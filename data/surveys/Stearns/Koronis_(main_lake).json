                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of Tullibee (Cisco) in Lake Koronis was conducted during mid-late November of 2015 using lake survey gillnets. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and spring electrofishing for bass). <br> \n <br> \nKoronis is a large (2,968 acres), and deep (132 feet maximum) lake located in Stearns County. Tullibee were believed to be initially introduced into Koronis during the 1880's. Green Lake is the only other Spicer Area lake with a self-sustaining Tullibee population. Tullibee spawn in 3-6 feet of water over bottom substrates consisting of large rock during late November to early December when the water temperature reaches 41 degrees Fahrenheit \"F\" or less. Spawning substrates in both Koronis and Green during recent years have been covered by periphyton/algae except in shallow (<1 foot) windswept shoal areas. Climate changes may be negatively affecting Tullibee natural reproduction/recruitment success in these lakes due to degrading spawning habitat and increasing numbers of warm water fish species (i.e. Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, etc.) which prey upon Tullibee eggs, fry or fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Tullibee are susceptible to summerkill in Koronis if oxygen levels drop (<2 ppm) in the cooler deeper areas (<74 F) of the lake for an extended time (1-3 weeks) during late July to early August. Young Tullibee can tolerate warmer temperatures than adult Tullibee. A minor summerkill was reported in 2006 for Koronis, but not Green Lake. Low dissolved oxygen (<2 ppm) levels were present in Koronis and Green at depths where preferred adult Tullibee temperatures (<74 F) occurred for a short time period in the 2010 late summer. Although no summerkill of Tullibee was reported for Green Lake, a minor summerkill of adult Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2010. A major summerkill of Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011, but only a minor kill occurred in Green Lake during the 2011 summer. Drought conditions and extremely high air temperatures were the norm for the Spicer Area during July and early August of 2012. There were no apparent summerkills in Green or Koronis during 2012, but adult numbers were so low that summerkill events may not have been recognizable, especially due to the large numbers of pelicans living on Lake Koronis islands. A narrow band (1-3 feet) of marginal temperatures (<74 F) and dissolved oxygen levels (1-3 ppm) was present in depths of 18-25 feet in Koronis during mid-July and early August of 2012. Tullibee summerkill conditions on Koronis were suitable when dissolved oxygen levels were less than 1 ppm at a depth of 20 feet with a water temperature of 76 F on July 24, 2012, but no summerkill events were observed in 2012. Summer temperature and oxygen conditions were more conducive for Tullibee survival during 2013-2015. Green has been the only lake in the Spicer Area open to the public for fall gillnetting of Tullibee during late November or early December each year since the late 1980's. Koronis was closed to public gillnetting during the late 1980's due to low Tullibee populations and high incidence of northern pike mortality during prior open seasons. Green Lake has been closed for Tullibee gillnetting since 2012 due to the low numbers sampled in recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish for trophy northern pike in Koronis and Green. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee numbers were low to moderate in a 2014 special assessment (mid-August) using vertical gillnets (20.7 fish/gang, 62 Tullibee total). There were five gillnets set per gang at three different deep water sites from the surface to bottom. Fish ranged in size from 3.1 to 17.5 inches from the seven different mesh sized panels of vertical gillnets. The majority of Tullibee captured were young of year (2014 year class), age 2+ (2012 and 2011) and age 6+ year classes. Unlike vertical gillnets, standard summer lake survey gillnets are comprised of five different mesh sizes per net, 250 feet long and set in water depths with adequate oxygen levels (usually 10-40 feet deep) encompassing 6 feet of depth up from the bottom. Fall gillnet assessments utilize standard summer gillnets, but are set along shallow (< 6 feet) boulder bars during mid/late November when water temperatures are below 41 F. <br> \n <br> \nThere were low to moderate numbers of Tullibee (19.7 fish/gillnet) captured in the 2015 fall special assessment. The 2015 fall Tullibee average size was moderate (1.39 pounds and 14.17 inches) for Koronis. Tullibee abundance was lower in 2014 (6.0 fish/gillnet) and 2012 (5.3 fish/gillnet) fall assessments. The fall Tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 29.6 fish/gillnet and 15.12 inches for Koronis. The fall Tullibee catch rate in nearby Green Lake was low in 2015 (10.3 fish/gillnet, 13.66 inches average length). The 2015 fall Tullibee condition factor (1.271) was above the 50th quartile (1.250) for Koronis. Tullibee growth rates were near or above the Koronis 50th quartiles for ages 2-7. The 2011 year class comprised 46% of the 2015 fall Tullibee catch in Koronis. The 2012 year class comprised 36% of the total 2015 fall catch. A recent increase in Tullibee abundance is encouraging for Koronis. However, the inconsistency of Tullibee natural reproduction and adequate adult Tullibee numbers on the spawning grounds as sampled by the DNR is not a good indication for the long term sustainability of the Tullibee population in Lake Koronis. Hopefully, consecutive cool summers will continue to occur periodically, which may result in a good hatch, recruitment and survival of Tullibee to maintain a long term population in Lake Koronis.  <br> \n <br> \nImproving and maintaining good water quality in Koronis is the key for Tullibee numbers to survive and flourish. Public fall Tullibee gillnetting seasons will not be reinstated in the near future on Koronis due to low Tullibee numbers and high incidental catches of other gamefish. Current fish management activities on Koronis include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Lake Koronis fishery will be sampled in the 2017 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Koronis during October 14, 2021. Previous fall electrofishing surveys were conducted at six stations for a total of 60+ minutes. The 2020 survey (7 stations, 114 minutes) was conducted as part of a larger statewide research study to evaluate fall electrofishing catch effectiveness for different total shocking times. Five stations were sampled for a total of 60 minutes in 2021. The water temperature was 62 F. Moderate waves were noted at one station, but wind/wave action was light at the other stations. Water clarity was good at five of six stations. Submergent vegetation density was light to moderate. We observed moderate numbers of sunfish species, Logperch, Black Crappie and Yellow Perch in the 2021 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nKoronis is a large (2,968 acres), deep (132 feet maximum), and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. Koronis is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Tullibee and Bluegill. Koronis receives moderate recreational use during the summer months. The largest inlet is the North Fork of the Crow River, which enters Koronis along the east shore and outlets near the southeast corner. The greatest volume of nutrient loading is delivered to Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. Water levels were below normal during 2021. An invasive algal species, starry stonewort, was found primarily in the east and outlet bays of Koronis in 2015 and near the south access of Rice Lake in 2016. Current efforts to chemically eradicate starry stonewort have been unsuccessful in Koronis. Aquatic vegetation densities are variable yearly in the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nRice Lake is upstream and connects to Lake Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. In the past, Walleye from both Rice and Koronis have spawned in the North Fork of the Crow River upstream of Rice Lake. A Walleye egg take station was operated just upstream of Rice Lake in the Crow River from the 1970's to 1992. However, this Walleye spawning run now appears to be considerably reduced. This is based on anecdotal observations of lower opening Walleye fishing activity near the Koronis inlet bay/narrows area especially since the 2000's and recent (2018-2019) ice out hoop netting in the river near the old egg take station. Walleye fishing activity often was higher during late ice off years at the Koronis inlet bay area due to fish returning from upriver spawning around opening weekend. Walleye also spawn adjacent to the east shores of the three islands in Koronis and the east point of Rice. Since 2001, both Rice and Koronis have been periodic \"Spicer Strain\" Walleye egg take sites for the statewide Walleye propagation program. Other recent Spicer Strain egg take lakes include Diamond and Elizabeth. Historic spawning sites for Walleye in both Koronis and Rice have been degraded in recent years with increased sedimentation, algal and periphyton growth.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Koronis has been frequent and often adequate to sustain Walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys and markings. However, natural reproduction contribution has been more variable in recent years due in part to degraded spawning habitat and unfavorable spring conditions. Walleye fry (0.5-2.0 million/year) were stocked during 1996 and 2001-2019 as a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the DNR statewide Walleye hatching program. Spicer strain Walleye fry have been primarily stocked since 2004. No Walleye eggs were taken and no fry were stocked in 2020. In 2021, 968,348 Spicer strain Walleye were stocked into Koronis. Walleye fingerlings were recently stocked in 2004 (2,409 pounds, 48,180 fish), combination of ages (2,355 pounds, 45,685 fish) were stocked in 2006, and a combination of yearlings/fingerlings (867 pounds, 4,887 fish) were stocked in the 2010. <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye numbers were abundant (65.00 YOY/hour, 7.23 inches) in 2021 fall electrofishing survey. No Yearling Walleye were observed in 2021. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (23.16 YOY/hour, 7.62 inches) were captured in 2020 fall electrofishing survey. We also observed moderate numbers of yearling (9.47 fish/hour) and age 2+ (23.16 fish/hour) Walleye in the 2020 survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2019 (1.85 YOY/hour). Abundant yearling Walleye were captured in 2019 (13.85 fish/hour, 9.76 inches). Moderate YOY and yearling Walleye numbers were captured in 2018 (20.57 YOY/hour, 7.20 inches; 8.57 yearlings/hour, 9.71 inches). Abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2017 (65.60 YOY/hour, 6.03 inches). OTC marked fish accounted for 33% of the YOY Walleye catch in the 2017 fall. Low numbers of yearling Walleye were captured in 2017 (4.80 fish/hour, 9.90 inches). Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2016 (14.18 YOY/hour, 6.51 inches). OTC marked fish accounted for 40% of the 2016 Fall YOY Walleye catch. Yearling and two year old Walleye numbers were abundant (17.45 fish/hour) in 2016. Low YOY Walleye numbers (3.60 YOY/hour, 5.97 inches) were captured in 2015. There were no OTC marked YOY walleye captured in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (22.80 fish/hour, 9.45 inches) in 2015. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye were captured in 2014 (208.09 YOY/hour, 6.39 inches average length) and 2013 (71.25 YOY/hour, 5.79 inches average length). OTC marked fish accounted for 82% of the 2014 Walleye fingerlings captured in the fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 45% of the 2013 fall electrofishing YOY catch were OTC marked (fry stocked). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (32.83 YOY/hour, 6.97 inches) were captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 92% of the 2012 year class fish captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey were OTC marked (fry stocked). Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (205.50 YOY/hour, 6.50 inches) were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 80% (164.40 YOY/hour) were OTC marked fish in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. The Koronis YOY Walleye historical average catch rate and average length are 42.19 YOY/hour and 6.67 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (17.00 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average catch rate (10.93 fish/gillnet) for Koronis in the most recent 2019 standard summer survey. The 2019 Walleye average size was moderate (1.28 pounds and 14.69 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average length is 14.01 inches from gillnets. The 2019 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches and larger) Walleye (7.60 fish/gillnet) was higher than the historical average (4.49 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. The 2016 and 2017 year classes (fry stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 36% and 19% respectively of the 2019 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Walleye fry were marked with Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" in 2009 and 2011-2017 to determine the contribution of natural reproduction versus stocking. OTC marked fish (fry stocked) comprised 38%, 25%, 33%, 50%, 100% and 100% respectively of the 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011 year classes in the 2019 summer survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Koronis include protecting the important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, participating in local watershed projects, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, stocking various species as needed, and stocking Walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Koronis fishery will be surveyed again for YOY Walleye in the 2022 fall by electrofishing and 2022 for all fish species by standard survey gears. <br> \n</p>",

THE MAJORITY OF NORTHERNS SAMPLED WERE FROM THE 1988 AND 1989 YEAR-CLASS (IN BOTH THE 1990 AND 1991 SURVEY'S) AND SHOWED AVERAGE GROWTH RATES.  THE 1990 YEAR-CLASS DID NOT SHOW ANY INDICATIONS OF BEING A STRONG ONE.  BASED ON THE LAST 5 CONSECUTIVE SURVEY'S (1987-1991), THE NOP CATCH INDICES WERE RELATIVELY HIGHER IN 1990 AND 1991 THAN IN 1987-1989.  THE 1991 BLG CATCH INDEX (3.13 PER TN) WAS LOWER THAN THE MAJORITY OF CLASS 22 LAKES.  THE 1991 INDEX (3.13 PER TN) IS ALSO THE CURRENT MEDIAN FOR THE 9 SURVEY'S DONE ON LAKE KORONIS.  THE GILLNET SAMPLING IN LAKE KORONIS APPEARS TO SAMPLE THE RELATIVE DENSITY OF  THE 1990 GILLNET INDICES (4.33, 1.07 LBS.) WAS THE HIGHEST RECORDED FOR BLG IN KORONIS WHICH COINCIDED WITH GOOD-EXCELLENT BLG FISHING THAT YEAR.  THE 1991 INDICES (2.75 PER GN, 0.70 LBS.) COINCIDED WITH A RELATIVE DECLINE IN FISHING SUCCESS FOR BLG.  THE 1988 YEAR-CLASS MOST LIKELY PROVIDED THE BULK OF THE HARVEST IN 1990 (PARTICULARLY IN THE LATE SUMMER/FALL).  THE 1990 AND 1991 AGE-CLASS DISTRIBUTIONS SUGGESTED A HEAVY MORTALITY FOR THE 1988 AGE-CLASS (66 INDIVUALS AGE 2+ INDIVIDUALS SAMPLED IN 1990, 11 AGE 3+ INDIVIDUAL SAMPLED IN 1991).  THE 1990 YEAR-CLASS DID NOT GIVE ANY INDICATION OF BEING A STRONG ONE. THE ABOVE AVERAGE GROWTH RATES SEEN IN KORONIS ALLOWS A PROPORTION OF THE AGE 2+ BLGS TO REACH HARVESTABLE SIZE (>6.0 3RD GROWING SEASON.  THE 1991 SMB CATCH INDEX (1.63 PER GN) WAS HIGHER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 22 LAKES AND WAS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED ON LAKE KORONIS (SMB FISHING HAS ALSO REPORTEDLY BEEN EXCELLENT RECENTLY).  GROWTH RATES ARE GOOD AS IT TAKES JUST 3 GROWING SEASONS TO REACH AN AVERAGE OF 12.5 INCHES.  SMB SPRING ELECTROFISHING SAMPLING HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL THUS FAR (1990 AND 1991).  THE LMB 1991 SPRING ELECTROFISHING SAMPLE YIELDED A SIMILAR SIZE DISTRIBUTION AS THE 1990 SAMPLE (1991, PSD=17, RSD-P=3:1990, PSD=16,RSD-P=6).  DENSITY INDICES FOR BOTH YEARS WERE SIMILAR TO THE MAJORITY OF OTHER SPICER AREA LAKES (1991, 26.40 PER HOUR: 1990, 36.68 PER HOUR).  THERE WERE NO AGE 1+ (1990 YEAR-CLASS) LMB SAMPLED IN THE 1991 SURVEY, WHEREAS, THERE WERE 24 AGE 1+ (1989 YEAR-CLASS) LMB SAMPLED IN THE 1990 SURVEY.  THE 1991 BLC TRAPNET CATCH INDEX (0.33 PER SET) WAS LOWER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 22 LAKES (THE 1991 GILLNET CATCH INDEX WAS 0.63 PER SET AND WAS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED FOR LAKE KORONIS).  THE MAJORITY OF SAMPLED BLC WERE FROM THE 1989 YEAR- CLASS AND SHOULD BE FOR THE 1992 FISHING SEASON WITH THEIR ABOVE AVERAGE GROWTH RATES.  THE 1991 YEP CATCH INDEX (48.00 PER GN) WAS HIGHER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 22 LAKES, HOWEVER, MUCH HIGHER CATCH INDICES ARE NOT UNCOMMON FOR THIS LAKE (1982- 293.70, 1977- 196.80, 1969 - 79.70).  THE 1991 INDEX, HOWEVER, WAS THE HIGHEST IN THE LAST 5 SURVEY'S (1987-1991) WHICH SHOW A DEFINITE INCREASE IN THE 1990, 1991 SAMPLES RELATIVE TO THE 1987-1989 SAMPLES.  GROWTH RATES WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER IN THE 1991 SURVEY RELATIVE TO THE 1990 SURVEY.  THE 1989 YEAR-CLASS APPEARS DOMINANT FOR YEP AND COULD PROVIDE 1992 IN HIGH NUMBERS.  THE 1991 WAE CATCH INDEX (4.25 PER GN) WAS THE LOWEST EVER RECORDED FOR LAKE KORONIS, BUT WAS SIMILAR TO THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 22 LAKES (LBS. PER GN, 3.93, WAS LOWER THAN THE MAJORITY OF CLASS 22 LAKES). CONVERSELY, THE WAE TRAPNET CATCH INDEX (3.93) WAS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED FOR LAKE KORONIS.  THE AVERAGE SIZE OF SAMPLED WAE WAS SMALL (GN-0.92 LBS., TN - 0.91 LBS.), HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR LAKE KORONIS (SEE HISTORICAL CATCH SUMMARY).  GROWTH RATES WERE CONSIDERED BELOW AVERAGE WHICH IS TYPICAL FOR LAKE KORONIS, HOWEVER, THE GROWTH RATES APPEARED SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE 1990 GROWTH RATES (AGES 4 AND 5 IN 1991, 14.7 INCHES AND 16.6 INCHES:  AGES 4 AND 5 IN 1990 13.2 AND 15.6 INCHES).  OVERALL, THE WAE CATCH INDICES APPEAR DOWN WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN GROWTH RATES.  THE INCREASE IN THE YEP AND SMB CATCH INDICES (GROWTH RATES FOR YEP AND SMB ALSO DECLINED SLIGHTLY) MAY HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE APPARENT MODERATE DECREASE OF WAE.  THE AGE-CLASS DISTRIBUTION FROM THE 1990 AND 1991 SURVEY SHOW A RELATIVELY STRONG 1989 YEAR-CLASS (NATURALLY REPRODUCED AND A WEAK 1990 YEAR-CLASS (FINGERLINGS STOCKED).  CATCH INDICES OF CERTAIN NON-GAMEFISH SPECIES (PARTICULARLY BLB, CAP, AND WTS) WERE ALL HIGHER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 22 LAKES. MOST APPARENT IS THE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN BLB GILLNET CATCH INDICES THE PAST 5 SURVEY'S COMPARED TO THE 1982 AND EARLIER SURVEY'S.  THE 1991 BLB GILLNET CATCH INDEX WAS 91.25 PER SET WHICH WAS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED FOR LAKE KORONIS (1990 INDEX:  76.33 PER SET, SEE HISTORICAL CATCH SUMMARY).  WTS AND CAP DO NOT SHOW THE SAME DRAMATIC INCREASE IN CATCH INDICES, HOWEVER, THE 1991 TRAPNET CATCH INDEX FOR CAP WAS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED FOR LAKE KORONIS (3.87 PER SET, BUT ONLY 5.30 LBS.  PER SET). THERE WAS AN UNUSUALLY HIGH NUMBER OF 7-11 INCH CAP IN THE 1991 SAMPLE (CAP LESS THAN 12 INCHES HAVE BEEN VERY RARE IN PAST LAKE SURVEY'S).  THE SUMMER TESTNETTING FOR CISCO HAS HAD RELATIVELY POOR SUCCESS DURING THE 1987-1991 SURVEY'S RELATIVE TO THE EARLIER SURVEY'S; HOWEVER, FALL TESTNETTING IN 1991 SHOWED THERE IS A SPAWNING CISCO POPULATION DOMINATED BY VERY LARGE INDIVIDUALS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Lake Koronis was conducted in late July of 2010. Koronis is a large, deep, and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. Koronis is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, tullibee and bluegill. The lake is highly developed with approximately 498 homes and cabins, and seven resorts/bible camp/campgrounds. In addition, the city of Paynesville is within two miles of the lake. The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural row crops, hardwood areas, and residential development. Nutrient runoff enters Koronis via 45 inlets/tiles (mostly small inlets) from agricultural, city storm sewer, and lake residential sources. The largest inlet and greatest nutrient contributor is the North Fork of the Crow River, which enters Koronis along the east shore and outlets near the southeast corner. The greatest volume of nutrient loading is delivered to Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. Nutrient levels (total phosphorus=0.030 ppm, chlorophyll a=24.0 ppb) were moderate in June of 2007 for Koronis. Aquatic vegetation densities are variable yearly in the lake. Water clarity was fair (4.5 feet) during the 2010 summer in Koronis. Water temperatures were stratified by July of 2010. Low (<1.0 ppm) or no oxygen was present in depths below 30 feet during the late 2010 summer. A minor summerkill of large sized tullibee (cisco) was noted during late July - early August of 2010. Partial summerkills of tullibee and white suckers are common in Koronis during hot summers. Koronis is a periodic walleye egg take site for the statewide walleye propagation program. Koronis is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, in addition to secondary species such as bluegill, yellow perch, tullibee, bass, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2010 (7.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes. The Koronis black crappie historical average catch rate is 1.11 fish/gillnet. The 2010 black crappie average size was moderate (0.35 pounds and 7.51 inches) from gillnets. The black crappie historical average length is 8.16 inches from gillnets. The 2010 catch rate of preferred size (10.00 inches) and larger black crappie was moderate (2.67 fish/gillnet). Black crappie growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2009 and 2005 year classes comprised 57% and 28% respectively of the 2010 black crappie gillnet and trapnet catch in Koronis. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low to moderate in 2010 (5.13 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes. The Koronis bluegill historical average catch rate is 8.84 fish/trapnet. The 2010 bluegill average size was moderate (0.22 pounds and 6.03 inches) from the trapnets. The bluegill historical average length is 5.03 inches from trapnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low (3.27 fish/trapnet).  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate to high in 2010 (3.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis, but below the normal range for similar lakes. The Koronis northern pike historical average catch rate is 2.73 fish/gillnet. The 2010 northern pike average size was moderate (4.53 pounds and 26.41 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average length is 23.62 inches from gillnets. The 2010 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger northern pike was low to moderate (1.00 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates in Koronis were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2004 and 2006-2008 year classes each comprised about 20% of the 2010 northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch. The largest northern pike captured was 33.27 inches in the 2010 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were abundant in 2010 (2.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes. The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.79 fish/gillnet from Koronis. The 2010 smallmouth bass average size was large (1.82 pounds and 14.11 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average length is 12.88 inches from gillnets. The 2010 catch rate of preferred size (14.00 inches) and larger smallmouth bass was high (1.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (0.48 fish/gillnet). The largest smallmouth bass captured was 19.69 inches in 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are not sampled efficiently with summer gillnets and trapnets (due to net avoidance) compared to the preferred gear of spring electrofishing. We did not conduct a 2010 spring electrofishing in Koronis due to time constraints with other fisheries activities. Largemouth bass numbers were not abundant in the 2010 gillnets (0.17 fish/gillnet). However, local anglers have reported largemouth bass numbers abundant in their catch in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee \"cisco\" numbers were moderately abundant in 2010 (2.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes. The tullibee historical summer average catch rate is 1.27 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2010 tullibee summer average size was moderate (1.00 pounds and 12.19 inches) from gillnets. The tullibee summer historical average length is 12.30 inches from gillnets. Tullibee abundance was moderate (23.8 fish/gillnet, 15.28 inches average length) in the 2010 fall gillnet special assessment. It appears that the 2010 tullibee summerkill had a minimal effect on population numbers in Koronis.  <br> \n <br> \nThere were moderate numbers of tullibee (23.8 fish/gillnet) captured in the 2010 fall special assessment. The 2010 tullibee average size was large (1.49 pounds and 15.29 inches), but similar to the historical average (15.15 inches). The fall tullibee historical average catch rate is 33.2 fish/gillnet . The tullibee condition factor in the 2010 fall (1.268) was moderate for Koronis. Tullibee growth rates were below the Koronis normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2003, 2002 and 2001 year classes comprised 18%, 30% and 32% respectively of the 2010 fall tullibee catch. It appears that smaller sized tullibee (2007 year class) were sampled more frequently in the 2010 summer gillnet sets than in the fall spawning station gillnet sets of Koronis. The 2007 year class tullibee may not have been sexually mature for spawning in 2010, thus these fish were not adequately sampled in the fall. Hopefully, cool summers will occur during the next several years, which may result in a good hatch and survival of tullibee in Koronis if adequate brood stock numbers are still present. Tullibee are an important forage species for both large northern pike and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were moderately abundant in 2010 (56.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 61.80 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2010 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.16 pounds and 7.16 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average length is 7.03 inches from gillnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was low (4.50 fish/gillnet).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2010 (16.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 9.39 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2010 walleye average size was moderate (1.38 pounds and 14.97 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average length is 13.96 inches from gillnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye (7.00 fish/gillnet) was higher than the historical average (3.53 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. Walleye growth rates were generally near or below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4, but within or above the normal ranges for ages 5-8. The 2007 and 2008 year classes (fry stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 36% and 24% of the 2010 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. The 2006 year class (fingerling & fry stocked, natural reproduction) comprised 18% of the 2010 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Koronis was generally both frequent and adequate to sustain walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys from 1993-2002. In recent years, walleye natural reproduction has been poor except for 2007-08. Walleye young of year \"YOY\" numbers were low (6.43 YOY/hour, 7.27 inches average length) in 2010 fall electrofishing survey. The fall electrofishing YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 27.63 YOY/hour for Koronis. Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2004 (2,409 pounds, 48,180 fish), a combination of ages (2,355 pounds, 45,685 fish) were stocked in 2006, and a combination of yearlings and fingerlings (867 pounds, 4,887 fish) were stocked in the 2010 due to low YOY numbers observed in fall electrofishing surveys. Walleye fry were stocked during 1996, and 2001-2010 as a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for the DNR statewide walleye-hatching program.  <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were abundant in 2010 (5.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes. The rock bass historical average catch rate is 1.67 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2010 rock bass average size was moderate (0.21 pounds and 6.45 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average length is 7.07 inches from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of interest captured in 2010 included low numbers of black bullhead (1.83 fish/gillnet, 0.20 fish/trapnet) and carp (0.00 fish/gillnet, 0.27 fish/trapnet) from Koronis. White sucker (5.83 fish/gillnet) and shorthead redhorse (4.33 fish/gillnet) numbers in Koronis were above the normal ranges of similar lakes. The Koronis historical average catch rates for black bullhead are 18.76 fish/gillnet and 2.76 fish/trapnet. The Koronis historical average catch rates for carp are 0.50 fish/gillnet and 1.55 fish/trapnet. The Koronis historical average catch rates for white sucker and shorthead redhorse are 5.21 and 1.12 fish/gillnet respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Koronis include protecting the important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, participating in local watershed projects, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, stocking various species as needed, and stocking walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Koronis fishery will be surveyed again for YOY walleye in the 2011 fall. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of Tullibee \"Cisco\" in Lake Koronis was conducted during mid-late November of 2017 using lake survey gillnets. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nKoronis is a large (2,968 acres), and deep (132 feet maximum) lake located in Stearns County. Tullibee were believed to be initially introduced into Koronis during the 1880's. Green Lake is the only other Spicer Area lake with a self-sustaining Tullibee population. Tullibee spawn in 3-6 feet of water over bottom substrates consisting of large rock during late November to early December when the water temperature reaches 41 degrees Fahrenheit \"F\" or less. Spawning substrates in both Koronis and Green during recent years have been covered by periphyton/algae except in shallow (<1 foot) windswept shoal areas. Climate changes may be negatively affecting Tullibee natural reproduction/recruitment success in these lakes due to degrading spawning habitat and increasing numbers of warm water fish species (i.e. Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, etc.) which prey upon Tullibee eggs, fry or fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Tullibee are susceptible to summerkill in Koronis if oxygen levels drop (<2 ppm) in the cooler deeper areas (<74 F) of the lake for an extended time (1-3 weeks) during late July to early August. Young Tullibee can tolerate warmer temperatures than adult Tullibee. A minor summerkill was reported in 2006 for Koronis, but not Green Lake. Low dissolved oxygen (<2 ppm) levels were present in Koronis and Green at depths where preferred adult Tullibee temperatures (<74 F) occurred for a short time period in the 2010 late summer. Although no summerkill of Tullibee was reported for Green Lake, a minor summerkill of adult Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2010. A major summerkill of Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011, but only a minor kill occurred in Green Lake during the 2011 summer. Drought conditions and extremely high air temperatures were the norm for the Spicer Area during July and early August of 2012. There were no apparent summerkills in Green or Koronis during 2012, but adult numbers were so low that summerkill events may not have been recognizable, especially due to the large numbers of pelicans living on Lake Koronis islands. Summer temperature and oxygen conditions were more conducive for Tullibee survival during 2013-2017. An adequate band of water temperatures (<74 F) and dissolved oxygen levels (2-8 ppm) was present at depths of 15-24 feet in Koronis during mid-July of 2017. Green has been the only lake in the Spicer Area open to the public for fall gillnetting of Tullibee during late November or early December each year since the late 1980's. Koronis was closed to public gillnetting during the late 1980's due to low Tullibee populations and high incidence of northern pike mortality during prior open seasons. Green Lake has been closed for Tullibee gillnetting since 2012 due to the low numbers sampled in recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish for trophy northern pike in Koronis and Green. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee numbers were not present in the 2017 summer standard survey catch. The Tullibee historical summer average catch rate is 1.1 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The Tullibee summer historical average length is 11.91 inches from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee abundance was low (10.3 fish/gillnet) in the 2017 fall gillnet targeted survey. The 2017 fall Tullibee average size was moderate (1.53 pounds and 14.39 inches). Tullibee abundance was moderate in the 2010 (23.8 fish/gillnet, 15.28 inches) and 2015 (19.7 fish/gillnet, 14.17 inches) fall gillnet targeted surveys, but low in 2012 (5.33 fish/gillnet) and 2014 (6.00 fish/gillnet). The Tullibee fall historical average catch rate and average length are 30.1 fish/gillnet and 15.20 inches for Koronis. The Tullibee fall catch rate in nearby Green Lake was low in 2017 (0.5 fish/gillnet, 11.25 inches) and 2015 (10.3 fish/gillnet, 13.66 inches average length). Tullibee growth rates were generally within the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2012 and 2014 year classes comprised 34% and 31% respectively of the 2017 Tullibee fall catch in Koronis. The 2013 and 2011 year classes each comprised about 16% of the 2017 Tullibee fall catch. Hopefully, consecutive cool summers will continue to occur periodically, which may result in a good hatch, recruitment and survival of Tullibee to maintain a long term population in Lake Koronis.  <br> \n <br> \nImproving and maintaining good water quality in Koronis is the key for Tullibee numbers to survive and flourish. Public fall Tullibee gillnetting seasons will not be reinstated in the near future on Koronis due to low Tullibee numbers and high incidental catches of other gamefish. Current fish management activities on Koronis include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Lake Koronis fishery will be sampled in the 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Koronis during October 15, 2020. Previous fall electrofishing surveys were conducted at six stations for a total of 60+ minutes. The 2020 survey was conducted as part of a larger statewide research study to evaluate fall electrofishing catch effectiveness for different total shocking times. Seven stations were sampled for a total of 114 minutes in 2020. The water temperature was 54 F. Submergent vegetation density was moderate. We observed moderate numbers of Bluegill, Black Crappie, Rock Bass, Brook Silverside, Shiners and Yellow Perch in the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nKoronis is a large (2,968 acres), deep (132 feet maximum), and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. Koronis is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Tullibee and Bluegill. Koronis receives moderate recreational use during the summer months. The largest inlet is the North Fork of the Crow River, which enters Koronis along the east shore and outlets near the southeast corner. The greatest volume of nutrient loading is delivered to Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. Water levels were below normal during 2020. An invasive algal species, starry stonewort, was found primarily in the east and outlet bays of Koronis in 2015 and near the south access of Rice Lake in 2016. Current efforts to chemically eradicate starry stonewort have been unsuccessful in Koronis. Aquatic vegetation densities are variable yearly in the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nRice Lake is upstream and connects to Lake Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. In the past, Walleye from both Rice and Koronis have spawned in the North Fork of the Crow River upstream of Rice Lake. A Walleye egg take station was operated just upstream of Rice Lake in the Crow River from the 1970's to 1992. However, this Walleye spawning run now appears to be considerably reduced. This is based on anecdotal observations of lower opening Walleye fishing activity near the Koronis inlet bay/narrows area especially since the 2000's and recent (2018-2019) ice out hoop netting in the river near the old egg take station. Walleye fishing activity often was higher during late ice off years at the Koronis inlet bay area due to gfish returning from upriver spawning around opening weekend. Walleye also spawn adjacent to the east shores of the three islands in Koronis and the east point of Rice. Since 2001, both Rice and Koronis have been periodic \"Spicer Strain\" Walleye egg take sites for the statewide Walleye propagation program. Other recent Spicer Strain egg take lakes include Diamond and Elizabeth. Historic spawning sites for Walleye in both Koronis and Rice have been degraded in recent years with increased sedimentation, algal and periphyton growth.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Koronis has been frequent and often adequate to sustain Walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys and markings. However, natural reproduction contribution has been more variable in recent years due in part to degraded spawning habitat and unfavorable spring conditions. Walleye fry (0.5-2.0 million/year) were stocked during 1996 and 2001-2019 as a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the DNR statewide Walleye hatching program. No Walleye eggs were taken and no fry were stocked in 2020. Walleye fingerlings were recently stocked in 2004 (2,409 pounds, 48,180 fish), combination of ages (2,355 pounds, 45,685 fish) were stocked in 2006, and a combination of yearlings/fingerlings (867 pounds, 4,887 fish) were stocked in the 2010. <br> \n <br> \nModerate YOY Walleye numbers (23.16 YOY/hour, 7.62 inches) due to natural reproduction were captured in 2020 fall electrofishing survey. We also observed moderate numbers of yearling (9.47 fish/hour) and age 2+ (23.16 fish/hour) Walleye in the 2020 survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2019 (1.85 YOY/hour). Abundant yearling Walleye were captured in 2019 (13.85 fish/hour, 9.76 inches). Moderate YOY and yearling Walleye numbers were captured in 2018 (20.57 YOY/hour, 7.20 inches; 8.57 yearlings/hour, 9.71 inches). Abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2017 (65.60 YOY/hour, 6.03 inches). OTC marked fish accounted for 33% of the YOY Walleye catch in the 2017 fall. Low numbers of yearling Walleye were captured in 2017 (4.80 fish/hour, 9.90 inches). Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2016 (14.18 YOY/hour, 6.51 inches). OTC marked fish accounted for 40% of the 2016 Fall YOY Walleye catch. Yearling and two year old Walleye numbers were abundant (17.45 fish/hour) in 2016. Low YOY Walleye numbers (3.60 YOY/hour, 5.97 inches) were captured in 2015. There were no OTC marked YOY walleye captured in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (22.80 fish/hour, 9.45 inches) in 2015. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye were captured in 2014 (208.09 YOY/hour, 6.39 inches average length) and 2013 (71.25 YOY/hour, 5.79 inches average length). OTC marked fish accounted for 82% of the 2014 Walleye fingerlings captured in the fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 45% of the 2013 fall electrofishing YOY catch were OTC marked (fry stocked). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (32.83 YOY/hour, 6.97 inches) were captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 92% of the 2012 year class fish captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey were OTC marked (fry stocked). Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (205.50 YOY/hour, 6.50 inches) were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 80% (164.40 YOY/hour) were OTC marked fish in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2019 gillnets (17.00 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average catch rate (10.93 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. The 2019 Walleye average weight and length were 1.28 pounds and 14.69 inches respectively from gillnets. The Walleye historical average length is 14.01 inches from gillnets. The 2019 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches and larger) Walleye (7.60 fish/gillnet) was higher than the historical average (4.49 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. The 2016 and 2017 year classes (fry stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 36% and 19% respectively of the 2019 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Walleye fry were marked with Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" in 2009 and 2011-2017 to determine the contribution of natural reproduction versus stocking. OTC marked fish (fry stocked) comprised 38%, 25%, 33%, 50%, 100% and 100% respectively of the 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011 year classes in the 2019 summer survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Koronis include protecting the important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, participating in local watershed projects, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, stocking various species as needed, and stocking Walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Koronis fishery will be surveyed again for YOY Walleye in the 2021 fall and 2022 for a standard survey. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Koronis is a large (3,014 acres) nutrient rich lake with 13.6 miles of shoreline. It hasa maximum depth of 132 feet. There are a chain of three large islands located along thenorthwest portion of the lake. The shoalwater substrates are mostly gravel, sand, rubble, andboulder. There are several distinct bays (Outlet, Assembly Grounds, Northwest, East, andWest) within the lake. Submergent vegetation densities often vary annually, but are generallygreatest in the east, west, and northwest bay areas. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush)is located near Hendrickson Creek inlet and on the west side of Second Island. The North Forkof the Crow River flows into the east side of Koronis with the outlet located on thesoutheast side. The North Fork of the Crow River watershed comprises about 198,400 acres.There are also about ten small spring/marsh originated inlets that flow into Koronis.Nutrient (phosphorous, nitrogen) loading from the Crow River watershed is a continualproblem. Total phosphorous was 0.131 ppm at the North Fork of Crow River inlet, 0.205 ppm at75 feet (hypolimnion) of the water quality station, and 0.038 ppm at the surface of the waterquality station on 6-18-91. Algae blooms are common during the summer. The secchi discreading was 4.2 feet on 7-19-94. Local residents reported that the water clarity in 1994 wasbetter than previous years in addition to less frequent summer algae blooms. Koronis ishighly developed with about 491 homes/cabins, 5 resorts, several parks, and the AssemblyGrounds Bible Camp. The lake has been primarily managed for northern pike and walleye.Intensive walleye fingerling stocking occurred about every other year (3,000 - 6,000 lbs peryear) during the 1980's. Recently, Koronis has been stocked every other year as needed (1,200lbs of fingerlings per stocking). There are two northern pike spawning areas (Spaeth andHendrickson NPSA) that are operated on Koronis. Previously, Koronis was opened for fall cisco\"tullibee\" gillnetting, but has been closed since the early 1980's due to low numbersresulting from summerkills (1983, 1987, 1988). Currently, the cisco population appears tohave rebounded, but there are no plans to re-open the fall gillnetting season. Koronis is apopular fishing lake for walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, and smallmouth bass.     Walleye abundance in 1994 (11.6 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (4.0 - 9.6fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (7.9 fish/gillnet). The 1994average size (1.0 lbs from gillnets) was the same as the historical average. The largest fishcaptured was 28.3 inches. Walleye 1994 catch rates of quality size (15-20 inches) andpreferred size (20-25 inches) fish were the highest recorded values (5.6 and 1.1 fish/netrespectively) with historical averages of 2.0 and 0.5 fish/net respectively. Growth ratesappear average. There appears to be several good year classes present, especially the 1992year class. In 1993, natural reproduction was documented by fall electrofishing (37.8 youngof year/hour, average length=6.0 inches). The walleye yearling electrofishing catch rate wasalso 37.8 fish/hour (average length=10.0 inches), but these fish could be from either or botha 1992 stocking and natural reproduction. In the fall of 1993, 17,941 fingerlings (14.5fish/lb.) were fin clipped (left pelvic fin) and stocked into Koronis. We caught 2 finclipped fingerlings out of 72 fish from the 1993 year class during a 1994 springelectrofishing survey (2.8% of total). Fin clipped walleyes accounted for 19.4% of the 1993year class fish caught in the 1994 summer survey. In the 1994 fall electrofishing survey, finclipped yearlings accounted for 7.8% of the total 1993 year class captured. The 1994 fallelectrofishing catch rates were 10.5 young of year/hour (average size=6.5 inches) and 38.3yearlings/hour (average size=9.8 inches).     Northern pike abundance in 1994 (2.1 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (3.0 - 7.9fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but the same as the historical average. The 1994 averagesize (3.1 lbs from gillnets) was similar to the historical average (3.0 lbs). The largestfish captured was 31.7 inches. Growth rates appear average for ages I-II, but above averagefor ages III-IV. The 1991 year class appears moderate. There were no fish sampled older thanfive years. Historically, Koronis has been a popular angling and darkhouse spearing lake fornorthern pike, especially for trophy size fish (>15 lbs).     Yellow perch abundance in 1994 (74.3 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (7.1 -33.9 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but comparable to the historical average (71.9fish/gillnet). The 1994 average size (6.4 inches) was slightly below the historical average(7.1 inches). The largest fish caught was 10.6 inches. Growth rates appear moderate to aboveaverage. There appears to be a strong 1992 year class present.     Smallmouth bass abundance (0.8 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (0.2 - 0.9fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and comparable to the historical average (0.5 fish/gillnet).The 1994 average size (12.8 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was above thehistorical average (10.2 inches). The largest fish caught was 15.4 inches. Growth ratesappear average. Local reports indicate excellent smallmouth angling success the past severalyears, especially for larger fish (> 3 lbs.).     Channel catfish abundance in 1994 (0.3 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average(0.1 fish/gillnet). The 1994 average size (8.2 lbs) was above the historical average (7.0lbs). There have been no stockings of channel catfish into Koronis, however these fishprobably entered Koronis from the Crow River or Rice Lake.     Black crappie abundance in 1994 (0.4 fish/trapnet) was slightly below the normal range(0.3 - 1.7 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (0.5fish/trapnet). The 1994 average size (0.5 lbs from trapnets) appears similar to thehistorical average (0.4 lbs). Growth rates appear average. All fish captured were from the1991 year class.     Bluegill abundance in 1994 (0.1 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (3.7 - 42.9fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and was the lowest recorded value (historical average= 7.2fish/trapnet). The 1994 average size (5.8 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) wassimilar to the historical average (5.7 inches). The highest recorded abundance value inrecent years occurred in September of 1989 (6.6 fish/trapnet, average size=0.17 lbs fromtrapnets). Local reports indicated good angling success for larger bluegill in the AssemblyGrounds Bay area (north side), west bay, and Highway 55 access bay during the latesummer/early fall of 1989. About 5,391 stunted bluegill (899 lbs at 6 fish/lb) were stockednear the Highway 55 access (Crow River inlet), north shore access, Tri-County Regional Park,and the west access in June of 1989. There was also some reports (reliable source) of illegalstocking of bluegill taking place during the summer of 1989 (about the same total poundsstocked, but smaller size). It is difficult to assess what contribution if any these stocked(legal or illegal) fish made to the 1989 fall angling success due to the lack of anypreliminary investigation (June trapnetting) prior to stocking, lack of any discernable marksmade (fin clipping) between stocked and endemic bluegill, or follow up evaluation (mini-creel) to determine actual sizes harvested. Factors that would lend credence to little or nocontribution to bluegill angling success include the small number stocked, the high growthobtained in such a short time period (2-3 months), and the lake size (3,014 acres) in whichfish could disperse. However, evidence in favor of significant contributions of stockedbluegill include low abundance of bluegill present the previous year (0.6 fish/trapnet),abundant numbers caught in the 1989 September survey (6.6 fish/trapnet), and the productivityof the lake to potentially allow fast growth rates. Long term limiting factors for bluegillnumbers include the lack of quality habitat (hardstem bulrush stands, largeleaf pondweeds,etc.) and deteriorating water quality (clarity) due to eutrophication.     Carp abundance in 1994 (3.0 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (0.1 - 0.5 ) forsimilar lakes and above the historical average (0.7 fish/gillnet). The 1994 average size (5.0lbs from gillnets) was similar to the historical average (5.4 lbs).     Black bullhead abundance in 1994 (1.2 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (0.5 -4.1 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (25.8 fish/gillnet).The 1994 black bullhead average size (9.3 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) wassimilar to the historical average (9.2 inches). Yellow bullhead abundance in 1994 (0.8fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (0.9 - 4.8 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and belowthe historical average (4.8 fish/trapnet). The 1994 yellow bullhead average size (10.4 inchesfrom gillnets and trapnets combined) was similar to the historical average (10.5 inches).     Management priorities for Koronis include maintaining current walleye numbers throughfingerling stocking as needed (after two successive years of poor natural reproduction),maintaining northern pike numbers through the operation of the two northern pike spawningareas, increasing habitat for bluegill and black crappie (bulrush transplanting), andencouraging local landowners (farmers, residential people) in the watershed to practice bestland management practices that reduce nutrient inputs into the Crow River and Koronis. Bestland management practices include private wetland restoration, upgrading failed septicsystems, planting buffer strips adjacent to shorelines or ditches, using conservation tillagetechniques (no till, ridge till, mulch till, etc.), proper feedlot management, properfertilizer application, and using no/low phosphorous fertilizers when possible. In thefuture, experimental regulations may be necessary to maintain trophy northern pike fishingopportunities in Koronis. In recent years local anglers have more readily adopted a catch andrelease ethic, but it needs to be more prevalent due to ever increasing fishing pressuredemands on area lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Koronis is a large (2,968 acres), and deep (132 feet maximum) lake located in Stearns County. A fall gillnetting assessment of tullibee (cisco) was conducted in Lake Koronis during November 19-20, 2014. Tullibee were believed to be initially introduced into Koronis during the 1880's. Green Lake is the only other Spicer Area lake with a self sustaining tullibee population. Tullibee spawn in 3-6 feet of water over bottom substrates consisting of large rock during late November to early December when the water temperature reaches 41 F or less. Spawning substrates in both Koronis and Green during recent years have been covered by periphyton/algae except in shallow (<1 foot) windswept shoal areas. Climate changes may be negatively affecting tullibee natural reproduction/recruitment success in these lakes due to degrading spawning habitat and increasing numbers of warm water fish species (i.e. rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, etc.) which prey upon tullibee eggs, fry or fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nAdult tullibee are susceptible to summerkill in Koronis if oxygen levels drop (<2 ppm) in the cooler deeper areas (<74 F) of the lake for an extended time (multiple days or weeks) during late July to early August. Young tullibee can tolerate warmer temperatures than adult tullibee. A minor summerkill was reported in 2006 for Koronis, but not Green Lake. Low dissolved oxygen (<2 ppm) levels were present in Koronis and Green at depths where preferred adult tullibee temperatures (<74 F) occurred for a short time period in the 2010 late summer. Although no summerkill of tullibee was reported for Green Lake, a minor summerkill of adult tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2010. A major summerkill of tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011, but only a minor kill occurred in Green Lake during the 2011 summer. Drought conditions and extremely high air temperatures were the norm for the Spicer Area during July and early August of 2012. There were no apparent summerkills in Green or Koronis during 2012, but adult numbers were so low that summerkill events may not have been recognizable, especially due to the large numbers of pelicans living on Lake Koronis islands. Summer conditions in 2013 and 2014 were moderate (2013) to mild (2014) especially in regards to daily air temperatures with few days >90 F. In 2013, the warmest period occurred near the Labor Day Weekend with many days >90 F.  <br> \n <br> \nA narrow band (1-3 feet) of marginal temperatures (<74.3 F) and dissolved oxygen levels (1-3 ppm) was present in depths of 18-25 feet in Koronis during mid-July and early August of 2012. Tullibee summerkill conditions on Koronis were suitable when dissolved oxygen levels were less than 1 ppm at a depth of 20 feet with a water temperature of 75.6 F on July 24, 2012, but no summerkill events were observed during this time period in 2012. A broad band (3-36 feet) of ideal temperatures (<74 F) and dissolved oxygen levels (>3 ppm) for tullibee were present in Green during late July and early August of 2013. Cool water temperatures (<74 F) and adequate oxygen levels (>3 ppm) were the norm in both Green and Koronis during the 2014 summer. <br> \n <br> \nGreen was the only lake in the Spicer Area open to the public for fall gillnetting of tullibee during late November or early December each year since the late 1980's until recently. Koronis was closed to public gillnetting during the late 1980's due to low tullibee populations and high incidence of northern pike mortality during prior open seasons. Green Lake was not opened for tullibee gillnetting from 2012-2014 due to the low numbers sampled in recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish for trophy northern pike in Koronis and Green. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee \"cisco\" numbers were present in low numbers during the 2014 summer standard gillnet sampling (0.20 fish/gillnet). There were no tullibee captured in the 2012 summer standard gillnet sets. The 2010 summer standard gillnet tullibee catch (2.50 fish/gillnet) was above the 50th quartile (1.56 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 22 lakes. The tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 1.20 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The tullibee historical average length is 12.3 inches from summer gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nVertical gillnets were set at three deep water (50-130 feet deep) sites which included the north bay (Assembly Grounds), south side (deepest part) and south side of Third Island during mid-August. Vertical gill nets consisted of seven 197 feet deep panels of monofilament webbing (bar-measure mesh size x panel width): 3/8\" x 3', 1/2\" x 3', 3/4\"mm x 4.9', 1\" x 4.9', 1 1/4\" x 10', 1 1/2\" x 10', 1 3/4\" x 10'). The 3/8\" and 1/2\" panels are sewn together vertically into one net, as are the 3/4\"and 1\" panels. The 1 1/4\", 1 1/2\", and 1 3/4\" panels are used individually for a total of five separate vertical nets. Each net is ganged together by a 12 foot connecting rope for a total of five vertical gill nets with 7 different mesh panels. Vertical gillnets are marked at 3.3 feet intervals and depth at capture is recorded for each fish. Nets are rolled up on custom made axles. Vertical gillnets are set as a gang, connected to each other, and anchored at the gang ends. Set and lift from downwind to prevent boat from floating over the gang. The gang is ordered from smallest to largest mesh (this will be consistent with standard gillnets and allow waypoints for each end). An oxygen-temperature profile was taken each day at each site. All fish species were counted. Tullibee were measured, weighed, age structures taken, depth of capture recorded and fish retained for later genetic analysis. In addition a hydro acoustic survey was done shortly after the vertical gillnetting to determine tullibee relative abundance throughout the preferred zone based on tullibee depth of capture in vertical gillnets. There were 62 tullibee (20.67 fish/gang) captured in 15 vertical gillnets (3 gangs). Tullibee captured with this gear (20.7 per gang) averaged 8.1 inches and ranged from 3.1 to 17.5 inches. Approximately 45% of the tullibee captured were likely young of year fish, 34% were probably age 2+ (2012 year class) and 21% were probably age 6+ to 8+ (2006-2009 year classes) based on historical growth data. The average depth at capture was 19.4 feet. The thermocline in Lake Koronis was set up at 29.5 feet over the deepest area of the lake (127.6 feet). The temperature when dissolved oxygen dropped to 3.0 ppm was 67 F. Tullibee were sampled in waters from 3.3-32.8 feet deep. These waters ranged in temperatures from 59-75 F and dissolved oxygen concentrations of 0.12-9.09 ppm. <br> \n <br> \nThere were low numbers of tullibee (6.00 fish/gillnet) captured in the Koronis 2014 fall gillnet special assessment. Only two gillnet stations (SGN3 & SGN4) were sampled in 2014 due to the early onset of ice (November 21, 2014). The 2014 fall tullibee average size was large (2.00 pounds and 15.95 inches) for Koronis. The 2012 fall tullibee catch rate was low (5.3 fish/gillnet, 14.9 inches average length). The 2010 fall tullibee catch rate was moderate (23.8 fish/gillnet, 15.3 inches average length). The fall tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 30.1 fish/gillnet and 15.20 inches for Koronis. Approximately 92% of the tullibee captured in 2014 fall were ripe males. The 2014 fall tullibee condition factor (1.301) was above the 75th quartile (1.293) for Koronis. Tullibee growth rates were between the Koronis 25th and 50th quartiles for ages 1-4, at the 50th quartiles for ages 5-6, and above the 75th quartile for age 7. The 2007 and 2009 year classes each comprised 33% of the 2014 fall tullibee catch in Koronis. The 2006 year class comprised 17% of the 2014 fall catch. The 2012 and 2010 year classes each comprised 8% of the total 2014 fall catch. There were no tullibee from 2009-2011 year classes in the 2012 fall catch. The lack of adult tullibee on the spawning grounds from early November to early December of recent years as sampled by the DNR is not a good indication for the long term sustainability of the tullibee population in Lake Koronis. Hopefully, cool summers will occur during the next several years, which may result in a good hatch and survival of tullibee in Lake Koronis if adequate brood stock numbers are still present.  <br> \n <br> \nGreen Lake was not sampled in 2014 due to early ice onset (November 20, 2014). Fall tullibee catch rate was low (8.33 fish/gillnet, 13.61 inches average length) in Green Lake during the 2012 fall. <br> \n <br> \nImproving and maintaining good water quality in Koronis is the key for tullibee numbers to survive and flourish. Public fall tullibee gillnetting seasons will not be reinstated in the near future on Koronis due to low tullibee numbers and high incidental catches of other gamefish. Current fish management activities on Koronis include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Lake Koronis fishery will be sampled in the 2017 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fall night electrofishing survey of young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Lake Koronis was conducted during September 29, 2016. The survey was done with a boat set up with electrofishing equipment to evaluate fry stocking success in 2016. The electrofishing equipment puts electricity into the water and fish are attracted to the positive charge in the front of the boat. We then net the fish and take lengths and weights to determine what condition the fish are in (etc.). Koronis is a large (2,968 acres), deep (132 feet maximum), and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. An invasive algal species, starry stonewort, was found primarily in the east and outlet bays of Koronis in 2015 and near the south access of Rice Lake in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nRice Lake is upstream and connects to Lake Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. Walleye from both Rice and Koronis spawn in the North Fork of the Crow River upstream of Rice Lake. Walleye also spawn adjacent to the east shores of the three islands in Koronis and the east point of Rice. Both Rice and Koronis are Walleye egg take sites for Spicer strain Walleye needs and statewide Walleye propagation program. Historic spawning sites for Walleye in both Koronis and Rice have been degraded in recent years with increased sedimentation, algal and periphyton growth.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Koronis was generally frequent and adequate to sustain Walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys from 1993-2002. Walleye natural reproduction or fry stocking successes were poor from 2003-2006 and 2008-2010 in Koronis. Walleye fry (0.5-2.0 million/year) were stocked during 1996 and 2001-2016 as a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the DNR statewide Walleye hatching program. Walleye fry stocked into Koronis have been primarily from the Spicer strain (Koronis, Rice, Diamond, Elizabeth or Green) since 2001. Stocked Walleye fry were marked with oxytetracycline \"OTC\" in 2001, 2007, 2009 and 2011-16 in both Rice and Koronis. Approximately 1.9 million OTC marked Walleye fry were stocked in Koronis during the 2013 spring. About 900,000 fry were stocked each year in 2014 and 2015. Approximately 715,000 fry were stocked in 2016. Walleye fingerlings and yearlings from the Pike River strain were recently stocked in 2006 (2,355 pounds, 45,685 fish) and 2010 (867 pounds, 4,887 fish). <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2016 (14.2 YOY/hour, 6.5 inches). OTC marked fish accounted for 40% of the 2016 Fall YOY Walleye catch. Yearling and two year old Walleye numbers were abundant (17.5 fish/hour) in 2016. The YOY Walleye historical average catch rate is 43.7 YOY/hour for Koronis. Walleye natural reproduction and fry/fingerling survival was poor in many area lakes and rearing ponds during 2016. Nearby and connected Rice Lake had moderate YOY Walleye numbers (56.0 YOY/hour) due to fry stocking and natural reproduction in 2016. An early ice out in mid-March resulted in earlier than normal Walleye spawning activity which is often less advantageous for fry survival due poor or erratic weather and lake conditions during early springs. <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers (3.6 YOY/hour, 6.0 inches) were captured in 2015. There were no OTC marked YOY Walleye captured in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (22.8 fish/hour, 9.5 inches) in 2015. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (208.1 YOY/hour, 6.4 inches) were captured in 2014. OTC marked fish accounted for 82% of the 2014 Walleye fingerlings captured in the fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (71.3 YOY/hour, 5.8 inches) were captured in 2013 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 45% of the 2013 Walleye year class captured was OTC marked (fry stocked) in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (32.8 YOY/hour, 7.0 inches) were captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 92% of the 2012 Walleye year class captured was OTC marked (fry stocked) in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (205.5 YOY/hour, 6.5 inches) were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 80% (164.4 YOY/hour) were OTC marked fish in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. The 2011 OTC marked year class accounted for 69% of the 2014 summer gillnet survey catch (19.8 fish/gillnet). Local anglers reported excellent Walleye fishing (16-18 inches) success in Koronis during 2014 and 2015.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Koronis fishery will be surveyed again in the 2017 summer for all fish species. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted each year to document Walleye natural reproduction and fry stocking success. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of Tullibee \"Cisco\" in Lake Koronis was conducted during mid-late November of 2019 using lake survey gillnets. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nKoronis is a large (2,968 acres), productive and deep (132 feet maximum) lake located in Stearns County. Tullibee were believed to be initially introduced into Koronis during the 1880's. Green Lake is the only other Spicer Area lake with a self-sustaining Tullibee population. Tullibee spawn in 3-6 feet of water over bottom substrates consisting of large rock during late November to early December when the water temperature reaches 41 degrees Fahrenheit \"F\" or less. Spawning substrates in both Koronis and Green during recent years have been covered by periphyton/filamentous algae except in shallow (<1 foot) windswept shoal areas. Climate changes may be negatively affecting Tullibee natural reproduction/recruitment success in these lakes due to degrading spawning habitat and increasing numbers of warm water fish species (i.e. Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, etc.) which prey upon Tullibee eggs, fry or fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Tullibee are susceptible to summerkill in Koronis if oxygen levels drop (<2 ppm) in the cooler deeper areas (<74 F) of the lake for an extended time (1-3 weeks) during late July to early August. Young Tullibee can tolerate warmer temperatures than adult Tullibee. Minor summerkills of Tullibee occurred on Koronis in 2006 and 2010. A major summerkill of Tullibee occurred on Koronis during 2011, but only a minor kill occurred on Green Lake during the 2011 summer. Drought conditions and extremely high air temperatures were the norm for the Spicer Area during July and early August of 2012. There were no apparent summerkills in Green or Koronis during 2012, but adult numbers were so low that summerkill events may not have been recognizable, especially due to the large numbers of pelicans living on Lake Koronis' islands. There have been no documented summerkills on Koronis since 2012. A narrow band of adequate water temperatures (<74 F) and dissolved oxygen levels (5 ppm) was present at depths of 20-21 feet in Koronis during July 22, 2019. Green has been the only lake in the Spicer Area open to the public for fall gillnetting of Tullibee during late November or early December each year since the late 1980's. Koronis was closed to public gillnetting during the late 1980's due to low Tullibee populations and high incidence of Northern Pike mortality during prior open seasons. Green Lake has been closed for Tullibee gillnetting since 2012 due to the low numbers sampled in recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish for trophy Northern Pike in Koronis and Green. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are less susceptible to capture in summer gillnets than late fall gillnets, Tullibee numbers were moderate (1.80 fish/gillnet, 14.17 inches) in the 2019 summer standard survey. Tullibee numbers were not present in the 2017 summer standard survey catch. The Tullibee historical summer average catch rate is 1.12 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The Tullibee summer historical average length is 12.15 inches from gillnets. The 2012 year class comprised 38% of the 2019 summer Tullibee catch. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee abundance was moderate (27.50 fish/gillnet, 15.74 inches) in the 2019 fall gillnet targeted survey. Tullibee abundance was low (10.33 fish/gillnet, 14.39 inches) in the 2017 fall gillnet targeted survey. Tullibee abundance was moderate in the 2010 (23.83 fish/gillnet, 15.28 inches) and 2015 (19.67 fish/gillnet, 14.17 inches) fall gillnet targeted surveys, but low in 2012 (5.33 fish/gillnet) and 2014 (6.00 fish/gillnet). The Tullibee fall historical average catch rate and average length are 28.57 fish/gillnet and 15.12 inches for Koronis. The Tullibee fall catch rate in nearby Green Lake was low in 2019 (1.75 fish/gillnet, 13.94 inches), 2017 (0.50 fish/gillnet, 11.25 inches) and 2015 (10.33 fish/gillnet, 13.66 inches average length). Tullibee growth rates were slow for ages 1-6, but moderate for ages 7-8. The 2013 and 2012 year classes each comprised about 35% of the 2019 Tullibee fall catch. Tullibee year classes prior to 2014 comprised 95% of the total 2019 fall catch. Hopefully, consecutive cool summers will continue to occur periodically, which may result in a good hatch, recruitment and survival of Tullibee to maintain a long term population in Lake Koronis.  <br> \n <br> \nImproving and maintaining good water quality in Koronis is the key for Tullibee numbers to survive and flourish. Public fall Tullibee gillnetting seasons will not be reinstated in the near future on Koronis due to low Tullibee numbers and high incidental catches of other gamefish. Current fish management activities on Koronis include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Lake Koronis fishery will be sampled in the 2022 summer for all fish species. Tullibee will be sampled by November gillnetting in 2022 for both Koronis and Green Lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of Tullibee (Cisco) in Lake Koronis was conducted during mid-late November of 2023 at four lake survey special gillnet stations. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nKoronis is a large (2,968 acres), and deep (132 feet maximum) lake located in Stearns and Meeker Counties. Koronis is currently infested with invasive species such as Curly-leaf Pondweed, Starry Stonewort and Zebra Mussels. A standard survey (summer gillnets and trapnets) of Koronis was last conducted during mid/late July of 2022. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted on October 4, 2023 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance in Koronis. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were believed to be initially introduced into Koronis and Green Lake during the 1880's. Green is the only other Spicer Area lake with a self-sustaining Tullibee population. Tullibee spawn in 3-6 feet of water over bottom substrates consisting of large rock during late November to early December when the water temperature reaches 41 degrees Fahrenheit \"F\" or less. Spawning substrates in both Green and Koronis during recent years have been covered by periphyton/filamentous algae except in shallow (<1 foot) windswept shoal areas. Increased phosphorus inputs or availability often result in greater blue-green and filamentous algae blooms. Climate changes (e.g. warmer temperatures, additional growing days, increased storm/runoff activity, etc.) coupled with continued nutrient inputs and Zebra Mussel impacts may be negatively affecting Tullibee natural reproduction and recruitment success in these lakes due to degrading spawning habitat and increasing numbers of warm water fish species (e.g. Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, etc.) which prey upon Tullibee eggs, fry or fingerlings.  <br> \n <br> \nAdult Tullibee are susceptible to summerkill in Koronis if oxygen levels drop (<2 ppm) in the cooler deeper areas (<74 F) of the lake for an extended time (1-3 weeks) during late July to early August. Young Tullibee can tolerate warmer water temperatures than adult Tullibee. A minor summerkill of adult Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2010, but none was reported in Green. Low dissolved oxygen (<2 ppm) levels were present at depths where preferred adult Tullibee water temperatures (<74 F) occurred for a short time period on Green in the 2010 late summer. A major summerkill of Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011, but only a minor kill occurred in Green during the 2011 summer. Drought conditions and extremely high air temperatures were the norm for the Spicer Area during July and early August of 2012. There were no apparent summerkills in Green or Koronis during 2012, but adult numbers were so low that summerkill events may not have been recognizable, especially due to the large numbers of pelicans living on Lake Koronis' islands. A narrow band (1-3 feet) of marginal water temperatures (<74 F) and dissolved oxygen levels (1-3 ppm) was present in depths of 25-30 feet in Green during late July and early August of 2012. Dissolved oxygen levels and water temperatures in Green were at potential summerkill levels of 2 ppm and 74 F on both July 30th and August 9th of 2012. Summer temperature and oxygen conditions were more conducive for Tullibee survival during 2013-2019 for both Koronis and Green. The month of June had warmer air temperatures (up to 90 F) and drier (< 2 inches of rain) than normal conditions during 2020-2022. July air temperatures were near or below normal during those same years. The 2023 summer was warmer and drier than normal especially for June, but no tullibee summerkills were observed in Green or Koronis. Adequate water temperatures and dissolved oxygen levels were present from 17 feet depth (73 F, 6 ppm) to 20 feet depth (70 F, 4 ppm) for tullibee survival on July 28, 2023. <br> \n <br> \nZebra Mussels were first observed in Koronis in 2022. It is unknown the extent Zebra Mussels will affect Tullibee and their corresponding forage base. Koronis was open to public gillnetting for Tullibee in the fall prior to the early 1980's but was closed due to low numbers and high incidental catch rate of other species such as Northern Pike and Walleye. Until recently, Green was the only lake in the Spicer Area open to the public for fall gillnetting of Tullibee during late November or early December from the late 1980's to 2011. Green Lake has been closed for Tullibee gillnetting since 2012 due to the low numbers sampled in recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish for trophy northern pike in both Koronis and Green. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee eggs were collected using a 300 foot gillnet (2.25-2.5 bar mesh) on November 18, 2022 at Lake Koronis for a doctoral research project. A total of 88 tullibee were captured in the overnight gillnet set. Approximately 2 quarts were stripped from 15 females and fertilized with 30 plus males on Koronis. One third of these eggs were immediately shipped to the University of Ohio-Miami. The remaining eggs were incubated in Muskellunge jars at the New London Hatchery for several weeks at 40 F river water and later shipped to the same research facility. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of UV light on cisco egg hatching and fry survival. The hatch rate was moderately successful. Local tullibee propagation (incubation, hatching and rearing to fryling stage) is possible at the New London Hatchery if using a recirculation system and a dry diet regime until fish can be stocked in the spring following ice out. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were present (0.20 fish/gillnet, 17.44 inches average length) in the 2022 Koronis summer survey. Moderate numbers of Tullibee were caught in 2019 (1.80 fish/gillnet, 14.17 inches average length). Tullibee were not present in the 2017 summer standard survey. The Tullibee historical average catch rate is 1.08 fish/gillnet for Koronis.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee numbers were low in 2023 November survey (5.00 fish/gillnet, 16.41 inches). Moderate numbers of Tullibee were captured in Koronis during 2019 (27.50 fish/gillnet, 15.75 inches) and 2015 (19.67 fish fish/gillnet, 14.17 inches), but low numbers in 2017 (10.33 fish/gillnet, 14.41 inches). The highest recorded tullibee catch was 119.83 fish/gillnet on Koronis during 1996. Low tullibee numbers (4.00 fish/gillnet, 10.78 inches) were also caught in Green Lake during 2023. The November Tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 28.52 fish/gillnet and 15.16 inches for Koronis. Tullibee growth rates were excellent for ages 1-8 in the 2023 November survey gillnet catches. The 2017 and 2015 year classes each comprised 35% of the 2023 November Tullibee survey catch. The inconsistency of Tullibee natural reproduction and inadequate adult Tullibee numbers on the spawning grounds as sampled by the DNR is not a good indication for the long term sustainability of the Tullibee populations in Green and Koronis. Hopefully, consecutive cool summers will continue to occur periodically, which may result in a good hatch, recruitment and survival of Tullibee to maintain a long-term population in Koronis. <br> \n <br> \nImproving and maintaining good water quality in Koronis is the key for Tullibee numbers to survive and flourish. Tullibee propagation is an option for maintaining a viable population. Other sampling methodology such as fall electrofishing and summer vertical gillnetting may better sample Tullibee populations in Green and Koronis. Public fall gillnetting season will probably be postponed until the adult population rebounds to adequate levels. Current fish management activities on Koronis include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Koronis fishery will be sampled in the 2024 summer for all fish species. Tullibee will be sampled by vertical gillnetting and hydroacoustic methods in June of 2024, and November gillnetting in 2025 for both Green and Koronis. <br> \n</p>",

PER GN).  THE AVERAGE SIZE INCREASED IN 1992 (3.43 LBS.)   COMPARED TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (3.0 LBS).  THE NOP PSD VALUE (79) WAS ABOVE THE RANGE (30-60) OF A BALANCED POPULATION AND ABOVE THE HISTORICAL PSD AVERAGE (67).  THE HIGH PSD VALUES AND LACK OF STRONG YEAR CLASSES PROBABLY INDICATE POOR NATURAL REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN KORONIS.  THE POPULATION HAS A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF LARGE NORTHERNS (>28 WHICH WAS EVIDENT FROM ANGLER REPORTS AND THE CALCULATED RSD-P VALUE OF 26 (RSD-P HISTORICAL AVERAGE =14).  GROWTH RATES APPEAR BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-3 AND AVERAGE FOR AGES 4-9.  PRESENTLY, THERE APPEARS TO BE AN ADEQUATE FORAGE BASE CONSISTING OF YEP AND TLC FOR NOP.  THE 1992 BLG CATCH INDEX (3.00 PER TN, 0.59 LBS. PER TN) WAS BELOW THE LAKE CLASS 27 INDEX AND THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (8.30 PER TN, 1.1 LBS. PER TN).  THE 1992 AVERAGE SIZE (0.20 LBS. WAS SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (0.19 LBS.).  THE 1992 BLG PSD VALUE (67) WAS ABOVE THE RANGE (40-60) OF A BALANCED POPULATION.  THE RSD-P VALUE WAS 0 COMPARED TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF 3.  GROWTH RATES APPEAR AVERAGE FOR BLG IN KORONIS.  THE STRONG 1989 BLG YEAR CLASS REPORTED IN THE 1989 SURVEY WAS NOT PRESENT IN 1992.  SMB CATCH INDEX (0.56 PER GN, 1.19 LBS.  PER GN) WAS AVERAGE FOR NUMBERS CAUGHT BUT ABOVE AVERAGE FOR POUNDS CAUGHT COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 27 INDEX.  THE 1992 SMB CATCH INDEX WAS SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (0.53 PER GN, AVERAGE SIZE= 1.29 LBS.), BUT THE AVERAGE SIZE WAS GREATER IN 1992 (2.12 LBS).  LOCAL REPORTS INDICATED GOOD FISHING FOR SMB (2-4 LBS).  DURING THE 1992 SUMMER.  GROWTH RATES APPEAR TO BE AVERAGE.  BLC CATCH INDEX (0.22 PER GN, 0.10 LBS.  PER GN) WAS BELOW THE LAKE CLASS 27 CATCH INDEX, BUT WAS SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (0.26 PER GN, 0.10 LBS.  PER GN).  THE 1992 YEP CATCH INDEX OF POUNDS (46.44 PER GN, 11.08 LBS.  PER GN) WAS ABOVE AVERAGE COMPARED TO LAKE CLASS 27 CATCH INDEX, BUT BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (73.6 PER GN, 11.5 LBS. PER GN).  THE PSD VALUE (54) WAS WITHIN THE RECOMMENDED RANGE FOR A BALANCED POPULATION (30- 60).  GROWTH RATES WERE AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-4 AND ABOVE AVERAGE FOR AGES 5-7.  THERE APPEARS TO BE TWO STRONG YEAR CLASSES (1989,1988) OF YEP IS KORONIS.  THE WAE CATCH INDEX (7.56 PER GN, 9.21 LBS. PER GN) WAS AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 27 INDEX AND SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (7.18 PER GN).  THE 1992 WAE AVERAGE SIZE (1.22 LBS.) WAS ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (0.96 LBS.).  THE 1992 PSD VALUE (39) WAS WITHIN THE RECOMMENDED RANGE OF A BALANCED POPULATION (30-60) AND ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (25). THE RSD-P VALUE (12) WAS ALSO ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (9).  GROWTH RATES APPEAR BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-7 AND AVERAGE FOR AGES 8-11.  THE STRONG 1989 YEAR CLASS (NATURALLY REPRODUCED) CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE WAE GILLNET CATCH. NONGAME SPECIES SUCH AS CARP, BLB, AND WTS HAVE INCREASED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.  THE 1992 BLB CATCH INDEX WAS (50.22 PER GN, 32.6 LBS.  PER GN) ABOVE THE LAKE CLASS 27 CATCH INDEX AND ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (30.3 PER GN, 13.8 LBS. PER GN).  ALTHOUGH, THE 1992 BLB CATCH INDEX DECREASED COMPARED TO THE RECORDED HIGH IN 1991 (91.25 PER GN).  THE 1992 CARP CATCH INDEX WAS THE HIGHEST RECORDED FOR BOTH GILLNETS (1.11 PER GN, 4.88 LBS. PER GN) AND TRAPNETS (9.40 PER TN, 25.08 LBS. PER TN).  THE 1992 CARP CATCH INDEX WAS ABOVE THE LAKE CLASS 27 CATCH INDEX AND ABOVE THE HISTORICAL CATCH INDEX (0.39 PER GN, 2.14 LBS. PER GN, 1.19 PER TN, 6.95 PER TN).  THE 1992 WTS CATCH INDEX WAS THE HIGHEST RECORDED (10.44 PER GN, 17.38 LBS. PER GN) AND ABOVE THE LAKE CLASS 27 CATCH INDEX.  THE 1992 FALL TLC CATCH INDEX (24.00 PER GN, 39.32 LBS. PER GN) WAS ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (13.3 PER GN, 23.00 LBS PER GN).  THE AVERAGE SIZE OF TLC CAUGHT DECREASED THE FIRST SURVEY TO DOCUMENT THE CAPTURE OF TLC LESS THAN 10 APPEAR TO BE SIMILAR FOR AGES 1-3 AND GREATER FOR AGES 4-9 COMPARED TO GREEN LAKE)LAKE CLASS 27).  THERE WERE TWO STRONG YEAR CLASSES (1989,1988) OF TLC THAT DOMINATED THE FALL SURVEY CATCH.  THE TLC POPULATION, NUMBERS AND SIZE STRUCTURE, HAS IMPROVED THE LAST TWO YEARS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Koronis is a large (3,014 acres), productive, and deep lake (maximum depth=132 feet)located 2 miles south of Paynesville, MN in Stearns County. A chain of three islands islocated along the northwest portion of the lake. The shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, gravel, rubble, and boulder. Aquatic vegetation density within the lake is variable eachyear. Algae blooms are common during the summer months. The North Fork of the Crow Riverflows into the east side and exits the southeast side of Koronis. Lake Koronis receivesnutrient inputs from various sources within the watershed which include agricultural rowcrops/feedlots, lake residential homes, and the City of Paynesville. The North Fork of theCrow River Watershed District and local citizens are actively involved in improving the waterquality within the watershed. Koronis is highly developed with 491 homes, several parks, 5resorts/campgrounds, and the Assembly Grounds Bible Camp (1992 survey). Koronis is a popularfishing lake for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and yellow perch. Koronis has anexcellent history of producing trophy size northern pike due to the presence of an excellentforage base (tullibee, yellow perch) in the lake. Two northern pike spawning areas (Spaethand Hendrickson) are operated by the MNDNR Spicer Area Fisheries Office each spring. Walleyefingerlings are stocked only after two poor consecutive year classes as documented by fallelectrofishing surveys. Excellent walleye natural reproduction has been documented in recentyears for Lake Koronis.     Walleye numbers in 1997 (22.4 fish/gillnet) were above normal compared to similar lakesand above the lake historical average (9.0 fish/gillnet). The walleye average size from thegillnets was 1.0 lbs. The largest walleye captured in the 1997 survey was 28.7 inches. The1995 year class comprised 46% of the total walleye catch in the 1997 survey. Excellentwalleye natural reproduction was documented by fall electrofishing in 1995 (60.9 young ofyear \"YOY\"/hour) and 1997 (81.8 YOY/hour). Fishing success for walleye has been excellent thelast two years, however the average size of walleye caught has been small (< 1.0 lbs.).      Northern pike numbers in 1997 (3.9 fish/gillnet) were normal compared to similar lakes,but above the historical average (2.0 fish/gillnet). The 1997 northern pike average size fromgillnets was 3.0 lbs. The largest northern pike captured in the survey nets was 31.1 inches.Koronis is a popular winter spearing lake for northern pike. In 1997, the Spaeth NorthernPike Spawning Area produced an estimated 8,690 northern pike fingerlings.     Smallmouth bass numbers in 1997 (1.1 fish/gillnet) were normal compared to similarlakes, but slightly above the historical average (0.6 fish/gillnet). The 1997 smallmouth bassaverage size from gillnets was 0.9 lbs. The largest smallmouth bass caught in the 1997 surveywas 17.0 inches. Anglers have experienced excellent fishing in Koronis especially for largesmallmouth bass in recent years.     Other notable fish species captured in 1997 include normal numbers of black crappie (1.5fish/trapnet), bluegill (5.1 fish/trapnet), and yellow perch (19.4 fish/gillnet) compared tosimilar lakes. The 1997 black crappie average size was 0.6 lbs (9.7 inches). Local anglershad excellent fishing success for black crappie during the spring of 1997. The 1997 bluegillaverage size was 0.2 lbs. The largest bluegill captured in the July 1997 survey was 9.4inches. Bluegill numbers have been low in recent years, thus adult bluegill brood stock werestocked in 1996 (12,017 fish) and 1997 (7,448 fish) to boost numbers and naturalreproduction.     Koronis has a diverse and popular fishery. Local residents have experienced excellent angling success for a variety of fish species in recent years. Management priorities forKoronis include operating the Spaeth and Hendrickson Northern Pike Spawning Areas, managingfor a variety of fish species, protecting important habitat (emergent vegetation), stockingvarious species as needed, and encouraging local landowners to implement best managementpractices in the watershed (conservation tillage, wetland restoration, planting bufferstrips, proper manure/feedlot management, using low/no phosphorus fertilizers, updating nonconforming septic systems).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Lake Koronis was conducted in late July of 2014. Koronis is a large (2968 acres), deep (132 feet maximum), and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. Koronis is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, black crappie, tullibee and bluegill. Koronis receives moderate recreational use during the summer months. There are five public access sites on Koronis. The lake is highly developed with approximately 498 homes and cabins, and seven resorts/bible camp/campgrounds. In addition, the city of Paynesville is within two miles of the lake. The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural row crops, hardwood areas, and residential development. Nutrient runoff enters Koronis via 45 inlets/tiles (mostly small inlets) from agricultural, city storm sewer, and lake residential sources. The largest inlet is the North Fork of the Crow River, which enters Koronis along the east shore and outlets near the southeast corner. The greatest volume of nutrient loading is delivered to Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. Aquatic vegetation densities are variable yearly in the lake. Various submergent species (curly-leaf pondweed, coontail, sago pondweed, narrow-leaf pondweed, chara and wild celery) can often become dense in the east bays, outlet bay and near shore areas of Koronis. Submergent vegetation densities were low to moderate in 2014. Water clarity was fair/poor (3.5 feet) on July 28, 2014 in Koronis. Water clarity (coffee colored) was poor during the 2012 fall and 2012-13 winter months, but improved in 2014-15 winter months. Water levels were high during June and July of 2014 due to rain events, but low by fall. A slow no-wake zone was put in place for lakes in Kandiyohi and Stearns Counties during June thru early July of 2014. High water levels due to rain events resulted in some shoreline erosion in addition to many docks and boat lifts floating away from their moorings.  <br> \n <br> \nA minor summerkill of large sized tullibee (cisco) was noted during late July to early August of 2010. A major summerkill of tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011, but only a minor kill occurred in Green Lake during the 2011 summer. Drought conditions and extremely high air temperatures were the norm for the area during July and early August of 2012. There were no apparent summerkills in Green or Koronis during 2012, but adult numbers were so low that summerkill events may not have been recognizable, especially due to the large numbers of pelicans living on Lake Koronis islands. A narrow band (1-3 feet) of marginal temperatures (<74.5 F) and dissolved oxygen levels (1-3 ppm) was present at depths of 18-25 feet in Koronis during mid-July and early August of 2012. Tullibee summerkill conditions on Koronis were suitable when dissolved oxygen levels were less than 1 ppm at a depth of 20 feet with a water temperature of 75.6 F on July 24, 2012, but no summerkill events were observed in 2012. No summerkills were observed in 2013 or 2014. Partial summerkills of tullibee and white sucker are common in Koronis during hot summers.  <br> \n <br> \nRice Lake is upstream and connects to Lake Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. Walleye from both Rice and Koronis spawn in the North Fork of the Crow River upstream of Rice Lake. Walleye also spawn adjacent to the east shores of the three islands in Koronis and the east point of Rice. Both Rice and Koronis are periodic walleye egg take sites for the statewide walleye propagation program. Historic spawning sites for walleye in both Koronis and Rice have been degraded in recent years with increased sedimentation, algal and periphyton growth. Northern pike spawning areas are located along the north (Spaeth) and west (Hendrickson) shores of Koronis.  <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices (buffers, storm sewer settling ponds, better wastewater management practices, better shore land practices) have been enacted or encouraged by local governments, North Fork Crow River Watershed District, homeowners, lake associations, and Paynesville Sportsman's Club. Koronis is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, in addition to secondary species such as bluegill, yellow perch, tullibee, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderately abundant in 2014 (4.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 1.30 fish/gillnet, but below the 2010 gillnet catch (7.50 fish/gillnet). The 2014 black crappie average sizes were small from both gillnets (0.10 pounds and 5.12) and trapnets (0.34 pounds and 6.98 inches). The black crappie historical average length is 7.83 inches from gillnets. Black crappie growth rates were moderate. A large 2013 year class of small (4-6 inches) black crappie was documented in the 2014 survey catch. Black crappie ranging in size from 9-12 inches (2011 and 2009 year classes) currently make up the angler catch based on local reports. Black crappie fishing has been excellent the last few years from shore adjacent to the Highway 55 access during the spring. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2014 (18.40 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average of 9.16 fish/trapnet. The 2014 bluegill average size was small (0.08 pounds and 4.51 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average length is 5.04 inches from trapnets. There were low numbers of moderate sized (6.00 plus inches) bluegill (1.28 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates are generally moderate to excellent for all ages. A large 2012 bluegill year class (<6 inches) was documented in the 2014 survey catch.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2014 (5.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 2.80 fish/gillnet. The 2014 northern pike average size was moderate (3.96 pounds and 24.97 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average length is 24.27 inches from gillnets. There were abundant numbers moderate sized (21.00 plus inches) northern pike (4.60 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were moderate. The largest northern pike captured was 33.7 inches from a gillnet in 2014. Approximately 72% of the northern pike captured in survey nets were from 2011 and 2010 year classes. Poor winter water clarity resulted in low observed spearing pressure during 2012-13 and 2013-14 winters, but spearing pressure increased in 2014-2015 due to increased clarity based on annual fish house counts and local reports. Northern pike angling (2012 summer) and spearing (2011-12 winter and 2014-15 winter) was excellent according to local reports for moderate/larger sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were moderately abundant in 2014 (1.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 0.87 fish/gillnet. The smallmouth bass average size was small (0.64 pounds and 10.40 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average length is 12.58 inches from gillnets. Smallmouth bass growth rates are moderate to excellent. Koronis has been known as an excellent smallmouth bass fishery for angling large (>15 inches) fish in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee \"cisco\" numbers were low in 2014 summer (0.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the summer historical average catch rate (1.15 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. The 2014 tullibee average length was small (8.74 inches). The tullibee summer historical average length is 11.91 inches from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nVertical gillnets were also set for tullibee at three deep water (50-130 feet deep) sites which included the north bay (Assembly Grounds), southeast side (deepest part) and south side of Third Island during mid-August of 2014. Vertical gillnets were marked at 3.3 feet intervals and depth at capture is recorded for each fish. There were 62 tullibee captured in 15 vertical gillnets. Tullibee captured with this gear averaged 8.1 inches and ranged from 3.1 to 17.5 inches. Approximately 45% of the tullibee captured were likely young of year fish, 34% were probably age 2+ (2012 year class) and 21% were probably ages 6+ to 8+ (2006-2009 year classes) based on historical growth data. The tullibee average depth at capture was 19.4 feet during mid-August. Tullibee were sampled in waters from 3.3-32.8 feet deep. These waters ranged in temperatures from 59-75 F and dissolved oxygen concentrations of 0.12-9.09 ppm. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee abundance was moderate (23.8 fish/gillnet, 15.28 inches average length) in the 2010 fall gillnet special assessment, but low in 2012 (5.33 fish/gillnet) and 2014 (6.00 fish/gillnet). The 2014 fall tullibee average size was large (2.00 pounds and 15.95 inches) for Koronis. The fall tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 30.1 fish/gillnet and 15.20 inches for Koronis. Fall tullibee catch rate in nearby Green Lake was also low in 2012 (8.33 fish/gillnet, 13.61 inches average length). Tullibee growth rates were within the Koronis normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2007 and 2009 year classes each comprised 33% of the 2014 fall tullibee catch in Koronis. Hopefully, cool summers will occur during the next several years, which may result in a good hatch and survival of tullibee in Koronis if adequate brood stock numbers are still present. Tullibee are an important forage species for both large northern pike and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were moderately abundant in 2014 (36.40 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes, but below historical average of 57.90 fish/gillnet. The 2014 yellow perch average size was small (0.12 pounds and 6.38 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average length is 6.96 inches from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2014 (19.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 10.48 fish/gillnet. The 2014 walleye average size was moderate (1.27 pounds and 14.67 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average length is 13.92 inches from gillnets. There were abundant numbers of moderate sized (15.00 plus inches) walleye (8.00 fish/gillnet) from gillnets in 2014. Walleye growth rates were moderate. The 2011 year class (fry stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 52% of the 2014 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Local anglers reported excellent walleye fishing (14-18 inches) in both the 2014 summer and 2014-2015 winter. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Koronis was generally both frequent and adequate to sustain walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys from 1993-2002. Young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers were low from 2003-2006 and 2008-2010, but abundant since 2011 in Koronis. Abundant numbers of YOY walleye (205.50 YOY/hour, 6.50 inches) were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye fry stockings (marked fish) contributed 80% in 2011, 92% in 2012 and 45% in 2013 of the YOY walleye catch in fall electrofishing surveys. Abundant to moderate numbers of YOY walleye captured included 2011 (205.00 YOY/hour), 2012 (32.83 YOY/hour), 2013 (71.25 YOY/hour, and 2014 (208.09 YOY/hour, 6.39 inches average length). The 2011 walleye year class was successful in many area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (0.5-2.0 million/year) were stocked during 1996 and 2001-2014 as a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for the DNR statewide walleye hatching program. Walleye fingerlings were recently stocked in 2004 (2,409 pounds, 48,180 fish), a combination of ages (2,355 pounds, 45,685 fish) were stocked in 2006, and a combination of yearlings and fingerlings (867 pounds, 4,887 fish) were stocked in 2010 due to poor fry survival from stocking and natural reproduction years. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were low in 2014 (0.60 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 1.69 fish/gillnet. The 2014 rock bass average size was small (0.32 pounds and 6.43 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average length is 7.04 inches from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass angling in Koronis by fishing clubs has been popular in recent years. Largemouth bass growth rates are excellent in Koronis. Standard survey gears like gillnets and trapnets do not efficiently sample largemouth bass, none the less, fair numbers of largemouth bass (0.40 fish/gillnet) were sampled in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of interest captured in 2014 included low numbers of black bullhead (0.40 fish/gillnet, 0.00 fish/trapnet), carp (0.00 fish/gillnet, 0.40 fish/trapnet), channel catfish (0.20 fish/gillnet), and yellow bullhead (2.60 fish/trapnet); high numbers of white sucker (7.80 fish/gillnet), bigmouth buffalo (1.00 fish/trapnet), and shorthead redhorse (1.00 fish/gillnet).  <br> \n\t <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Koronis include protecting important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, participating in local watershed projects, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, stocking various species as needed, and stocking walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Koronis fishery will be surveyed again for YOY walleye in the 2015 fall and 2017 for a population assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Lake Koronis was conducted in late July of 2007. Koronis is a large, deep, and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. Koronis is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Koronis receives moderate recreational use during the summer months. There are five public access sites on Koronis. The lake is highly developed with approximately 498 homes and cabins, and seven resorts/bible camp/campgrounds. In addition, the city of Paynesville is within two miles of the lake. The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural row crops, hardwood areas, and residential development. Nutrient runoff enters Koronis via 45 inlets/tiles (mostly small inlets) from agricultural, city storm sewer, and lake residential sources. The largest inlet is the North Fork of the Crow River, which enters Koronis along the east shore and outlets near the southeast corner. The greatest nutrient loading volume is delivered to Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. Nutrient levels (total phosphorus=0.030 ppm, chlorophyll A=24.0 ppb) were moderate in June of 2007 for Koronis. Water clarity was fair (3.5 \u0013 5.0 feet) during the 2007 summer in Koronis. Water temperatures were stratified by mid June through late August of 2007. Low (<1.0 ppm) or no oxygen was present in depths below 30 feet during the 2007 summer. No summerkills of tullibee (cisco) or white suckers were noted of any consequence in 2007, however partial summerkills are common during hot summers. Best management practices (buffers, storm sewer settling ponds, better wastewater management practices, shore land practices) have been enacted or encouraged by local governments, North Fork Crow River Watershed District, homeowners, lake associations, and sportsman\u0019s club. Bank erosion is noticeable along steep clay banks of First Island and two large points (Peterson\u0019s and Stoney Point) along the eastern portion of the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nAquatic vegetation densities are variable yearly in the lake. Submergent vegetation species that occurred frequently and had high mean abundance in the 2007 transects included wild celery, sago pondweed, muskgrass (chara), coontail, northern milfoil, water moss, and clasping-leaf pondweed. Filamentous algae were also abundant during 2007. Hardstem bulrush stands were limited to the west side of Second Island, southeast area of the outlet bay, and Hendrickson creek area. There are three large islands located on Koronis. Shoalwater substrates are varied with boulder, rubble, gravel, sand, and silt. Water levels were below normal during the summer due to drought conditions, but improved by late fall in 2007. Koronis is a periodic walleye egg take site for the statewide walleye propagation program. Koronis is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, in addition to secondary species such as bluegill, yellow perch, cisco, bass, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were high in 2007 (7.13 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the Koronis black crappie historical average catch rate (0.71 fish/gillnet). The 2007 black crappie average size was small to moderate (0.19 pounds and 7.01 inches) from gillnets. The black crappie historical average length is 8.29 inches from gillnets. Black crappie growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1 and 3-4, and within the normal range for age 2. The 2005 year class comprised 98% of the 2007 black crappie gillnet and trapnet catch in Koronis. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2007 (18.20 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but above the Koronis bluegill historical average catch rate (9.07 fish/trapnet). The 2007 bluegill average size was small (0.07 pounds and 4.58 inches) from the trapnets. The bluegill historical average length is 4.90 inches from trapnets. The 2007 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low (1.20 fish/trapnet). Young of year \"YOY\" bluegill catch rates were high (59.89 YOY/haul, 1.32 inches average length) in the 2007 shoreline seine hauls. Bluegill growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2005 year class comprised 83% of the 2007 bluegill gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2007 (9.88 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and above the Koronis northern pike historical average catch rate (2.70 fish/gillnet). The 2007 northern pike average size was moderate (3.26 pounds and 23.52 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average length is 23.27 inches from gillnets. The 2007 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger northern pike was low to moderate (1.00 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates in Koronis were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2005 and 2004 year classes comprised 49% and 28% of the 2007 northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch. The largest northern pike captured in the 2007 resurvey was 35.83 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were high in 2007 (1.88 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and above the smallmouth bass historical average catch rate (0.69 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. The 2007 smallmouth bass average size was moderate (1.55 pounds and 12.93 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average length is 12.72 inches from gillnets. The 2007 catch rate of preferred size (14.00 inches) and larger smallmouth bass was high (0.63 fish/gillnet) compared to the Koronis historical average (0.36 fish/gillnet). Shoreline seine catch rates of YOY smallmouth bass were low (0.89 fish/haul, 2.52 inches average length) in 2007. Smallmouth bass growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 3-6, but within the normal ranges for ages 1-2. The 2005 smallmouth bass year class comprised 47% of the 2007 smallmouth bass gillnet and trapnet catch. The largest smallmouth bass captured in the 2007 resurvey was 18.90 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing surveys were not conducted for largemouth bass or smallmouth bass in 2007 due to workload constraints. Local anglers reported good success catching largemouth and smallmouth bass during the 2007 summer. Largemouth bass abundance in the Koronis 2003 spring electrofishing survey was low (15.27 fish/hour). The 2003 largemouth bass average weight and length were moderate (1.22 pounds and 12.22 inches) from spring electrofishing. The Spicer Area historical average largemouth bass catch rate is 46.6 fish/hour from spring electrofishing. Previous spring electrofishing largemouth bass catch rates for Koronis were 36.67 fish/hour in 1990 (0.55 lbs, 9.2 inches average size) and 26.40 fish/hour in 1991 (0.60 pounds, 10.0 inches average size).  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee \"cisco\" numbers were moderate to high in 2007 (1.88 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and above the tullibee historical average catch rate (1.19 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. The 2007 tullibee average size was small (0.69 pounds and 10.82 inches) from gillnets. The tullibee historical average length is 12.32 inches from gillnets. Tullibee growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2005 and 2003 year classes comprised 47% and 33% of the 2007 summer gillnet catch. Tullibee are an important forage species for both large northern pike and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2007 (9.88 fish/gillnet) compared to normal range for similar lakes and below the yellow perch historical average catch rate (61.80 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. The 2007 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.24 pounds and 7.93 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average length is 7.02 inches from gillnets. The 2007 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was low to moderate (5.50 fish/gillnet). The shoreline seine haul catch of YOY yellow perch was low to moderate (8.22 fish/haul, 2.35 inches average length) in 2007. Yellow perch growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-2, and above the normal ranges for ages 3-6. The 2004 year class comprised 37% of the 2007 yellow perch gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were high in 2007 (10.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and above the walleye historical average catch rate (8.96 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. The 2007 walleye average size was moderate (1.30 pounds and 14.58 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average length is 13.83 inches from gillnets. The 2007 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye (4.50 fish/gillnet) was higher than the historical average (3.09 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. Walleye growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal quartiles for ages 1-8. The 2006 and 2004 year classes (stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 28% and 19% of the 2007 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. The 2005 year class comprised 21% of the 2007 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Koronis was generally both frequent and adequate to sustain walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys from 1993-2002. YOY Walleye numbers were low (<11.0 YOY/hour) from 2003-2006 in Koronis. Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2004 (2,409 pounds, 48,180 fish) and a combination of fingerlings/yearlings/adults (2,355 pounds, 45,685 fish) were stocked in 2006 due to low YOY numbers observed in fall electrofishing surveys. Walleye fry were stocked during 1996, and 2001-2007 as a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for the DNR statewide walleye-hatching program. There were moderate to high numbers of YOY walleye (44.00 YOY/hour, 7.29 inches average length) from fry stocking and natural reproduction in the 2007 fall electrofishing survey. A strong 2001 year class from natural reproduction (79%) and stocking of oxytetracycline marked fry (21%) was documented in the Koronis 2001 fall electrofishing survey (84.92 YOY/hour). The fall electrofishing YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 29.35 YOY walleye/hour for Koronis.  <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were moderate in 2007 (2.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The rock bass historical average catch rate is 1.46 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2007 rock bass average size was moderate to small (0.25 pounds and 6.51 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average length is 7.15 inches from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of interest captured in 2007 include low numbers of black bullhead (2.63 fish/gillnet) and carp (0.13 fish/trapnet) from Koronis. The Koronis historical average catch rate for black bullhead is 19.82 fish/gillnet. The Koronis historical average catch rate for carp is 1.63 fish/trapnet.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Koronis include protecting the important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, participating in local watershed projects, stocking various species as needed, and stocking walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Koronis fishery will be surveyed again for YOY walleye in the 2008 fall. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey summer of Lake Koronis was conducted in mid-July of 2022. In addition, a targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Koronis during October 26, 2022, to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to natural reproduction and a fry stocking. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nKoronis is a large (2,968 acres), deep (132 feet maximum), and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. Koronis is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Tullibee and Bluegill. Koronis receives high recreational use during the summer months. There are five public access sites on Koronis. The lake is highly developed with approximately 545 homes/cabins/parcels which includes one resort, one bible camp and several recreational vehicle campgrounds. In addition, the city of Paynesville is within two miles of the lake. The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural row crops, wetlands, hardwood areas, and residential development. Nutrient runoff enters Koronis via 45 inlets/tiles (mostly small inlets) from agricultural, city storm sewer, and lake residential sources. The largest inlet is the North Fork of the Crow River, which enters Koronis along the east shore and outlets near the southeast corner. The greatest volume of nutrient loading is delivered to Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. Water levels were above normal during 2019, but generally below normal during 2020-2022 summers. Water clarity was poor (2.5 feet) on July 18, 2022 in Koronis. An invasive algal species, starry stonewort, was found primarily in the east and outlet bays of Koronis in 2015 and near the south access of Rice Lake in 2016. Current efforts to chemically or mechanically eradicate starry stonewort have been unsuccessful in Koronis. Zebra Mussels were first found in Koronis during the 2022 summer. <br> \n <br> \nPartial summerkills of Tullibee \"Cisco\" and White Sucker are common in Koronis during hot summers. A minor summerkill of large sized Tullibee was noted during late July - early August of 2010. A major summerkill of Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011, but only a minor kill occurred in Green Lake during the 2011 summer. Drought conditions and extremely high air temperatures were the norm for the area during July and early August of 2012. There were no apparent summerkills in Green or Koronis during 2012, but adult numbers were so low that summerkill events may not have been recognizable, especially due to the large numbers of pelicans living on Lake Koronis islands. Although high air temperatures (>90 F.) occurred during several days in June of 2022, an adequate narrow band of water temperatures (<74.5 F) and dissolved oxygen levels (2-3 ppm) was present at depths of 22-25 feet in Koronis during mid-July of 2022 (moderate July air temperatures). No significant summerkills of Tullibee have been observed since 2012 on Koronis.  <br> \n <br> \nRice Lake is upstream and connects to Lake Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. In the past, Walleye from both Rice and Koronis have spawned in the North Fork of the Crow River upstream of Rice Lake. A Walleye egg take station was operated just upstream of Rice Lake in the Crow River from the 1970's to 1992. However, this Walleye spawning run now appears to be considerably reduced. This is based on anecdotal observations of lower opening Walleye fishing activity near the Koronis inlet bay/narrows area especially since the 2000's and recent (2018-2019) ice out hoop netting in the river near the old egg take station. Walleye fishing activity often was higher during late ice off years at the Koronis inlet bay area due fish returning from upriver spawning around opening weekend. Walleye also spawn adjacent to the east shores of the three islands in Koronis and the east point of Rice. Both Rice and Koronis are periodic \"Spicer Strain\" Walleye egg take sites for the statewide Walleye propagation program. Other Spicer Strain egg take lakes include Green, Diamond and Elizabeth. Historic spawning sites for Walleye in both Koronis and Rice have been degraded in recent years with increased sedimentation, algal and periphyton growth.  <br> \n <br> \nStandard surveys are scheduled two out of five years for both Koronis and Rice. Fall electrofishing surveys for YOY Walleye are scheduled every year for both lakes. There are presently good fishing opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Black Crappie and Smallmouth Bass on Koronis. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was high (5.80 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The 2022 Black Crappie trapnet catch was moderate (2.40 fish/trapnet). The Koronis Black Crappie historical average catch rates are 2.52 fish/gillnet and 1.23 fish/trapnet. The 2022 Black Crappie average size was moderate (0.35 pounds and 7.9 inches) from gillnets. The Black Crappie historical average length is 7.9 inches from gillnets. The 2022 catch rates of preferred size (10.0 inches plus) Black Crappie was high (1.80 fish/gillnet). Black Crappie growth rates were moderate in Koronis. The 2020 year class comprised 47% of the 2022 Black Crappie survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was high (36.60 fish/trapnet) in 2022. The historical average catch rate is 12.07 fish/trapnet. Moderate numbers of larger Bluegill (7.00 fish/gillnet, 6.7 inches average) were captured in the 2022 summer gillnets. The 2022 Bluegill average weight and length were 0.11 pounds and 5.0 inches respectively from the trapnets. The Bluegill historical average length is 5.0 inches from trapnets. The 2022 catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches plus) Bluegill was moderate (9.10 fish/trapnet). The 2022 catch rate of preferred size (8.0 inches plus) Bluegill was low (0.47 fish/trapnet). The largest Bluegill captured was 8.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass electrofishing survey was not conducted in 2022. However, Largemouth Bass (post spawn) abundance was moderate (21.00 fish/hour) in the late June 2017 electrofishing survey. The Largemouth Bass average size was small (0.70 pounds and 9.9 inches) from the 2017 electrofishing survey. Largemouth Bass growth rates were above the Spicer Area 50th quartiles for ages 1-6. The 2015 year class comprised 64% of the 2017 Largemouth Bass electrofishing catch. Post spawn electrofishing surveys generally catch greater numbers of smaller or younger Largemouth bass than previous electrofishing surveys conducted during the spawning season. Koronis is a popular lake for tournament/league bass fishing events. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was high (9.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The historical average catch rate is 3.40 fish/gillnet. The 2022 Northern Pike average size was moderate (3.96 pounds and 26.0 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average length is 24.1 inches from gillnets. The 2022 catch rate of preferred size (28.0 inches plus) Northern Pike was high (2.60 fish/gillnet). Northern Pike growth rates in Koronis were moderate to excellent for ages 1-8. The 2017-2019 year classes each comprised about 21% of the 2022 Northern Pike survey catch. The largest Northern Pike captured was 35.0 inches. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Koronis in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26.0 inches; and all from 22.0 to 26.0 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22.0 and 26.0 inches or two larger than 26.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass abundance was high (3.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The historical average catch rate is 1.10 fish/gillnet from Koronis. The 2022 Smallmouth Bass average size was large (2.10 pounds and 15.2 inches) from gillnets. The Smallmouth Bass historical average length is 12.8 inches from gillnets. The 2022 catch rate of preferred size (14.0 inches plus) Smallmouth Bass was high (2.20 fish/gillnet). The largest Smallmouth Bass captured was 19.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee abundance was low (0.20 fish/gillnet) in the 2022 standard summer survey. The Tullibee historical summer average catch rate is 1.08 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2022 summer survey average length was large (17.4 inches). The Tullibee summer historical average length is 12.6 inches from gillnets. The 2015 year class comprised 100% of the 2022 summer Tullibee catch. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee abundance was moderate (27.50 fish/gillnet, 15.7 inches) in the 2019 fall gillnet targeted survey. Tullibee abundance was low (10.33 fish/gillnet) in the 2017 fall gillnet target survey. Tullibee abundance was moderate in the 2010 (23.8 fish/gillnet, 15.3 inches) and 2015 (19.7 fish/gillnet, 14.2 inches) fall gillnet targeted surveys, but low in 2012 (5.33 fish/gillnet) and 2014 (6.00 fish/gillnet). The Tullibee fall historical average catch rate and average length are 28.57 fish/gillnet and 15.1 inches for Koronis. Hopefully, cool summers will occur during the next several years, which may result in a good hatch and survival of Tullibee in Koronis if adequate brood stock numbers are still present. Tullibee are an important forage species for both large Northern Pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was low (12.80 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The historical average catch rate is 57.08 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2022 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.12 pounds and 6.3 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average length is 6.8 inches from gillnets. The 2022 catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches plus) Yellow Perch was low (0.20 fish/gillnet). Local spearers reported seeing abundant small Yellow Perch in their spear holes during the 2022-23 winter. Our standard survey net mesh sizes are too large to retain small (< 4.0 inches) Yellow Perch in the nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was high (18.60 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The historical average catch rate is 11.28 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2022 Walleye average size was moderate (1.58 pounds and 15.8 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average length is 14.1 inches) from gillnets. The 2022 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches plus) Walleye (10.60 fish/gillnet) was higher than the historical average (4.92 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. The preferred size (20.00 inches plus) Walleye (2.00 fish/gillnet) was slightly above the historical average (1.00 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates generally moderate for ages 1-8. Three year classes (2017 and 2020-21 from fry stockings and natural reproduction) each comprised approximately 20% respectively of the 2022 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Walleye fry were marked with Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" in 2009 and 2011-2017 to determine the contribution of natural reproduction versus stocking. No OTC marked fish (fry stocked) were captured in the 2022 survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (0.5-2.0 million/year) were stocked during 1996 and 2001-2022 as a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the DNR statewide Walleye hatching program. Walleye fingerlings were recently stocked in 2004 (2,409 pounds, 48,180 fish), combination of ages (2,355 pounds, 45,685 fish) were stocked in 2006, and a combination of yearlings/fingerlings (867 pounds, 4,887 fish) were stocked in the 2010. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Koronis was frequent and often adequate to sustain Walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys, markings and analysis. However, natural reproduction contribution has been more variable in recent years due in part to degraded spawning habitat and unfavorable spring conditions. YOY Walleye numbers were moderate (39.00 YOY/hour, 6.55 inches) in the 2022 fall night electrofishing survey. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (24.00 fish/hour, 10.4 inches) in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant (65.00 YOY/hour, 7.2 inches) in 2021 fall electrofishing survey. No Yearling Walleye were observed in 2021. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (23.16 YOY/hour, 7.6 inches) were captured in 2020 fall electrofishing survey. We also observed moderate numbers of yearling (9.47 fish/hour) and age 2+ (23.16 fish/hour) Walleye in the 2020 survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2019 (1.85 YOY/hour). Abundant yearling Walleye were captured in 2019 (13.85 fish/hour, 9.8 inches). Moderate YOY and yearling Walleye numbers were captured in 2018 (20.57 YOY/hour, 7.2 inches; 8.57 yearlings/hour, 9.7 inches). Abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2017 (65.60 YOY/hour, 6.0 inches). OTC marked fish accounted for 33% of the YOY Walleye catch in the 2017 fall. Low numbers of yearling Walleye were captured in 2017 (4.80 fish/hour, 9.90 inches). Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2016 (14.18 YOY/hour, 6.5 inches). OTC marked fish accounted for 40% of the 2016 Fall YOY Walleye catch. Yearling and two year old Walleye numbers were abundant (17.45 fish/hour) in 2016. Low YOY Walleye numbers (3.60 YOY/hour, 6.0 inches) were captured in 2015. There were no OTC marked YOY walleye captured in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (22.80 fish/hour, 9.45 inches) in 2015. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye were captured in 2014 (208.09 YOY/hour, 6.39 inches average length) and 2013 (71.25 YOY/hour, 5.8 inches average length). OTC marked fish accounted for 82% of the 2014 Walleye fingerlings captured in the fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 45% of the 2013 fall electrofishing YOY catch were OTC marked (fry stocked). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (32.83 YOY/hour, 7.0 inches) were captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 92% of the 2012 year class fish captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey were OTC marked (fry stocked). Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (205.50 YOY/hour, 6.5 inches) were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 80% (164.40 YOY/hour) were OTC marked fish in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. The Koronis YOY Walleye historical average catch rate and average length are 42.08 YOY/hour and 6.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass abundance was moderate (1.60 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The historical average catch rate is 1.76 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2022 Rock Bass average size was small (0.11 pounds and 5.0 inches) from gillnets. The Rock Bass historical average length is 6.8 inches from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of interest present or absent in 2022 survey nets included low/no numbers of Black Bullhead (0.80 fish/gillnet, 0.13 fish/trapnet), Common Carp (0.00 fish/gillnet, 0.53 fish/trapnet), Bigmouth Buffalo (0.07 fish/trapnet), Shorthead Redhorse (0.20 fish/gillnet), and Channel Catfish (0.00 fish/gillnet); high numbers of Yellow Bullhead (5.60 fish/gillnet), and White Sucker (5.60 fish/gillnet). The Koronis historical average catch rates for Black Bullhead are 14.93 fish/gillnet and 2.15 fish/trapnet. The Koronis historical average catch rates for Common Carp are 0.40 fish/gillnet and 1.30 fish/trapnet. The Koronis historical average catch rates for White Sucker and Shorthead Redhorse are 5.39 and 1.23 fish/gillnet respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Koronis include protecting the important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, participating in local watershed projects, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, stocking various species as needed, and stocking Walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Koronis fishery will be surveyed again for YOY Walleye in the 2023 fall by electrofishing, Tullibee in the 2023 fall, and 2024 summer for all fish species by standard survey gears. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Koronis is a large (3,014) productive lake located about 2 miles south of Paynesville, MN in Stearns and Meeker Counties. It has a maximum depth of 132 feet. There is a variety of habitat and structure which includes shallow bays, three large islands, river channel, flats, and reefs. Submergent vegetation densities often vary annually, but are generally the greatest in the east, west and outlet bay areas. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, reed canary grass) is restricted to one inlet area, west side of Second Island, and bay areas (east, west, northwest). The North Fork of the Crow River flows into the east side of Koronis with the outlet located on the southeast side. The North Fork of the Crow River Watershed comprises about 198,400 acres. There are also about ten small spring/marsh originated inlets that flow into Koronis. Nutrient (phosphorus, nitrogen) loading from the Crow River Watershed is a continual problem. Algae blooms are common during the summer. The lake is highly developed with about 491 homes/cottages, 5 resorts, several parks, and the Assembly Bible Camp. The lake has been managed primarily for northern pike and walleye. Intensive walleye fingerling stocking occurred about every other year (3,000 - 6,000 lbs per year) during the 1980's. Presently, Koronis is stocked every other year with about 1,200 lbs of walleye fingerlings. There are two northern pike spawning areas (Spaeth, Hendrickson) that are operated on Koronis. Previously, Koronis was open for fall cisco \"tullibee\" gillnetting, but has been closed since the early 1980's due to low densities resulting from summerkills (1983, 1987, 1988). Koronis is a popular fishing lake for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and yellow perch.     Walleye abundance (11.3 fish/gillnet) in 1993 was above the normal range (3.7 - 10.0 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (7.6 fish/gillnet). The 1993 average weight (0.9 lbs) was below normal (1.1 - 1.8 lbs) for similar lakes, but the same as the historical average. Growth rates appear average compared to local lakes. Natural reproduction is probably a greater contributor than stocking to the walleye population during most years in Koronis. The walleye young of year catch rate was 6.4 fish/seine haul on August 25, 1993. The 1993 fall electrofishing catch rate for young of year walleye from natural reproduction was 37.8 fish/hour with an average length of 6.0 inches. The yearling catch rate was also 37.8 fish/hour, however, these fish could be from either or both a 1992 stocking and natural reproduction in 1992.     Northern pike abundance in 1993 (2.2 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (3.0 - 8.2 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but slightly above the historical average (1.8 fish/gillnet). The highest abundance rating occurred in 1977 (3.0 fish/gillnet). The average weight in 1993 (3.3 lbs) was above the historical average (3.0 lbs). The largest fish caught and released alive from the survey gear was 40.9 inches. Growth rates appear good compared to local lakes. There appeared to be a fair amount of natural reproduction that occurred in 1993 as indicated by the fall electrofishing catch rate of 10.5 young of year per hour.     Yellow perch catch rate in 1993 (51.4 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (8.1 - 50.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (71.6 fish/gillnet). Yellow perch abundance has ranged from 2.7 to 293.7 fish/gillnet. The average size was 7.7 inches in 1993. The average weight in 1993 (0.3 lbs) was above the normal range for similar lakes (0.1 - 0.2 lbs) and above the historical average (0.2 lbs). Growth rates appear excellent compared to other local lakes. Koronis is one of the premier yellow perch fishing lakes in the area due to the large size and abundance of yellow perch present.     Smallmouth bass abundance in 1993 (0.4 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (0.2 - 0.7 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and similar to the historical average (0.5 fish/gillnet). The highest abundance rating occurred in 1991 (1.6 fish/gillnet). The average weight in 1993 (1.7 lbs) was above the historical average (1.1 fish/gillnet). The largest smallmouth caught in the survey gear was 18.8 inches.     Cisco \"tullibee\" abundance in the 1993 summer survey (0.6 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (0.7 - 6.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (1.2 fish/gillnet). However, the cisco abundance in 1993 was the highest recorded value since a 1987 summerkill. The average weight in 1993 (1.3 lbs) was similar to the historical average (1.2 lbs).      Black crappie abundance in 1993 (1.3 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (0.3 - 1.7 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (0.4 fish/trapnet). The average weight in 1993 was the same as the historical average (0.4 lbs). Growth rates appear slightly below average.     Bluegill abundance in 1993 (2.9 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (3.1 - 47.1 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (7.8 fish/trapnet). Catch rates for bluegill have generally been between 0.3 - 6.6 fish/trapnet with exception to 1982 (36.3 fish/trapnet) and 1977 (23.3 fish/trapnet). The average size was 4.8 inches in 1993. Only 20% of the bluegill captured were greater than 6 inches. Growth rates appear average compared to other local lakes. Bluegill natural reproduction has been rather poor as indicated by the 1993 young of year catch rate of 0.3 fish/seine haul. Poor bluegill reproduction has been due to several factors such as high turbidity caused by algae blooms, lack of cover (submergent vegetation) for young of year and yearling survival, an abundant yellow perch population preying upon young of year bluegill, and declining spawning cover (hardstem bulrush stands).      Black bullhead abundance in 1993 (4.8 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (0.7 - 7.3 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (28.0 fish/gillnet). Black bullhead abundance has been high from 1989 to 1992 ranging from 39.9 - 91.3 fish/gillnet. The 1993 average weight was the same as the historical average (0.5 lbs). About 13,350 lbs of bullhead were removed by commercial fishermen from 1988-1993.     Carp abundance in 1993 (4.7 fish/trapnet) was above the historical average (2.2 fish/trapnet). The average size in 1993 (4.8 lbs) was also above the historical average (3.8 lbs). Commercial fishermen and the Paynesville Sportsmen's Club removed about 260,000 lbs of carp from 1988-1993.     Koronis is a highly developed lake within a large agricultural dominated watershed. Reducing nutrient inputs into the lake should be the primary management goal for Koronis. A comprehensive plan must be implemented to improve the water quality within the watershed. This plan should include identifying specific sites of high nutrient inputs, educating and encouraging landowners to implement better land use practices, educating area landowners about the various government programs currently available that assist in implementing better land use practices, restoring previously drained upstream wetlands to act as settling basins and filtration systems, and provide better coordination between the various government agencies and the private sector for improving the water quality within the watershed. Specific fisheries management options should include the continued evaluation of walleye natural reproduction, recruitment, and the necessity of stocking. The northern pike spawning areas should continue to be operated to assist in maintaining a viable northern pike fishery. If fishing pressure increases and results in overexploitation of certain species (walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, bluegill, etc.) then special regulations may be necessary to limit harvest. Other management activities should also include the expansion of habitat (hardstem bulrush stands) for species such as bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass. Continued periodic lake surveys, natural reproduction checks, special sampling (ice out netting, fall cisco gillnetting, spring electrofishing, fall electrofishing), and creel surveys are needed to provide accurate information for forming and implementing lake management objectives.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Lake Koronis was conducted in late July of 2012. Koronis is a large, deep, and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. Koronis is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, black crappie, tullibee and bluegill. Koronis receives moderate recreational use during the summer months. There are five public access sites on Koronis. The lake is highly developed with approximately 498 homes and cabins, and seven resorts/bible camp/campgrounds. In addition, the city of Paynesville is within two miles of the lake. The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural row crops, hardwood areas, and residential development. Nutrient runoff enters Koronis via 45 inlets/tiles (mostly small inlets) from agricultural, city storm sewer, and lake residential sources. The largest inlet is the North Fork of the Crow River, which enters Koronis along the east shore and outlets near the southeast corner. The greatest volume of nutrient loading is delivered to Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. Nutrient levels (total phosphorus=0.030 ppm, chlorophyll a=24.0 ppb) were moderate in June of 2007 for Koronis. Aquatic vegetation densities are variable yearly in the lake. Curly-leaf pondweed can often become dense in the east end and outlet bay of Koronis. Submergent vegetation densities were low to moderate in 2012. Water clarity was good (6.2 feet) on July 24, 2012 in Koronis. Water clarity (coffee colored) was poor during the 2012 fall and 2012-13 winter months. Water levels were high to normal early in 2012, but low by mid-summer.  <br> \n <br> \nA minor summerkill of large sized tullibee (cisco) was noted during late July - early August of 2010. A major summerkill of tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011, but only a minor kill occurred in Green Lake during the 2011 summer. Drought conditions and extremely high air temperatures were the norm for the area during July and early August of 2012. There were no apparent summerkills in Green or Koronis during 2012, but adult numbers were so low that summerkill events may not have been recognizable, especially due to the large numbers of pelicans living on Lake Koronis islands. A narrow band (1-3 feet) of marginal temperatures (<23.5 C) and dissolved oxygen levels (1-3 ppm) was present at depths of 18-25 feet in Koronis during mid-July and early August of 2012. Tullibee summerkill conditions on Koronis were suitable when dissolved oxygen levels were less than 1 ppm at a depth of 20 feet with a water temperature of 24.2 C on July 24, 2012, but no summerkill events were observed in 2012. Partial summerkills of tullibee and white sucker are common in Koronis during hot summers.  <br> \n <br> \nRice Lake is upstream and connects to Lake Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. Walleye from both Rice and Koronis spawn in the North Fork of the Crow River upstream of Rice Lake. Walleye also spawn adjacent to the east shores of the three islands in Koronis and the east point of Rice. Both Rice and Koronis are periodic walleye egg take sites for the statewide walleye propagation program. Historic spawning sites for walleye in both Koronis and Rice have been degraded in recent years with increased sedimentation, algal and periphyton growth. Northern pike spawning areas are located along the north (Spaeth) and west (Hendrickson) shores of Koronis.  <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices (buffers, storm sewer settling ponds, better wastewater management practices, better shore land practices) have been enacted or encouraged by  local governments, the North Fork Crow River Watershed District, homeowners, lake associations, and Paynesville Sportsman's Club. Koronis is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, in addition to secondary species such as bluegill, yellow perch, tullibee, bass, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderately abundant in 2012 (1.60 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes, but below the 2010 gillnet catch (7.50 fish/gillnet). The Koronis black crappie historical average catch rate is 1.13 fish/gillnet. The 2012 black crappie average size was moderate (0.47 pounds and 8.53 inches) from gillnets. The black crappie historical average length is 8.22 inches from gillnets. The 2012 catch rate of preferred size (10.00 inches) and larger black crappie was low (0.60 fish/gillnet). Black crappie fishing has been excellent the last few years from shore adjacent to the Highway 55 access during the spring. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low to moderate in 2012 (5.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes. The Koronis bluegill historical average catch rate is 8.65 fish/trapnet. The 2012 bluegill average size was small (0.16 pounds and 5.66 inches) from the trapnets. The bluegill historical average length is 5.09 inches from trapnets. The 2012 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low (1.60 fish/trapnet).  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low in 2012 (1.60 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes. The Koronis northern pike historical average catch rate is 2.67 fish/gillnet. The 2012 northern pike average size was large (6.83 pounds and 29.41 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average length is 24.20 inches from gillnets. The 2012 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger northern pike was moderate to high (0.80 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates in Koronis were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2009 year class comprised about 36% of the 2012 northern pike assessment catch. The largest northern pike captured was 40.4 inches in the 2012 assessment. Northern pike angling (2012 summer) and spearing (2011-12 winter) was excellent for moderate/large sized fish, but fair for total numbers. Poor water clarity resulted in minimal spearing pressure during the 2012-13 winter. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were abundant in 2012 (2.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes. The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.87 fish/gillnet from Koronis. The 2012 smallmouth bass average size was moderate (1.07 pounds and 12.05 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average length is 12.80 inches from gillnets. The 2012 catch rate of preferred size (14.00 inches) and larger smallmouth bass was moderate to high (0.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (0.51 fish/gillnet). The largest smallmouth bass captured was 19.1 inches in the 2012 assessment. Smallmouth bass growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3 and above the normal ranges for ages 4-8. The 2010 year class comprised 47% of the 2012 smallmouth gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee \"cisco\" numbers were not present in the 2012 summer gillnets. The tullibee historical summer average catch rate is 1.20 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The tullibee summer historical average length is 12.30 inches from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee abundance was moderate (23.8 fish/gillnet, 15.28 inches average length) in the 2010 fall gillnet special assessment, but low in 2012 (5.33 fish/gillnet). The 2012 fall tullibee average size was moderate (1.41 pounds and 14.91 inches) for Koronis. The fall tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 31.6 fish/gillnet and 15.16 inches for Koronis. Fall tullibee catch rate in nearby Green Lake was also low in 2012 (8.33 fish/gillnet, 13.61 inches average length). The 2012 fall tullibee condition factor (1.180) was below the normal range for Koronis. Tullibee growth rates were at or below the Koronis normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2006 year class comprised 34% of the 2012 fall tullibee catch in Koronis. The 2008 and 2007 year classes each comprised 22% of the total 2012 fall catch. A major summerkill of tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011. Hopefully, cool summers will occur during the next several years, which may result in a good hatch and survival of tullibee in Koronis if adequate brood stock numbers are still present. Tullibee are an important forage species for both large northern pike and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low to moderate in 2012 (18.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 59.09 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2012 yellow perch average size was small to moderate (0.13 pounds and 6.84 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average length is 7.01 inches from gillnets. The 2012 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was low (0.40 fish/gillnet). Yellow perch growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2010 year class comprised 96% of the 2012 gillnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2012 (19.60 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 9.96 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2012 walleye average size was small (0.89 pounds and 12.82 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average length is 13.84 inches from gillnets. The 2012 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye (6.00 fish/gillnet) was high compared to the historical average (3.77 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. Walleye growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 2-7, but within the normal ranges for ages 1 and 8. The 2011 year class (fry stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 44% of the 2012 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fish (fry stocked) comprised 77% of the 2011 year class captured in the 2012 summer gillnets. The 2010 year class (fry stocked, fingerling stocked, natural reproduction) comprised 19% of the 2012 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. The 2008 year class (fry stocked, natural reproduction) comprised 17% of the 2012 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Koronis was generally both frequent and adequate to sustain walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys from 1993-2002. YOY Walleye numbers were low (<11.0 YOY/hour) from 2003-2006 in Koronis. There were moderate to low numbers of YOY walleye from fry stocking and natural reproduction in the 2007 (44.00 YOY/hour, 7.29 inches) and 2008 (22.94 YOY/hour, 5.93 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. Approximately 40% of the YOY walleye sampled in the 2007 fall electrofishing survey were from an OTC marked fry stocking. No fall electrofishing survey was conducted for Koronis in 2009, but low walleye numbers (1.30 fish/hour, 7.60 inches average size) of the 2009 year class were captured in a 2010 spring electrofishing survey. Low numbers of YOY walleye (6.43 YOY/hour, 7.27 inches) were captured in the 2010 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 55% of the 2010 fall electrofishing YOY catch had white light characteristics on otoliths (unmarked fry stocking). Abundant numbers of YOY walleye (205.50 YOY/hour, 6.50 inches) were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 80% (164.40 YOY/hour) were OTC marked fish in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate YOY walleye numbers (32.83 YOY/hour, 6.97 inches) were captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 92% of the 2012 year class fish captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey were OTC marked (fry stocked). The fall electrofishing YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 37.26 YOY/hour for Koronis.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (0.5-2.0 million/year) were stocked during 1996 and 2001-2012 as a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for the DNR statewide walleye hatching program. Walleye fingerlings were recently stocked in 2004 (2,409 pounds, 48,180 fish), a combination of ages (2,355 pounds, 45,685 fish) were stocked in 2006, and a combination of yearlings and fingerlings (867 pounds, 4,887 fish) were stocked in the 2010. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were moderately abundant in 2012 (3.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes. The rock bass historical average catch rate is 1.75 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2012 rock bass average size was moderate (0.32 pounds and 7.32 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average length is 7.10 inches from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of interest captured in 2012 included moderate/low numbers of black bullhead (7.40 fish/gillnet, 0.07 fish/trapnet), carp (0.40 fish/gillnet, 0.13 fish/trapnet), white sucker (6.00 fish/gillnet), largemouth bass (0.40 fish/gillnet) and shorthead redhorse (0.80 fish/gillnet). Yellow bullhead abundance (14.00 fish/gillnet, 10.31 inches average length) was above the normal range for Koronis in 2012.  <br> \n <br> \nInvasive goldfish were sampled in a 2012 Index of Biotic Integrity \"IBI\" survey. Invasive goldfish were documented in a private pond that connects to Koronis during 2011. The pond was drained and reclaimed, but goldfish probably entered Koronis prior to 2011 over the pond's dam boards during high flows. Lake shore residents reported seeing goldfish in the outlet stream of the pond next to the lake during 2011. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Koronis include protecting the important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, participating in local watershed projects, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, stocking various species as needed, and stocking walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Koronis fishery will be surveyed again for YOY walleye in the 2013 fall and 2014 for a population assessment. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey summer of Lake Koronis was conducted in mid-July of 2017. In addition, a targeted late June Largemouth Bass (post spawn fish) electrofishing survey and targeted fall Walleye young of year \"YOY\" electrofishing survey were conducted in 2017. A fall targeted gillnet survey was conducted for Tullibee \"Cisco\" during mid-late November of 2017. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nKoronis is a large (2968 acres), deep (132 feet maximum), and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. Koronis is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie, Tullibee and Bluegill. Koronis receives moderate recreational use during the summer months. There are five public access sites on Koronis. The lake is highly developed with approximately 498 homes and cabins, and seven resorts/bible camp/campgrounds. In addition, the city of Paynesville is within two miles of the lake. The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural row crops, hardwood areas, and residential development. Nutrient runoff enters Koronis via 45 inlets/tiles (mostly small inlets) from agricultural, city storm sewer, and lake residential sources. The largest inlet is the North Fork of the Crow River, which enters Koronis along the east shore and outlets near the southeast corner. The greatest volume of nutrient loading is delivered to Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. <br> \n <br> \nAn invasive algal species, starry stonewort, was found primarily in the east and outlet bays of Koronis in 2015 and near the south access of Rice Lake in 2016. Current efforts to chemically eradicate starry stonewort have been unsuccessful in Koronis. Aquatic vegetation densities are variable yearly in the lake. Various submergent species (curly-leaf pondweed, coontail, bladderwort, buttercup, sago pondweed, narrow-leaf pondweed, chara and wild celery) can often become dense in the east bays, outlet bay and near shore areas of Koronis. Submergent vegetation densities were moderate (i.e. sago pondweed, water celery, coontail, clasping-leaf pondweed, curly-leaf pondweed, water moss, bushy pondweed and other pondweeds) in 2017. Muskgrass \"chara\" (native species of the stonewort family) was found at 94% of 2017 transect stations. Starry Stonewort (invasive species) was found at 28% of the 2017 transect stations. Water clarity was excellent (9.8 feet) on July 17, 2017 in Koronis. The 2017 summer was characterized as a cooler than average with normal water levels. Ice on occurred during December 12, 2017, but warm temperatures resulted in poor ice conditions until after the holidays. Snowfall was lacking during the 2017-18 winter. <br> \n <br> \nPartial summerkills of Tullibee and white sucker are common in Koronis during hot summers. A minor summerkill of large sized Tullibee (Cisco) was noted during late July - early August of 2010. A major summerkill of Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011, but only a minor kill occurred in Green Lake during the 2011 summer. Drought conditions and extremely high air temperatures were the norm for the area during July and early August of 2012. There were no apparent summerkills in Green or Koronis during 2012, but adult numbers were so low that summerkill events may not have been recognizable, especially due to the large numbers of pelicans living on Lake Koronis islands. An adequate band of water temperatures (<23.5 C) and dissolved oxygen levels (2-8 ppm) was present at depths of 15-24 feet in Koronis during mid-July of 2017. No summerkills have been observed since 2011 on Koronis.  <br> \n <br> \nRice Lake is upstream and connects to Lake Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. Walleye from both Rice and Koronis spawn in the North Fork of the Crow River upstream of Rice Lake. Walleye also spawn adjacent to the east shores of the three islands in Koronis and the east point of Rice. Both Rice and Koronis are periodic Walleye egg take sites for the statewide Walleye propagation program. Historic spawning sites for Walleye in both Koronis and Rice have been degraded in recent years with increased sedimentation, algal and periphyton growth.  <br> \n <br> \nStandard surveys are scheduled two out of five years for both Koronis and Rice. Fall electrofishing surveys for YOY Walleye are scheduled every year for both lakes. There are presently good fishing opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass on Koronis. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were abundant in 2017 (11.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The Koronis Black Crappie historical average catch rate is 1.82 fish/gillnet. There were also abundant numbers (4.80 fish/gillnet) of Black Crappie 10.00 inches and larger in 2017. Black Crappie growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal range for ages 2-5. The 2013 and 2015 year classes comprised 51% and 25% respectively of the 2017 Black Crappie catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderately abundant (15.07 fish/trapnet), but small (0.07 pounds and 4.59 inches) in 2017. The Koronis Bluegill historical average catch rate is 9.46 fish/trapnet. Bluegill growth rates were within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2015 year class comprised 95% of the 2017 Bluegill catch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass (post spawn) numbers were moderate (21.00 fish/hour) in the late June 2017 electrofishing survey. The Largemouth Bass average size was small (0.70 pounds and 9.94 inches) from electrofishing. Largemouth Bass growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2015 year class comprised 64% of the 2017 Largemouth Bass electrofishing catch. Post spawn electrofishing surveys generally catch greater numbers of smaller or younger Largemouth bass than previous electrofishing surveys conducting during the spawning season. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were abundant in 2017 (6.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The Koronis Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 3.00 fish/gillnet. The 2017 Northern Pike average size was moderate (3.60 pounds and 25.47 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average length is 24.37 inches from gillnets. The 2017 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 plus inches) Northern Pike was 1.40 fish/gillnet. Northern Pike growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 2-6. The 2014 and 2013 year classes comprised 40% and 32% respectively of the 2017 Northern Pike catch. Locals reported many Northern Pike were seen during mid December of 2017, but fewer fish were seen after the holidays when ice conditions improved. <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass numbers were moderately abundant in 2017 (3.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but above the Koronis historical average catch rate (1.76 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. The 2017 Rock Bass average size was small (0.30 pounds and 6.72 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass numbers were abundant in 2017 (3.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the Koronis historical average catch rate (1.00 fish/gillnet). The 2017 Smallmouth Bass average size was moderate (1.01 pounds and 11.44 inches) from gillnets. The Smallmouth Bass historical average length is 12.48 inches from gillnets. Smallmouth Bass growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 2-7. The 2015 year class comprised 59% of the 2017 Smallmouth Bass catch.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were not captured in 2017 summer gillnets. The Tullibee historical summer average catch rate is 1.09 fish/gillnet for Koronis. Tullibee abundance was low (10.33 fish/gillnet) in the 2017 fall gillnet targeted survey. The 2017 fall Tullibee average size was moderate (1.53 pounds and 14.39 inches) for Koronis. The fall Tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 30.1 fish/gillnet and 15.20 inches for Koronis. Fall Tullibee catch rate in nearby Green Lake was also low in 2017 (0.50 fish/gillnet, 11.25 inches average). Tullibee are an important forage species for both large Northern Pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2017 (22.60 fish/gillnet) to the Koronis historical average catch rate (56.13 fish/gillnet). The 2017 Yellow Perch average size was small to moderate (0.10 pounds and 6.12 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average length is 6.89 inches from gillnets. Yellow Perch growth rates were near or below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2015 and 2014 year classes comprised 49% and 39% respectively of the 2017 Yellow Perch survey catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (0.5-2.0 million/year) were stocked during 1996 and 2001-2017 as a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the DNR statewide Walleye hatching program. Walleye fingerlings were recently stocked in 2004 (2,409 pounds, 48,180 fish), a combination of ages (2,355 pounds, 45,685 fish) were stocked in 2006, and a combination of yearlings and fingerlings (867 pounds, 4,887 fish) were stocked in the 2010. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Koronis was frequent and often adequate to sustain Walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys, markings and historical data review. However, natural reproduction contribution had been variable since 2002 due in part to degraded spawning habitat and unfavorable spring conditions. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2017 (65.60 YOY/hour, 6.03 inches). OTC marked fish (fry stocked) accounted for 33% of the YOY Walleye catch in the 2017 fall. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2016 (14.18 YOY/hour, 6.51 inches) and 2015 (3.60 YOY/hour, 5.97 inches). Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye were captured in 2014 (208.09 YOY/hour, 6.39 inches average length), 2013 (71.25 YOY/hour, 5.79 inches average length) and 2011 (205.50 YOY/hour, 6.50 inches). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (32.83 YOY/hour, 6.97 inches) were captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. OTC marked fish (fry stocked) accounted for 80%, 92%, 45%, 82%, 0% and 40% respectively of the 2011-2016 Fall YOY Walleye catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2017 survey (13.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 10.63 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2017 Walleye average size was moderate (1.17 pounds and 14.32 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average length is 13.95 inches from gillnets. There were moderate numbers of Walleye 15.00 inches and larger (5.00 fish/gillnet) in Koronis during 2017. Walleye growth rates were generally near the lower end of the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6, but within the normal ranges for ages 7-8. The 2014 and 2013 year classes (fry stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 39% and 24% respectively of the 2017 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. OTC marked fish (fry stocked) comprised 36% of the 2014 year class captured in the 2017 summer gillnets. OTC marked fish (fry stocked) comprised 46%, 50% and 60% respectively of the 2013, 2012 and 2011 year classes in the 2017 summer gillnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species of interest captured in 2017 included low numbers of Black Bullhead (1.00 fish/gillnet, 0.07 fish/trapnet), Common Carp (0.00 fish/gillnet, 0.20 fish/trapnet), and channel catfish (0.00 fish/gillnet); high numbers of White Sucker (3.80 fish/gillnet), Shorthead Redhorse (1.60 fish/gillnet) and Bigmouth Buffalo (0.07 fish/trapnet). Yellow Bullhead abundance (14.60 fish/gillnet, 11.55 inches average length) was also high for 2017.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Koronis include protecting the important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, participating in local watershed projects, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, stocking various species as needed, and stocking Walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Koronis fishery will be surveyed again for YOY Walleye in the 2018 fall and 2019 for a standard survey. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Lake Koronis during October 24, 2018 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. Koronis is a large (2968 acres), deep (132 feet maximum), and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. Koronis is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie, Tullibee and Bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (0.5-2.0 million/year) were stocked during 1996 and 2001-2018 as part of a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the DNR statewide Walleye hatching program. There were 503,406 unmarked Walleye fry stocked in Koronis during May of 2018. Walleye fingerlings were recently stocked in 2004 (2,409 pounds, 48,180 fish), a combination of ages (2,355 pounds, 45,685 fish) were stocked in 2006, and a combination of yearlings and fingerlings (867 pounds, 4,887 fish) were stocked in the 2010. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Koronis was frequent and often adequate to sustain Walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys, markings and analysis. However, natural reproduction contribution has been more variable in recent years due in part to degraded spawning habitat and unfavorable spring conditions. OTC marked fry have contributed generally between 30-80% of the fall electrofishing and summer gillnet catch in Koronis during recent years. <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers (20.57 YOY/hour, 7.20 inches) were captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. The 2018 catch rate is probably a conservative estimate due to negative effects of moderate wind/wave conditions at several sampling stations and the later than normal sampling date during colder water temperatures (48 F). Moderate yearling Walleye numbers (8.57 fish/hour, 9.71 inches) were captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2017 (65.60 YOY/hour, 6.03 inches). OTC marked fish accounted for 33% of the YOY Walleye catch (6 of 18 otoliths readable) in the 2017 fall. Low numbers of yearling Walleye were captured in 2017 (4.80 fish/hour, 9.90 inches). Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2016 (14.18 YOY/hour, 6.51 inches). OTC marked fish accounted for 40% of the 2016 Fall YOY Walleye catch. Yearling and two year old Walleye numbers were abundant (17.45 fish/hour) in 2016. Low YOY Walleye numbers (3.60 YOY/hour, 5.97 inches) were captured in 2015. There were no OTC marked YOY walleye captured in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (22.80 fish/hour, 9.45 inches) in 2015. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye were captured in 2014 (208.09 YOY/hour, 6.39 inches average length) and 2013 (71.25 YOY/hour, 5.79 inches average length). OTC marked fish accounted for 82% of the 2014 Walleye fingerlings captured in the fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 45% of the 2013 fall electrofishing YOY catch were OTC marked (fry stocked). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (32.83 YOY/hour, 6.97 inches) were captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 92% of the 2012 year class fish captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey were OTC marked (fry stocked). Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (205.50 YOY/hour, 6.50 inches) were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 80% (164.40 YOY/hour) were OTC marked fish in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye abundance (13.40 fish/gillnet) was above the normal ranges for Koronis and similar lakes in the most recent 2017 standard summer gillnet survey. The 2017 Walleye average weight and length were 1.17 pounds and 14.32 inches respectively from gillnets. The 2014 and 2013 year classes (fry stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 39% and 24% respectively of the 2017 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. OTC marked fish (fry stocked) comprised 36% of the 2014 year class captured in the 2017 summer gillnets. OTC marked fish (fry stocked) comprised 46%, 50% and 60% respectively of the 2013, 2012 and 2011 year classes. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Koronis include protecting the important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, participating in local watershed projects, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, stocking various species as needed, and stocking Walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Koronis fishery will be surveyed again for YOY Walleye in the 2019 fall and 2019 summer for a standard survey. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Lake Koronis was conducted in late July of 2003. Koronis is a large, deep, and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. Koronis is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Koronis receives moderate recreational use during the summer months. The lake is highly developed with homes and cabins. In addition, the city of Paynesville is within two miles of the lake. Nutrient runoff enters Koronis from agricultural, city storm sewer, and lake residential sources. There are five public access sites on Koronis. Aquatic vegetation densities are variable yearly in the lake. Hardstem bulrush stands are limited within the lake. There are three large islands located on Koronis. Shoalwater substrates are varied with boulder, rubble, gravel, sand, and silt. Water clarity was moderate to low during the 2003 population assessment (secchi=5.2 feet). Water levels were normal during the spring and early summer, but low by fall due to drought conditions in 2003. The largest inlet is the North Fork of the Crow River, which enters Koronis along the east shore and outlets near the southeast corner. Black crappie numbers were low in 2003 (0.5 fish/trapnet) and near the low end of the normal range for similar lakes. The Koronis black crappie historical average catch rate is 0.7 fish/trapnet. The 2003 black crappie average size was small (0.16 pounds and 5.9 inches) from trapnets. The Koronis black crappie historical average length is 8.5 inches. Black crappie growth rates were within or above the normal ranges for ages 1-4 compared to area lakes. The 2002 black crappie year class comprised 86% of the 2003 total black crappie catch in Koronis.Bluegill numbers were low to moderate in 2003 (12.1 fish/trapnet) and within the normal range for similar lakes. The Koronis bluegill historical average catch rate is 8.5 fish/trapnet. The 2003 bluegill average size was small (0.04 lbs. and 3.7 inches) from trapnets. The Koronis bluegill historical average length is 4.9 inches from trapnets. Northern pike numbers were moderate to high in 2003 (5.6 fish/gillnet) and within the normal range for similar lakes. The Koronis northern pike historical average catch rate is 2.2 fish/gillnet. The 2003 northern pike average size was moderate (3.7 lbs. and 24.9 inches) from gillnets. The Koronis northern pike historical average length is 23.5 inches from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates in Koronis were generally above the normal ranges compared to area lakes. The 2001 Northern pike year class comprised 51% of the 2003 total northern pike assessment catch in Koronis. The largest northern pike captured was 36.5 inches in the 2003 assessment.Smallmouth bass numbers were moderate in 2003 (1.0 fish/gillnet), but above the normal range for similar lakes. The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.6 fish/gillnet from Koronis. The 2003 smallmouth bass average size was moderate (1.3 lbs. and 11.3 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average length is 12.7 inches from gillnets. The 2002 smallmouth bass year class comprised 36% of the total 2003 smallmouth bass summer assessment catch in Koronis. Smallmouth bass growth rates in Koronis were generally above the normal ranges compared to similar area lakes. The largest smallmouth bass captured in the 2003 summer assessment was 20.0 inches.Largemouth bass numbers were low in the Koronis 2003 spring electrofishing survey (15.3 fish/hour). The Spicer area historical average largemouth bass catch rate is 46.1 fish/hour from spring electrofishing. Previous spring electrofishing largemouth bass catch rates for Koronis were moderate in 1990 (36.7 fish/hour, 9.2 inches average size) and 1991 (26.4 fish/hour, 10.0 inches average size). The 2003 largemouth bass average size was moderate (1.21 pounds and 12.2 inches) from spring electrofishing. The 2000 year class comprised 43% of the Koronis 2003 total spring electrofishing largemouth bass catch. Koronis largemouth bass growth rates were generally above the normal ranges compared to area lakes. The largest largemouth bass captured during the Koronis 2003 spring electrofishing survey was 16.1 inches.Tullibee \"cisco\" numbers were low in 2003 (0.9 fish/gillnet) and near the low end of the normal range for similar lakes. The tullibee historical average catch rate is 1.2 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2003 tullibee average size was large (1.57 lbs. and 13.9 inches) from gillnets. The tullibee historical average length is 12.6 inches from gillnets. Tullibee are an important forage species for both large northern pike and large walleye.Yellow perch numbers were high in 2003 (68.8 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 65.3 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2003 yellow perch average size was small (0.11 lbs. and 6.2 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average length is 6.9 inches from gillnets. Walleye abundance in 2003 (7.3 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range for similar lakes, but slightly below the Koronis historical average catch rate (8.9 fish/gillnet). The 2003 walleye average weight and length were 1.44 lbs. and 14.9 inches respectively from gillnets. The walleye historical average length is 13.7 inches from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches) and larger walleye in 2003 (1.5 fish/gillnet) was lower than the historical average (2.7 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. The 2001 year class (stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 34% of the Koronis total 2003 walleye assessment catch. Walleye growth rates calculated from the 2003 Koronis assessment were generally below the normal ranges for ages 1-8 compared to area lakes, but slightly above average compared to historical growth rates for Koronis. Walleye natural reproduction in Koronis was generally both frequent and adequate to sustain walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys from 1993-2003. Walleye fingerlings (2,830 fish, 215 pounds) were last stocked in Koronis during 1996. Walleye fry were stocked during 1996, and 2001-2003 as a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for the DNR statewide walleye hatching program. Low young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (10.9 YOY walleye/hour, 6.7 inches average size) were captured in the 2003 fall night electrofishing survey. A large 2001 year class from natural reproduction (79%) and stocking of fry (21%) was documented in the Koronis 2001 fall electrofishing survey (84.9 YOY/hour). The fall electrofishing YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 35.4 YOY walleye/hour for Koronis. Rock bass numbers were high in 2003 (8.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The rock bass historical average catch rate is 1.4 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2003 rock bass average size was small (0.19 lbs. and 6.1 inches) from gillnets. The Koronis rock bass historical average length is 7.2 inches from gillnets.Other species of interest captured in 2003 include low numbers of black bullhead (4.8 fish/gillnet, 0.9 fish/trapnet) and carp (0.0 fish/gillnet, 0.1 fish/trapnet) from Koronis. The Koronis historical average catch rates for black bullhead are 21.0 fish/gillnet and 3.1 fish/trapnet. The Koronis historical average catch rates for carp are 0.5 fish/gillnet and 1.7 fish/trapnet. Current fish management activities on Koronis include protecting the important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, participating in local watershed projects, stocking various species as needed, and stocking walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Koronis fishery will be surveyed again for YOY walleye in the 2004 fall and all fish species during the 2007 summer.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fall night electrofishing survey of young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Lake Koronis was conducted during October 1, 2015. Koronis is a large (2,968 acres), deep (132 feet maximum), and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. An invasive algal species, starry stonewort, was found primarily in the east and outlet bays of Koronis in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nRice Lake is upstream and connects to Lake Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. Walleye from both Rice and Koronis spawn in the North Fork of the Crow River upstream of Rice Lake. Walleye also spawn adjacent to the east shores of the three islands in Koronis and the east point of Rice. Both Rice and Koronis are Walleye egg take sites for Spicer strain Walleye needs and statewide Walleye propagation program. Historic spawning sites for Walleye in both Koronis and Rice have been degraded in recent years with increased sedimentation, algal and periphyton growth.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (0.5-2.0 million/year) were stocked during 1996 and 2001-2015 as a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the DNR statewide Walleye hatching program. Walleye fry stocked into Koronis have been primarily from the Spicer strain (Koronis, Rice, Diamond, Elizabeth or Green) since 2001. Stocked Walleye fry were marked with oxytetracycline \"OTC\" in 2001, 2007, 2009 and 2011-15 in both Rice and Koronis. Approximately 1.9 million OTC marked Walleye fry were stocked in Koronis during the 2013 spring. About 900,000 fry were stocked each year in 2014 and 2015. Walleye fingerlings and yearlings from the Pike River strain were recently stocked in 2006 (2,355 pounds, 45,685 fish) and 2010 (867 pounds, 4,887 fish). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Koronis was generally frequent and adequate to sustain Walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys from 1993-2002. YOY Walleye numbers were low from 2003-2006 and 2008-2010 in Koronis. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (205.50 YOY/hour, 6.50 inches) were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 80% (164.40 YOY/hour) were OTC marked fish in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Local anglers reported excellent Walleye fishing (16-18 inches) success in 2014 and 2015. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (32.83 YOY/hour, 6.97 inches) were captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 92% of the 2012 Walleye year class captured was OTC marked (fry stocked) in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (71.25 YOY/hour, 5.79 inches) were captured in 2013 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 45% of the 2013 Walleye year class captured was OTC marked (fry stocked) in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (208.09 YOY/hour, 6.39 inches) were captured in 2014. OTC marked fish accounted for 82% of the 2014 Walleye fingerlings captured in the fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (3.60 YOY/hour, 5.97 inches) were captured in 2015. There were no OTC marked YOY walleye captured in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (22.80 fish/hour, 9.45 inches) in 2015. The YOY Walleye historical average catch rate is 45.04 YOY/hour for Koronis.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Koronis fishery will be surveyed again in the 2017 summer for all fish species. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted each year to document Walleye natural reproduction and fry stocking success. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>An Index of Biotic Integrity \"IBI\" survey was conducted on Lake Koronis from July 25-27, 2016. One measure of a lake's health is the community of fish, plants and aquatic life it sustains. Certain species can't survive without clean water and a healthy habitat while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions. Examples of fish that require clean water are Tullibee, Rock Bass, and Bluegill.  Species that are tolerant to degraded habitat are Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish.  The more intolerant fish to degraded habitat you have in the sample, the higher the score will be.  An index of biological integrity (IBI) is a score that compares the types and numbers of fish or plants observed in a lake to what is expected for a healthy lake.   <br> \n <br> \nKoronis is a large (2,968 acres), deep (132 feet maximum), and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. An invasive algal species, starry stonewort, was found primarily in the east and outlet bays of Koronis in 2015 and near the south access of Rice Lake in 2016. Seine hauls were conducted at 20 IBI stations with a bag seine of 50 foot width and 1/8 inch bar mesh in depths of 3.5 feet or less. A 15 foot wide and 1/8 inch bar mesh bag seine was used at 2 IBI stations. Dense aquatic vegetation (starry stonewort) or soft sediments prohibited seining at 2 other IBI stations). Near shore electrofishing was conducted at all 24 IBI Stations with a back-pack unit in water depths generally less than 2 feet deep. The 24 IBI Stations were spaced equally apart around the entire shoreline of the lake in a variety of near shore habitats. Each station was approximately 100 feet long. Two back-pack electrofishing runs were conducted with the initial run of 100 feet near the shore-water interface in depths of < 1 foot and the second run of 100 feet long about 10-20 feet from shore in depths up to 2 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nApproximately 22 different fish species (13 species from back-pack electrofishing, 20 species from seining) were captured from electrofishing and seining combined. Fish species captured included gamefish (i.e. Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass), panfish (Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, and Hybrid Sunfish), large non-gamefish (Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, White Sucker and Shorthead Redhorse) and small non-gamefish (Logperch, Brook Silverside, Johnny Darter, Iowa Darter, Spottail Shiner, Common Shiner, Golden Shiner and Bluntnose Minnow). Young of year species captured included Bluntnose Minnow, Bluegill, Brook Silverside, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass and Yellow Perch with seine hauls or back-pack electrofishing. Johnny Darter and Iowa Darter were only caught with the back-pack electrofishing gear. The various fish species captured in Koronis is indicative of species present in most Spicer Area lakes connected to riverine habitats.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Koronis is a large (3,014 acres) and productive lake with a maximum depth of 132feet. It is located 2 miles south of Paynesville, MN in Stearns County. Three largeislands are located along the northwest portion of the lake. There are several distinctbays within the lake. Submergent vegetation density is variable during different years. In1999, submergent vegetation stands (muskgrass, pondweed species, wild celery, northernwater milfoil, etc.) were low to moderate in density. Emergent vegetation stands (hardstembulrush, waterlily species, cattail species) were relatively sparse with most occurringadjacent to the Hendrickson Creek inlet, west side of First and Second Islands, northwestcorner near Bug Bee's Resort, and the west shore near the Tim Adams Public Access (AC-3).The shoalwater substrates were mostly sand, gravel, rubble, and boulder. Koronis is highlydeveloped with 408 first tier homes, 3 resorts, 1 bed & breakfast, Tri County RegionalPark, Vans Beach City Park, and the Assembly Grounds Bible Camp. The North Fork of theCrow River flows into Koronis along the east and exits along the southeast corner of thelake. Hendrickson Creek flows into Koronis along the southwest shore of the outlet bay.There are about 15 small spring/wetland/storm sewer originated inlets that flow intoKoronis. The watershed size is approximately 198,400 acres. Most of the excess nutrientrunoff enters Koronis from the North Fork of the Crow River inlet, Hendrickson Creek, andfrom surrounding lake shore property. Nutrient runoff sources include agricultural rowcrops/feedlots, residential lake homes, and the City of Paynesville (storm sewer, sanitarysewer during emergency over flow periods only). Clay bank erosion is a problem on severalsteep banks located along First & Second Islands, north shore, and the east shore. Waterclarity is usually fair to poor during the mid summer months in Koronis (secchi disk=4.75feet on 7/26/99). Total phosphorus nutrient levels were uncharacteristically low inKoronis during early June of 1999 (0.028 ppm). Algae blooms are common during the latesummer in Koronis. Several organizations (The North Fork of the Crow River WatershedDistrict, Paynesville Sportsman's Club, Koronis Lake Association, Rice Lake Association)have been actively involved in improving water quality within the watershed. Koronis ismanaged for walleye and northern pike as primary species with smallmouth bass, bluegill,black crappie, and yellow perch as secondary species. Intensive walleye stocking had beendone in the past. However, good walleye natural reproduction has been documented throughfall electrofishing surveys. Koronis is presently stocked on an as needed basis when twoconsecutive poor year classes have been documented by fall electrofishing. There are twonorthern pike spawning areas \"NPSA\" (Spaeth and Hendrickson) operated on Koronis forfingerling production. Koronis is a popular fishing lake for walleye, northern pike,yellow perch, and smallmouth bass.     Walleye were moderately abundant(8.67 fish/gillnet) in 1999 and comparable to thehistorical average (8.99 fish/gillnet). The 1999 walleye average size was small tomoderate (0.94 lbs., 13.53 inches from the gillnets), but a majority of the walleye in the1999 resurvey were young (51% of total catch from 1997 year class). Walleye growth rateswere average compared to other local lakes. The moderately abundant 1997 walleye yearclass in the 1999 resurvey corresponds to an excellent natural year class documented byfall electrofishing in 1997. Excellent walleye natural reproduction success (young of year\"YOY\" walleye) was documented by fall electrofishing in 1995 (60.85 YOY/hour) and 1997(81.82 YOY/hour). Moderate to low walleye natural reproduction was documented in 1993(37.85 YOY/hour), 1994 (10.50 YOY/hour), 1996 (27.43 YOY/hour), 1998 (3.00 YOY/hour), and1999 (24.00 YOY/hour).      Northern pike numbers were low (1.89 fish/gillnet) in 1999 compared to the normalrange (3.00 - 7.89 fish/gillnet) of similar lakes, but equivalent to the historicalaverage (1.97 fish/gillnet). The 1999 northern pike average size was large (3.28 lbs.,23.75 inches) from the gillnets. The largest northern pike caught in the 1999 survey was42.91 inches (20.55 lbs.). Northern pike growth rates were above average for ages III andolder fish compared to local lakes.     Yellow perch numbers were moderate (28.44 fish/gillnet) in 1999 compared to thenormal range (7.06 - 33.87) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (65.01fish/gillnet). The 1999 yellow perch average size was small (5.97 inches) compared to thehistorical average (7.03 inches).     Bluegill were abundant (23.40 fish/trapnet) in the July 26, 1999 resurvey compared tothe historical average (8.21 fish/trapnet). The 1999 resurvey bluegill average size wassmall (3.59 inches, trapnets), because of the presence of large numbers of young fish.Adult bluegill were stocked into Koronis in 1998 (6,020 fish), 1997 (7,448 fish), and 1996(12,017 fish) in order to boost adult numbers and natural reproduction success. It appearsthat the bluegill stockings were successful in producing several good bluegill yearclasses as documented by shoreline seining in 1999 (11.0 YOY/hour, 1.31 inches averagelength), 1998 (39.5 YOY/hour, 1.30 inches average length), and 1996 (11.8 YOY/hour, 1.36inches average length).     Black crappie were moderately abundant (2.73 fish/trapnet) in 1999 compared to thenormal range (0.25 - 1.74 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average(0.73 fish/trapnet). The 1999 black crappie average size was moderately large (0.42 lbs,trapnets). The 1997 year class comprised 91% of the 1999 total black crappie catch. Blackcrappie natural reproduction success was good to excellent in several local lakes in thearea during 1996-1998.     Tullibee (cisco) were moderately abundant (2.78 fish/gillnet) in the 1999 summerresurvey compared to the historical average (1.17 fish/gillnet). However, a substantialsummerkill of tullibee and white sucker occurred in Koronis from July 29, 1999 to earlyAugust.     Non gamefish numbers were relatively low (0.67 black bullhead/gillnet, 0.20 commoncarp/gillnet) in Koronis during 1999. The 1999 black bullhead average size was 6.69 inches(gillnets and trapnets combined). The Paynesville Sportsman's Club removed 5,100 lbs. ofcarp in 1999 12,000 lbs. in 1997, 12,100 lbs. in 1995, and 45,000 lbs. in 1993 in theNorth Fork of the Crow River below the Koronis fixed sill outlet dam.     Koronis has a diverse and popular fishery. Local residents have experienced good toexcellent walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and black crappie angling success inrecent years. Walleye natural reproduction has been good in Koronis, thus requiring nowalleye fingerling stockings during 1994-95, and 1997. In 1996, walleye fry andfingerlings (133,589 fry, 2,830 fingerlings) were stocked in lieu of 1,209,664 walleyeeggs taken in the 1996 spring due to shortages at traditional statewide walleye egg takesites. It appears that the walleye stocking contribution to population numbers in Koronisis negligible during years of good natural reproduction. However, walleye stocking may bea significant contributor to population numbers during consecutive poor naturalreproductive years. Koronis will be routinely monitored to determine if walleye stockingis necessary. Koronis has an excellent forage base (tullibee, yellow perch) for producingtrophy northern pike. Winter spearers generally have the best success for harvesting largenorthern pike in Koronis. Tullibee populations had increased in recent years, however thetullibee population is presently down (1999 fall tullibee special assessment) due topartial summerkills during hot and calm conditions of the late summer months during 1997and 1999. Adult bluegill numbers and natural reproduction in Koronis have responded due tothe stockings from 1996-1998. The growth rates of small stocked bluegill have beenexcellent in Koronis. Management priorities for Koronis include operating Spaeth andHendrickson Northern Pike Spawning Areas as needed, managing for a variety of fish species(walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, bluegill, yellow perch), protecting andenhancing important habitat (emergent vegetation, planting willows in the eroding claybank areas), stocking various species as needed, and encouraging local landowners andresidents to implement best management practices (conservation tillage, planting bufferstrips, proper manure/feedlot management, using low/no phosphorus fertilizers, updatingnon conforming septic systems, wetland restoration).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey summer of Lake Koronis was conducted in mid-July of 2019. In addition, a targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Koronis during October 16, 2019 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to natural reproduction and a fry stocking. A fall targeted gillnet survey was conducted for Tullibee \"Cisco\" during mid-late November of 2019. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nKoronis is a large (2,968 acres), deep (132 feet maximum), and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. Koronis is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Tullibee and Bluegill. Koronis receives moderate recreational use during the summer months. There are five public access sites on Koronis. The lake is highly developed with approximately 545 homes/cabins/parcels which includes one resort, one bible camp and several recreational vehicle campgrounds. In addition, the city of Paynesville is within two miles of the lake. The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural row crops, hardwood areas, and residential development. Nutrient runoff enters Koronis via 45 inlets/tiles (mostly small inlets) from agricultural, city storm sewer, and lake residential sources. The largest inlet is the North Fork of the Crow River, which enters Koronis along the east shore and outlets near the southeast corner. The greatest volume of nutrient loading is delivered to Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. Water levels were above normal during 2019. Water clarity was poor (3.2 feet) on July 22, 2019 in Koronis. <br> \n <br> \nAn invasive algal species, starry stonewort, was found primarily in the east and outlet bays of Koronis in 2015 and near the south access of Rice Lake in 2016. Current efforts to chemically eradicate starry stonewort have been unsuccessful in Koronis. Aquatic vegetation densities are variable yearly in the lake. Various submergent species (curly-leaf pondweed, coontail, bladderwort, buttercup, sago pondweed, narrow-leaf pondweed, chara and wild celery) can often become dense in the east bays, outlet bay and near shore areas of Koronis. Submergent vegetation densities were moderate (i.e. sago pondweed, water celery, coontail, clasping-leaf pondweed, curly-leaf pondweed, water moss, bushy pondweed and other pondweeds) in 2017 standard vegetation transect stations conducted by DNR Spicer Area Fisheries personnel. Muskgrass \"chara\" (native species of the stonewort family) was found at 94% of 2017 transect stations. Starry Stonewort (invasive species) was found at 28% of the 2017 transect stations. Starry Stonewort occurrence has increased from 17% to 58% of point intercept stations sampled from 2015-2018 by DNR Division of Ecological Services and Waters personnel.  <br> \n <br> \nPartial summerkills of Tullibee and white sucker are common in Koronis during hot summers. A minor summerkill of large sized Tullibee (Cisco) was noted during late July - early August of 2010. A major summerkill of Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011, but only a minor kill occurred in Green Lake during the 2011 summer. Drought conditions and extremely high air temperatures were the norm for the area during July and early August of 2012. There were no apparent summerkills in Green or Koronis during 2012, but adult numbers were so low that summerkill events may not have been recognizable, especially due to the large numbers of pelicans living on Lake Koronis islands. A narrow band of adequate water temperatures (<23.5 C) and dissolved oxygen levels (1-5 ppm) was present at depths of 20-21 feet in Koronis during mid-July survey of 2019. No summerkills have been observed since 2012 on Koronis.  <br> \n <br> \nRice Lake is upstream and connects to Lake Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. In the past, Walleye from both Rice and Koronis have spawned in the North Fork of the Crow River upstream of Rice Lake. A Walleye egg take station was operated just upstream of Rice Lake in the Crow River from the 1970's to 1992. However, this Walleye spawning run now appears to be considerably reduced. This is based on anecdotal observations of lower opening Walleye fishing activity near the Koronis inlet bay/narrows area especially since the 2000's and recent (2018-2019) ice out hoop netting in the river near the old egg take station. Walleye fishing activity often was higher during late ice off years at the Koronis inlet bay area due fish returning from upriver spawning around opening weekend. Walleye also spawn adjacent to the east shores of the three islands in Koronis and the east point of Rice. Both Rice and Koronis are periodic \"Spicer Strain\" Walleye egg take sites for the statewide Walleye propagation program. Other Spicer Strain egg take lakes include Diamond and Elizabeth. Historic spawning sites for Walleye in both Koronis and Rice have been degraded in recent years with increased sedimentation, algal and periphyton growth.  <br> \n <br> \nStandard surveys are scheduled two out of five years for both Koronis and Rice. Fall electrofishing surveys for YOY Walleye are scheduled every year for both lakes. There are presently good opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie and Smallmouth Bass on Koronis. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were abundant in 2019 (13.20 fish/gillnet, 2.40 fish/trapnet). The Koronis Black Crappie historical average catch rates are 2.36 fish/gillnet and 1.17 fish/trapnet. The 2019 Black Crappie average size was small from gillnets (0.29 pounds and 7.68 inches), but moderate from trapnets (0.35 pounds and 8.30 inches). Black Crappie 12.00 inches and larger were present in the 2019 survey nets. A variety of Black Crappie size groups were present in Koronis. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2019 (39.80 fish/trapnet). The Koronis Bluegill historical average catch rate is 10.90 fish/trapnet. The 2019 Bluegill average size was small (0.08 pounds and 4.58 inches) from the trapnets. Abundant schools of small Bluegill feeding near the surface are often observed in Koronis. There were relatively few Bluegill over 7.00 inches captured in the 2019 survey nets. Locals reported good fishing success for larger (7.00 inches plus) Bluegill during March of 2020. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass electrofishing survey was not conducted in 2019. However, Largemouth Bass (post spawn) abundance was moderate (21.00 fish/hour) in the late June 2017 electrofishing survey. The Largemouth Bass average size was small (0.70 pounds and 9.94 inches) from 2017 electrofishing survey. Largemouth Bass growth rates were slightly above average for ages 1-6. The 2015 year class comprised 64% of the 2017 Largemouth Bass electrofishing catch. Koronis has been a popular lake for Largemouth Bass fishing tournament and league events.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were abundant in 2019 (5.80 fish/gillnet). The Koronis Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 3.14 fish/gillnet. The 2019 Northern Pike average size was moderate (3.65 pounds and 25.32 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average length is 24.04 inches from gillnets. Growth rates were fair for ages 1-7. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Koronis in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass numbers were moderate in 2019 (1.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (1.01 fish/gillnet) from Koronis. The 2019 Smallmouth Bass average size was large (1.59 pounds and 13.62 inches) from gillnets. The Smallmouth Bass historical average length is 12.57 inches from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee numbers were moderate in 2019 standard summer survey (1.80 fish/gillnet) and comparable to the historical summer average catch rate of 1.12 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2019 summer survey average length was large (14.17 inches). The Tullibee summer historical average length is 12.15 inches from gillnets. The 2012 year class comprised 38% of the 2019 summer Tullibee catch. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee numbers were moderate (27.50 fish/gillnet, 15.74 inches) in the 2019 fall gillnet targeted survey. Tullibee abundance was low (10.33 fish/gillnet) in the 2017 fall gillnet target survey. Tullibee abundance was moderate in the 2010 (23.8 fish/gillnet, 15.28 inches) and 2015 (19.7 fish/gillnet, 14.17 inches) fall gillnet targeted surveys, but low in 2012 (5.33 fish/gillnet) and 2014 (6.00 fish/gillnet). The Tullibee fall historical average catch rate and average length are 28.57 fish/gillnet and 15.12 inches for Koronis. The Tullibee fall catch rate in nearby Green Lake was low in 2019 (1.75 fish/gillnet, 13.94 inches), 2017 (0.50 fish/gillnet, 11.25 inches) and 2015 (10.33 fish/gillnet, 13.66 inches average length). Tullibee growth rates were slow for ages 1-6, but moderate for ages 7-8. The 2013 and 2012 year classes each comprised about 35% of the 2019 Tullibee fall catch. Tullibee year classes prior to 2014 comprised 95% of the total 2019 fall catch. The last major summerkill of Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011. Hopefully, cool summers will occur during the next several years, which may result in a good hatch and survival of Tullibee in Koronis if adequate brood stock numbers are still present. Tullibee are an important forage species for both large Northern Pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were abundant in 2019 (120.40 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 59.19 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2019 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.10 pounds and 6.02 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average length is 6.79 inches from gillnets. Yellow Perch growth rates were fair. The 2016 year class comprised 75% of the 2019 Yellow Perch survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2019 summer survey (17.00 fish/gillnet). The Walleye historical average catch rate is 10.93 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2019 Walleye average size was moderate (1.28 pounds and 14.69 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average length is 14.01 inches from gillnets. The 2019 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches and larger) Walleye was higher (7.60 fish/gillnet) than the historical average (4.49 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. Walleye growth rates were fair. The 2016 and 2017 year classes (fry stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 36% and 19% respectively of the 2019 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Walleye fry were marked with Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" in 2009 and 2011-2017 to determine the contribution of natural reproduction versus stocking. OTC marked fish (fry stocked) comprised 38%, 25%, 33%, 50%, 100% and 100% respectively of the 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011 year classes in the 2019 summer survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (0.5-2.0 million/year) were stocked during 1996 and 2001-2019 as a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the DNR statewide Walleye hatching program. Walleye fingerlings were recently stocked in 2004 (2,409 pounds, 48,180 fish), a combination of ages (2,355 pounds, 45,685 fish) were stocked in 2006, and a combination of yearlings and fingerlings (867 pounds, 4,887 fish) were stocked in the 2010. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Koronis was frequent and often adequate to sustain Walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys and markings. However, natural reproduction contribution has been more variable in recent years due in part to degraded spawning habitat and unfavorable spring conditions. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2019 (1.85 YOY/hour). Abundant yearling Walleye were captured in 2019 (13.85 fish/hour, 9.76 inches). Fair YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2018 mid-October fall electrofishing survey (20.57 YOY/hour, 7.20 inches). Abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2017 (65.60 YOY/hour, 6.03 inches). OTC marked fish accounted for 33% of the YOY Walleye catch in the 2017 fall. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2016 (14.18 YOY/hour, 6.51 inches). OTC marked fish accounted for 40% of the 2016 Fall YOY Walleye catch. Low YOY Walleye numbers (3.60 YOY/hour, 5.97 inches) were captured in 2015. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye were captured in 2014 (208.09 YOY/hour, 6.39 inches average length) and 2013 (71.25 YOY/hour, 5.79 inches average length). OTC marked fish accounted for 82% of the 2014 Walleye fingerlings captured in the fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 45% of the 2013 fall electrofishing YOY catch were OTC marked (fry stocked).  <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass numbers were low in 2019 (2.00 fish/gillnet), but comparable to the historical average catch rate of 1.77 fish/gillnet for Koronis. The 2019 Rock Bass average size was small (0.26 pounds and 6.19 inches) from gillnets. The Rock Bass historical average length is 6.95 inches from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of interest captured in 2019 included low numbers of Black Bullhead (0.00 fish/gillnet, 0.07 fish/trapnet), Common Carp (0.00 fish/gillnet, 0.87 fish/trapnet), Bigmouth Buffalo (0.07 fish/trapnet) and Channel Catfish (0.00 fish/gillnet); high numbers of Yellow Bullhead (6.20 fish/gillnet), White Sucker (6.80 fish/gillnet) and Shorthead Redhorse (4.40 fish/gillnet). The Koronis historical average catch rates for Black Bullhead are 15.61 fish/gillnet and 2.24 fish/trapnet. The Koronis historical average catch rates for Common Carp are 0.42 fish/gillnet and 1.33 fish/trapnet. The Koronis historical average catch rates for White Sucker and Shorthead Redhorse are 5.38 and 1.28 fish/gillnet respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Koronis include protecting the important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, participating in local watershed projects, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, stocking various species as needed, and stocking Walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Koronis fishery will be surveyed again for YOY Walleye in the 2020 fall and 2022 for a standard survey. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Koronis during October 4, 2023. Five electrofishing stations were sampled for a total of 40 minutes. The water temperature was 67.5 F. Clarity was good (3 feet). Submergent vegetation density was variable. We observed abundant numbers of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, White Sucker, Shiners and Yellow Perch in the 2023 fall electrofishing survey. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nKoronis is a large (2,968 acres), deep (132 feet maximum), and productive lake located primarily in Stearns County. Koronis is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Tullibee and Bluegill. Koronis receives moderate recreational use during the summer months. The largest inlet is the North Fork of the Crow River, which enters Koronis along the east shore and outlets near the southeast corner. The greatest volume of nutrient loading is delivered to Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. Water levels were generally below normal during 2020-2023. Zebra Mussels were found in 2022. An invasive algal species, starry stonewort, was found primarily in the east and outlet bays of Koronis in 2015 and near the south access of Rice Lake in 2016. Current efforts to chemically eradicate starry stonewort have been unsuccessful in Koronis. Starry Stonewort has presently spread throughout the lake. Aquatic vegetation densities are variable yearly in the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nRice Lake is upstream and connects to Lake Koronis via the North Fork of the Crow River. In the past, Walleye from both Rice and Koronis have spawned in the North Fork of the Crow River upstream of Rice Lake. A Walleye egg take station was operated just upstream of Rice Lake in the Crow River from the 1970's to 1992. However, this Walleye spawning run now appears to be considerably reduced. This is based on anecdotal observations of lower opening Walleye fishing activity near the Koronis inlet bay/narrows area especially since the 2000's and recent (2018-2019) ice out hoop netting in the river near the old egg take station. Walleye fishing activity often was higher during late ice off years at the Koronis inlet bay area due to fish returning from upriver spawning around opening weekend. Walleye also spawn adjacent to the east shores of the three islands in Koronis and the east point of Rice. Since 2001, both Rice and Koronis have been periodic \"Spicer Strain\" Walleye egg take sites for the statewide Walleye propagation program. Other recent Spicer Strain egg take lakes include Green, Diamond and Elizabeth. Historic spawning sites for Walleye in both Koronis and Rice have been degraded in recent years with increased sedimentation, algal and periphyton growth.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Koronis has been frequent and often adequate to sustain Walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys and markings. However, natural reproduction contribution has been more variable in recent years due in part to degraded spawning habitat and unfavorable spring conditions. Walleye fry (0.5-2.0 million/year) were stocked during 1996, 2001-2019 and 2021-2023 as a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the DNR statewide Walleye hatching program. No Walleye eggs were taken and no fry were stocked in 2020. Approximately 1.2 million fry were stocked during 2023. Walleye fingerlings were recently stocked in 2004 (2,409 pounds, 48,180 fish), combination of ages (2,355 pounds, 45,685 fish) were stocked in 2006, and a combination of yearlings/fingerlings (867 pounds, 4,887 fish) were stocked in the 2010. <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye numbers were abundant (120.00 YOY/hour, 7.15 inches) in the 2023 fall night electrofishing survey. Yearling numbers were low (4.5 fish/hour) in 2023. YOY Walleye numbers were moderate (39.00 YOY/hour, 6.55 inches) in the 2022 fall night electrofishing survey. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (24.00 fish/hour, 10.40 inches) in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey.

Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (22.80 fish/hour, 9.45 inches) in 2015. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye were captured in 2014 (208.09 YOY/hour, 6.39 inches average length) and 2013 (71.25 YOY/hour, 5.79 inches average length). OTC marked fish accounted for 82% of the 2014 Walleye fingerlings captured in the fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 45% of the 2013 fall electrofishing YOY catch were OTC marked (fry stocked). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (32.83 YOY/hour, 6.97 inches) were captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 92% of the 2012 year class fish captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey were OTC marked (fry stocked). Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (205.50 YOY/hour, 6.50 inches) were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 80% (164.40 YOY/hour) were OTC marked fish in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. The Koronis YOY Walleye historical average catch rate and average length are 44.68 YOY/hour and 6.68 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2022 survey gillnets (18.60 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average catch rate (11.28 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. The 2022 Walleye average weight and length were 1.58 pounds and 15.79 inches respectively from gillnets. The Walleye historical average length is 14.14 inches from gillnets. The 2022 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches and larger) Walleye (10.60 fish/gillnet) was higher than the historical average (4.92 fish/gillnet) for Koronis. Several year classes (2017, 2020 and 2021) from fry stocked and natural reproduction each comprised 20% respectively of the 2022 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Koronis include protecting the important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, participating in local watershed projects, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, stocking various species as needed, and stocking Walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Koronis fishery will be surveyed again for YOY Walleye in the 2024 fall and 2024 summer for a standard survey. <br> \n</p>",
