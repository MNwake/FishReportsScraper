This assessment sampled a trap net CPUE of 1.1 compared to 1.3 in 1981.  No white sucker were captured in the gill nets in this assessment, however.  This was the first fall trap netting conducted on this lake.  Past studies on trout lakes in Minnesota by Merle Johnson indicated a CPUE in heavily fished lakes of 1-5 trout in fall trap netting.  A trap net CPUE of 0.8 was observed in this assessment.  Growth rates of the rainbow trout are comparable to those in other trout lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kremer Lake is located north of Grand Rapids and is one of 15 lakes managed for stream trout in the Grand Rapids management area.  Kremer Lake has had a long history of being managed for stream trout dating back to 1927.  Prior to 1945 Kremer Lake was managed for trout as well as other gamefish.  Since reclamations in 1958 and 1974 the lake has been managed solely for stream trout.     The species composition of the stream trout fishery has been changed from rainbow trout to brown trout and splake.  The last stocking of rainbow trout occurred in 1995.  Brown trout yearlings were stocked in the spring of 1996 and 1998.  Yearling splake were stocked in the spring of 1997.  The brown trout catch rate of 0.8/set is the first catch index recorded in Kremer Lake for this species, so historical comparisons are not possible.  Splake catch rate was 0.3/set which is the result of one stocking in the spring of 1997.  The combined stream trout catch was 1.1/set which is below the long range goal of 1.5/set.  Brown trout varied in length from 9 to 13 inches and splake varied in length from 12 to 15 inches.    The largemouth bass population appears to have remained stable and the catch rate of 0.4/set is similar to the previous rate of 0.3/set in 1993.  The white sucker population appears to have been reduced as the catch rate dropped from 2.3/set in 1993 to 0.7/set in this assessment.  The golden shiner abundance has been reduced dramatically and none were sampled in this assessment, while 87 fish or 1.4/set were sampled in the 1993 assessment.  Predation from either largemouth bass or newly introduced trout species are likely causes for the decline.    The long term goal of at least 20% of the catch greater than 16 inches was not achieved in this assessment.   It is hoped that a greater proportion of the splake and brown trout will achieve 16 inches in length in the future by utilizing the white sucker and golden shiner as forage.  Anglers can increase the proportion of larger trout in Kremer Lake by voluntarily releasing a portion of their catch.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kremer Lake is located north of Grand Rapids along State Highway #38 in the Chippewa National Forest.  This lake has been managed as a stream trout lake since 1927 but was also populated with several warmwater gamefish species.  Chemical reclamations in 1958 and 1974 eliminated competing species so the lake could be managed solely for stream trout.   Rainbow trout was the species of choice for many years due to popularity with anglers. Fingerling and yearlings were stocked annually until 1995 to provide a consistent stream trout fishery of acceptable sized fish.  As other fish species such as white suckers, golden shiners, and largemouth bass repopulated the lake they had adverse effects on the growth and survival of rainbow trout.   Splake and brown trout were introduced to prey on white suckers and golden shiners, and to better compete with a high abundance of small largemouth bass. These species were stocked as yearlings on alternating years beginning with brown trout in 1996 and splake in 1997.  This is the second special assessment to evaluate growth and survival of these two species and to determine if the long-range goals of the 2001 management plan were achieved.  The long-range goal of the management plan was to create a stream trout fishery capable of producing quality sized brown trout and splake and would be measured by a fall trap net catch rate maintained at 1.5 trout/ net with 20% of the catch exceeding 16 inches.  For this assessment approximately 55%, or 22 of 40 brown trout, and 46%, or 6 of 13 splake exceeded 16 inches.  The catch rate aspect of the goal was not achieved as the total stream trout catch for this assessment was 0.75 trout/trap net (0.56 brown trout + 0.19 splake) nor was it achieved in the previous assessment when the catch was 1.08 trout /trap net (0.78 brown trout/net, 0.27 splake/ net, and 0.03 rainbow trout).  Since the catch rate goal has not been achieved during either of the two recent assessments this level of abundance may not be attainable. The low fertility of this lake due to low phosphorous and alkalinity levels limits trout production therefore the catch rate goal may need to be reduced. An attempt was made to determine ages and length of survival in the lake for brown trout and splake by assigning them to a particular stocked year according to their size.  A two-year gap between stockings for each species helped create gaps in the length frequency distribution. Each cluster of lengths around a certain length group represented fish from a particular stocked year.  For example ten brown trout that were grouped around the 13.0-13.99 inch range were believed to have been stocked in 2002 and therefore had survived for 1.4 years in the lake and were 2.9 years old (including 1.5 years in a state hatchery).  Twenty-six brown trout that were clustered around the 16.0-16.99 inch group were suspected to be survivors from the yearlings stocked in 2000 and would be 4.9 years old. (1.5 years in a hatchery + 3.4 years in the lake). The remaining 4 brown trout that were clustered around the 19.0-19.99-inch group were probably survivors from the yearlings stocked in 1998 and would be 6.9 years old. (1.5 years in a hatchery + 5.4 years in the lake).  Since the expected life span of brown trout is 5 to 6 years, occasionally 7 or 8 years, no fish would be expected to have survived from the introductory stocking in 1996, as they would have been 8.9 years old.  Growth for these brown trout appear to be similar to what has been observed in Lucky Lake, a remote lake in close proximity to Kremer Lake.  Thirteen splake were also captured and also assigned ages according to their size.  Six of the smallest splake that ranged from 7.5 - 11.5 inches were believed to have originated from the yearlings stocked in 2003 (2002 year class) and were 1.8 years old (1.3 years in a hatchery + .5 years in the lake).  The remaining seven splake that were clustered around the 16.0-16.99 inch group were suspected to be survivors from the yearlings stocked in 2001 that were 3.8 years old (1.3 years in the hatchery+ 2.5 years in the lake).  Since the largest splake was only 17 inches no fish were suspected to have originated from the 1999 or 1997 stocked years and would have been 5.8 and 7.8 years old, respectively.  Reasons for their absence are unclear and may be due to intense angler harvest within the first year after they were stocked. Lifespan for splake are unknown but individual fish up to ten years old have been caught in other area lakes. A temperature and dissolved oxygen profile was conducted in mid August.  A thermocline occurred between 20 to 35 feet where water temperatures cooled rapidly from 70.2?F to 46.8?F.   Dissolved oxygen levels were suitable for stream trout (?5.0 ppm) down to 36 feet or at the bottom of the thermocline. Largemouth bass and white suckers were also captured during this assessment at catch rates of 0.44 and 0.57 fish/ trap net, respectively, which are similar the 1998 assessment.  Golden shiners have not been caught in the last two assessments, which correlates with the introduction of splake and brown trout. Four minnow traps were set and no fish were caught. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kremer Lake has been managed for stream trout since 1927 when trout were first stocked on top of natural populations of warm water fish species.  The lake was chemically reclaimed in 1958 and again in 1974 to eliminate warm water species that would compete with stream trout.  Rainbow trout, a species popular with anglers, were stocked annually with fingerlings and/or yearlings.  Growth and survival of rainbow trout was adversely affected by the resurgence of white suckers and largemouth bass, due to competition for a limited food supply in a lake with very low fertility. It was noted in the 1993 population assessment that many of the rainbow trout did not appear as plump as fish in other area    lakes.  Subsequently, it was decided to introduce splake and brown trout, which are considered more piscivorous at larger sizes to prey on the increasingly abundant undesirable fish species.  Each species was stocked as yearlings in separate years at recommended rates of 50 fish/acre.   <br> \n <br> \nThis is the third population assessment to evaluate the performance of splake and brown trout and determine if the long range goal of the 2005 management plan was being achieved.  The long range goal was to maintain a stream trout fishery capable of producing quality sized (>16 inches) splake and brown trout and to maintain a population that yields a fall trap net catch of at least 1.5 trout per net with 20% of the catch exceeding 16 inches.  The combined catch rate for this assessment, 0.70 trout/trap net (0.5 for brown trout, 0.2 for splake), fell short of the long range goal for the third consecutive assessment. However the proportion of quality-sized fish greater than 16 inches was achieved in this assessment as forty (40%) percent of the trap netted brown trout (N=10 trout) and forty-two (42%) percent of the gill netted brown trout (N=14) exceeded 16 inches. Also the mean length of all brown trout from trap nets was 16.0 inches and 16.1 inches for one gill net set. This was the second consecutive assessment where the size structure goal was met or exceeded.   <br> \n <br> \nFour splake were sampled in this assessment and they were all captured in trap nets. The three splake in the 13.00-13.99-length group were most likely from the stocked yearlings this spring (2008), and the larger splake from the 16.0-16.99-length group was most likely stocked as a yearling the previous year (2007). <br> \n   <br> \nScale samples were collected from gill net captured brown trout and ages were determined from 13 of the 14 fish.   All brown trout were either age-2 or age-3.  The fish came from yearling stocked in the springs of 2006 and 2007 therefore they had survived either one and one half or two and one half years in the lake.  The age-2 brown trout ranged from 14.1 to 17.9 inches while the age-3 fish ranged from 14.3 to 16.7 inches indicating good growth for the first year and one half in the lake but slowed dramatically the second year.  All brown trout were gravid with either eggs or sperm indicating they had attained sexual maturity. Temperature and dissolved oxygen levels were measured in mid-August and revealed a thermocline occurred between 21 and 41 feet where water temperatures dropped rapidly from 71.4 to 43.3 degrees F. Dissolved oxygen levels above 5.0 ppm that is deemed the minimum to sustain stream trout occurred down to a water depth of 41 feet.  <br> \n   <br> \nAdditional undesirable fish species that have repopulated the lake since the last reclamation and captured in this assessment included white suckers and largemouth bass.  Gill nets and trap nets captured 10 largemouth bass ranging from 5.0 to 13.8 inches and 16 white suckers ranging from 16.8 to 22.6 inches. This was the third consecutive assessment where golden shiners were absent which correlates with the introduction of brown trout and splake.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo minnow trap sets yielded no fish. <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
