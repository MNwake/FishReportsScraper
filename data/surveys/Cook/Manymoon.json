Access to the lake was too difficult to allow its use as a walleye rearing pond, and the lake was probably too shallow to support a permanent game fish or panfish population.  The lake does provide a good example of a 'fishless' lake type that has become rare as Fisheries management has converted many previously 'fishless' lakes in the area to stream trout or rearing pond management.</p>",
