                "narrative": "<p>Child Lake is a 316-acre lake located near Longville, MN. The lake has 4.56 miles of shoreline with a maximum depth of 29 feet.  There is a user developed earthen access on state owned land on the south shore off Cass County Highway 5. Child Lake is also accessible from Woman Lake through the Boy River. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Child Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are regularly shaped, clear, hard water lakes. A 24- to 36-inch protected slot regulation for northern pike was implemented in 2003 and a muskellunge minimum length of 48 inches was implemented in 2007. Both of these regulations included Woman (DOW# 11-201), Little Woman (DOW # 11-265), Girl (DOW # 11-174) and Child (DOW # 11-174) lakes because of a navigable connection through the Boy River. <br> \n <br> \nThe best angling opportunities on Child Lake are for northern pike, bluegill, largemouth bass, and walleye. Northern pike were moderately abundant compared to other Lake Class 31 lakes. Northern pike mean length was 19 inches and fish up to 33 inches were sampled. Bluegill abundance was below average for Lake Class 31 lakes. Bluegill mean length was 6 inches with fish 8 inches in length or greater present. Largemouth bass mean length was near 14 inches and the lengths ranged from 9 to 20 inches.  Muskellunge were not sampled in this survey, but are present in Child Lake.  Walleye abundance was low but similar to previous assessments dating back to 1959 and was similar to what can be expected in Lake Class 31 lakes. Walleye mean length was near 16 inches and the lengths ranged from 12 to 21 inches. Black crappie numbers appeared to be down compared to previous years. Yellow perch were small with an average length of 6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish (bluegill x pumpkinseed), pumpkinseed, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Birch Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Child Lake is a 285-acre lake located 9 miles east of Hackensack, MN. The lake has 4.56 miles of shoreline with a maximum depth of 29 feet. There is a primitive, user-developed earthen access on state-owned land on the south shore off Cass County Highway 5. Child Lake is also accessible from Woman Lake through the Boy River. The Boy River connects Child Lake to Little Woman, Woman, and Girl lakes. There are no barriers to fish movement between Child, Little Woman, Woman, and Girl lakes. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Child Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear and productive with moderate depth. Other Class 31 lakes in the Walker area include Little Webb (DOW# 11-0387), May (DOW# 11-0482), Ox Yoke (11-0355) and Welsh (DOW# 11-0493). The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch and secondarily for Muskellunge, Cisco (Tullibee) and Walleye. A 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit was implemented in 2003 to improve the size structure of the Northern Pike population. The purpose of this survey was to evaluate Walleye fry stocking and the status of Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch populations using gill nets only. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were moderately abundant. The Northern Pike gill net catch rate of 7.7 fish per net was within the management goal of between 5 and 10 fish per net.  Northern Pike averaged 18 inches long with fish up to 32 inches long in the sample. The proportion of Northern Pike greater than 24 inches long of seven percent was below the management goal of ten percent.  Walleye are present in low numbers and an angler may catch one on occasion. The Walleye gill net catch rate of 1.5 fish per net was below the management goal of four fish per gill net. Walleye gill net catch rates in Child Lake have never exceeded three fish per net and have not increased in response to Walleye fry stocking. Yellow Perch numbers have dropped from near 12 fish per gill net in 2008 to a historic low of one fish per gill net in 2020, which was below the management goal of five fish per net. Child Lake is best known for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass. Small Black Crappie were present in good numbers from the 2020 gill nets. In two to three years these fish will reach 10 inches in length and provide good angling opportunities. Though gill nets are not the preferred gear to sample Bluegill, fish over 7 inches long and up to 9 inches were present.  Only a few Largemouth Bass were sampled and were small averaging 12 inches long. Previous spring electrofishing surveys showed a moderately abundant Largemouth Bass population with fish over 16 inches long present in the lake. On occasion, Muskellunge up to or exceeding 50 inches in length could be encountered. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently the aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Child Lake are the rusty crayfish and purple loosestrife. Curly Leaf Pondweed and Eurasian Watermilfoil are documented in Girl Lake and likely present throughout the Woman Lake chain. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

Child Lake belongs to Lake Class 31.  Other area lakes in the same lake class are:  Widow (1.5 milessouth), Little Webb (3.5 miles northwest), and Horseshoe (6 miles south) Lakes.Game fish species sampled in the nets included walleye, northern pike, bluegill, pumpkinseed, rock bass, blackcrappie, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.Walleye were caught at a rate slightly below what was typically found in lake class 31 lakes.  These walleyeshad a wide range of lengths and good growth.  Northern pike was the most abundant predator.  Although the northernpike were generally small good natural reproduction and growth were indicated.  Bluegill were of quality size andalso displayed good growth.Other species captured include cisco, white sucker, black, brown, and yellow bullheads.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Child Lake is a 316-acre lake with a maximum depth of 29 feet.  The lake is located ten miles east of Hackensack.    The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Child Lake is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include: Five Point, Ox Yoke, Sanburn, and Widow Lakes.  Approximately 50% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth. There is a user developed public access located on county land adjacent to County Road 5.  Access from Woman Lake via the Boy River is also possible. Child Lake provides good fishing for northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  Walleye fishing can be good at times. The lake is managed primarily for northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.Because the Boy River flows through Child Lake, the abundance of some fish species  can vary during out the year.  For example, in the spring, two to three thousand walleye migrate through Child Lake on their spawning run.  Walleye abundance during the summer is typical of other lakes in lake class 31 and similar to past surveys.  Between 1980 and 1993 walleye were stocked. However, walleye abundance did not increase.  Walleye that exist in Child Lake are the result of natural reproduction and/or migration from other lakes.   Walleye are as abundant or more abundant now with no walleye stocking as they were when stocking was being done.As with walleye, northern pike abundance is influenced by migration in and out of Child Lake.  Summer abundance of northern pike was similar to other lake class 31 lakes and past surveys.  The average size of northern pike is small, however, there is ample opportunity for anglers to catch a 30+ inch fish.  There were eight different ages (year classes) found in sampled fish indicating consistent natural reproduction.    With the presence of white sucker, cisco, and yellow perch, there appears to be adequate food fish available. The quality of bluegill sampled has changed very little since the first survey.  Quality size bluegill are present in Child Lake.  To maintain such good quality, anglers need to use some restraint if large bluegill are really biting.  Release the larger bluegill and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size bluegill have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.  Growth was good with an age four bluegill being 5.3 inches in length.  In order for a bluegill to be a half pound, they need to live eight years.  Muskellunge, although not sampled, have been caught by anglers in Child Lake.  Even though largemouth bass and black crappie were sampled in low numbers, fishing for these species is good.  Fish sampled showed good quality.Although they make up a small portion of the angler catch, rock bass, bullheads, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker add to the diverse fish community that exists in Child Lake.There has been considerable lakeshore development on Child Lake.  In 1959 DNR personnel counted 21 lake homes.  In 1998 that number had increased to 49.  This development has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  Lakeshore that is not currently developed is some of the most sensitive and important shoreline for maintaining water quality and fish habitat.  These shorelines and shallow water areas with their aquatic plants, help protect the lakeshore  from erosion and absorb nutrients and pollutants as well as provide excellent places for wildlife and fish to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Child Lake is also needed to maintain water quality.  Based on the increasing value of lakeshore in this area, there will be much demand to develop the remaining lakeshore on Child Lake.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Information obtained from DNR creel surveys on area lakes such as Woman and Ten Mile Lakes show that less than 20% of the walleye 20 inches or larger caught by anglers were being released.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the quality of the fish population and provide anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.  The same can be said for other species of fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Child Lake is an 316-acre lake located near Longville, MN that has 3.7 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 29 feet.  There is a state owned user developed earthen public access on the south shore just off of County Road 5.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Child Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are regularly shaped hardwater lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass and secondarily for muskellunge, walleye, tullibee (cisco), and yellow perch.  A 24- to 36-inch protected slot for northern pike was implemented in 2003.    Northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass were present in Child Lake, however the abundance of these species as measured by summer MNDNR test netting catches was somewhat lower than other Lake Class 31 waters.  Northern pike up to 23 inches were sampled.  Bluegill were present with fish up to 9 inches sampled and the mean length was 6 inches.  Black crappie up to 12 inches were sampled and a majority of the fish were in the 9- and 10-inch categories.  Spring sampling was conducted and the bluegill and black crappie were abundant   Few largemouth bass were present, but fish up 18 inches were sampled.  However, plenty of habitat is available to sustain a largemouth bass population.  Other fish species that are available to anglers to catch are black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.   Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Child Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Child Lake is a 285-acre lake located 9 miles east of Hackensack, MN. The lake has 4.56 miles of shoreline with a maximum depth of 29 feet. There is a primitive, user-developed earthen access on state-owned land on the south shore off Cass County Highway 5. Child Lake is also accessible from Woman Lake through the Boy River. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Child Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear and productive with moderate depth. Other Lake Class 31 lakes in the Walker area include Bowen, Child, Five Point, Little Webb, Ox Yoke, Sanborn, Welsh, and Widow. A 24- to 36-inch protected slot limit for Northern Pike was implemented in 2003 to increase the number fish larger than 24 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of this survey was to assess the status of Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations in Child Lake. Eighteen Largemouth Bass were sampled. The average length was 11 inches and fish up to 17 inches were sampled. Only two Smallmouth Bass, one 10 inches long and the other 16 inches long, were also sampled. Smallmouth Bass are abundant in Woman Lake, which is directly connected to Child Lake through the Boy River.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently the aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Child Lake are the rusty crayfish and purple loosestrife. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Child Lake is a 285-acre lake located near Longville, MN. The lake has 4.56 miles of shoreline with a maximum depth of 29 feet. There is a user-developed earthen access on state-owned land on the south shore off Cass County Highway 5. Child Lake is also accessible from Woman Lake through the Boy River. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Child Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear, productive, and moderate depth. Child Lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass, and secondarily for Muskellunge, Walleye, Tullibee (Cisco), and Yellow Perch. A 24- to 36-inch protected slot regulation on Northern Pike was implemented in 2003 with the objective of increasing size structure. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were highly abundant compared to other Class 31 lakes. Northern Pike mean length was 20 inches and fish up to 34 inches were sampled. A large portion of the Northern Pike population consisted of fish from the 2010 and 2011 year classes. These fish should be available for harvest the next few years. Bluegill were not abundant when compared to similar lakes. Bluegill mean length was 6 inches and fish up to 9 inches long were captured. Low densities and large size structure should present quality angling opportunities for the foreseeable future. Yellow Perch were similar in abundance to past years, but size structure was larger than past years. Fish averaged 7 inches long and individuals up to 10 inches in length were sampled. Low density populations exist for Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Muskellunge, and Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, And Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently the aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Child Lake are the rusty crayfish and purple loosestrife. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Child Lake was conducted on August 10-12, 2021, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured 10 species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Bowfin comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Child Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

The assessment consisted of 37 survey sites evenly spaced every 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 80.5 (+/- 3.2) out of 100 possible. Approximately 35 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 64.5 (+/- 7.0), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 89.2 (+/- 1.0).</p>",
