                "narrative": "<p>Detroit Lake is a 3,067-acre body of water within the city limits of Detroit Lakes.  It is made up two basins-Little Detroit and Big Detroit-that are separated by a shallow gravel bar.  A channel on the north end of the gravel bar allows boats to travel back and forth between the two basins.  The Little Detroit basin is approximately 1,000 acres and has a maximum depth of 16 feet.  As its name implies, Big Detroit is larger at over 2,000 acres, and has a maximum depth of 89 feet. <br> \n   <br> \nA channel also exists under South Shore Drive and allows boaters to travel into Deadshot Bay (Curfman Lake).  This channel is a popular shorefishing spot for anglers.  Curfman Lake is just over 120 acres in size with a maximum depth of 24 feet.  Although Curfman Lake is technically its own public water basin, Detroit Lake and Curfman Lake are managed as one water body. <br> \n <br> \nIn the initial phases of the larger effort to restore Lake Sturgeon to the Red River Basin, sub-adult Lake Sturgeon were transplanted from the Rainy River to Detroit Lake in 1997 and 1998.  Fingerling stockings have occurred annually since 2004, with no stockings occurring in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions.  This targeted survey was conducted in October 2021 to evaluate the success of these stocking efforts.  Gill nets with large mesh were used to target Lake Sturgeon and minimize the catch of other fish species. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 104 Lake Sturgeon were captured during this survey, indicating a robust population exists in Detroit Lake.  Sturgeon had a mean length of 52 inches , with the smallest sturgeon sampled being 29 inches long and the largest individual being 67 inches long.  Fish of multiple size classes were present, with a majority of the distribution between 46 and 58 inches.  Fish from the 1997 to 1998 transplant stockings were also found. On average, these fish have grown almost 33 inches since being stocked into Lake Detroit.  <br> \n <br> \nThese results demonstrate a healthy sturgeon population in Detroit Lake.  Anglers can target Lake Sturgeon during a catch-and-release season that is open from March 1 to April 14.  A closed season exists from April 15 to June 15, in order to protect these fish while they are spawning.  If anglers encounter a tagged Lake Sturgeon, they are encouraged to measure the fish, release it quickly, and report the tag number to the Detroit Lakes Fisheries Office at (218)-846-8290.  Tagged fish reports can also be submitted at the website below.  In addition, if anyone encounters several Lake Sturgeon splashing in shallow water in the spring, please contact the Detroit Lakes Fisheries Office. <br> \n <br> \nThese tag reports and future surveys will be used to continue to monitor the Lake Sturgeon population in Detroit Lake and the Red River Basin. <br> \nhttps://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/tagged_fish_reporting/index.html</p>",

Muskellunge were first introduced into Detroit Lake in 1989.  Directed Muskellunge surveys began on Detroit Lake in 1993.  Thirteen surveys had been conducted prior to 2019.  This assessment was the first year of a planned two year project to estimate the number of adult Muskellunge in Detroit Lake.  The goal for this assessment was to capture and mark as many fish as possible. Data from these two years will be used to calculate a population estimate of adult Muskellunge in Detroit Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nLarge frame trap nets captured 139 individual Muskellunge, for a catch rate of 1.46 fish per net.  Forty female and 98 male Muskellunge were captured.  Lengths of these fish ranged from 34.4 to 53.2 inches and averaged 43.7 inches.  Female and male Muskellunge sizes in 2019 ranged from 40.6 to 53.2 inches long and 34.4 to 47.2 inches long, respectively.  Female Muskellunge averaged an impressive 48.7 inches.  Mean weight of all Muskellunge was 19.97 pounds.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Detroit, including Deadshot Bay (Curfman Lake), is a 3,067-acre, class-22 lake within the city limits of Detroit Lakes.  The lake is mesotrophic, bordering on eutrophic, with an average trophic state index in the upper forties.  This study, like most previous fish assessments, groups data from all three connected basins, Curfman Lake and Big and Little Detroit Lakes.  Curfman Lake, a 116 acre bay, is separated from Big Detroit by an approximately 150 ft wide, 20 ft deep channel.  Little Detroit, which covers approximately 1,000 acres and is 16 ft deep at its maximum, is separated from Big Detroit by a long, shallow gravel bar with a dredged boat channel near its northeast end.  The lake's primary inlet and outlet, the Pelican River, enters the north shore of Big Detroit and exits the southwest shore of Little Detroit.  The Pelican River supports spawning runs for Northern Pike, Walleye, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate in 2015 of 9.2 Northern Pike per gill net was similar to the historic average for Detroit Lake (nine Northern Pike per gill net).  The mean length of sampled Northern Pike from gill nets in 2015 was 20.4 inches with a size range from 11 to 31.7 inches.  Almost 22% of Northern Pike caught in gill nets were greater than or equal to 24 inches long.  Northern Pike up to seven years old were sampled, with most fish being 2 to 5 years old.  Growth rates for Northern Pike in Detroit Lake were considered normal when compared to both statewide and historic Detroit Lake rates.  On average, Northern Pike that were four years old were found to be just over 20 inches long.    <br> \n <br> \nDespite several different Walleye stocking regimens, likely increased fishing pressure, and sporadic naturally reproduced year classes, the Walleye population in Detroit Lake has remained relatively stable with a lake historical catch rate of 7.2 Walleye per gill net.  This latest survey showed that this remains to be true, as the catch rate of Walleye in gill nets in 2015 was slightly higher than the historic average at 8.3 Walleye per gill net.  Walleye abundance is primarily the result of stocking, with annual stocking of fingerlings occurring since 2005.  Walleye lengths in gill nets ranged from 9.8 to 24.8 inches with an average length of 17.2 inches.  Four-year-old Walleye were found to be most abundant, but one fish was captured that was estimated to be 17 years old and just over 27 inches long.  Walleye growth rates were found to be similar to past surveys and statewide indices with the average Walleye reaching a length of 14.1 inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nNo muskies were sampled in gill nets or trap nets, but a muskie assessment was completed on Detroit Lake during spring 2015.  After approximately thirteen days of sampling in 2015, the assessment captured 85 individual fish which was fewer than the all-time high of 125 muskies captured in 2011.  The muskie population is primarily maintained through stocking fingerlings in odd numbered years.  Muskies captured in 2015 averaged 43.4 inches long and consisted of 27 females (37.9-52.8 inches long) and 58 males (34.3-50.4 inches long).  The percent of muskies 50 inches or greater was 13% in 2015, compared to 19% in 2011.   <br> \n <br> \nMid-summer gill net catch rates for Yellow Perch in Detroit Lake have consistently been low compared to similar lakes in the state.   Detroit Lake's historic mean is 6.4 Yellow Perch per gill net.  In 2015, however, the Yellow Perch catch rate remained above the historic mean at 14.3 per gill net.  This is a decrease from the 2011 survey when a historic high 23.7 Yellow Perch per gill net set were captured.  Yellow Perch sampled in gill nets in 2015 averaged 6.9 inches in length with few fish over nine inches. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catches of Bluegill in Detroit Lake increased slightly from 26.6 per net in 2011 to 27.9 fish per net during this survey in 2015.  Although these numbers are still below the lake's historic average of 51.5 Bluegills per trap net, gill net catches of Bluegill were relatively high at 33.2 per net.  Size distributions for Bluegills caught in gill and trap nets were roughly similar and lengths ranged from 0.8 to 8.4 inches with an average length of 6.0 inches.  Bluegills from two years old to eight years old were found, providing evidence that good spawning conditions and recruitment exist in Detroit Lake.  However, the sharp decline in the number of fish over age five indicates heavy angling harvest.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch of 0.8 fish per trap net was slightly above the lake's historic average of 0.6 bass per net.  Largemouth Bass sampled in trap nets ranged from 5.9 to 18.8 inches long with a mean of 11.4 inches.  Seven age groups were found with the 2011 year class the most abundant.  The Largemouth Bass growth rate of 11.4 inches by four years old was similar to Detroit Lake's historic average.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trap net catches averaged 1.0 fish per set in 2015, which was similar to the catch rate in 2011 (0.5 per net) and Detroit Lake's historic average (0.5 per net).  The average size of Black Crappie sampled in trap nets in 2015 was 8.5 inches and had a growth rate of 8.3 inches by the time they were four years old.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon were initially reintroduced in Detroit Lake in 1997 and an annual stocking regimen continues today utilizing fingerlings stocked in the fall.  Although eleven Lake Sturgeon were captured in gill nets in 2011, only two Lake Sturgeon were captured in gill nets in 2015.  These sturgeon were 34.8 inches and 35.2 inches long and eight years old (2007 year class).  Two Lake Sturgeon were also observed during spring electrofishing operations, one of which was captured and measured to be 38.6 inches and the other was believed to be larger than 50 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSeveral other fish species were found in the diverse and productive fish community in Detroit Lake.  These species included all three species of bullhead, Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.    One species that was conspicuous by its absence was Cisco (Tullibee) which was formerly a significant part of the fish community in this lake as recently as 1994.  None have been sampled during the past three assessments.  Dissolved oxygen and temperature profiles  suggest that conditions are not favorable for this species and it remains to be seen whether water quality can be improved enough to once again sustain Cisco in Detroit Lake or whether they are still present in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWith continuing shoreline and watershed development, this diverse, productive, and valuable fishery will need help on several fronts to be sustained.  Anglers can help to maintain balance in fish populations by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium and large fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.  This is particularly true for northern pike and bluegill.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, by taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and by using wise land management practices.   <br> \n</p>",

Muskellunge were first introduced into Detroit Lake in 1989.  Directed Muskellunge surveys began on Detroit Lake in 1993.  Fourteen surveys had been conducted prior to 2023.  This assessment was the first year of a planned two year project to estimate the number of adult Muskellunge in Detroit Lake.  The goal for this assessment was to capture and mark as many fish as possible. Data from these two years will be used to calculate a population estimate of adult Muskellunge in Detroit Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nLarge frame trap nets captured 89 individual Muskellunge, for a catch rate of 1.27 fish per net.  Twenty six female and 62 male Muskellunge were captured.  Female and male Muskellunge sizes in 2023 ranged from 36.9 to 53.1 inches long and 29.6 to 46.7 inches long, respectively.  Female Muskellunge averaged 46.5 inches.  Mean weight of all Muskellunge was 16.7 pounds.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Detroit Lake has a variety of fish habitats and the fish community reflects that diversity.  This fishery has included warm water species like bullheads and panfish, coldwater species like walleye, and even coldwater species like tullibee.  However, warm water temperatures in the well-oxygenated layers likely stressed ciscoes in 2003 and 2007.  Coldwater fish species require both cool temperatures and good levels of dissolved oxygen and, when both are not present together, there is often a die-off of those species.  No tullibee were sampled during the 2007 mid summer study.  Two potential trophy species are also present in these waters. <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake strain muskellunge were first stocked in Detroit Lake in 1989.  Fishing opportunities now exist in this lake for catching muskies over fifty inches long and weighing well over thirty pounds.  Recent publicity and excellent fishing have made this lake a very popular destination for muskie anglers throughout the state and region. <br> \n <br> \nA century ago, Detroit Lake was known to harbor lake sturgeon weighing over 100 pounds.  Historical accounts from the Detroit newspaper document angler catches of these giants in the late 1800's and early 1900's.  Stream fragmentation (dam building), over fishing, and water quality degradation resulted in the loss of this long-lived and slow maturing fish species from Detroit Lake and the entire Red River watershed.  Several steps have been taken to reverse this condition and restore the fishery including modifications of dams to make them passable by fish, various water quality improvements, and restrictive fishing regulations.  In addition, lake sturgeon reintroductions began in Detroit Lake and a few other Red River watershed locations in 1997.  Some of these sturgeon have recently been found during test netting and electrofishing in Detroit.  Also, there have been two reports of anglers catching and releasing lake sturgeon during recent years.  There is currently no sturgeon harvest allowed in Detroit Lake because of the length of time it takes for sturgeon to become sexually mature (approximately 15-25 years).  However, the potential exists to catch fish over 100 pounds in this lake within decades. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fishing continues to be very popular in Detroit Lake.  Walleye test net catches have been remarkably stable since 1970, but have declined in 2007.  A relatively strong 1999 year class still contributes to angler catches.  These fish are now over 20 inches long.  In addition, three moderately strong year classes from 2003 through 2005 will probably be contributing more to angler catches in the next couple of years.  Walleye are stocking at a rate of 1 pound per littoral acre (1895 lbs) annually.  Natural reproduction occurs periodically but not frequently enough to sustain the walleye fishery in Detroit Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches were abundant, but large bluegills (those over eight inches) were not found in 2003 or 2007 (most recent studies) and are considered rare in this lake.  Bluegills are slow growing in Detroit and it is believed that most bluegills reaching seven inches or longer are soon harvested by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass, black crappie, northern pike and other species continue to be important parts of the fishery in this lake.  Northern pike were larger on average in 2007 than at any time in the recorded history of Detroit Lake.  Although trophy pike remain rare, three to five pound fish are definitely more common in recent years.  With continuing shoreline and watershed development, this diverse, productive, and valuable fishery will need help on several fronts to be sustained.  Anglers can help to maintain balance in fish populations by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium and large fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.  This is particularly true for northern pike.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, and by using wise land management practices.  It is not known whether water quality can be improved enough to once again sustain a tullibee fishery in Detroit Lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Detroit Lake has a variety of fish habitats and the fish community reflects that diversity.  This fishery has included warm water species like bullheads and panfish, coolwater species like walleye, and even coldwater species like tullibee.  However, warm water temperatures in the well-oxygenated layers likely stressed ciscoes (tullibee) in 2003 and 2007.  Coldwater fish species require both cool temperatures and good levels of dissolved oxygen and, when both are not present together, there is often a die-off of those species.  No tullibee were sampled during either the 2007 or 2011 mid summer studies.  Two potential trophy species are also present in these waters. <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake strain muskellunge were first stocked in Detroit Lake in 1989.  Fishing opportunities now exist in this lake for catching muskies over fifty inches long and weighing well over thirty pounds.  Recent publicity and excellent fishing have made this lake a very popular destination for muskie anglers from throughout the state and region. <br> \n <br> \nA century ago, Detroit Lake was known to harbor lake sturgeon weighing over 100 pounds.  Historical accounts from the Detroit newspaper document angler catches of these giants in the late 1800's and early 1900's.  Stream fragmentation (dam building), over fishing, and water quality degradation resulted in the loss of this long-lived and slow maturing fish species from Detroit Lake and the entire Red River watershed.  Several steps have been taken to reverse this condition and restore the fishery including modifications of dams to make them passable by fish, various water quality improvements, and restrictive fishing regulations.  In addition, lake sturgeon reintroductions began in Detroit Lake and a few other Red River watershed locations in 1997.  Some of these sturgeon have recently been found during test netting and electrofishing in Detroit.  Also, there have been two reports of anglers catching and releasing lake sturgeon during recent years.  There is currently no sturgeon harvest allowed in Detroit Lake because of the length of time it takes for sturgeon to become sexually mature (approximately 15-25 years).  However, the potential exists to catch fish over 100 pounds in this lake within decades. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fishing continues to be very popular in Detroit Lake.  Walleye test net catches have been remarkably stable since 1970, except for a decline four years ago which has now reversed itself.  Nine different year classes of walleyes were sampled, but the most abundant was the 2008 (age three) which should provide good fishing in the near future.  Walleye are stocked at a rate of one pound per littoral acre (1895 lbs) annually to supplement natural reproduction.  Natural reproduction occurs periodically but not frequently enough to sustain the walleye fishery in Detroit Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches were down somewhat, but they are still relatively abundant compared to other ecologically similar lakes.  Large bluegills (those over eight inches) were found in very modest numbers in 2011.  Bluegills have historically been slow growing in Detroit and it is believed that most bluegills reaching seven inches or longer are soon harvested by anglers.  With the recent decline in abundance, however, bluegill growth rates appear to have increased.  It still takes about six years to grow an eight-inch bluegill in Detroit Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass, black crappie, northern pike and other species continue to be important parts of the fishery in this lake.  Northern pike were larger on average in 2007 than at any time in the recorded history of Detroit Lake.  Four years later average pike size has reverted to a more \"normal\" range for this lake.  The average length of pike in this young population was 18.8 inches in 2011.  With continuing shoreline and watershed development, this diverse, productive, and valuable fishery will need help on several fronts to be sustained.  Anglers can help to maintain balance in fish populations by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium and large fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.  This is particularly true for northern pike and bluegill.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, by taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and by using wise land management practices.  It is not known whether water quality can be improved enough to once again sustain a tullibee fishery in Detroit Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Detroit Lake is a 3,067-acre body of water within the city limits of Detroit Lakes.  It is made up two basins-Little Detroit and Big Detroit-that are separated by a shallow gravel bar.  A channel on the north end of the gravel bar allows boats to travel back and forth between the two basins.  The Little Detroit basin is approximately 1,000 acres and has a maximum depth of 16 feet.  As its name implies, Big Detroit is larger at over 2,000 acres, and has a maximum depth of 89 feet. <br> \n   <br> \nA channel also exists under South Shore Drive and allows boaters to travel into Deadshot Bay (Curfman Lake).  This channel is a popular shorefishing spot for anglers.  Curfman Lake is just over 120 acres in size with a maximum depth of 24 feet.  Although Curfman Lake is technically its own public water basin, Detroit Lake and Curfman Lake are managed as one water body. <br> \n <br> \nIn a large effort to restore Lake Sturgeon to the Red River Basin, initial Lake Sturgeon stockings occurred in the late 1990's and have occurred annually since 2004.  This targeted survey was conducted in early October 2018 to evaluate the success of these stocking efforts.  Gill nets with large mesh were used to target Lake Sturgeon and minimize the catch of other fish species.  Lake Sturgeon that were captured were measured, had part of their fin removed to obtain an estimate of their age, and tagged with internal and external tags.  <br> \n  <br> \nA total of 50 Lake Sturgeon were captured during this survey, indicating a robust population exists in Detroit Lake.  Sturgeon had a mean length of 49.8 inches, with the smallest sturgeon sampled being 21.5 inches long and the largest individual being almost 65 inches long.  Fish of multiple ages were present, from four-year-old Lake Sturgeon to a 35-year-old sturgeon.   <br> \n <br> \nThree Lake Sturgeon were found to have tags from their initial stocking in 1997.  The smallest was 58.5 inches long at time of capture in 2018, was 27 inches long when it was stocked, and was estimated to be 26 years old.  Another was almost 63 inches long when it was captured, was 24 inches long when it was stocked, and estimated to be 25 years old.  The largest recapture (and the largest sturgeon encountered during the survey), was a fish that was 64.7 inches long, was 38 inches long when it was stocked, and was estimated to possibly be up to 35 years old. <br> \n   <br> \nThese results show there is a healthy sturgeon population in Detroit Lake.  Anglers can target Lake Sturgeon during a catch-and-release season that is open from March 1 to April 14.  A closed season exists from April 15 to June 15, in order to protect these fish while they are spawning.  The size and ages of these Lake Sturgeon suggest they are becoming mature and soon will begin looking to reproduce.  If anglers encounter a tagged Lake Sturgeon, they are encouraged to measure the fish, release it quickly, and report the tag number to the Detroit Lakes Fisheries Office.  These tag reports and future surveys will be used to continue to monitor the Lake Sturgeon population in Detroit Lake and the Red River Basin.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Detroit is a 3,067-acre, class-22 lake within the city limits of Detroit Lakes.  Visually, the lake has three parts-Big Detroit, Little Detroit, and Curfman Lake (a.k.a., Deadshot Bay).  Curfman Lake is a 120 acre lake that is separated from Big Detroit by an approximately 150 feet wide by 20 feet deep channel.  Little Detroit, which covers approximately 1,000 acres and is 16 feet deep at its maximum, is separated from Big Detroit by a long, shallow gravel bar with a dredged boat channel near its northeast end.  Big Detroit, which is the main basin, is over 2,000 acres in size and has a maximum depth of 89 feet.  This survey, like most previous fish surveys, treats all three connected basins as one lake.  The lake's primary inlet and outlet, the Pelican River, enters the north shore of Big Detroit and exits the southwest shore of Little Detroit.  The Pelican River supports spawning runs for Northern Pike, Walleye, and White Sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Northern Pike in 2019 was 11.5 pike per net, similar to the lake's historical average.  The average pike sampled measured 19.5 inches, with collected pike ranging in size from about 11 to 32 inches.  Only 15% of sampled pike were equal to or larger than 24 inches, indicating an abundance of small-moderately sized fish.  This is a common occurrence in lakes located in the north-central zone of the state.  The Northern Pike regulations implemented in 2018 aim to enhance size structure and reduce the number of small pike in lakes facing these types of management challenges.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Detroit Lake has remained stable, withstanding high fishing pressure and sporadic naturally reproduced year classes.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked into Detroit Lake annually since 2005.  Average catch rate of Walleye in the 2019 survey was 10.8 fish per net, slightly above the lake's historical average.  Walleye caught in 2019 ranged in length from 7 to 27 inches, with the average Walleye caught measuring about 17 inches.  Good size structure of fish was observed, with dominant catch rates of quality sized fish between 13 and 22 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSummer catch rates of Yellow Perch in Detroit Lake have remained consistently low, with roughly 4 perch caught per gill net in 2019.  Perch ranged in length from 5.5 to 8.5 inches, with the average perch caught measuring 6.5 inches.  A primary forage species, Yellow Perch densities often fluctuate in a lake based on inconsistent reproduction and predation pressure. <br> \n <br> \nThe Muskellunge population in Detroit Lake is maintained primarily by stocking fingerlings every other year.  Several muskie were caught in gill nets during the 2019 standard survey, measuring between 23 and 35 inches.  An additional targeted survey of muskie is currently underway on Detroit Lake that aims to estimate the population of adult fish.  A total of 139 muskie were sampled in 2019 spring surveys.  This targeted survey found Muskellunge ranged in length from 35 to 53 inches, with an average length of 44 inches.  Similar to the muskie targeted survey in 2015, approximately 13% of sampled fish were 50 inches or larger in size.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon were initially reintroduced into Detroit Lake in 1997 and are stocked annually in the fall.  A total of 15 Lake Sturgeon were caught in gill nets during the 2019 standard survey, having an average length of about 22 inches.  Two Lake Sturgeon were also caught during the 2019 spring targeted Muskellunge survey, one measuring 43.5 inches and the other 50 inches.  In addition, a targeted survey of Lake Sturgeon was done in 2018 using large mesh gill nets.  A total of 50 fish were sampled, ranging in length from 22 to 65 inches and averaging roughly 50 inches.  This is a positive sign that the reintroduction program that began over 20 years ago is resulting in several age-classes of Lake Sturgeon in Detroit Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe average catch rate of Bluegill in 2019 was roughly 29 fish per trap net, similar to the surveys done in 2015 and 2011.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3 to 8 inches, with the average Bluegill caught measuring about 6 inches.  Very few Bluegill over eight inches were sampled, suggesting heavy angler harvest.   <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing surveys conducted in late May for Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie were included in the 2019 survey.  A total of 79 Largemouth Bass and 64 Black Crappie were sampled.  Largemouth Bass ranged from 7 to 19.5 inches, averaging about 12 inches.  The average length of sampled Black Crappie was 9 inches and lengths ranged from 5 to 12.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSeveral other fish species were sampled during the 2019 standard survey.  These included all three species of bullhead, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.  Cisco were not captured during the 2019 survey, nor were they captured in the past four dating back to 2007.  This may be a function of the nets being used, as a targeted survey for Cisco using vertical gill nets in 2016 captured 14 Cisco.   <br> \n <br> \nDetroit Lake possesses a highly developed shoreline and watershed which can lead to certain fish management challenges.  There are many ways stakeholders can help protect and sustain the valuable fishery in Detroit Lake.  Shoreline owners and watershed residents can maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by implementing the following best management practices: leaving shoreline buffer zones of native aquatic vegetation intact, taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and using wise land management practices to reduce erosion and runoff.  Anglers can also help by releasing a portion of medium to larger sized fish and harvesting smaller fish for consumption to enhance the size structure of important game species like Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Detroit Lake is a 3,067-acre lake within the city limits of Detroit Lakes.  Visually, the lake has three parts, Big Detroit, Little Detroit, and Curfman Lake (a.k.a., Deadshot Bay).  Curfman Lake is 120 acres, Little Detroit covers approximately 1,000 acres, and Big Detroit, the main basin, is over 2,000 acres in size.  Fisheries assessments treat all three connected basins as one lake.  The lake's primary inlet and outlet, the Pelican River, enters the north shore of Big Detroit and exits the southwest shore of Little Detroit.  The Pelican River supports spawning runs for Northern Pike, Walleye, and White Sucker.  A standard fisheries survey was completed in August 2023 to assess the fish populations in Detroit Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find a moderate number of Northern Pike in Detroit Lake, however, most of these fish will be on the small side.  The average size of the pike captured in 2023 was 19 inches, but one 29-inch fish was measured.  Additionally, although not the target of this survey, one 40-inch Muskellunge was measured in the survey.  Detroit Lake has a very stable Walleye population and the 2023 survey captured Walleyes in good numbers and size.  About 83% of the Walleye observed in 2023 were over 15 inches and 29% were over 20 inches.  Anglers can expect to find good numbers of small Bluegills, but fish over eight inches are rare.  Only two percent of the Bluegills sampled in 2023 were over eight inches.  Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were captured in low numbers in the nets, which is often the case with this sampling gear.  Black Crappie up to 10.5 inches were measured and Largemouth Bass up to 19 inches were captured.  Lake Sturgeon are present in Detroit Lake and the survey captured fish up to 35 inches.  Other fish species observed were Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Detroit Lake is a 3,000 acre lake lying within the city limits of Detroit Lakes.  It is popular for many water     recreation activities.  It's shoreline is heavily-developed.  Historical water quality data are sketchy, but,     water clarity seems to be less than during the fifties.  Cultural eutrophication has almost certainly     increased lake fertility during the past century.  Fishing pressure is relatively heavy.  Despite all these     factors, Detroit Lake remains a productive and popular angling lake.          The 1994 test netting showed that the walleye population remained stable and well within the \"normal\" range     for similar lakes.  Other than the first year of test netting, 1953, the gillnet catch of walleye has     fluctuated around seven per net set.  The average sampled walleye weighed just over a pound and a half.      Growth rates for walleye older than about three years appeared to be slower than normal.  This observation has     also been made during previous surveys and has been attributed to the historically low abundance of yellow     perch, a primary forage fish.  In other words, the right size food is not available at the right time,     resulting in slowed growth for older walleye.  Natural reproduction of walleye occurs in Detroit Lake and a     two-year stocking blank is currently in effect to evaluate that reproduction more fully.  Past stocking     efforts are difficult to evaluate since carryover yearling walleye have often been included with fingerling     stockings.  Triennial stocking of walleye fingerlings would undoubtedly facilitate evaluation of natural     reproduction.          The other major predator fish in Detroit Lake, northern pike, remain well within the \"normal\" abundance range     for similar lakes at 6.4 per gillnet set.  Present numbers appear to be down from abnormally high net catches     in the early eighties.  High water levels during the past two years may result in increased pike spawning     success and, consequently, increased pike numbers in the near future.  Mean size of sampled pike is 18.5     inches and 1.4 pounds.  Like the walleye in Detroit Lake, northern pike seem to grow at normal rates for the     first three years, then slow considerably.  Again, this phenomenon may be related to the scarcity of yellow     perch, the preferred forage fish of both northern pike and walleye.  Expanded northern pike regulations have     been in effect since 1985; a six fish limit with not more than three over 24 inches long.  It is not known     whether the apparent decline in pike numbers is a result of the regulation or of natural factors like     decreased spawning success.  It is hoped that the recent creel survey (report not yet completed) will help to     shed some light on the success of the regulation.          Another top predator, muskellunge, has been stocked in Detroit Lake annually since 1989 in an effort to     establish a trophy population.  Only one muskie, a two-year-old, was captured during mid-summer test netting.      Spring trapnetting and/or electrofishing are generally more effective for capturing muskellunge.  Two spring     evaluations have been conducted during the past three years.  Trapnet catches have been low (less than 0.1     muskie/net), but, nearly every stocked year class has been represented in the samples.  Anglers have caught     and winter spearfishermen have sighted several muskies up to 42 inches long.          The bluegill population continues to fluctuate and abundance is once again significantly higher than normal at     nearly sixty fish per trapnet.  Bluegill size, however, is somewhat larger than during the past three surveys.      It is clear that Detroit Lake bluegill were larger previous to the eighties.  However, it is not known whether     those fish were larger due to faster growth or to less fishing pressure (older fish).  Average length of     sampled fish was 5.9 inches in 1994 with a few larger than eight inches.  No bluegill larger than eight inches     were taken during the 1986, 1989, or 1992 assessments.          Black crappie and largemouth bass are difficult to capture during mid-summer surveys, but, net catches for     both species were within \"normal\" ranges for lakes of the same ecological class as Detroit.  Population trends     for these two species will be evaluated more closely during spring muskie trapnetting studies.          All three common species of bullhead (black, yellow, and brown) were abundant.  Yellow bullhead continue     occupy the largest portion of the bullhead population in Detroit Lake, in spite of annual commercial     hoopnetting.  Some studies have indicated that yellow bullhead are more vulnerable to hoopnets than either     black or brown bullheads and are more likely to be reduced in abundance by netting.          As indicated previously, yellow perch abundance remains very low in Detroit when compared to similar lakes.      There has been, however, a significant increase over the past two surveys.  Low perch abundance generally     brings concern about northern pike and walleye growth, but, is apparently the norm for Detroit Lake.          In summary, it may be stated that Detroit Lake holds good populations of northern pike, black crappie,     largemouth bass, and walleye and that a trophy population of muskellunge (Leech Lake strain) is being     established.  Bluegills are overabundant, slow-growing, and smaller than desirable but seemingly increasing in     average size.  Cause and effect relationships are difficult to establish given the large number of factors     affecting the fish community in the lake; i.e. pollution, sedimentation, vegetation removal, stocking, angling     and other fish removal, etc.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Despite the pressures of heavy shoreline development, cultural eutrophication from the surrounding community and watershed, the invasion of exotic plant species (curlyleaf pondweed and flowering rush), and increased angling, Detroit Lake remains a productive and popular angling lake.  Watershed dwellers are becoming increasingly aware of the need to be good stewards of the land in order to protect water quality, fish populations, and property values.This survey was aimed at assessing the fish community, which was generally considered diverse and healthy in view of the pressures mentioned above.  Walleye test net catches, for example, remained very stable at 7.1 walleyes per set.  Of eight previous assessments, only the 1953 study (which was done in October, two months later than normal) showed significantly higher net catches of walleye.  In 1999, the average size of walleye sampled was 1.4 pounds.  Two-year stocking blanks in 1993-1994 and 1996-1997 did not seem to affect recruitment from those years.  Far and away the strongest year class of walleyes was the 1996, a year with no stocking.  Natural reproduction seemed to drive the walleye population in Detroit Lake more than did fingerling stocking in recent years.Natural reproduction also sustains populations of northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass in Detroit.  Each of these species also showed test net catches in the normal range for ecologically similar lakes.  Northern pike numbers were, however, lower than during any previous study at 5.4 per set.  Decreasing pike numbers may be affecting the growth rates.  Northern pike growth appeared to be faster than in the recent past.  The average weight of northern pike remained somewhat small (1.6 pounds) but anglers reported catching more three to six pound fish in 1999 than in recent years.Another top predator, muskellunge, has been stocked in Detroit Lake annually since 1989 in a effort to establish a trophy fish population.  Recent angling popularity is a testament to the success of this effort.  Although no muskies were caught in mid summer gear, spring trap netting with large frame nets in 1999 revealed a well established muskie population with fish over 46 inches being sampled.  Anglers reported muskie catches over 50 inches in Detroit Lake in 1998 and 1999.The bluegill population continues to fluctuate and abundance was near the top end of the normal range at 36.8 per trap net.  Interestingly, more bluegills over eight inches were sampled than in any assessment since the 1970s.  Growth rates remained somewhat slower than normal but, apparently, more old bluegills were present in the population in 1999 than in the past two decades.Black, yellow, and brown bullheads were relatively abundant.  Yellow perch numbers were comparatively low (typical for Detroit Lake).  Bowfin, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and cisco (tullibee) all add to this diverse fish community.Lake sturgeon were reintroduced into Detroit Lake in 1997 and 1998.  This species was known to have been present in the lake before the era of dams and river degradation.  Though slow growing, they can reach sizes over two hundred pounds.  Lake sturgeon are free roaming and require the ability to navigate both up and downstream for long distances to sustain populations.  They feed primarily upon crayfish and small fish.  Though hundreds of fish barriers remain in the Red River watershed, grassroots efforts have begun to reestablish river connectivity throughout.  These efforts should be beneficial to many fish species, including lake sturgeon.Other recent stewardship efforts, including the city's sewage treatment system additions and improvements, can only help to sustain the Detroit Lake fish community, angling, water quality, and property values.  Some additional methods in which watershed dwellers and lakeshore owners can help include: (1) following practices outlined in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property, (2) not fertilizing or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (3) leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail stands which are so beneficial to the lake, (4) continuing active participation in the lake association, and (5) leaving as much \"natural\" as possible on your shoreland lot.  Buffer zones along the shore are particularly helpful in preventing erosion and sedimentation.  With efforts like these and more voluntary catch and release fishing, good angling can be not just a thing of the past but of the future, as well.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cisco (Tullibee) are present in Detroit Lake.  Historical gillnet catches have been erratic with a high of 4.78 fish per net in 1952 and low of zero per net in 1989.  The 1992 catch remains below the first quartile for class #27 lakes at 0.27 cisco per net.  Conjecture about the condition of the tullibee population is made more difficult by the pelagic nature of the species.  However, it is worth noting that there have been a few undocumented but generally reliable reports of fairly productive gillnetting during the fall season in most recent years.Northern Pike abundance, at 7.64 per gillnet set, is within the normal range for similar lakes although it has decreased from recorded highs in the late seventies and early eighties.  The average weight of sampled pike has increased approximately 0.5. lb. over past surveys to 1.8 lbs. per fish.  The PSD (21) is presently 36%, while the RSD (30) is less than 2%; compared to historical PSDs ranging from 12% to 30% and RSDs at zero.  Northern pike spawning habitat is considered very good in at least two major Detroit Lake tributaries and there has been no stocking of the species since 1972 with sporadic stocking in previous years.  Additionally, there is an uncontrolled, state-owned NPSA connected to the southeast shore of the lake.  Expanded pike limits have been enforced since 1985 (see additional field notes).  Whether the apparent population shift to somewhat fewer, larger individuals has been caused by special regulations or natural forces remains unclear.  However, the regulation should probably be maintained for a minimum of two more test-net cycles (6-10 years) with an additional creel survey to get a better grasp of the regulation's effects.Leech Lake strain muskellunge fingerlings have been stocked annually since 1989 in an effort to establish a trophy population in the Detroit Lake area.  Evaluation of the stocking during the standard mid-summer survey was unsuccessful and an attempt should be made to assess muskies by early spring trapnetting.  Only one muskie was caught with standard survey gear but several local anglers report observing and catching fish ranging in weight from approximately one to eight pounds.Black, yellow and brown bullheads are all present and relatively abundant in Detroit Lake.  Yellows, in particular, were much more numerous than normal at nearly 29 per gillnet set per night.  No specific trend is apparent in the bullheads, but yellows have historically comprised the largest share of the ictalurids in Detroit Lake.  The lake is one of the core waters of Inland Commercial Fishing Area No. 14 and is frequently hoop-netted in season.  In contrast to some other area lakes, commercial netting has apparently had little effect upon the yellow bullhead population in Detroit.The bluegill population has undergone dramatic shifts (both up and down) in abundance since originally evaluated in 1952 and is presently on the high end of the inter-quartile range for trapnets in class #27 lakes at 41 fish per set.  The general trend appears to be an increase in number although net catches have decreased significantly in the two surveys since 1986.  A more definite downward trend in average size is evident.  Average weight of trapnet-caught bluegills from 1952 through the seventies was about one-third pound whild average weight from 1983 to the present is near one-tenth pound.  Additionally, PSD (6) and RSD (8) values, presently 29% and zero respectively, are much less desirable than the average values during the seventies, 58% and 28% respectively.  As expected, current bluegill growth rates are retarded.  Yet, it is unclear whether the pre-eighties bluegill population consisted of old, relatively unexploited, slow-growing individuals or simply fewer, faster-growing individuals; bluegill age and growth were not evaluated before 1989 in Detroit Lake.  Age groups II through IX are each represented in the trapnet catch with the strongest showing from three and four-year-olds.  Efforts should be made in future surveys to glean from all pertinent data a probable cause (natural cycle, overharvest, underharvest, habitat changes, etc.) for the prevailing decline in average bluegill size.  Currently available data are insufficient to reveal underlying reasons.Mid-summer habitat shifts and general behavior characteristics make both black crappie and largemouth bass populations difficult to properly evaluate during standard surveys and population assessments.  Trapnet catches for both species have remained relatively low (<1 fish per net) and stable throughout the past four decades, consistent with most class #27 lakes.  Although the sample size was small, growth rates for crappie and bass appear normal.  Black crappie, in particular, are an increasingly popular target species for anglers in Detroit Lake, especially during winter.  Early spring trapnetting for muskies may provide a good opportunity to better evaluate black crappie and largemouth bass as well.Since test-netting was initiated in 1952, yellow perch numbers have always been lower than the first quartile value for gillnets in comparable lakes.  However, mean numbers of perch per gillnet set have been significantly lower during 1989 and 1992 than during any of the five previous surveys, 0.625 and 0.82 respectively.  Predation by record high numbers of northern pike during the late seventies and early eighties is a likely explanation for the delayed decline in the yellow perch population.Walleye abundance, as measured by experimental gillnet, has remained remarkably stable and well within the normal range for similar lakes since 1970, fluctuating between 5.3 and 8.4 fish per net.  Only the 1952 survey was significantly different from the others at 16.2 walleye per gillnet.  Average weight of net-captured walleye, presently 1.5 lb., has ranged from 1.1 lbs. to 2.1 lbs.  Relatively stable length frequencies are reflected in historical calculations of proportional and relative stock densities.  Present values for PSD (15) and RSD (20) are 61% and 19% respectively.  Back-calculated growth is normal for walleye through age five or six but appears to slow considerably thereafter.  Reasons for the relative growth rate decline are not fully understood but may be a result of historically meager yellow perch numbers, i.e. lack of preferred size forage for mature fish.  Walleye have been stocked regularly in Detroit Lake since 1908 as fry, fingerlings or yearlings.  Present efforts to evaluate biennial walleye fingerling stocking have been confounded by the mixture of yearling fish due to rearing pond carryover.  It is clear from age study that there is natural reproduction in Detroit Lake; all but two of the past fifteen year classes were represented in the gillnet catch.  However, it is still unclear whether natural reproduction alone will sustain a viable walleye population.  Future stocking plans shoud be made, if possible, with evaluation as a key goal; single age-class, biennial or triennial stocking would be more readily evaluated than annual or multiple age-class stocking.Curfman Lake (Deadshot Bay) test net data are not included in this report.  However, since Curfman and Detroit are considered one body of water for management purposes, a brief comment is in order.  A relatively wide (about 200'), deep (28') water channel connects Curfman and Detroit Lakes and the general assumption is that since fish movement between the two is unrestricted, fish growth rates are similar in each.  Age and growth data comparison does not appear to counter that assumption.  Some possible (statistically insignificant) differences between fish populations in Deadshot Bay and Detroit Lake are as follows:  higher net catches of cisco and northern pike in Deadshot Bay; a higher proportion of black to yellow bullheads in Deadshot Bay; slightly older bluegill population in Detroit Lake proper; and higher net catches of walleye in Detroit Lake than in Deadshot Bay.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Detroit Lake has a variety of fish habitats and the fish community reflects that diversity.  This fishery includes warmwater species like bullheads and panfish, coolwater species like walleye, and even coldwater species like tullibee.  During the summer of 2003, however, the tullibee (cisco) population was likely stressed by warm water temperatures in the well-oxygenated layers.  Coldwater fish species require both cool temperatures and good levels of dissolved oxygen and, when both are not present together, there is often a die-off of those species, as there was in some area lakes in 2003.  Two potential trophy species are also present in these waters.Leech Lake strain muskellunge were first stocked in Detroit Lake in 1989.  Fishing opportunities now exist in this lake for catching muskies over fifty inches long and weighing well over thirty pounds.A century ago, Detroit Lake was known to harbor an occasional lake sturgeon weighing over 100 pounds.  Historical accounts from the Detroit newspaper document angler catches of these giants in the late 1800's and early 1900's.  Stream fragmentation (dam building), overfishing, and water quality degradation resulted in the loss of this slow growing fish species from Detroit Lake and the entire Red River watershed.  Several steps have been taken toreverse this condition and restore the fishery including (1) modifications of dams to make them passable by fish, (2) various water quality improvements, and (3) restrictive fishing regulations.  In addition, lake sturgeon reintroductions began in Detroit Lake and a few other Red River watershed locations in 1997.  Some of these sturgeon have recently been found during test netting and electrofishing in Detroit.  Also, there have been two reports of anglers catching and releasing lake sturgeon during the past two years.  There is currently no sturgeon harvest allowed in Detroit Lake because of the length of time it takes for sturgeon to become sexually mature (approximately 15-25 years).  However, the potential exists to catch fish over 100 pounds in this lake within decades.Walleye fishing continues to be very popular in Detroit Lake.  Walleye test net catches have been remarkably stable since 1970 and remained so in 2003.  A strong 1996 year class that was naturally reproduced still contributes to angler catches.  These fish are now over 20 inches long.  In addition, two moderately strong year classes from fingerling stocking years (1998 and 1999) will probably be contributing more to angler catches in the next couple of years.Bluegill catches were abundant, but large bluegills (those over eight inches) were not found in 2003 and are considered rare in this lake.  Bluegills are relatively slow growing in Detroit and it is believed that most bluegills reaching seven inches or longer are soon harvested by anglers.Largemouth bass, black crappie, northern pike and other species continue to be important parts of the fishery in this lake.  With continuing shoreline and watershed development, this diverse, productive, and valuable fishery will need help on several fronts to be sustained.  Anglers can help to maintain balance in fish populations by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium and large fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.  This is particularly true for northern pike.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, and by using wise land management practices.</p>",

Muskellunge were first introduced into Detroit Lake in 1989.  Directed Muskellunge surveys began on Detroit Lake in 1993.  Eleven surveys had been conducted prior to 2015.  Muskellunge were assessed in spring 2015 using a combination of electrofishing and large-frame trap nets.  This assessment was the first year of a planned two year project to estimate the number of adult Muskellunge in Detroit Lake.  The goal for this assessment was to capture and mark as many fish as possible. Data from these two years will be used to calculate a population estimate of adult Muskellunge in Detroit Lake.  \n\nTwenty-four Muskellunge were sampled during boat electrofishing and 61 individual Muskellunge were captured in 130 net-nights in large-frame tap nets (0.47 fish/net).  This catch rate was the lowest observed in the five Muskellunge assessments since 2001, but the 2015 trap net catch rate was likely affected by the unusual spring.  The total number of Muskellunge caught in trap nets on the first lift-day (18) was more than double the number of Muskellunge caught on any of the following days.  Seventy-three percent of the Muskellunge sampled with both gears were captured in Deadshot Bay or the immediately adjacent southern portion of the main lake.\n\nTwenty-seven female and 58 male Muskellunge were captured in both gears.  Lengths of these fish ranged from 34.3 to 52.8 inches and averaged 44.3 inches.  Female and male Muskellunge sizes ranged 37.9 to 52.8 inches long and 34.3 to 50.4 inches long, respectively.  Female Muskellunge average 47.9 inches while male Muskellunge averaged 42.6 inches.  The first male Muskellunge greater than 50 inches was sampled in 2015; this fish was 50.4 inches in length.  \n\nTrends in catch rates of adult Muskellunge over time suggest the population of Muskellunge in Detroit Lake was increasing through 2003.  However, examination of length frequencies of captured female Muskellunge suggest the adult population had not reached maximum growth potential until the survey in 2011.  The proportion of female Muskellunge 48 inches or longer was: 4% in 2003; 20% in 2007; 73% in 2011 and 67% in 2015.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Detroit Lake was conducted beginning on July 27, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at twenty-four sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eighteen stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at six stations. Nearshore sampling captured 20 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass,) and three that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore was combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Detroit Lake is likely impacted by some watershed and/or shoreline stressors, as indicated by an FIBI score that is near the impairment threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Detroit Lake fully supported aquatic life use based on the FIBI. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
