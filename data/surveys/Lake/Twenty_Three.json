There is no developed public access to the lake; however, it is possible to get to the lake by hiking approximately 0.25 mile to the southwest end of the lake across public land.  A lake survey conducted on the lake in the summer of 2003.  Fish species sampled during the survey were yellow perch, white sucker and common shiner.  Yellow perch were sampled in fairly high numbers, and the catch included some quality size fish.  They ranged in size from 6.0 inches to 12.7 inches with approximately 68% of the fish larger than 9.0 inches.  Most of the yellow perch in the sample were heavily infested with yellow grub.In earlier surveys on this lake, brook trout were sampled in low numbers; however, none were captured during this survey.  Brook trout have access to the lake from the East Branch Baptism River, a designated trout stream, which passes through the lake.</p>",
