                "narrative": "<p>Island is a 129 acre lake located about two miles north of Trommald, in Crow Wing County.  There is a public access located on the north side of the lake.  Development is limited to the north shore and there were about 10.9 homes/cabins per shoreline mile in 1998.  The lake has a maximum depth of 36 feet and about 53% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  Water clarity is about average for the area.  Common cattail was the most abundant emergent aquatic plant in 1998 and was found around most of the lake.  Hardstem bulrush provides important spawning habitat for a variety of fish species.  It was listed as \"abundant\" in 1980 but was only seen outside of vegetation transects in 1998.Island Lake was test netted in 1998, for the first time since 1980.  Northern pike was the most abundant gamefish.  The northern pike catch was in the \"low\" category when compared to similar type lakes and it was also lower than the 1980 catch.  Pike averaged 21 inches and 1.8 lbs. in size, similar to the 1980 values.  Several age classes were sampled, in about equal numbers, and growth was good.  The largemouth bass was found in numbers considered \"average,\" although few fish were caught.  The lake has had a history of containing larger fish and having a good abundance of bass.  Bluegills were found in numbers considered to be \"high,\" although the catch was well below the level found in 1980.  A good number of age classes were present and growth was good.  Nearly one-half of the catch was from the 1993 year class.  About 6% of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or longer, similar to the 1980 value.  Black crappies were caught in \"average\" numbers and averaged about 8.5 inches long in 1998.  Two year classes made up the majority of the catch.</p>",
