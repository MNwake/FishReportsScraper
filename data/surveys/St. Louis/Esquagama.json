                "narrative": "<p>Esquagama Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that have soft and clear water.  Esquagama Lake is deeper and has less clear (more bog stained) water than most lakes in this lake class.Esquagama Lake was thermally stratified on 06/21/99 and retained good oxygen (5 ppm) to within a few feet of the bottom, where the temperature was 39 F.  The Embarrass River flows through Esquagama Lake with midsummer flows of 100-500 CFS.  There are no barriers to fish movement in the inlet from Cedar Island Lake.  The outlet to the St. Louis River has a dam with a fixed head of several feet, but water levels on the lake vary a lot due to the small size of Esquagama Lake in relation to the large watershed of the Embarrass River system upstream (160 square miles).  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are 66% sand, 25% rubble, and 9% muck.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a maximum depth of 8 ft. The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1999 of 32 fish/net (29 lb/net) was normal for this lake class and was higher than the average catch of 23 fish/net (16 lb/net) in three previous investigations on this lake dating back to 1947.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1999 of 53 fish/net (37 lb/net) was higher than the average catch of 15 fish/net (13 lb/net) in previous investigations.  The increase in the trapnet catch in 1999 was due primarily to higher numbers of bluegill sunfish.Fish populations in 1999 were dominated by bluegill sunfish, followed by cisco, white sucker, northern pike, and walleye.Bluegill numbers in 1999 (30/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the average catch of 5/trapnet in previous investigations on this lake. Bluegill sizes in 1999 averaged 5\"; the largest was 9.5\".  Most bluegill captured in 1999 were ages 2-5.  Bluegill growth was faster than average for this lake class.Northern pike numbers in 1999 (3/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were higher than the average catch of 1/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 1999 averaged 23\"; the largest was 31.4\".  Most pike captured in 1999 were ages 3-6.  Pike growth was near the median for area lakes.Walleye numbers in 1999 (4/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the average catch of 5/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 1999 averaged 13\"; the largest was 29.4\".  Most walleye captured in 1999 (56%) were age three from the 1996 year class, although ten year classes were represented.  Walleye growth was normal for this lake class.Although their numbers were low, some nice sized perch (up to 11\") and crappie (up to 13\") were present in 1999.Many of the fish examined during this investigation were infested with neascus.  Many yellow perch and rock bass also had yellow grub, and many of the cisco had Trianophorus.  Neascus (black spot), yellow grub, and Trianophorus are parasites found in the skin or muscle of the fish.  They are all common to the area, cannot infect humans, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.  Fish infected with Trianophorus (found in muscle of fish) are generally not eaten because the appearance of the parasite in the meat is displeasing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Esquagama Lake is a 453 acre lake located five miles southeast of Gilbert.  It is accessed by a ramp on the south side of the lake on land that is privately owned by the Eshquaguma Country Club.  This Ecological Lake Class 5 lake has a maximum depth of 90 feet and dark brown water.  On July 17, 2018 Esquagama Lake was weakly thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 75 F and a bottom temperature of 42 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish throughout the water column.   <br> \n <br> \nEsquagama is relatively developed with year round and seasonal homes.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly sand and rubble.  The only place a substantial amount of aquatic vegetation grows is in the long muck bottom bay that extends to the southwest.  The Embarrass River enters the lake on the north end and empties out the southwest corner.  There are no barriers to fish movement in the inlet from Cedar Island Lake.  The outlet to the St. Louis River has a dam with a fixed head of several feet.  At times of high water fish are able to move in and out of Esquagama Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 22.7 fish/net which was below average compared to past surveys on the lake.  Fish species sampled were cisco, walleye, northern pike, white sucker, black bullhead, and yellow perch.   Trap nets caught fish at an overall rate of 12.4 fish/net which was also lower than average for the lake.  Additional species sampled in trap nets were bluegill, black crappie, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, pumpkinseed, and brown bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nFifty-two walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 5.8 fish/net, which was above average compared to other similar lakes in the state and the highest catch on record for Esquagama Lake.  Sizes ranged from 8 to 29 inches with an average of 12 inches which was bigger than normal for the lake.  As is the often the case for lakes with strong river influence, walleye growth can be somewhat slow.  It takes the average walleye 7 years to reach 15 inches in Esquagama.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 2.1 fish/net which was higher than normal for Esquagama but lower than average compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 16 to 39 inches with an average of 23 inches.  The average weight was nearly 3 pounds which was good compared to other similar lakes in the state. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnet catch was 6 fish/net which was similar to most past surveys on the lake, with one exception being a high catch rate in 1999.  Lengths were also similar with an average of 5 inches and the biggest fish measuring nearly 9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie trapnet catch was 2.3 fish/net which was above average compared to other similar lakes and tied for the highest catch rate on Esquagama.  Lengths ranged from 4 to 12 inches with an average of just over 8 inches.  Ages ranged from 1 to 8 with the strongest representation from the 2015 year class.  Growth rates were average compared to other area crappie lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe cisco catch rate was 13.3 fish/gill net which was below average compared to past surveys on Esquagama.  The average length of 8 inches was smaller than past surveys.  The biggest fish which measured over 15 inches, was similar to big fish caught in past surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled but in lower numbers were black and brown bullhead, white sucker, yellow perch, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and shorthead redhorse. <br> \n <br> \nSome of the northern pike and rock bass had moderate neascus (black spot) infestations.  <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish, a non-native invasive species, were sampled for the first time in Esquagama Lake during the 1999 survey.  In that survey, over 11/gill net and 46/trap net were sampled.  The 2018 survey showed a lower abundance with a gill net catch rate of just over 3/net and a trap net catch rate of less than 1/net. <br> \n</p>",
