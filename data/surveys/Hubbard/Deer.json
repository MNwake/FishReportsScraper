                "narrative": "<p>\tDeer Lake is located 0.5 miles West of Nevis, in central Hubbard County. Deer has a surface area of 181 acres and a maximum depth of 9 feet. There are two ways to access Deer Lake. The first is a city owned earthen access on the southeast shore of the lake, with limited parking area. The second way to access the lake is through a channel that connects Deer Lake to Shallow Lake, but this requires high water to navigate. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Deer Lake is in lake class 42. Class 42 lakes generally are shallow with a very high littoral area (depths less than 15 feet), irregularly shaped, and have hard and turbid water. Moran Lake is the only other class 42 lake in the Park Rapids area. <br> \n\tOnly one Largemouth Bass and two Northern Pike were sampled in the summer of 2015. They both have been sampled in very limited numbers in the past, because preferred sampling gear has not been used. <br> \n\tBluegills were sampled in higher numbers than recent years, and in comparable numbers to similar lakes. Bluegills of all sizes were sampled from 3 to 8.2 inches, with most fish 6.5 to 8 inches in length. <br> \n\tBlack Crappies were sampled in comparable numbers to most past surveys but lower than similar lakes. The average size was 8 inches, with some fish larger than 10 inches. <br> \n\tCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Deer Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

No gillnets were set during 1993 due to time constraints and shallow water.  Only one walleye was sampled which was 20.6 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Four northern pike were sampled ranging in length from 16.9 to 23.3 inches that averaged 1.9 pounds.  Largemouth bass were also sampled and ranged in length from 6.1 to 14.3 inches and had a mean weight of 0.7 pounds.  The bluegill trapnet catch of 11.8 per set was nearly the same as the 12.0 per set during 1988.  The bluegill size structure is small with the largest sample at 7.7 inches.  Growth rates are slow.  The yellow perch were not well sampled by trapnets.  The small sample taken (6) indicate a small population with only 1 yellow perch sampled more than 8.0 inches.</p>",
