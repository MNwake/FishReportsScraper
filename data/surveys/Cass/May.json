                "narrative": "<p>LOCAL REPORTS:Fishing during the summer of 1954 was \"fair\" for walleye, \"poor\" for northern pike, and \"good\" for largemouth bass.  Fishing observed on May Lake was chiefly trolling for walleye and northern pike and still-fishing for sunfish.  The lake has yielded some good walleye catches in the past and is known as a \"pretty good\" northern pike lake and a \"good\" largemouth bass lake.  There are some complaints of small size of crappie and sunfish, especially bluegill.SPECIAL REGULATIONS:Lake May was closed to darkhouse spearing during the 1949-50 season.SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION:May Lake is at present supporting a good population of bass and panfish which are growing at normal rates for lakes in this area.  A good year-class (1952) of bass and panfish should enter the anglers catch beginning in 1955.The northern pike population is low and natural reproduction of this species is poor.  All possible encouragement should be given this species.  Northern pike fishing will continue to decline until bolstered by a successful year-class.Walleye abundance is above normal for lakes of this type and the population, as judged by the test net catch is made up primarily of old, mature fish.  It seems probable that this walleye population is being maintained by fish from an outside source since natural reproduction is lacking and no recent walleye stocking has been done in this lake.  This source is probably nearby Leech Lake.  Since May Lake is essentially a northern pike, bass-panfish lake, the existing walleye population represents a source of fishing that would not normally be avaiulable in lakes of this type.  Walleye fishing, under these conditions, is of the bonus variety that cannot be appreciably increased due to the limited fish production potential of the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>May Lake (ID# 11-0482) is a 143-acre lake on the south edge of the City of Walker, MN.  May Lake has 2.26 miles of shoreline with a maximum depth of 59 feet.  The lake is connected by a navigable channel to Long Lake, which has a US Forest Service public access.   <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  May Lake is in Lake Class 31.    The lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie and secondarily for Bluegill, and Cisco (Tullibee).  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were more abundant than most other lakes in Class 31. Though many fish less than 20 inches were found during DNR test netting, fish up to 31 inches were sampled. Largemouth Bass were relatively abundant and fish up to 18 inches were sampled.  Numbers of Black Crappie found were similar to other waters in this Lake Class, and fish up to 10 inches were sampled.   Bluegill and Pumpkinseed Sunfish were also abundant in May Lake. Though many were less than 6 inches long, fish were also found in the 7- or 8-inch categories.   Other species sampled in May Lake were Rock Bass, Walleye and Yellow Bullhead.    <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.    AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resources office.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional information on all of these topics can be found on the MNDNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>May Lake (DOW 11-0482, Lake Class 31) is a 143-acre lake on the south edge of the City of Walker, MN.  May Lake has 2.26 miles of shoreline with a maximum depth of 59 feet.  Littoral area is 74 acres. The lake is connected by a navigable channel to Long Lake, which has a US Forest Service public access. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. May Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear, productive, and have moderate depth. Other area lakes in this class include Bowen, Five Point, Sanborn, Ponto, Welsh and Widow. May Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie and secondarily for Bluegill, Cisco, and Muskellunge. However, no Muskellunge have ever been sampled in May Lake, and the few reported by anglers could have been remnant migrants from Leech Lake prior to barrier construction that limited fish passage.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were below what has been seen in recent surveys in this lake with seven fish per net caught, below the management goal of 8 to 10 fish per gill net. In the 2020 survey Northern Pike ranged in length from 10 to 34 inches with an average length of 18 inches. Largemouth Bass catch rates tied for the second highest in this lake with fish ranging in length from 6 to 20 inches.  Largemouth Bass averaged 11 inches. Long-range management goals are assessed using spring electrofishing, which was not conducted in 2020. Black Crappie were caught at a level comparable to recent surveys and met the management goals of at least one fish per trap net and one fish per gill net. Black Crappie ranged in length from 5 to 11 inches, with an average of eight inches. Bluegill abundance was lower than in recent surveys with nine fish per trap net caught. The 2020 Bluegill catch was lower than the long range management goal of 15-25 fish per trap net. Bluegill had an average length of five inches and fish up to eight inches were sampled. Tullibee (Cisco) were sampled at rates close to past surveys in this lake with just over one fish per gill net, meeting the management goal of 1-3 fish per net. The Tullibee (Cisco) lengths ranged from 11 to 15 inches. Tullibee (Cisco) can provide important forage for larger predator fish in addition to offering an angling opportunity. Walleye abundance has remained stable at low levels with less than one fish per gill net and only two fish sampled in this survey. Yellow Perch numbers were low compared to similar lakes, comparable to recent surveys in this lake.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and Rock Bass. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Lake May. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>May Lake is a 123-acre lake located near Walker, Minnesota that has 2.26 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 59 feet.  An US Forest Service owned public access is located on Long Lake, and May Lake can be reached via a navigable channel from Long Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant in May Lake.  The 2006 gill net catch rate was above the third quartile for lakes of similar qualities and was consistent with the last two surveys.  The mean length of fish sampled was 21 inches, and fish up to 27 inches were sampled.  Larger fish were sampled with the 2006 survey when compared to the last two surveys.    <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are present in May Lake and their abundance was lower than the two previous two surveys.  Their mean length was 5 inches, and fish up to 10 inches were sampled.  However, very few bluegills greater than 8 inches were sampled, but this has been consistent with the previous two surveys.    <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass up to 15 inches were sampled in the survey.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species present for anglers are brown bullhead, black crappie, cisco (tullibee), pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, walleye, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in May Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in May Lake was conducted on July 25-27, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Nearshore sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations, and a 15-foot seine was used to sample two stations due to difficult site conditions including abundant lilies out to deep water along the shoreline. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including abundant numbers of seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and no species that are classified as tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill and Rock Bass comprised a majority of the trap net catch by biomass, with Bluegill most abundant by number. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was just below the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 31 lakes and the average length was 5.0 inches, with 14% over 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Common Carp and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n  <br> \nData from this survey indicates May Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike ranged in length from 14 to 31 inches, with bimodal length groups of 19.0-19.9 and 20.0-20.9 inches.  The PSD from 1991 (44) was only half of the 1986 PSD (89).  RSD also dropped from 16 in 1986 to 5 in 1991.  The main reason for this change in PSD and RSD was an influx of 18-20 inch northern pike in 1991.  In 1986, there were no northern pike in the 18-20 inch range.  Growth was good at all ages, with a 20 inch fish being 3 years old.Walleye gillnet indices have changed little over the last four assessments, ranging from 1.5 to 2.5/gillnet lift.  This falls between the first quartile and the median.  The 13 walleye that were captured ranged from 18 to 22 inches, with a modal length group of 18.0-18.9 inches and a PSD of 100.  In 1986, the mode was 17.0-17.9, with a PSD of 77.  Growth was good, with an age V fish averaging 18.8 inches in length.  No walleye under age V were captured.Bluegill catch rates in 1991 (11.9/trapnet lift) dropped to half from the last three assessments (1954-29.8, 1978-27.3 and 1986-24.5).  The median for lake class 31 is 30.63/lift.  The mean length of bluegill captured has changed little over the last three assessments (1978-5.0 inches, 1986-5.3 inches and 1991-5.1 inches).  The same can be said of the PSD (1978-38, 1986-45, and 1991-39).  Growth was marginally good the first year, then slow for the rest of the years.  An age VI bluegill was 5.5 inches long.There were 24 largemouth bass captured by night electrofishing, for a CPE of 27.9 bass/hour.  These fish ranged in length from 5 to 14 inches.  Growth was good at all ages, with an age V bass being 11.9 inches long.Black crappie were caught at a rate of 2.1/trapnet lift, which falls between the median and the third quartile.  These fish ranged in length from 5 to 11.5 inches, with a strong modal length group of 5.5-5.9.  This length group was made up 38 percent of the catch and were age III fish.  Growth was good at all ages.All three species of bullhead were captured at low numbers.</p>",

The average lakewide habitat score was 83.4 (?3.8) out of 100 possible.

                "narrative": "<p>Minnesota lakes have been classified, based on a number of physical and chemical parameters, into 43 lakeclassifications.  It has been determined that May Lake is in lake class 31.  Fish assemblages typical of this lakeclass include primary species of northern pike, yellow bullhead and bluegill.  Secondary species, species thatoccur in at least 50 percent of class 31 surveys include:  bowfin, white sucker, brown bullhead, black bullhead,rockbass, black crappie, pumpkinseed, largemouth bass, yellow perch and walleye.  With the exception of bowfinand black bullhead, all fish species typical of a class 31 lake were sampled in May Lake during the 1994 survey. Additional species sampled or known to exist in May included muskellunge and cisco.  Other Walker area lakes inthe same lake class include:  Child (11-263), Five Point (11-351), Bowen (11-350), Ox Yoke (11-355),, Sanburn (11-361), and Widow (11-273).  Prior surveys and assessments completed on May Lake include 1954 - Initial survey, 1978- Resurvey, 1986 - Population assessment, 1991 - Population assessment,  1994 - Creel survey.Preliminary findings of the 1994 creel survey estimated angler hours from May 14, 1994 (opening day) throughSeptember 5, 1994 (Memorial Day) at 4,027 hours for an overall pressure of 21.5 hours per acre.  Of the anglersseeking specific species, over 50 percent indicated they were angling for black crappie or largemouth bass.  Blackcrappie and largemouth bass anglers enjoyed catch rates of 1.21 black crappie/hour and 0.79 largemouth bass/hour. Other species anglers fished specifically for were northern pike, bluegill, and walleye.  No walleye were sampledduring the 1994 creel survey.      DISCUSSION OF THE 1994 POPULATION ASSESSMENTThe 1994 catch rate for northern pike was 10.5/gill net lift.  This value was higher than 75 percent of the class31 lakes and was the highest ever recorded on May Lake.  Sampled northern pike ranged in length from 10.1 inchesto 35.3 inches.  Age and growth analysis revealed 75 percent of the 1994 sample age 2 and 3 with lengths at agesimilar to other class 31 lakes.  After looking at other lake surveys, it appears that 1992 was conducive tonorthern pike reproduction in many area lakes including Leech.  Quality size northern pike are present in May Lakeand provide some excellent angling opportunities.  Spring electrofishing produced a sample of 31 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 19.9/hour.  The catch rate forfish of stock size (> 8.0 inches) was 16.7/hour.  Sampled largemouth bass ranged in length from 6.1 - 19.6 inches. Age and growth analysis revealed growth to be similar to other class 31 lakes.  Representation of all year classesback to 1985 indicated consistent natural reproduction.  In 1984 and 1985, biology students from Bemidji StateUniversity, working as counselors at the In Fisherman's Camp Fish, weighed and measured largemouth bass caughton May and Long Lakes.  During the two years, a total of 386 largemouth bass were measured from May Lake. Individuals as large as 22 inches were caught in both years.The bluegill catch rate for trapnets was 32.9/lift.  This value was slightly above the historical catches for MayLake (11.9 - 29.8). The sample was dominated by small slow growing bluegill with only one percent of the samplegreater than seven inches.  In 1954, 26 percent of the bluegill sample was greater than seven inches.  Thisdecline in quality likely can be attributed to over harvest of large individuals by anglers.  This often occursin many Walker area lakes.  As in May Lake, lake class 31 lakes in the Walker area experience slow bluegillgrowth.  This finding has prompted DNR Biologists to include May Lake in a research project investigatingregulations designed to increase the harvest of bluegill greater than eight inches.  The three types ofregulations being considered are:     1)   Regulations that influence the bag limit and/or size        limit of bluegill.          2)   Regulations that influence the bag limit and/or size    limit of large predators that feed onbluegill.     3)   Regulations using a combination of both 1 and 2.Pre-regulation data will be collected in 1994 and 1995.  If acceptable to the public, new regulations will beimplemented during 1996.  Monitoring will continue until the year 2001.  Data will then be analyzed and resultswill be used to help manage bluegill in Minnesota.  Presently May Lake is being considered as a control lake.The 1994 black crappie catch rate for trapnets (1.1/lift) and gillnets (1.0/lift) were within the historical rangefor May Lake. The largest individual sampled was 10.8 inches.  The most often occurring length group sampled was8.0 - 8.9 inches and was similar to all prior surveys.  Age and growth analysis indicated good growth, similarto other area class 31 lakes.  Historically, sampled sizes have been small.  However, preliminary estimates fromthe 1994 creel survey indicated black crappie were the most sought after species in May Lake.  Black crappieanglers enjoyed a harvest rate of 1.19 and a catch rate of 1.21.  Harvested black crappie had an average weightof 0.44 pounds.  Personal observations appear to indicate increased pressure directed at black crappie on MayLake, especially after ice-out when black crappie traditionally are extremely vulnerable to the angler.  Thisincreased harvest and pressure could cause a reduction of average size.  Increased black crappie sample size wouldbe necessary to determine affects of escalating angling pressure.  In future surveys, spring trapnetting mayaugment the sample size and should be considered if time and man-power are available.  The yellow perch catch rate for gill nets was 13.2/lift and was within the Lake May historical range (0.3 - 53.0). Considerable fluctuation of gill net catch rates have occurred over prior surveys.  Length frequency distributionsindicated this fluctuation to be a result of a single strong year class being sampled by the gillnet in years ofhigh gillnet catch rates.  Little sport fishing for yellow perch occurs on May Lake.  Preliminary findings of the1994 creel survey estimated only 14 yellow perch were harvested from May 14 through September 5, 1994.  Lengthfrequency distributions show a population that does not achieve sizes desired by anglers.  Yellow perch stillprovide excellent food for other species such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye in May Lake.  Sampledyellow perch ranged in length from 5.0 - 8.9 inches and had an average length of 6.5 inches.  The 1994 catch rate for walleye was 1.8/gillnet lift.  This value was consistent with all prior surveys (1.5 -2.5) and also similar to other class 31 lakes.  Length frequency data as well as age and growth analysis revealeda mature walleye population.  Burrows reported the walleye population in 1954 to also be of mature fish.  Itappeared then the walleye population in May Lake was being maintained by an outside source, probably Leech Lakevia May Creek.  He also concluded May Lake was essentially a northern pike, largemouth bass/panfish lake andwalleye angling in lakes of this type was of the bonus variety, and could not be increased appreciably.  Datacollected in surveys since continue to concur with these findings.  May Lake will continue to provide walleyeangling opportunities, especially for anglers seeking trophy class WAE. Other species sampled during this survey included cisco, white sucker, yellow bullhead and pumpkinseed.  Catchrates for these species were similar to prior surveys.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>May Lake is a 123 acre lake located partially within the city limits of Walker, MN.  May Lake has 1.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 59 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics; May Lake is in Lake Class 31.  This lake is primarily managed for black crappie, northern pike and largemouth bass and secondarily for muskellunge, bluegill and walleye.  Fish population surveys have been conducted by the MNDNR in 1954, 1978, 1986, 1991, 1994 and the current survey was done in 2001.  The black crappie population in May Lake appears to be stable although catch rates are slightly lower than other lakes in this lake class.  Black crappie in the 2001 survey were between 6.9 and 10.2 inches long; the average size was 9.1 inches.  Most of the sampled black crappie were in the 8-10 inch range.  Largemouth bass electrofishing catch rates have declined over the past three surveys but the size structure of largemouth bass has increased.  Fish between 7.1 and 20.4 inches were collected during the 2001 survey.  The northern pike population continues to increase in abundance.  The gill net catch in 2001 was the highest on record.  Northern pike ranging in size from 11.8 and 30.7 inches were collected in the test netting survey.  As the population has increased the average size of northern pike has decreased.  Removing larger northern pike via angling from May Lake has likely reduced the ability of this population to regulate itself and decreased the numbers of yellow perch, cisco and white sucker.  Only 4 walleye were collected in the 2001 survey.  This was the lowest number of fish collected since surveys were initiated in 1951.  Natural recruitment appears to be very limited because the smallest walleye collected was 21.3 inches long.  The walleye that are present in May Lake are most likely immigrants from Leech Lake.  May Lake is connected to Walker Bay of Leech Lake via May Creek.  The abundance of bluegill appears to be stable in May Lake even though the number collected in DNR trap nets was lower than previous surveys.  Bluegill ranging in size from 2.5 to 7.9 inches were sampled in the 2001 survey.  The abundance of pumpkinseed has declined in May Lake since the 1978 survey.  Despite the decline in abundance the number of pumpkinseed in May Lake is similar to other Lake Class 31 lakes.  The fish species typically sampled in Lake Class 31 lakes were collected during the 2001 survey.   Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Long Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.    Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.  Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in May Lake was conducted on July 22, 2021, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations and a 15-foot seine was used to sample two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in May Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
