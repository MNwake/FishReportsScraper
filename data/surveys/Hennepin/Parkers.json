Boat access to the lake is through a city maintained concrete boat ramp on the north end of the lake and shore access is available from a public fishing pier located on the west side of the lake.  Largemouth bass, northern pike, and bluegill are the primary fish species of interest to anglers in Parkers Lake.Largemouth bass have typically been the most abundant predator species in the lake, however, northern pike have increased in number during recent years and are now the most abundant predator species.  Although bass and northern pike were sampled with high abundance, average sizes were relatively small for these species.  Bass averaged 11.6 inches in length and 0.94 pounds in weight, while northern pike averaged 20.9 inches long and 2.3 pounds.Bluegills were the most abundant species sampled in the lake.  Bluegills were also found to be small with an average length of only 4.9 inches.  Only 12.4% of the bluegills captured were greater than 6.0 inches in length.  No bluegills over 8 inches were caught.  Green sunfish as well as hybrid sunfish were also caught in low numbers and small sizes in Parkers Lake.Black crappie were sampled with relatively low abundance, however, sizes tended to be over the median for lakes of this type.  Black crappie mean length was 8.2 inches while mean weights exceeded 0.33 pounds. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Parkers Lake is a 100-acre lake with a maximum depth of 37 feet, located in central Hennepin County, in the city of Plymouth. Parkers Lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass, but also supports catchable populations of Bluegill and Northern Pike. A Standard Survey (trap nets and gill nets) was conducted on Parkers Lake during the week of 6/12/17. During the survey, water clarity was 13 feet, with low oxygen below 26 feet. Eurasian Watermilfoil also remains present in Parkers Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled with boat electrofishing at a rate of 52.1 fish per hour. Largemouth Bass averaged 14.7 inches-- with the largest measuring 19.0 inches-- while 57% of fish sampled were over 15 inches. Growth was average compared to similar lakes across the state. An abundance of large individuals and multiple year classes should provide reliably good Largemouth Bass angling. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled with trap nets at a typical rate (30.2/net) compared to similar lakes throughout the state. Bluegill averaged 5.6 inches, with the largest measured at 7.9 inches. Approximately 23% of sampled fish were greater than 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers in Parkers Lake were very abundant, with 23.8/net. Average size of Northern Pike in gill nets was 22.4 inches, with the largest measured at 34.3 inches. Parkers Lake is a prime candidate to take advantage of the new Northern Pike regulation (which begins in 2018), where possession limit increases to 10, but with no more than two pike longer than 26 inches; all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundance during the 2017 survey were Black Crappie, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Boat access to the lake is through a city maintained concrete boat ramp on the north end of the lake and shore access is available from a public fishing pier located on the west side of the lake. Northern pike and bluegill were the most abundant game fish during this survey but largemouth bass are also an important game fish in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance is at an all time high for Parkers Lake.  Gill nets averaged 20.2 northern pike per net, and mean weight was 2.7 pounds.  Lengths ranged from 17.7 to 32 inches and averaged 22.6 inches.  The size structure of this population includes a large number of fish between 20 and 25 inches and 8 percent of the population is longer than 28 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catches (312.1 per net) were very high compared with similar lakes.  Similar to northern pike, this marks the highest bluegill abundance for Parkers Lake.  These fish tend to be small, averaging 5.3 inches and 0.1 pounds.  Only 25 percent of the population is longer than 6 inches and no fish greater than 8 inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nOther sunfish species sampled during this survey include pumpkinseed, hybrid, and green sunfish, however abundance is low and sizes are small (mean lengths are 4.4, 6.0, and 4.1 inches for the respective species). <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled in below average numbers (1.3 per net) and have been below the normal range since 1985.  Sampled black crappies ranged from 6.4 to 8.5 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were not targeted during this survey, however one three-year-old bass was sampled that measured 7.2 inches and weighed 0.2 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullhead were at above average density and weight (average weight = 0.8 pound).  Lengths ranged from 5.9 to 13.6 and averaged 11 inches.    <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Only 8 species of fish and hybrid sunfish were sampled in this survey. Largemouth bass are the most abundant predator species present and 1 of every 10 individuals sampled was over 16.0 inches in length. Northern Pike were sampled within the normal range for abundance and 1/3 of the sampled individuals were 25.0\" and over. Bluegill were abundant and averaged 6.4\" in length with 11.4% of the individuals sampled being 7.0\" or larger. Black crappie were present in relatively low numbers but over half of the sampled fish were over 9.0 inches in length. The ratio of yellow bullhead to black bullhead was found to be approximately 3-to-1 and specimens over 13 inches were observed for both species. Green sunfish were also common and appear to readily hybridize with bluegill in this lake.</p>",
