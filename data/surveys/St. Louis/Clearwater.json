The lake is stocked annually with 1,125 yearling Rainbow Trout, and has been primarily managed as a put-and-take Rainbow Trout fishery.  Clearwater was surveyed in 2015 to evaluate the stocking program and update information on other fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nOne 12.1 inch Rainbow Trout was captured in the gillnets for an abundance of 0.3 per lift.  Rainbow Trout gillnet abundance was below average when compared to similar lakes.  Zero Rainbow Trout were captured in the trapnets.  The low abundance of trout captured suggests that anglers are efficient in their ability to harvest trout from Clearwater Lake.  The lake is stocked in the spring, and anglers have likely removed most trout by fall.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured included Blacknose Shiner, Central Mudminnow, Fathead Minnow, Brook Stickleback, Golden Shiner, Northern Redbelly Dace and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear is a 15 acre lake with 9 (64%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The lake is located 9 miles north of Hermantown, Minnesota just past Fish Lake Reservoir on County Highway #48 (Lavaque Road).  Carry-down access is located on the northwest side of the lake off County Road #48.  Clear lake has been managed primarily as a put-and-take rainbow trout fishery.     Various life stages of rainbow trout have been stocked in Clear Lake beginning in 1958.  Yearling Kamloops rainbow trout have been stocked annually in the spring since 1994.  Adult trout have been stocked in 4 years since 1996 and large yearlings were stocked in 2004 and 2005.  A total of 13 rainbow trout were captured in gill and trapnets during the 2005 lake survey.  Twelve of the captured trout had adipose and right front pectoral fin clips, which indicates they were stocked in 2005.  One trout had an adipose and left front pectoral fin clips, which indicates it was stocked in 2004.  No unclipped fish were captured.  Mean and maximum length of sampled rainbow trout was 9.6 and 14.8 inches.  It has been reported by anglers that the stocking of large yearlings and adult rainbow trout has resulted in an increased level of fishing pressure on Clear Lake.     A total of 49 white sucker were captured during the survey.  Other fish species sampled include blackchin shiner, fathead minnow and golden shiner.     Information about aquatic vegetation was collected along 10 transects around Clear Lake.  Water shield, a plant with a small, round, gelatin covered, floating leaf, was identified within 100% of the transects and was rated as abundant.  Water shield was identified as rare during the 1990 lake survey.  Dense stands of water shield have become a problem for recreational boating and the setting of assessment gear along the shoreline of several lakes in the Duluth Area.</p>",
