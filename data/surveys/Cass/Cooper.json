NET CATCHES AND AGE AND GROWTH ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THE BLUEGILL POPULATION IS ABUNDANT AND IS MADE UP OF RELATIVELY SMALL, SLOW-GROWING FISH.  NUMBER AND GROWTH OF LARGEMOUTH BASS IS GOOD.  NORTHERN PIKE REMAIN LOW IN NUMBERS AS COMPARED TO OTHER LAKES IN THE AREA.  ALL YEAR CLASSES ARE PRESENT AND GROWTH APPEARS TO BE GOOD TO EXCELLENT.ONE LONGEAR SUNFISH WAS CAPTURED IN A TRAPNET AND THE IDENTIFICATION WAS CONFIRMED BY DR.
