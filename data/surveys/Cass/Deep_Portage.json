                "narrative": "<p>Deep Portage Lake has an area of 123 acres and a shoreline length of 1.75 miles.  Though it has a maximum depth of 105 feet, about one-quarter of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  This lake can be accessed via a public access on Big Portage Lake through a boatable channel to Deep Portage.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Deep Portage Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally very deep and clear with a low percentage of shallow water areas.  The west shoreline of Deep Portage Lake is public land administered by Cass County.  Sixteen lake homes are scattered along the shoreline.     The northern pike in Deep Portage Lake are abundant with larger fish in excellent condition.  The average size of sampled northern pike was 20.1 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Walleye are also are abundant and average 19.4 inches and 2.6 pounds.  The largest walleye sampled was 26.7 inches.  Nine year classes were present with the 1996 year class accounting for 30 percent of all sampled walleye.  These fish averaged 18.9 inches in length.     Largemouth bass sampled in Deep Portage Lake ranged in length between 5.1 inches and 15.8 inches.  Bluegill and black crappie were sampled in low abundance and average 4.3 inches and 8.5 inches, respectively.     Other species sampled in low abundance include: yellow perch, white sucker, tullibee, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.     Angler can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Deep Portage Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.       Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.     Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.     Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.     Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deep Portage Lake (DOW 11-0237) is a 129-acre lake with a shoreline length of 1.79 miles and a maximum depth 105 feet.  Approximately one-quarter of the lake is less than 15 feet deep which is concentrated along the shoreline.  This lake can be accessed through a navigable channel northeast of the public access on Big Portage Lake (DOW 11-0308).  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Deep Portage Lake is in Lake Class 23. Lakes in this class are generally very deep and clear with a low percentage of shallow water areas.  Similar Lake Class 23 lakes in the Walker area include Grave, Hay, Horseshoe (near Backus), and Jack. The west shoreline of Deep Portage Lake is public land administered by Cass County.  The purpose of this survey was to assess the status of Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch populations in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nMuch of the shoreline along Deep Portage Lake is associated with relatively steep drop offs. Vegetation density and abundance in near shore areas is variable. Northern pike are abundant and average 20 inches long with fish over 30 inches long present. Walleye numbers are low, but averaged 23 inches long. Little is known about the Largemouth Bass population, but shoreline structure and vegetation are typical of good Largemouth Bass lakes. The same can be said for Bluegill and related shoreline vegetation and structure. Black Crappie are present but can be difficult to sample as they often suspend over deep water.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Deep Portage Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Deep Portage Lake on August 15th, 2023 to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 17 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 34 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 6.3?C (43.3?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for these species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for these species was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. Data collected in 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2017 also indicated suitable oxythermal habitat. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress.</p>",
