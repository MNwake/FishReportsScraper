The relatively small12 acre lake has almost eight littoral acres and a max depth of 44 feet, and a shoreline length about 0.7 miles.  There is one U.S. Forest Service carry-in access on the east side of lake.  Lucky has been exclusively managed for brown trout since being reclaimed in 1973.  Biennial spring stocking of yearling brown trout in even years has occurred since 1988. <br> \n <br> \nOne 24 hour gill net sampled 20 brown trout, and due to the high catch the other 24 hr net was not set.  Lengths ranged from 13 to 20.1 inches with an average length of 15.8 inches.  A total of 16 - half inch trap net sets sampled eight brown trout for a rate of 0.5/net.  Lengths ranged from 13.6 to 17.9 inches with an average length of 15.6 inches.  Length frequency from both gears suggests almost all of these fish are from the spring 2010 stocking indicating over-winter survival.  One 20 inch gill net sampled fish could have possibly originated from the 2008 stocking.  The 2006 assessment had a higher catch in both gears, 47 in one gill net and 40 in 32 trap net sets.  This high catch was predictable due to sampling the spring stocking and not directly comparable to the 2011 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net caught five white sucker while trap nets sampled 58 for a rate of 3.6/set.  Both gears caught more suckers and in less time than the previous assessment (gill net=3, trap nets=25).  Lengths from the trap net sample ranged from 7.9 to 16.1 inches with an average length of 12.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nGolden shiner were the most abundant species sampled in trap nets (n=89) and the gill net (n=27).  A combined length frequency indicated a wide distribution of sizes, 3.2 to 6.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNear shore sampling included setting four minnow traps.  A total of 14 brook stickleback, 176 fathead minnow, seven golden shiner, and 149 northern redbelly dace were sampled. <br> \n</p>",

Although most of the fish were 11 to 13 inches in length about 20% of those sampled were from 16 to 23 inches. The mean weight of the trout sampled in the trap nets was 1.1 pounds.

It is only 12 acres and is the only lake in the Grand Rapids management area to be managed exclusively for brown trout.  Brown trout have been stocked every other year with yearlings in even years since 1988.  The goal has been to keep trout abundance relatively low so that growth is high.Trout were not as abundant as in years past.  Two year classes appeared to be present, from the 1998 stocking and the 2000 stocking.  (Typically trout in Lucky Lake only live three years after stocking.)  Fish from the 2000 stocking generally ranged from 9.5 to 13 inches while the fish from the 1998 stocking were between 16 to 22 inches long.Golden shiners and suckers appear to be increasing in abundance and were likely brought in by anglers illegally using live bait.  There are also brook stickleback, fathead minnow and northern redbelly dace present.   Because brown trout eat fish, it is hoped that the presence of all the other fish species does not reduce the productivity of the lake for brown trout.  However, the abundance of all these other species may explain the apparent reduction in brown trout production.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lucky Lake is within the Soumi Hills semi-primitive wilderness area of the Chippewa National Forest.  All trails within the boundaries of this area prohibit motorized travel therefore access is limited to hikers and cross-country skiers.  The lake is located in a deep valley with access gained from either of two trails off a main trail that is part of the trail system. Maps are posted at several trail intersections to guide hikers and skiers.  This lake continues to be managed exclusively for brown trout.  Approximately 600 yearling brown trout are stocked every other year usually in May. Alternate year stocking allows yearlings to grow with less competition from older larger fish. Previous netting results and angler reports indicate that many yearling fish survive their first year in the lake but disappear after two years due to either angler or natural mortality or both.   <br> \n      <br> \nTemperature and dissolved oxygen levels were measured in mid August to determine how much of the lake contains suitable habitat for brown trout. The warmest water at the surface was 74 degrees F that can be tolerated by brown trout for short periods to allow surface feeding.  Temperature measurements from top to bottom indicated a thermocline layer from 14 to 20 feet, where water temperatures dropped rapidly. Although water temperatures were suitable for trout throughout the water column dissolved oxygen levels dropped rapidly at the top of the thermocline.  Dissolved oxygen levels above 5.0 ppm that are considered necessary for long term survival of most trout species, were only available down to 16 feet. This mid summer dissolved oxygen profile did indicate that brown trout could access the entire habitat within the littoral zone, down to 15 feet, or about 62% of the lakes sediments and all surface waters for food gathering purposes.   <br> \n <br> \nNetting was conducted in late October when water temperatures had cooled and brown trout are more actively pursuing food near the shoreline.  A gill net was set in deeper water to determine if larger brown trout were ranging too  far from shore to be caught in trap nets.    The first gill net lift yielded 47 brown trout and due to high catch rate no additional gill nets were set.  This catch rate was similar to those from the two previous assessments, 2000 and 1994,when 37 and 65 brown trout were sampled respectively.  A large portion, 85% or 41 of the brown trout were around 10.0 to 12.0 inches and were assumed to be yearlings that survived from the 600 yearlings stocked in May 2006. The remaining 15%, or 7 fish, were around 16.0 to 18.0 inches and were presumed to be survivors from yearlings stocked two years and 5 months earlier in May 2004. Note: No yearlings were stocked in 2005.     <br> \n   <br> \nEight trap net stations were set and lifted on four consecutive days (32 set days) and captured 40 brown trout.  This catch yielded a rate of 1.25 fish/net that is within the range of previous efforts (0.6-3.5 fish/net).   Ninety-three percent (37 fish) of the trap net catch were smaller brown trout that centered around the 9.5 to 11.5 length groups and assumed to be survivors from the yearlings recently stocked in May 2005. The remaining 7% (3 fish) ranged in size from 16.0-`18.0 and were assumed to be survivors from the 600 yearlings stocked in May 2004.     <br> \n <br> \nGrowth for yearling brown trout was  determined  from  76  assumed age-1 fish by comparing their their mean weight at capture and subtracting their mean weight when stocked.  All yearling brown trout in gill net and trap net catches had an average weight of 0.45 lbs and a average  length of 10.9 inches.  Stocking records reveal that these yearlings had an average weight of 0.24 lbs each (4.16 fish/lb) when stocked in mid May. Therefore yearling brown trout, stocked in May 2006, had an average weight gain of 0.21 lbs per fish.  <br> \n <br> \nGolden shiners appear to be increasing as the net catches were at an all time high.  Golden shiners were caught at a rate of 5.6/trap net compared to 2.7 fish/trap net in 2000 and 0.3 fish per net in 1994 and 0.0 in 1993.  Golden shiners have also increased in the 24 hr gill net set from 0 in 1994 to 4 fish in 2000 to 23 fish in this assessment.  Golden shiners ranged from 3.5 to 7.0 inches in the net catches.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite suckers have also become more frequent in the trap net catch as only one fish was captured in 24 sets in 1993 while three fish were captured in 32 sets in 2000 and 25 fish were captured in this assessment.  Individual white suckers ranged from 7 to 18 inches and were  uniformly distributed throughout this range.   <br> \n <br> \nGolden shiners and white suckers have been reintroduced since the last reclamation probably due to illegal use of live minnows for bait.    <br> \n  <br> \nFour minnow traps were also set and only captured 4 fathead minnows and 1 brook stickleback.        <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",
