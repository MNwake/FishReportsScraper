                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was completed in the spring of 2022 on Lake Amelia to assess the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  A special regulation that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 down to 10 was also implemented in the spring of 2022.  The goal of this new regulation is to maintain or increase the average size of Bluegill.  This survey will be used to help evaluate effects of the regulation on the Bluegill population.  Bluegill catch rates were low, but some quality fish were observed during the survey. About 37% of the Bluegill in the survey were over 8 inches in length.  Growth rates of Bluegill in Lake Amelia are moderate and 7 year old Bluegill averaged almost 8 inches in length.  The largest Bluegill observed in the survey was over 9 inches.  Black Crappie catch rates were moderate and the population consists of some very old and large fish.  Approximately 71% of the crappie in the survey were over 10 inches in length. Black Crappie growth rates are fast; average length of age 4 fish was 10 inches.  The largest Black Crappie in the sample was just shy of 14 inches and the oldest crappie was 14 years old. <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Lake Amelia.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of the fishery.  Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish can help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nLake Amelia was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2018.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Amelia is a relatively deep lake with many steep drop-offs.  The lake bottom is mostly rock andgravel which provides suitable spawning areas for walleye, but limits aquatic plant growth.  LakeAmelia does support dense beds of aquatic vegetation in areas where the bottom is suitable for plants,especially in the shallow, flat area located in the northwest corner of the lake.  Walleye are present in moderate numbers, averaging 4.3 fish/gillnet in 1993.  Fish average 1.2 poundsand range from 12 to 16 inches in length.  Walleye fry stocking is used to supplement naturalreproduction. Prior evaluations have indicated that fry stocking is as effective or more effective thanfingerling stocking in supplementing walleye numbers.  Northern pike numbers have decreased since thelast survey, which is similar to many other lakes in the area.  Low water levels during the late 1980'sand 1990 likely limited natural reproduction. This is evident in the present size structure.  Most ofthe fish are 24 to 32 inches in length and the average weight is 4.2 pounds.  Largemouth bass areabundant, however angling quality may be limited by the size structure of the population.  The averageweight of largemouth bass is 0.8 pounds and few fish are greater than 14 inches in length.  Bluegillare also abundant but small.  Only one in four fish exceeded 6 inches and no fish over 8 inches wascaptured during the survey.     </p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 14 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Amelia.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nFourteen species were collected during this survey.  Three species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter) were considered \"intolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.  No \"tolerant\" species were captured.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Amelia.</p>",

A special regulation that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 down to 10 was implemented in the spring of 2022. The goal of this new regulation is to maintain or increase the average size of Bluegill. This survey will be used to help evaluate effects of the regulation on the Bluegill population. Bluegill catch rates were low, but quality fish were observed during the survey. About 39% of the Bluegill in the survey were over 8 inches in length. Growth rates of Bluegill in Lake Amelia are moderate and 7 year old Bluegill averaged almost 8 inches in length. The largest Bluegill observed in the survey was 10.3 inches. Black Crappie catch rates were low and the population consists of some old and large fish. Approximately 81% of the crappie in the survey were over 10 inches in length. Black Crappie growth rates are fast; average length of age 5 fish was 11.6 inches. The largest Black Crappie observed in the survey was just shy of 14 inches and was 10 years old. <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Lake Amelia. Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of the fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish can help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nLake Amelia was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2018.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",

The strongest year class (age 3) appears to be a result of the 1982 fry stocking. This is a fast growing year class. Northern Pike abundance dropped from 7.63 fish/gillnet in 1980 to 3.63 now. Average size sampled is still very small. Yellow Perch numbers have declined but still are abundant enough to provide forage for the predator fish. Bluegill numbers have increased since the last survey but all fish measured were under 6 inches total length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gillnet catches for Walleye have decreased since the 1985 survey (11.25 fish/set to 3.25 fish/set). The 1987 fingerling stocking was a mix of age 0 and 1 fish. Fish of both age classes were captured in the netting survey. Yellow Perch relative density decreased greatly from the 1985 survey (24.25/set to 0.50/set). Northern Pike gillnet catch rates and mean weight have increased. Capture of age 1 or 2 Largemouth Bass indicates successful natural reproduction and recruitment in the last two years. Larger Largemouth Bass are undoubtedly present, but not subject to capture by nets. Bluegill catch rates and size structure would indicate an overabundant, slow-growing population. Further evaluation of the Largemouth Bass population and subsequent implementation of restrictive bass harvest regulations may be necessary to produce desirable shifts in panfish size structure.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Amelia is the lower basin in a chain of three lakes that form the headwaters of the east branch of the Chippewa River.  Lake Amelia differs from lakes Villard and Leven in that it is larger, deeper, and mesotrophic.  Lake Amelia is the deepest and fourth largest lake in Pope County.  It consistently ranks 2nd out of 15 lakes in terms of water quality indices monitored by the Pope County Coalition of Lake Associations.  Leven and Villard lakes likely act as sediment and nutrient sinks for the upper watershed and minimize pollutants entering Lake Amelia.  The lake bottom is mostly rock and gravel which provides suitable spawning habitat for walleye, but limits the abundance of aquatic plants.  The lakes does support dense beds of aquatic vegetation in areas where the bottom is suitable for plants, especially in the shallow, flat area in the northwest corner of the lake.  Bass and panfish anglers should note that most of this area is posted as a Fish Spawning Area.  Boating and fishing are prohibited in the posted area until July 1.  Lake Amelia is managed for walleye.  Fry are stocked in even numbered years to supplement the natural reproduction that occurs.  Previous investigations determined that fry stocking was as effective or more effective than fingerling stocking in supplementing walleye numbers in Lake Amelia.  Gill net catches averaged 10.5 fish/net in 1998.  This catch rate exceeds both the normal range of catch rates for this lake type and the goal of 8.0 fish/net stated in the Lake Management Plan.  Age-2 fish comprised 75% of the fish captured.  This year class corresponds to a fry stocking in 1996.  These fish averaged about 12 inches in length at time of capture in 1998.  Lake Amelia can also provide good fishing opportunities for other species.  Largemouth bass are relatively abundant and the size structure of the population is desirable.  About one-half of the fish are 12 inches in length or greater and 21% exceed 15 inches.  Largemouth bass growth is relatively slow in Lake Amelia.  It takes about five years for fish to reach 13 inches.  Slow growth makes the population vulnerable to overharvest.  Larger fish should be released to maintain the quality fishing.  Bluegill are also relatively abundant and slow growing.  Only 22% of the fish are 6 inches in length or greater and none exceed 8 inches.  Northern pike abundance is considered normal for this type of lake.  Fish measuring up to 29 inches were captured. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Amelia is a 910-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located 4 miles northeast of Glenwood in Pope County.  It is the lower basin in a chain of three lakes (Leven, Villard, and Amelia) forming the headwaters of the East Branch of the Chippewa River.  Lake Amelia is larger, deeper, and less fertile than Lakes Villard and Leven.  It is the deepest lake in Pope County and ranks second out of eighteen lakes in terms of water quality parameters monitored by the Pope County Coalition of Lake Associations.  Secchi disk transparency averages ten feet during summer months.  Leven and Villard lakes likely act as sediment and nutrient sinks and minimize pollutants in surface water entering Lake Amelia. <br> \n <br> \nBottom substrates of Lake Amelia are primarily sand, gravel and rock.  This provides suitable spawning habitat for walleye, but limits abundance of emergent aquatic vegetation.  There are dense stands of aquatic vegetation in areas where the bottom substrate is suitable for plants, especially in the shallow, flat area in the northwest corner of the lake.  Aquatic plants provide critical spawning and cover habitat for many fish species, especially bass and bluegill.  These areas need to be protected from shoreline alterations and destruction associated with shoreline use activities. <br> \n <br> \nLake Amelia is managed primarily for walleye.  Gillnet catches averaged 8.0 fish/net in 2008.  This is at the upper end of expected catch rates for lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics.  Walleye fry or fingerlings are stocked in even-numbered years to supplement the walleye population.   Mean length of sampled walleye was 14.4 inches.  The largest individual measured over 28 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 7.1 fish/net in 2008.  Average size of sampled fish was 19.5 inches and weighed 1.8 pounds.  The largest fish sampled measured 32.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass remain abundant.  Although only six percent of the sample exceeded 15 inches in length, larger individuals are present in the fishery.  The largest largemouth bass sampled measured 17.1 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are present in good numbers.  Trapnet catches averaged 25.2 fish/net.  Forty -four percent of the sampled fish exceeded 6.0 inches in length.  Average length was 5.3 inches.  The largest bluegill measured eight inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie also contribute to the fishery, but are not effectively sampled with standard survey gear during summer months. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Amelia is a 934-acre natural basin located approximately one mile southwest of the City of Villard in Pope County.  It is the lowermost basin in a chain of three lakes comprised of Leven, Villard, and Amelia lakes.  Lake Amelia is larger and much deeper than connected basins. Maximum depth is 69.0 feet.  Average depth is 21.0 feet.  Upstream Leven and Villard lakes remove and assimilate nutrients and sediments delivered from a large watershed before discharging to Lake Amelia.  Water clarity approaches 12.0 feet through much of the summer.  Severe algal blooms are rare.  Bottom soils are primarily sand and gravel.  Dense stands of emergent aquatic vegetation remain along the northwest shoreline.  The lake supports a diverse submergent plant community.  In response to very good water clarity, submergent plants grow to a depth of 19 feet. <br> \n <br> \nLake Amelia supports a healthy, robust fish community. Primary fish management is focused on the Walleye fishery.  Currently, Walleye are abundant in Lake Amelia.  Higher levels of natural recruitment have been observed in Lake Amelia's Walleye population in recent years.  Walleye fingerlings are also stocked in even-numbered years.  A gill net catch rate of 11.3 Walleye/net during the 2019 survey is above average.  Multiple year classes are well represented in the population, providing a variety of sizes for anglers to catch.  Length at capture varied from 8.5 to 26.4 inches. Approximately 73 percent of the Walleye caught in the survey were over 15 inches long. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance declined from the previous survey and currently could be considered moderate.  Smaller individuals typically dominate the Northern Pike population in Lake Amelia.  However, some larger fish were captured during the last survey.  Northern Pike measured in the 2019 survey ranged from 10.4 to 36.4 inches.   Anglers are encouraged to harvest small \"hammerhandle\" pike in this system. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are abundant in Lake Amelia.  Catch rates of Largemouth Bass in gill nets and by electrofishing were high.  Largemouth Bass growth is moderate and on average it takes 4.1 years for bass to reach 12 inches.  Size structure of the electrofishing catch described a quality fishery.  More than 50 percent of the bass were over 12 inches and the largest bass observed was 19.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates averaged 15.8 fish/trap net, which is typical for Lake Amelia.  Bluegill growth rates are moderate and on average, it takes Bluegill 4.9 years to reach 6 inches.  A fair number of Bluegill over 8 inches were caught during the survey, with the largest fish measuring 8.9 inches.  Lake Amelia also has the ability to produce some large crappies.  Black Crappies over 13 inches have been recorded in many surveys.  Black Crappie catch rates were moderate during 2019.  However, low catch rates of Black Crappie are typical during summer months. <br> \n   <br> \nFailure to catch Yellow Perch is cause for concern as they are typically an important prey species in many lakes.  Catch rates have been extremely low since 2003.  However, Walleye growth rates are acceptable, suggesting other prey fish are available in large enough numbers to sustain growth.  Multiple species of minnows and shiners were observed in near-shore surveys <br> \n. <br> \nYellow Bullheads are abundant and many are large enough to harvest. Ten-inch and larger Yellow Bullheads comprised 81 percent of bullheads captured in gill nets and some approached 14 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLake Amelia was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2018.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Amelia is a 910-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located about 4 miles northeast of Glenwood in Pope County.  It is the lower basin in a chain of three lakes (Leven, Villard, and Amelia) in the upper reaches of the East Branch of the Chippewa River.  Lake Amelia is larger, deeper, and less fertile than lakes Villard and Leven.  It is the deepest lake in Pope County and ranks first out of fourteen lakes in terms of water quality indices monitored by the Pope County Coalition of Lake Associations.  Seechi disk transparency averages about twelve feet during summer months.  Leven and Villard lakes likely act as sediment and nutrient sinks for the upper watershed and minimize pollutants in surface water entering Lake Amelia.The bottom substrate of Lake Amelia is mostly gravel, rock, and sand.  This provides suitable spawning habitat for walleye, but limits the abundance of aquatic plants.  There are dense beds of aquatic vegetation in areas where the bottom substrate is suitable for plants, especially in the shallow, flat area in the northwest corner of the lake.  These aquatic plants provide critical spawning and cover habitat for many fish species, especially bass and sunfish.  These areas need to be protected from shoreline alterations associated with residential development.  Lake Amelia is managed primarily for walleye.  Gill net catches averaged 7.0 fish/net in 2003.  This is within the normal range for lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics, and slightly below the management goal of 8 to10 fish/net stated in the Lake Management Plan.  Walleye fry or fingerlings are stocked in even-numbered years to supplement the natural reproducing walleye population.  The effectiveness of walleye stocking in Lake Amelia is unclear.  The biggest year class present in 2003 was two-year-old fish that correspond to a year of no stocking in 2001.  Lake Amelia also provides good fishing opportunities for other species.  Largemouth bass and bluegill are abundant.  Both species are experiencing slow growth rates, thus average size tends to be small.  Black crappie also contribute to the fishery, but are not effectively sampled with standard survey gear during summer months.  Northern pike are present in moderate numbers and several of the fish captured exceeded 30 inches in total length.           </p>",

It is the lowermost basin in a chain of three lakes comprised of Leven, Villard, and Amelia lakes.  Lake Amelia is larger and much deeper than connected basins.  Maximum depth is 69.0 feet.  Average depth is 21.0 feet. <br> \n <br> \nLake Amelia offers a high quality environment for sustained proliferation of native gamefishes.  Upstream Leven and Villard lakes remove and assimilate nutrients and sediments delivered from a large watershed before discharged to Lake Amelia.  Water clarity approaches 12.0 feet through much of the summer.  Severe algal blooms are rare.  Bottom soils are primarily sand and gravel.  Dense stands of emergent aquatic vegetation remain along the northwest shoreline.  The lake supports a diverse submergent plant community.  In response to very good water clarity, submergent plants grow to a depth of 19 feet.     <br> \n <br> \nLake Amelia supports a healthy, robust fish community.  Primary fish management is focused on the walleye fishery.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in even-numbered years to supplement inconsistent natural recruitment.  A gillnet catch rate of 16.0-walleye/net during the 2013 survey described an abundant population.  The population sample was comprised of 11 age groups.  Sizes at capture varied from 8.8 to 26.4 inches.  Average size was 15.5 inches and 1.5 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are also abundant.  Reproductive success and initial survival was good in 2008 and 2009.  Sizes captured in gillnets varied from 13.2 - 28.8 inches in total length.  Due to proportionally high numbers of four- and five-year-old fish making up the population sample, average size was 19.8 inches and weighed 1.7 pounds.  Due to a limited carrying capacity and competition, pike grow slowly beyond age 4.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the surplus pike.  <br> \n <br> \nFewer largemouth bass were captured during the 2013 survey than reported in preceding surveys.  Based on age distribution of electrofishing catch, declining abundance was partially attributable to loss of many old fish stemming from strong recruitment from the late-90s through 2003.  Fewer young bass have grown into the fishery since 2004.  A net reduction in bass abundance is considered desirable and will likely improve rate of growth.  The largest bass captured was estimated to be 14-years-old and measured 17.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch was also lower during the 2013 survey, suggesting that population abundance has declined.  Warm surface water temperatures during the August survey may have pushed older fish into deeper water and reduced the effectiveness of trapnets.  Average size of bluegills caught in gillnets was larger than that of trapnets.  The population sample did have a broad age distribution extending to age 12.  In contrast to age structure of bluegills captured in preceding surveys, none of the 11 age classes represented in the 2013 population sample could be described as strong.  A reduction in recruitment of young bluegill might be attributable to poor survival due to high densities of northern pike and walleyes.  No yellow perch, a primary prey for these predators, were caught during the 2013 survey.  Young bluegills may now make up a greater proportion of pike and walleye diets.  Based on this information a net decline in population abundance is likely a reality.  The average trapnet catch rate of 8.6-bluegill/net remains within the range of expected catches for similar lakes.  The largest bluegill caught during the survey measured 8.8 inches in total length.   <br> \n <br> \nOnly 16 black crappies were captured during the 2013 survey.  Low catch rates are not unexpected during summer months.  Most crappies large enough to escape predators will occupy deeper, cooler water during the heat of the summer.  This behavioral pattern makes them less vulnerable to capture with our sampling gears.  True to expectations, all 10.0-inch and larger crappies were captured in gillnets which are set offshore.  Size at capture varied from 4.1 to 13.5 inches in total length.  <br> \n <br> \nFailure to catch a yellow perch is cause for concern.  Catch rates were very low in the 2003 and 2008 surveys.  Adequate abundance and multiple size groups are extremely important to predator growth and fishing quality.  At a slow rate of growth, too many walleye, largemouth bass, and northern pike are lost to natural mortality before growing to large sizes.  Predators will also change their preferred diet to the young of other gamefishes.  A young walleye is an acceptable substitute of yellow perch.  Stocking performance can diminish due to poor survival of young walleye.  Again, anglers are strongly encouraged to help correct the current predator-prey imbalance by harvesting predators, particularly 14.0 to 21.0 inch northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullheads are abundant.  Many are large enough to harvest.  Ten-inch and larger yellow bullheads comprised 78% of bullheads captured in gillnets.  Average weight of captures was 0.7 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nChinese mystery snails are present in Lake Amelia.  Other aquatic invasive species such as zebra mussels and Eurasian water milfoil have not been detected.  As required by Minnesota Statue, boaters need to clean their equipment before entering and leaving the lake to prevent spread of these undesirable organisms. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Amelia Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 21-24 June 2021.  Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with one site sampled from the boat.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample ten sites, a 15-foot seine was used at two sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 21 native species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 21-23 June 2021 by IBI Program Staff.  Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Walleye comprised a majority of the catch by biomass.  The number of Bluegill sampled per net was just below the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 27 lakes and the average length was 6.4 inches, with 22% over 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Amelia Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Chippewa River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
