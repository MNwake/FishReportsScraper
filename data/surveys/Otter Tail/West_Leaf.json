                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in West Leaf Lake was conducted on August 20-21, 2018 by Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff. Fourteen sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all stations.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and a substantial fringe of dense emergent vegetation and water lilies and soft substrates prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 21 native species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey from July 2017 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for West Leaf Lake based on this survey is well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Redeye River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in West Leaf Lake was conducted on July 25, 2022 by Fergus Falls Area Fisheries Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen sampling stations, but two stations were moved a short distance due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at seven stations, and soft sediments and abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 21 species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicates West Leaf Lake is in good health as indicated by a high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leaf River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    West Leaf Lake is a 684-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in east-central Otter Tail County approximately two miles east of Ottertail, MN.  West Leaf Lake is connected to Middle Leaf Lake via an unnavigable culvert along the east shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots and marshland.  West Leaf Lake has a maximum depth of 55 feet; however, 37% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 11.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 5.6 to 9.9 feet.   <br> \n     Development is located around the entire shoreline of West Leaf Lake.  Homes and cabins compose the majority of the development.  One resort is located along the northeast shoreline.  A state owned concrete public access is located on a township road along the northeast shoreline off of County Highway 108.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  There are extensive areas of emergent aquatic plants (hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and common cattail) present in the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     West Leaf Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass panfish-Walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant game fish species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     <br> \n     A moderate density Walleye population exists.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.0 to 24.8 inches with an average length and weight of 17.3 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike are also moderately abundant.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that Northern Pike exhibit consistently good reproduction.  Pike ranged in length from 15.6 to 28.6 inches with an average length and weight of 21.4 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Pike growth rates are slow with an average length of 23.4 inches at five years of age <br> \n     Catch data indicate that Largemouth Bass are abundant.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 4.1 to 17.4 inches.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 12.4 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     The Bluegill catch rate was within the expected range for this type of lake.  Fifteen percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at five years of age. <br> \n      Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     West Leaf Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.     <br> \n </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Leaf Lake is a 684-acre moderately fertile lake located in east-central Otter Tail County approximately three miles west of Ottertail, MN.  West Leaf Lake is connected to Middle Leaf Lake via an unnavigable culvert along the east shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  West Leaf Lake has a maximum depth of 55 feet; however, 37% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2004 lake survey was 9.1 feet, indicating good water clarity.  West Leaf Lake is included in class 27 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.     Development is located around the entire shoreline of West Leaf Lake.  The 1994 lake resurvey report referenced 129 homes and cabins along the shoreline.  One resort is located along the northeast shoreline.  A state owned concrete public access is located on a township road along the northeast shoreline off of MN State Highway 108.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  There are extensive areas of emergent aquatic plants (harstem bulrush, wild rice, and common cattail) present in the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     West Leaf Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant game fish species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.         The test-net catch rate for walleye was below the normal range for lake class 27.  Walleye abundance has historically fluctuated.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.8 to 28.4 inches with an average length and weight of 17.4 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked by the DNR on a biennial basis to supplement limited natural reproduction.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.9 inches at four years of age.     The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the normal range for lake class 27.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that northern pike exhibit consistently good reproduction.  Pike ranged in length from 12.4 to 38.0 inches with an average length and weight of 20.3 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Pike growth rates are slow with an average length of 19.4 inches at four years of age.  The slow growth may correspond with the low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish.     Test-net catch data indicate that largemouth bass are abundant.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 4.7 to 16.3 inches.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 11.6 inches at four years of age.      The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range.  Bluegill abundance has fluctuated in previous surveys.  Bluegill size structure is poor with only 4% of the bluegill measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 6.6 inches at seven years of age.     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     West Leaf Lake is a 684-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in east-central Otter Tail County approximately two miles east of Ottertail, MN.  West Leaf Lake is connected to Middle Leaf Lake via an unnavigable fish passageway along the east shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots and marshland.  West Leaf Lake has a maximum depth of 55 feet; however, 37% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2022 lake survey was 11.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 5.6 to 11.5 feet.   <br> \n     Development is located around the entire shoreline of West Leaf Lake.  Homes and cabins compose the majority of the development.  One resort is located along the northeast shoreline.  A state owned concrete public access is located on a township road along the northeast shoreline off of County Highway 108.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  There are extensive areas of emergent aquatic plants (hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and common cattail) present in the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     West Leaf Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-Walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant game fish species in the fish community.   <br> \n     A moderate density Walleye population exists.  Walleyes ranged in length from 13.6 to 22.6 inches with an average length and weight of 18.0 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.2 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike are also moderately abundant.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 17.1 to 25.7 inches with an average length and weight of 20.7 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Pike growth rates are slow with an average length of 22.8 inches at five years of age <br> \n     Catch data indicate that Largemouth Bass are abundant.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is also consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 7.9 to 18.8 inches.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 12.2 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has historically remained very stable.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  A quality size structure exists, with Bluegills up to 9.8 inches represented in the sample.  Thirty-one percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length, while 16% were 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 8.2 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     West Leaf Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Leaf Lake is located in east-central Otter Tail County, 3 miles west of the town of Ottertail.  The lake is 684 acres in size, and reaches a maximum depth of 55 feet.  There is a public access on a township road on the northeast shore of the lake off of MN State Highway 108.  There is an unnavigable tributary that flows from Gourd Lake, and an outlet that flows to Middle Leaf Lake.  A small dam at the outlet maintains the lake level and prevents rough fish from entering the lake from downstream.  The secchi depth was 9.9 feet, indicating good water quality.  Landowners can protect quality by properly maintaining their septic systems, using fertilizers that do not contain phosphorous, and maintaining a vegetated buffer along the shoreline.     There are extensive areas of emergent, floating, and submerged aquatic plants present in the lake.  Aquatic vegetation is important to fish for spawning, rearing, and feeding habitat, and is utilized by migratory waterfowl for food.  Because of its importance, there are state regulations designed to protect aquatic plants.  Landowners should contact the DNR to learn about specific rules before undertaking any aquatic vegetation removal.     Leaf Lake supports a diverse fishery, with good populations of walleye, bluegill, northen pike, and largemouth bass.  There are also moderate numbers of black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, and several species of non-game fish.     Walleye averaged 6.8 per gill net, while in 1994 catches averaged 9.1 per net, the highest ever surveyed in the lake.  The statewide median for this type of lake is 5.5.  Walleye averaged 15.3 inches and 1.33 lbs., and 32% were greater than 16 inches.  The 1996 year class is strong, comprising 57% of the catch.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked into the lake at a rate of 1 lb. per acre (256 lbs.) in alternate years.  Natural reproduction is occurring, but the most abundant year classes have corresponded to stocked years, indicating that stocking supplements walleye natural reproduction in the lake.  Walleye averaged 15.4 inches at age 4, while the area average for this type of lake is 14.9 inches at age 4.     Northern pike decreased from 9.0 per gill net in the 1994 survey to 6.8, which is within the expected range for this type of lake.  Pike averaged 18.5 inches, and 6% were greater than 24 inches.  West Leaf Lake has abundant spawning habitat for northern pike.  Reproduction was consistent, as 7 consecutive year classes were sampled.  Pike averaged 17.7 inches at age 4, while the area average for this type of lake is 22.1 inches.     Yellow perch catch rates were low, averaging 0.83 per gill net.  Catch rates are typically low on this lake, and are likely the result of high predator (northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass) populations.  The average size of yellow perch was 5.6 inches.     Bluegill numbers were similar to the previous survey, averaging 17.5 per trap net.  This approximates the statewide median (16.2) for this lake type.  Bluegill averaged 5.5 inches, and 14% were greater than 7 inches.  The 1994 survey found that 10% exceeded 7 inches.  Bluegill growth was good, averaging 6.0 inches at age 5, while the area average for this lake type is 5.6 inches.     Largemouth bass averaged 1.0 per trap net and 1.1 per gill net, both of which are within the expected range for this type of lake.  Catches from previous years have been similar.  The average size was 12.7 inches in gill nets, and 6.5 inches in trap nets.  Neither gill nor trap nets are efficient at sampling largemouth bass, especially larger fish, so the bass population is likely under-represented by this sample.  Largemouth averaged 12.1 inches at age 6, while the area average for this lake type is 14.6 inches.     Black crappie averaged 0.4 per gill net and 0.7 per trap net, which are within their respective interquartile ranges for this lake class.  Crappie are not efficiently sampled in summer when the survey was performed, so the population is likely under-represented.  Crappie averaged 9.3 inches in gill nets and 10.2 inches in trap nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     West Leaf Lake is a 684-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in east central Otter Tail County approximately two miles east of Ottertail, MN.  West Leaf Lake is connected to Middle Leaf Lake via an unnavigable culvert along the east shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots and marshland.  West Leaf Lake has a maximum depth of 55 feet; however, 37% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2010 lake survey was 8.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.6 to 9.9 feet.   <br> \n     Development is located around the entire shoreline of West Leaf Lake.  The 1994 lake resurvey report referenced 129 homes and cabins along the shoreline.  One resort is located along the northeast shoreline.  A state owned concrete public access is located on a township road along the northeast shoreline off of County Highway 108.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  There are extensive areas of emergent aquatic plants (harstem bulrush, wild rice, and common cattail) present in the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     West Leaf Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass panfish-walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant game fish species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically fluctuated.  In this survey, the test-net catch rate was within the expected range for this type of lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.2 to 23.0 inches with an average length and weight of 15.7 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Historically, the northern pike population has remained abundant.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that northern pike exhibit consistently good reproduction.  Pike ranged in length from 9.2 to 26.4 inches with an average length and weight of 18.5 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Pike growth rates are slow with an average length of 22.1 inches at six years of age.  The slow growth may correspond with a low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish. <br> \n     Test-net catch data indicate that largemouth bass are abundant.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 4.2 to 15.6 inches.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 11.8 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Historically, the bluegill population has exhibited large fluctuations in abundance.  The test-net catch rate for this survey was within the expected range.  Fifteen percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.3 inches at eight years of age. <br> \n      Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n</p>",

Average weight of northern pike was 1.2 lbs. Fifty percent of the northern pike aged were age-3+, indicating a strong 1986 year class.  Bluegill abundance was 66.8 per trap net, which is a slight decrease from 72.4 per net in 1984, but still well above area medians. Seven percent of the bluegills measured were greater than 7 inches in length compared to 10% in 1984. None of the bluegills were greater than 8.0 inches.  Five age-classes were represented.  Yellow perch abundance was 0.5 per gill net, which is a significant decline from the two previous surveys (1984-10.7, 1978-19.8). Walleye abundance was 1.8 per gill net, which is a decline from previous surveys (1984-4.8, 1978-6.5), while the average weight was 2.1 lbs. Age data for walleye indicates little evidence of natural reproduction.  Abundances of all three bullhead species are well above area medians.  Black bullheads were especially abundant at 55.5 per gill net.</p>",
