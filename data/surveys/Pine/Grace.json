                "narrative": "<p>  Fisheries crews conducted a fish population assessment on Grace Lake in July 1993.  Two gill nets and six trap nets were set to obtain current data on the fish population.  Grace is a small, shallow lake and has a history of low winter oxygen levels, although a complete winterkill has never been documented. The lake is managed for northern pike and panfish.  Northern pike numbers were considered normal for this type of lake, and have been similar in the last three surveys.  The average weight was 6.1 pounds.  All northern pike sampled were between 24 and 33 inches, and were 4-7 years old.  Northern pike seen during the survey were reported to be large and in good condition.  Numbers of black crappies were in the average range for this lake type.  The highest numbers of crappies were in the 5.5-6 inch range, but there were some 11 and 13 inch crappies seen.  Bluegill numbers have been low-average in all of the surveys that have been done on Grace Lake.  Bluegills seen in the 1993 assessment were in the 5.7-8.5 inch length range, and 1/3 of the total catch was over 8 inches.  Black bullhead and white sucker abundances were both high for this lake type.  Several carp were seen in nets.  Other species in Grace Lake include yellow perch, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, common shiner, and golden shiner.  An attempt was made to sample largemouth bass by electrofishing, but none were seen in the entire length of shoreline.  Report prepared by Deborah Sewell, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Located in eastern Pine County, entirely within the St. Croix State Forest, Grace Lake is assigned to lake class 37 due to it's  small size (53 acres) and it's shallow, soft water.  The Division of Forestry maintains a public access on the southwest shore.  A portion of the access road was under water in 2003 due to a beaver dam at the lakes outlet, but access was possible with a four wheel drive.  Despite low winter oxygen levels catch rates have been fairly stable since 1978.  The largemouth bass population remains low.  The entire shoreline was electrofished in May but only 4 bass were captured.  The bass ranged from 13.8 to 15.1 inches.  The 1998 catch rate and size structure was similar.  The northern pike catch at 3.5 per net remained within the normal range for the lake class and was similar to the 1998 rate.  Pike size did decline in the sample with no fish exceeding 24 inches.  The black crappie catch rate (8.7/trapnet) also remained in the normal range and similar to the 1998 rate.  Crappie size was lower but still respectable with a range from 4.1 to 11.7 inches and a average weight of a third pound.  Bluegill numbers, 3.2 per net, were up slightly from 1998 but typical for the lake class.  Size quality remained good with more than half the catch exceeding 8 inches.  Yellow perch abundance was low with a total of only 6 fish sampled in the 9 trapnets and 2 gillnets.  Catches of white sucker, common carp, and black bullhead were similar to past assessments and typical of lake class 37.Fall shoreline seining found bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass young of the year. Anglers visiting Grace Lake can expect light fishing pressure.  Northerns and crappies should be available in catchable numbers as well nice sized bluegill.</p>",

A concerned citizen had contacted the office wondering if the lake had winterkilled.  A targeted survey had been done on September 7 and 8 of 2021.  In that survey three standard survey nets and three walleye pond nets were set for one night and a variety of species had been found. <br> \n <br> \nSix trap nets (three standard lake survey nets and three walleye pond nets) were placed randomly around the lake in 2022. The following species were caught in the trap nets: Common Shiner, Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Black Crappie, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Common Carp, and Bowfin. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 344 fish were caught. Bluegill was the greatest percent of the catch with 269 fish. The fewest were Common Shiner, Black Bullhead, and Common Carp with one of each species caught. Based on the catch, the fish population in Graces Lake appears to be stable at the present time. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> In July 1988 a lake survey was conducted on Grace Lake.  Two gillnets and four trapnets were set to obtain data of the present fish population.  Of the four trapnets used, one was eliminated from the survey due to excessive muskrat holes. Shoreline seining efforts were conducted in August to evaluate natural reproduction in conjunction with the lake survey.  <br> \n  Based on respective local medians the present fish population is as follows:  The northern pike (5.50/set) net catch was the same as the previous survey net catch in 1978 (5.50/set) and was above the local median catch (3.88/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 11.5 to 30.9 inches with a median length group of 23.0 - 23.9 inches.  This group was larger than the median length group of 1978 (20.0 - 20.9 inches).  Mean weight was 3.24 pounds compared to 2.67 pounds in 1978.  Growth rates of the northern pike sampled expressed normal growth when related to statewide average growth rates. <br> \n  The walleye (1.00/set) net catch was below the local median catch (3.52/set).  The median length group was 16.0 - 16.9 inches with a mean weight of 1.75 pounds.  These fish were of age group II and experienced fast growth up to the time of capture.  This occurrence of walleye (as noted in Item 37) was either from migration via Lower Tamarack River or a private stocking.  <br> \n  The yellow perch (2.50/set) net catch showed a real decrease from the previous survey (12.00/set) and remains below the local median catch (24.27/set).  The 1988 survey found yellow perch to be represented by age groups II-V.  Shoreline seining in August did not record any young-of-year in the 0.36 acre area sampled.  <br> \n  Largemouth bass were not sampled in the previous surveys of 1978 and 1967, however, one was caught in the 1988 gillnet catch (0.50/set).  This fish was 11.9 inches and of age group II.  It expressed fast growth up to the time of capture. Young-of-year largemouth bass were never recorded by shoreline seining efforts. <br> \n  The bluegill sunfish (4.33/set) net catch was up slightly from the two previous surveys but remained well below the local median catch (25.67/set).  Of the thirteen fish trapped, they ranged from 7.0 to 8.9 inches with a median length group of 7.5 - 7.9 inches.  Median length groups in 1978 and 1967 were 6.0 - 6.4 and 7.5 - 7.9 inches, respectively. Shoreline seining efforts recorded 85 young-of-year in the 0.36 acre area seined.  <br> \n  The black crappie (25.33/set) net catch was up from 1978 (9.50/set) and was above the local median catch (18.45/set). The length frequency distribution ranged from 4.5 to 10.4 inches with a median length group of 7.0 - 7.4 inches.  Of 38 fish aged, a good year-class distribution showed fish present from age I to age VII.  In 1978 the length frequency was 4.5 to 11.4 inches with a median length group of 7.5 - 7.9 inches.  The 1967 survey did not record any black crappie taken in the sampling gear used.  <br> \n  Pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled in seining efforts but not in the gillnets or trapnets.  Three bullhead species, black, yellow, and brown were captured in the sampling gear.  The black bullhead had a trapnet catch of 14.33/set and a gillnet catch of 34.00/set.  Both catches were down from the previous survey, however, black bullheads still remain as the dominant bullhead species present in Grace Lake.  Yellow and brown bullheads had relatively low net catches.  Other species taken in sampling gear used (bowfin and white sucker) did not appear to be substantially above or below their local median net catches nor to have undergone any noteworthy changes. <br> \n</p>",

The Division of Forestry maintains a public access on the southwest shore.  Despite low winter oxygen levels fish net catch rates have been fairly stable since 1978.   <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass population remains low.  The entire shoreline was electrofished in May but only two bass were captured, 15.0 and 15.5 inches.  Previous bass catch rates and size structures were similar.  The northern pike catch at 7 per gill net was historically the highest recorded but that catch rate was still well within the normal range for the lake class.  Pike quality has improved since 2003 with one third of the catch exceeding 26 inches in length.  The black crappie catch rates (9/trap net and 11/gill net) fell just below and above the 75th percentile respectively.  Crappie averaged 0.3 pounds with nearly a third of the catch 9 inches or greater in length.    Bluegill numbers, 3.6 per trap net, were very similar to the previous sample and typical for the lake class.  Size quality slipped some but 40% of the catch exceeded 7 inches.  Yellow perch numbers increased from the 2003 catch and returned to levels near the historic average for Grace Lake.  Perch were small with no individuals reaching 8 inches. The black bullhead catch was down dramatically.  Common carp were not sampled in 2008. <br> \n  <br> \nAnglers visiting Grace Lake can expect light fishing pressure.  Northerns, bluegill and crappies should be available in size and numbers acceptable to anglers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grace Lake, located in eastern Pine County, is a shallow 53 acre lake that is managed primarily for northern pike with black crappie and bluegill sunfish as the secondary species.  The lake has been assigned to lake class 37 based on seven different parameters.According to historical winter oxygen monitoring records, Grace Lake has the potential to undergo partial winterkills during severe winters.  In the event of any degree of winterkill, fish stocking occurs naturally via the inlet and outlet, which are connected to Benjamin and Stevens Lakes, and the Lower Tamarack River, respectively.A standard lake survey was conducted during the week of July 20, 1998 to evaluate the current status of the fish population, the physical, chemical and biological factors concerning habitat, and the water quality.  Standardized gear types used to evaluate the fish population included spring night electrofishing, two gill nets, six trap nets, and three shoreline seine hauls.  The selected gear types were chosen based on guidelines obtained from the MN DNR Manual of Instructions for Lake Survey.  Habitat and water quality data were also collected based on guidelines from this manual.Northern pike numbers along with the average weight ( 3.2 lbs.) were found to be within a normal range for this type of lake.  Measured fish extended from 12.8 to 30.9 inches with an average length of 22.6 inches.  Grace Lake northern pike growth was well above normal at all ages when compared to statewide averages.Spring night electrofishing sampled the entire shoreline on June 4, 1998 for largemouth bass.  A catch rate of 7.6 fish/hour was determined along with an average weight of 1.9 pounds.  Since catch rate averages for this gear type by lake class have not been formally developed, comparisons were not made.  Previous electrofishing conducted in 1993, which also fished the entire shoreline, did not sample any largemouth.  Total lengths ranged from 14.3 to 15.4 inches with an average length of 14.8 inches.  Largemouth growth was typical of normal when compared to statewide averages.The abundance of black crappie was found to be within a normal range along with the average weight (0.4 lbs.).  Black crappie lengths ranged from 4.1 to 11.3 inches with an average length of 9.0 inches.  When average back calculated lengths were compared to statewide averages, black crappie growth was representative of normal at all ages.Bluegill sunfish numbers were determined to be below normal while the average weight, at 0.4 pounds, was found to exceed the normal range for lakes of this type.  Total lengths extended from 4.9 to 9.8 inches with an average length of 7.7 inches.  Bluegill sunfish growth was determined to be above average at all ages when compared to statewide averages of similar lakes.  Yellow perch numbers were found at a normal level while the average weight, at 0.08 lbs., was below normal for this lake class.  Measured perch lengths ranged from 5.2 to 6.9 inches with an average length of 6.0 inches.On July 20, 1998, three shoreline seine hauls were utilized to sample natural reproductive success.  Bluegill sunfish and yellow perch both showed good reproductive success while black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike and white sucker showed some successful natural reproduction.The fish species composition in Grace Lake also included black bullhead, common carp, common shiner, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, Johnny darter, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.  Black bullhead and pumpkinseed sunfish were normal in abundance while common carp and white sucker fell below normal in numbers.  </p>",
