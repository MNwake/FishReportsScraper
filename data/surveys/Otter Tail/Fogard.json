                "narrative": "<p>Fogard Lake is a 65-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Maine, MN.  Fogard Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The immediate watershed of Fogard Lake is composed primarily of woodlands interspersed with agricultural and pasture land.  The maximum depth of Fogard Lake is 42 feet; however, 68% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the survey was 11.5 feet, indicating excellent water clarity.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms during the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  At the time of the assessment, water levels were extremely high so the previous benchmarks could not be located.  Two new benchmarks were established.  Fogard Lake is included in lake class 28 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.     The entire shoreline of Fogard Lake is privately owned and  very little shoreline development exists.  The light development consists of three houses with docks and one seasonal cabin.  The access is a privately owned earthen access which is located along the west shoreline of the lake.  Fogard Lake has a prevalent wild rice fringe.  Common cattail are also abundant along the shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as wild rice and common cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  Submergent vegetation is prevalent along the south and west shorelines.     Since the access is privately owned and public access is restricted, Fogard Lake receives little fishing pressure.  Fogard Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Black crappie, bluegill, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, northern pike, and pumpkinseed sunfish are the dominant fish species in Fogard Lake.  Fogard Lake also had a high catch rate of hydrid sunfish, which commonly occurs in lakes with over abundant areas of submergent vegetation.  Growth of gamefish species may be limited by a low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish.     A moderate-density northern pike population exists.  The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistent.  Northern pike size structure is poor; pike ranged in length from 17.6 to 21.5 inches with an average length and weight of 19.9 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Growth rate estimates were slow.  Pike attain an average length of 18.2 inches at four years of age.      A high-density slow growing largemouth bass population appears to exist.  The largemouth bass test-net catch rate exceeded the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction may be inconsistent.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 4.5 to 17.3 inches with an average length and weight of 8.3 inches and 0.5 pounds.  Growth rate estimates are extremely slow; bass attain a mean length of 9.6 inches at five years of age.         The black crappie test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Age data indicate that crappie reproduction is consistently good.  Crappies ranged in length from 3.2 to 11.1 inches with an average length and weight of 7.6 inches and 0.3 pounds.  Sixty percent of the black crappies sampled were at least 8.0 inches in length.  Black crappie growth is moderate with a mean length of 8.0 inches at four years of age.        The bluegill test-net catch rate was well below the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Age and growth estimates indicate that the bluegill population is young and slow growing.  The oldest bluegills sampled corresponded to the 1999 year class.  Bluegills ranged in length from 3.0 to 5.8 inches with an average length of 4.1 inches.  Bluegill attain an average length of 4.2 inches at three years of age.     Pumpkinseed sunfish were the most abundant fish specie sampled during the population assessment.  The pumpkinseed test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Fourteen percent of the pumpkinseed sunfish were 7.0 inches or greater in length. </p>",
