                "narrative": "<p>Pleasant Lake is a 509-acre general development lake located within the city limits of Annandale in Wright County.  About fifty percent of the lake area is littoral with 3.9 miles of shoreline.  Pleasant Lake has a maximum depth of 74 feet.   Two accesses provide anglers boat launching opportunities.  Pleasant Lake has been stocked with walleye fingerlings every other year for several decades.  In 2001 it was included with many other lakes as part of the statewide walleye stocking study.  The last lake survey was conducted in 1997 but gill net assessments were done in 2001 and 2004. <br> \n <br> \nCurled pondweed was assessed at the time of peak abundance on June 7th, 2007.  It grew near the surface over 0.8 acres or less than 1% of the entire basin.   Coontail and muskgrass were the most common submersed aquatic plants in the lake.  Submersed plants grew out to a depth of 20 feet.  At the time the survey was conducted in the latter part of July oxygen was available to fish down to a depth of 16 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nFew changes in the fisheries are apparent between the 1997 and 2007 surveys.   Northern pike and bluegill are still abundant, while yellow perch and black crappie are not. Northern pike numbers are above the normal range and the average size northern pike is 2.2 pounds.   Anglers can expect good fishing for small northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nA primary management species for Pleasant Lake is largemouth bass.  Pleasant Lake has an excellent bass population with a wide range of sizes available to anglers including fish up to 20 inches.  Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing on May 7, 2007.  A total of 94 largemouth bass were captured in just over an hour of effort for a catch rate of 92.4 fish/hr.  This is 50% higher than the average catch rate (63.4 fish/hr) for Montrose Area lakes and greater than that reported in 1997, (16.4 fish/hr).   <br> \n <br> \nBecause Pleasant Lake has been part of the statewide walleye stocking study it has been netted three times since 1997.  The catch has remained somewhat higher over the past 10 years and the average length of walleye was 20.6 inches.  It appears that the population, which consists entirely of stocked fish, is surviving despite the high numbers of northern pike and the lack of yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were abundant though the catch appeared to be less than that of 1997.   <br> \nThe average length was 5.5 inches.  The largest bluegill captured was 8.4 inches.  Historically, bluegill have been abundant and small. <br> \n <br> \nPleasant Lake has a low population of black crappie.  The catch rate of black crappie in 2007 was similar to 1997.  Average length was about 8.5 inches. The largest black crappie was nearly eleven inches long and six years old.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species in the fish community include hybrid, green and pumpkinseed sunfish, johny darter, banded killifish, and black and yellow bullheads.    <br> \n <br> \nMaintaining the water quality in Pleasant Lake should be a high priority of the county and landowners around the lake.  Buffer strips on inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the lake. Maintaining adequate septics and keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out the lake will help reduce nutrients entering the lake, thus slowing algae and excess vegetation growth. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Northern Pike numbers were above the expected range for lakes similar to Pleasant; this was similar to the last survey.  Ages 2-7 made up the catch, with a strong 1988 year class.  Growth rates for Northern Pike were average.  Lengths ranged from 16-32 inches.  Walleye numbers showed a significant increase from the 1986 survey and were above the expected range for similar lakes.  Most of the Walleye were age 5, from the 1986 stocking, and had lengths of 19 to 20 inches.  The average weight was nearly three pounds and growth was average.  Yellow Perch numbers were within the expected range and increased significantly from low numbers in 1986. Lengths ranged from 5-7.9 inches.  \n\nImportant species sampled in trap nets included: Black, Yellow, and Brown Bullhead, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass.  All three bullhead species had large average sizes, with lengths ranging from 7.5-14 inches.  Bluegill numbers were high and unchanged since the last survey.  Lengths ranged from 2-7.9 inches with most Bluegill in the four inch length group.  Pumpkinseed were also abundant, but average size was large (0.2 pounds).  Most Pumpkinseed were 5-6 inches in length.  Black Crappie numbers and average size were within the expected range for lakes similar to Pleasant, with most fish in the seven inch length group.  \n\nThe electrofishing catch for Largemouth Bass was 36 per hour, or 19.7 pounds per hour. Lengths ranged from 5-15.9 inches, and 27% of catchable size fish (>8 inches) were over 12 inches.  Ages 2-8 were present and growth rates for Largemouth Bass were average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Pleasant Lake was conducted on August 9, 2017 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 14 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 12 stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Pleasant Lake is in poor health as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-St. Cloud Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Subsequently, they say, Northern Pike are not attracted to the natural spawning areas upstream and fishing has suffered due to lack of reproduction and recruitment. (This problem is being studied further by other fisheries personnel). The Walleye population was about average, but average weight was 3 pounds. Northern Pike numbers were several times the statewide average with a good size range and 2.5 pounds average weight. The Bluegill population is stunted.  Black Crappie numbers were less than the statewide average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pleasant Lake is a 509 acre lake located at the City of Annandale.  The lake has 3.9 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 74 feet.  During late June 1997, there was adequate dissolved oxygen for fish to a depth of 25 feet.  The lakeshore is highly developed with about 80% of the shoreline taken up by residential areas of the city of Annandale.  Thirty aquatic plant species were identified in the 1997 survey.  There is a county-owned access on the north side of the lake in the county park as well as a city-owned access on the south shore off CSAH 5.Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, Largemouth Bass and Walleye are all present in the lake.  A lake survey conducted in the summer of 1997 revealed the following information about the fish population.The Northern Pike catch rate was 13.2/gill net, which is higher than expected for lakes similar to Pleasant.  The average Northern Pike weighed 1.8 pounds and was 19.8 inches long, which was smaller than expected for the lake type.  Northern Pike growth was average compared to other populations in the state.  The gill net catch of Walleye (2.8/gill net) was in the expected range for this lake type.  Walleye averaged 3.0 pounds and 20.0 inches, which is larger than expected.  The Yellow Perch catch rate was 0.3/gill net, which is lower than expected.  The trap net catch of Black Crappie (2.5/trap net) was in the expected range for the lake class.  The average Black Crappie was 4.6 inches long, and 88% of the Black Crappie sampled were less than 5 inches long. The Bluegill catch rate (73.5/trap net) was higher than expected.  The average Bluegill length was 5.5 inches and lengths ranged from 2.8-7.9 inches long.  Bluegill growth rates were average for the lake type, but this is still slow:  typical Bluegill did not reach 6 inches long until age 6.  Young-of-year Bluegill were caught in shoreline seine hauls.Largemouth Bass were caught by spring electrofishing.  A total of 41 fish were caught at a rate of 16.4 fish/hour of run-time, which is close to the area average.  Largemouth Bass averaged 1.7 pounds and 13.7 inches long.  A large proportion of fish were over 12 inches long.  Pleasant Lake has excellent spawning habitat and young Largemouth Bass were common in shoreline seine hauls.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pleasant Lake is a 509 acre lake located within the city limits of Annandale in Wright County. Pleasant Lake has a relatively small watershed (3,283 acres) in which land use consists of agriculture (35%), open water (20%), residential (20%), hay/pasture (9%), forest (8%), wetland (5%) and grassland (3%). About fifty percent of the lake area is littoral with 3.9 miles of shoreline. Pleasant Lake has a maximum depth of 74 feet and two public accesses that provide anglers boat launching opportunities. Pleasant Lake has been stocked with Walleye fingerlings every other year for several decades. A standard summer survey was conducted in 2017 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2007. Near shore Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) sampling and emergent and floating leaf vegetation mapping were also completed to evaluate the physical habitat of Pleasant Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nPleasant Lake has a diverse aquatic plant community. While no submerged plant survey was conducted in 2017, the last submerged plant survey conducted in 2007 found 21 species of aquatic plants growing to a depth of 20 feet. Coontail, chara, bushy pondweed, water celery, and sago pondweed being the most common. Emergent plants were mapped in 2017 and found to cover 27% of the shoreline. Species found were yellow water lily (13 acres), cattail spp. (4 acres) and bulrush spp. (1 acres). <br> \n <br> \nPleasant Lake has an excellent bass population with a wide range of sizes available to anglers including fish up to 20 inches. Largemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing on May 24, 2017. A total of 105 Largemouth Bass were captured in just over two hours of effort for a catch rate of 52.3 fish/hr. This is higher than the average daytime catch rate (43 fish/hr) for Sauk Rapids Area lakes but lower than that reported in 2007 when sampling was conducted at night, (92.4 fish/hr).   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was above average for the Lake Class, but near the long term average for Pleasant Lake. Northern Pike averaged 21.4 inches and 2.1 pounds. Twenty-three percent of Northern Pike sampled were longer than 24 inches and no fish over 30 inches were sampled. Anglers can expect good fishing for small Northern Pike and are encouraged to harvest small pike (under 22 inches) and release the larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and to improve growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also increase Walleye stocking success and allow Yellow Perch numbers (which are low) to increase. Higher perch populations are desirable as they are an important prey species for both Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Walleye was identical to that of 2007 and near the long term average. The average size of Walleye was 19 inches and 2.4 pounds. Growth of Walleye was faster than the statewide average. Walleye reached 15 inches in three years. It appears that the population, which consists entirely of stocked fish, is surviving despite the high numbers of Northern Pike and the lack of Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were abundant though the catch was less than that of 2007. The average length was 5.3 inches and the largest was 8.1 inches. Historically, Bluegill in Pleasant Lake have been abundant and small. Pleasant Lake has historically had a low population of Black Crappie and 2017 was no exception. The catch of Black Crappie in 2017 was similar to the past two surveys. Average length was 9.4 inches and the largest was over 13 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included: Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. All of these species were sampled at rates within or below the range of expected values for the lake class except Yellow Bullhead, which was well above the range of expected values. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2017, Pleasant Lake was designated infested with Eurasian watermilfoil. Lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Pleasant Lake was conducted on August 15th, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 14 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 12 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on August 15th - 17th, 2019 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Yellow Bullhead and Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by biomass.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap data were combined with gill net data from the week of  July 23rd, 2018 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (St. Cloud) Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pleasant Lake is a 509 acre lake located within the city limits of Annandale in Wright County. Pleasant Lake has a maximum depth of 74 feet. Two public accesses provide anglers boat launching opportunities. A targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted on Pleasant Lake from May 24 25, 2017. Targeted surveys using trap nets around spawning time can give a more accurate picture of Bluegill size structure than standard surveys conducted later in the summer. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 380 Bluegill were caught; lengths ranged from 3.5 to 8.2 inches with an average length of 6.2 inches. Fisheries biologists describe the size structure of a fish population using terms such as Proportional Stock Density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD). For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of Bluegill larger than three inches that are also larger than six inches. The PSD of Bluegill from Pleasant was 69. So, 69% of the Bluegill sampled larger than three inches were also larger than six inches.  Similarly, RSD-8 is the percentage of Bluegill larger than three inches that are also larger than eight inches.  The RSD-8 on Pleasant Lake was < 1. These results seem average for overall size, but poor for larger Bluegill. Recent targeted Bluegill surveys in the Sauk Rapids Area have found a PSD range from 26 to 95 and an RSD-8 range from 0 to 54. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish were also caught; a total of 20 Pumpkinseed and 45 Hybrid Sunfish were captured. Pumpkinseed lengths ranged from 4.8 to 7.5 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches. Hybrid Sunfish lengths ranged from 3.9 to 9.3 inches with an average length of 7.6 inches. A total of 20 Black Crappie were also caught; lengths ranged from 8.5 to 12.7 inches with an average length of 10.3 inches. Black Crappie likely finished spawning earlier and were not targeted in the current survey. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill grow slowly in central Minnesota taking up to eight years to reach eight inches. Therefore anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill. Especially adult males which are more colorful during the spring time when they are in the process of spawning and are more easily exploited by anglers. The larger male Bluegills are important to maintaining a healthy size structure as they restrict reproduction by smaller males, allowing the smaller males to put more energy into growth and less into reproduction. Anglers can help to improve fishing for Bluegill on Pleasant Lake by selectively harvesting medium sized females and releasing larger males. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Pleasant Lake was conducted on August 6-7, 2018 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 14 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 12 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-St. Cloud Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
