The yellow perch was very low at 2.50 per set. The black crappie and pumpkinseed sunfish had low median figures at 10.75 and 1.50 per set respectively. The pumpkinseed was of a small average size while the black crappie ranged from small to fair size. The black, yellow and brown bullheads all had low population figures and were at a fair to good size. The golden shiner was also low at 1.17 per set. Note:  the first and only known partial winterkill occurred during the winter of 1983-84. The largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish were present in the past, but none were taken in the netting or shoreline seining results.</p>",
