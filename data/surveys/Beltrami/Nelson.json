ABUNDANCE AND POUNDS PER LIFT OF YEP WERE WITHIN THE FIRST-THIRD QUARTILE RANGES WITH THE WEIGHT PER FISH ABOUT EQUAL TO THE THIRD QUARTILE FIGURES.  PSD WAS 40 AND NO PERCH WERE LONGER THAN 9.4 INCHES.  TRAP NET ABUNDANCE OF YEB WAS WITHIN THE FIRST-THIRD QUARTILE RANGE, BUT POUNDS PER LIFT AND WEIGHT PER FISH WERE BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE MARKS.  ABUNDANCE AND POUNDS PER LIFT OF PMK WERE ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE FIGURES AND WEIGHT PER FISH WAS ABOUT EQUAL TO THE THIRD QUARTILE MARK.  ABUNDANCE OF BLG APPROACHED THE THIRD QUARTILE MARK, WHILE POUNDS PER LIFT WAS HIGHER THAN THE THIRD QUARTILE.  WEIGHT PER FISH WAS WITHIN THE FIRST- THIRD QUARTILE RANGE, PSD WAS 78 AND RSD-8 WAS 8. GROWTH RATE OF BLG WAS LOWER THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE FOR AGES I-IV, BUT EQUAL TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE BY AGE V.  ABUNDANCE AND POUNDS PER LIFT OF LMB WERE ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE MARKS, WHILE WEIGHT PER FISH WAS BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTILES.  PSD WAS 22 AND ONE 13 INCH AND ONE 14 INCH FISH WERE CAUGHT.  CALCULATED GROWTH OF LMB WAS LOWER THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGES AT AGES I- II-III, BUT HIGHER AT AGE IV.  NO BLC WERE COLLECTED IN THE TRAP NETS, BUT GILL NET INDICES WERE ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE MARKS FOR ABUNDANCE AND POUNDS PER LIFT.  WEIGHT PER FISH WAS BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE MARK.  ONE CRAPPIE WAS OVER 10 INCHES.  NO ASSESSMENT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION WAS COMPLETED.  FOUR YEAR CLASSES OF NOP, THREE FOR LMB AND FOUR FOR BLG WERE COLLECTED.  BASED ON LENGTH FREQUENCIES, SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES OF PMK WERE PRESENT, POSSIBLY TWO FOR YEP AND PROBABLY THREE FOR BLC.  THE FISH POPULATION OF NELSON LAKE APPEARS TO BE DOMINATED BY LARGRE THAN AVERAGE NOP AND CEN, WITH LMB, BLG, AND POSSIBLY BLC ABUNDANT ENOUGH AND LARGE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A LIMITED FISHERY.  BLH APPEAR TO BE LOW IN ABUNDANCE.</p>",
