                "narrative": "<p>Cabin Lake is characterized as a lake class 17 lake and is located four miles east and 11 miles north of Finland in the Superior National Forest.  Public access is a 20 yard carry-in from the 0.75 mile access road (FS 359B) which heads north from the main road (FS 359).  The lake is 66 acres with a maximum depth of four feet in brown bog stained water.  Water clarity is good.  Muck and detritus are abundant throughout the lake with boulder, rubble, and gravel present near much of the shore. Many mid lake boulders are present above and below the water line so if an outboard motor is used great caution must be taken. Vegetation was found growing to the bottom throughout the lake, 34 species/groups were identified with wild rice, floating burred, water bulrush, and sweetgale common. Two inlets enter the lake on the northwest end.  One outlet, (Cabin Creek) exits on the southeast end of the lake.  Cabin Lake is co-managed by DNR Wildlife, Ducks Unlimited, 1854 Treaty Authority, and the Fond du Lac band for wild rice production by monitoring and manipulating water levels.  Cabin Lake is utilized by fishermen, duck hunters and wild rice harvesters. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 Northern Pike gill net catch of 21.5/lift was higher than average for similar lakes in the area.  The average weight of 2.5 pounds and length of 21 inches was also higher than average. The largest fish sampled was 32.4 inches and weighed 8.4 pounds.  Almost 30% of the catch was 24 inches or larger.  Reproduction was consistent with fish sampled in all year classes from age-2 to age-10.  Northern Pike growth was average for the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch was 13/lift, slightly higher than average for similar lakes in the area. The mean length of 7.4 inches and weight of 0.2 pounds was average for the area.  The largest fish sampled was 10.9 inches.  Twelve percent of the catch was larger than nine inches. Reproduction was consistent with only one year class absent between Age-3 and Age-10.  Yellow Perch growth was slow for the area. <br> \n <br> \nCabin Lake has a pretty good carry-in access by Finland standards and contains a good population of nice sized Pike and Perch.  Canoes or light non-motorized boats are the best choice because of the presence of mid lake boulders and dark water, heavy vegetation in mid-summer would also make outboard use difficult. <br> \n</p>",
