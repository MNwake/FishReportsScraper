                "narrative": "<p>Pit Lake is a small, 26 acre lake that lies within the Lake Superior North watershed, draining to Lake Superior via Two Island, Dick, and McDonald Lakes, McDonald Creek, and the Cascade River. It is approximately 11 miles north of Grand Marais and public access is through a carry-in/earthen launch on the western side of the lake. Pit Lake is one of very few lakes in this area managed for panfish (bluegill). The 2023 standard survey was conducted to evaluate the fish community and monitor the survival and growth of the bluegill and northern pike populations.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates the lowest it has been since the 2004 survey and is below average for similar area lakes. Only a few bluegill were captured but were good sized with one fish 9 inches in length. Aging results indicated the presence of 3 naturally reproduced year classes in 2016, 2017, and 2020. Growth rates were slightly above average. The lack of small bluegill in the 0.25 inch trap nets indicate poor natural recruitment in recent years.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch met the current management goal and was within the normal range for similar area lakes. Northern pike ranged from 10.9 to 26.2 inches with a mean length of 18.5 inches. Aging results found 4 naturally reproduced year classes in the population with the oldest individual being 6 years old. Growth rates are average for northern pike populations in the area. Overall, northern pike were primarily small but there were a few individuals over 25 inches that may interest some anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catches in the trap nets were the highest recorded since 1999 and was above average for similar area lakes. Many age 1 yellow perch were also captured in the 0.25 inch trap nets, indicating that natural reproduction is strong. Size structure was good with yellow perch up to 9 inches. The combination of high abundance and good sized yellow perch may interest anglers looking to target yellow perch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are rare in Pit Lake and this was the first time they were sampled since the 2006 survey. The four walleye captured were about 14 inches long and were two year old fish from the 2021 year class. Walleye likely came from Two Island Lake when very young and grew fast on the abundant forage in Pit Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured within the 0.25 trap nets include blacknose shiner, central mudminnow, golden shiner, pumpkinseed and white sucker. The diversity and large number of fish collected indicate Pit Lake has a thriving minnow community that should provide excellent forage for piscivores.  <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health.

Recent stocking may have contributed to the catch, but a considerable amount of natural reproduction had also occurred.  Bluegill growth had been slow, even for this area, where bluegill are at the edge of their habitable range.  Pit Lake is one of the better bluegill lakes in this area, but it wouldn't compare very favorably with lakes further south. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were present in below-average numbers, although there were a few fish as large as 25 inches included in the catch.  Forage for northern pike was provided by a modest yellow perch population.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pit Lake has been managed for panfish since the 1970s, and is one of very few lakes in this area where an angler could, with some luck, catch a few bluegill.  The current goal for the lake is to maintain a modest bluegill population (a minimum trap net catch of 2.0 fish/set), with some fish over seven inches present.  Stocking would be used to supplement the population if catches fell below the goal.  This was the second of three assessments scheduled in the 2008 lake management plan to monitor the fish community and determine if more bluegill stocking was needed. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 bluegill catch exceeded catch and size goals for the species in this lake.  The catch included fish in a wide range of sizes, with some as large as 10 inches found.  Reproductive success was apparently good; five year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the catch.  Growth of young fish had been about average for the area; three-year-old fish reached a mean length of 4.8 inches by the end of their third year.  There appeared to have been no need for additional stocking, and none has been proposed for 2015. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have been the top predator in this lake, which has a reputation for producing fair numbers of mainly small fish.  The northern pike gill net catch, and the mean weight for northern pike taken in gill nets in 2014, were low for a lake of this type, but were similar to results of several past assessments of this lake.  Only two year classes were represented in the 2014 catch, with no fish older than three years taken.  Growth of young northern pike appeared to have been somewhat slower than average; two-year-old fish reached an mean length of 13.6 inches by the end of their second year, compared to an area mean of 14.2 inches.  Forage for northern pike consisted mainly of yellow perch and golden shiner.  Golden shiner were apparently abundant; large numbers were taken in 0.25-in-mesh trap nets used as part of this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nPit Lake is connected to Two Island Lake by its outlet stream, and there are no barriers to fish movement between the lakes.  In the 2014 assessment, smallmouth bass and pumpkinseed sunfish, probably migrants from Two Island Lake, were found in Pit Lake.  Smallmouth bass had not been seen in Pit Lake since 1959, and pumpkinseed sunfish had last been taken in 1985.  Smallmouth bass abundance was probably low, with none taken in gill nets and 0.25-in-mesh trap nets, only only one collected in standard trap nets.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were apparently more abundant; the trap net catch was well within the normal range for this type of lake, and three year classes were included in the total catch.  Although walleye are abundant in Two Island Lake, and have been found in small numbers in some past assessments of Pit Lake, none were taken in 2014.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This survey was done to update water quality and habitat information, and to determine whether stocking was needed to supplement bluegill reproduction (objectives from the 2008 lake management plan).  In 2010, Clean Water Legacy funding allowed areas across the state to do some nearshore fish community sampling to improve our ability to use a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) to identify disturbed aquatic ecosystems.  Pit Lake was selected for nearshore sampling because its accessibility allowed for use of the sampling gears required. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were present in fair numbers in 2010, but most were young fish, too small to have provided much angling opportunity.  The trap net catch fell short of the long range goal for the species (2.0 fish/set) established in the 2008 lake management plan.  The size goal in that plan (some fish over seven inches) was minimally satisfied.  All but one of the bluegill collected in 2010 had been produced naturally; the catch was dominated by two and three-year-old fish.  Growth of young bluegill had been relatively slow.  Lengths of three-year-old fish averaged just 3.7 inches at the end of their third year of growth, compared to an area average of 4.9 inches.   Quarter-in-mesh trap nets used for nearshore sampling yielded fairly high catches of small bluegill.  Based on all the sampling done on this lake in 2010, it appeared that there was little need to stock bluegill at this time. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers and average size were unusually low (for this lake) in 2010.  The 2010 catch consisted entirely of one and two-year-old fish.  Growth rates varied; growth of one-year-old fish had apparently been slow, while growth of two-year-olds had been faster.  Forage for northern pike was apparently provided mainly by the various minnow species present; yellow perch gill net and trap net catches were low. <br> \n <br> \nSampling of the nearshore fish community was done using quarter-in-mesh trap nets, a 15-ft beach seine, backpack electrofishing gear, and quarter-inch-mesh wire minnow traps.  Prior to sampling done in 2010, Pit Lake was known to support natural populations of yellow perch, white sucker, walleye, bluegill, northern pike, largemouth bass, green sunfish, golden shiner, blacknose shiner, black crappie, and smallmouth bass.  Walleye and largemouth bass have not been common in the lake.  Black crappie were last sampled in 1988, and smallmouth bass were last taken in 1959.  Nearshore sampling  in 2010 added Iowa darter, central mudminnow, and pumpkinseed to the list of fish species known to be present in this lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pit Lake is one of very few lakes in this area managed for panfish (Bluegill).  This was the third of three surveys scheduled in the 2008 management plan to determine whether stocking was needed to supplement Bluegill reproduction.  All were completed as scheduled; results will be used to revise the current plan over the winter of 2020. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers may have been low in 2018, but their average size was excellent.  The Bluegill trap net catch in this survey fell below the goal from the 2008 plan (a minimum of 2.0 fish/set); however, the size goal from that plan (some fish over 7 inches present) was met.  The 2008 plan called for stocking of Bluegill if two consecutive surveys yielded Bluegill catches below the plan goal.  While that was the case in 2018, the catch in the previous survey (2014) exceeded the goal.  Therefore, no stocking will be proposed at this time.  Bluegill taken in all gears in 2018 ranged in length from 1.3 to 10.4 inches, with most over eight inches.  Four age classes (including fish as old as 12 years) contributed to the catch, with a notable lack of younger fish.  Growth of young Bluegill appeared to have been somewhat slower than average, with fish reaching a mean length of 4.4 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area mean of 4.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nDespite not appearing in catches from standard gill and trap nets, Pumpkinseed Sunfish appeared to have been abundant in 2018.  Unfortunately, all were small (under five inches in length), and likely to have been mostly a nuisance to panfish anglers.  Sampling with quarter-in-mesh nets yielded a catch of 18.4 fish/set.  Competition from high numbers of Pumpkinseed Sunfish may have been a factor limiting growth of young Bluegill in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were fairly abundant in Pit Lake in 2018, but, as has usually been the case in this lake, most were small.  The Northern Pike gill net catch was within the normal range for a lake of this type, and was similar to many catches seen in this lake in the past.  Four year classes contributed to the catch, with no fish older than five years taken.  Growth of young Northern Pike had been somewhat faster than average, fish reached a mean length of 15.3 inches at the end of their second year, compared to an area mean of 14.6 inches.  Forage for Northern Pike was provided by high numbers of Golden Shiners and small Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nSmall Yellow Perch were abundant in 2018.  The Yellow Perch gill net catch was very low, but the catch in standard trap nets was higher, and the catch in quarter-inch trap nets was higher still (36.6 fish/set).  Although the vast majority of Yellow Perch taken in this survey were small (under six inches in length), a few larger fish (over 10 inches) were present. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
