                "narrative": "<p>Tripp Lake is located in Hubbard County, eleven miles southeast of Nevis.  Tripp Lake has a surface area of 145 acres and a maximum depth of 65.0 feet.  There is no public access on Tripp Lake.  Trapnets were the only type of sampling gear used during the survey.  Tripp Lake provides fishing opportunities for panfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Tripp Lake is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: several of the Crow Wing chain of lakes (Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth), Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, and Lower Twin.Tripp Lake has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that helps to support a healthy panfish and largemouth bass population.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish in the 6-8 inch size range and bass in the 12-16 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers (0.3 crappie/trapnet).  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers.  Four small northern pike were sampled in the trapnets.  Gillnets are the preferred gear type to use to assess northern pike abundance and size distribution.  Historical surveys using gillnets have shown that northern pike have generally been in moderate abundance, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers looking to pursue bullheads will find good numbers of 10-12 inch yellow bullhead present in Tripp Lake.  Bowfin (dogfish) were sampled in high numbers, with the trapnet catch rate of 2.8 bowfin/trapnet above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Walleye have been sampled in past surveys in very low numbers.</p>",
