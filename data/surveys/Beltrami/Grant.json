                "narrative": "<p>Grant Lake is a 208-acre lake with a maximum depth of 92 feet located near the town of Wilton in southern Beltrami County.  A public water access is located in Rognlien County Park on the north end of the lake.  The park features a public swimming beach, picnic area and playground equipment.  The recent addition of a fishing pier is another amenity within the park that provides excellent shore fishing opportunity for those who do not have access to a boat, or have limited mobility. <br> \n <br> \nGrant Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and bluegill.  Northern pike are very abundant in Grant Lake.  The 2012 assessment catch rate of 17.33 fish/gill net is well above the statewide normal range for class 23 lakes.  Northern pike average size was on the small side at 20.8 inches in length and 2.1 pounds, although northern pike greater than 24 inches in length comprised 23% of the sample.  Grant Lake has a good population of tullibee (cisco), which is an important forage species that contributes to the lake's potential to produce large northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nGrant Lake's bluegill population has increased since the most recent assessment in 2005.  The 2012 catch rate of 29.63 fish/trap net is within the normal range for class 23 lakes.  The abundance of bluegill greater than 8 inches in length has declined since 2005, although good numbers of fish in the 6.0 to 7.5-inch length range hold the potential to produce quality-size bluegill for anglers within the next few years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie are also present in Grant Lake.  The 2012 catch rate of 1.5 fish/trap net is within the normal range for class 23 lakes and nearly double the 2005 assessment catch rate.  Black crappie reproduction has been more consistent on Grant Lake recently, with good numbers of young fish present from the 2010 year class.  Anglers should notice these fish within the next two to three years as they grow to a harvestable size. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured in the 2012 population assessment included hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, largemouth bass, yellow perch, walleye, white sucker and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grant Lake is a 214-acre lake with a maximum depth of 92 feet located near the town of Wilton in southern Beltrami County.  A DNR public water access with a concrete ramp and parking for approximately 6 trucks/trailers is located in Rognlien County Park on the north end of the lake.  The park also features a swimming beach, picnic area, playground equipment and an accessible shore fishing pier.  Statewide fishing regulations are in effect for all species of fish present in Grant Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nGrant Lake supports a quality Northern Pike population that gets attention in both the open water and winter seasons.  Northern Pike captured in the 2021 survey had an average size of approximately 21 inches and just over 2 lbs/fish, with fish up to nearly 33 inches in length present.  Seventeen percent of pike captured in this survey exceeded 26 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish such as Bluegill and Black Crappie are abundant in Grant Lake although these fish tend to grow more slowly here than in many other Bemidji area lakes.  Nevertheless quality-size fish are present.  The 2021 survey captured Bluegill over 8 inches in length and Black Crappie up to 11 inches in length.  These species can provide lots of action for anglers young and old alike, and the accessible fishing pier in Rognlien Park is a great place to start looking for them.  <br> \n  <br> \nRecently Grant Lake has developed a local reputation as a quality Largemouth Bass fishery.  An electrofishing survey targeting bass was conducted as part of the 2021 survey.  The catch rate of 54 bass/hr was impressive for the Bemidji area, as was the proportion of bass captured that exceeded 15 inches in length (24%).  The largest bass captured in this survey was just over 20 inches in length and would be considered a dandy fish anywhere.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in this survey were Bowfin, Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Rock Bass, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, White Sucker and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Grant Lake was conducted on July 25-27, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill, Bowfin, Yellow Bullhead, and Black Crappie comprised majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill and Bowfin catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 25% quartile for similar Lake Class 23 lakes and the average length was 4.9 inches, with 7% over 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Grant Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grant Lake is located 5 miles west of Bemidji.  The public access is in Rognlein Park, administered by DNR Forestry, with the boat ramp in the area known as Little Grant Lake.  A concrete log ramp is adequate for most boats.  At the time of this assessment, the lake level was about two feet above normal due to floating bog and beaver activity in Grant Creek.    Grant Lake is in class 23 which is a collection of 115 lakes with primary distribution through north-central Minnesota.  Bemidji area lakes in this class include North and South Twin, Buck, Swenson, Elk and Oziwindib.  Lakes in this class are typically very deep, clear, hard water with a small percentage of littoral area (less than 15 feet).    Primary management is for northern pike and bluegill with secondary species listed as largemouth bass and black crappie.  Smallmouth bass fingerlings were stocked in 1979, but there is no documentation of any being sampled since.    Northern pike are abundant at nearly double the population of most comparable lakes.  The average weight is 1.9 pounds.  The largest pike captured in 1997 was 30.4 inches.  The average was 19.9 inches.  Most of the pike are 3-4 years old.  Many have Neascus or black spot, a common parasite of fish that will not affect humans.  Some darkhouse spearing for pike occurs each winter.    Bluegill abundance is comparable with most other lakes in this class and similar to that found in previous assessments.  The average weight of one-fifth pound is comparable to similar lakes.  The largest bluegill was 8.9 inches and the average was 6.1 inches.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish are present in low numbers.    Black crappie are near lake class average in abundance and weight.  Four year classes are present with the largest crappie sampled at 10.4 inches and an average length of 7.5 inches.    Largemouth bass were sampled below the abundance and size of comparable lakes.  Weather or water level conditions may have affected sampling efficiency.  The largest bass captured was 12.2 inches long.    Yellow perch have declined to the lowest abundance since 1969, but the mean weight of one-third pound is higher than in most comparable lakes.  Most perch have yellow grubs and Neascus.  Average length of perch was 7.9 inches.    Tullibee (cisco) abundance is nearly double the lake class range and the highest since 1969.  These fish are not readily available to anglers, but they are an important forage fish for the high northern pike population.  Cisco netting is authorized in Grant Lake under state statute.  Another forage fish, the white sucker, has declined in abundance.    Bullheads of all three species have been present in the lake, but blacks were not sampled in 1997.  Yellow and brown bullheads were sampled but at a low abundance level. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Grant Lake on August 1, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 6 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 10.3 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 6.3?C (43.3?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1997-2012 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1997. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",
