Captured bass were tagged with a short-term mark so that recapture efforts could quantitatively estimate the size of the population based on the ratio of marked to unmarked fish.  <br> \n   <br> \nA total of 252 individual bass were tagged and there were 72 recaptures. Individual sizes ranged from 8.1-19.5 inches. The population estimate (PE) for fish 8 inches or larger was 275 (21-339, 95% CI) fish. The PE for fish 12 inches or larger was 242 (179-306, 95% CI) fish. Estimates may be biased low due to repeated electrofishing in small areas of the lake resulting in over-sampling of marked fish.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a deep, (84 feet), 253 acre lake with good water clarity at the end of July with a secchi disk reading of 11 feet.  Although the lake lacks a public access, Cedar Lake receives moderate fishing pressure and relatively heavy recreational use.  A bible camp is located on the north side of the lake and a private campground with a swimming beach and boat access is on the east side of the lake.  Management goals for the lake focus on northern pike and largemouth bass.     Cedar Lake has a reputation of producing large northern pike.  While pike abundance remains within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes, they appear to be above the desired management goal.  Quality of the pike population was above normal with many fish exceeding 24 inches observed.  A spring ice-out netting measured pike up to 37 inches in length.  Protecting this high quality pike population from overharvest is an important management goal for Cedar Lake.       Spring electrofishing indicates that Cedar Lake has an abundant largemouth bass population when compared to other area lakes.  The majority of the bass were between 9 and 11 inches in length with a strong showing of 12 to 13 inch bass.  Quality fish up to almost 18 inches were documented indicating the lake can produce trophy fish.  Fishing for larger bass should be good in a few years.     Bluegills were one of the two species to show a significant change from the 1994 survey.  Despite displaying a decline, bluegill abundance remained within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  Small fish dominate the population.  All the bluegills seen in the summer survey and the vast majority of the spring sample were less than 6 inches in length, likely the result of slow growth rates.  Some fish up to almost 8 inches were documented in the spring assessment, however, they could be a real challenge to locate.       Black crappies and yellow perch are also present in the lake, but populations appear to be low for both species.  Some yellow perch were found in northern pike stomachs indicating their importance as a prey species, however, tullibees were much more prevalent in pike stomachs.  Northern cisco or tullibee numbers were high when compared to similar type lakes and the species are probably the main prey for many predator species in Cedar Lake.  All the tullibee seen in the summer survey were from 6 to just over 7 inches in length, an excellent food size for the northern pike and other large predators.     Other species in the fish community include black bullheads, bowfin or dogfish, brown bullheads, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, white suckers, and yellow bullheads.       Some of the tullibee sampled had triaenophorus or whitefish grub in their flesh.  Neascus or black grub was common on the northern pike and some of the panfish were infected also.  Neascus is trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested.       Cedar Lake has a unique northern pike fishery for this part of the state.  A management goal is to sustain a quality pike population with many of the fish exceeding 24 inches in length.  Having no public access has lessened fishing pressure on the pike population.  Protecting and improving the water quality of Cedar Lake should be high priority of the lakeshore owners along with the bible camp and campground.  Maintaining properly functioning septics along with using good lawn and farm practices will reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the water and using zero phosporus lawn fertilizers are recommended to reduce algae blooms caused by the excess nutrients.  Shoreline buffer strips and fencing animals away from the lake and inlets are also recommended.  The lake management plan proposes an introduction of hardstem bulrush along the shallow south shore to lower the suspension of marl soils on windy days.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Night electrofishing was conducted in late May to evaluate the largemouth bass population in Cedar Lake.  The lake is part of the Sentinel Lakes Study and largemouth bass is an indicator species for the study.  Cedar Lake has an abundant bass population having produced catch rates of over 200/hour in the last two electrofishing efforts.  The 222/hour catch rate in 2000 was the highest recorded in the Area with the old boat. A new boat with two netters was used in 2008, where 144 bass were captured for a catch rate of 259/hour.  The Area Mean CPUE with the old boat was 51.8/hour.  A new Area Mean will be developed from catches with the new boat.  The fish measured from 5 to 20.6 inches with a mean length of 10 inches.  The 20+ inch largemouth bass was one of the largest bass sampled to date in the area.  Modal length for the sample was 9 - 9.5 inches and a PSD of 27, which was half of the Area Mean PSD of 53.  Small fish appear to dominate the population as only 7 (5%) of the bass caught in the 2008 electrofishing effort were more than 16 inches in length.  Ages 2 thru 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14 were represented in the 2008 electrofishing sample.  Ages 6 and 7 displayed slow growth while the other age groups showed normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table.  The 2005 year class accounted for 46% of the sample. <br> \n    Small bass were prevalent in the 2000 catch as well.  A total of 222 largemouth bass were captured and only one exceeded 16 inches in length.  The fish ranged from 5 to 18 inches in length with a mean length of 10.2 inches.  The modal length for the sample was 12 - 13 inches and the PSD was 37.  Fewer bass were caught in the one-hour of on-time in 1994 electrofishing effort (n=107).  Although the catch rate of 107/hour was still high, the size structure of the sample appeared to be better.  The bass in the catch measured from 7 to 18 inches with a mean length of 12.1 inches.  The modal length was 13 - 14 inches and the PSD was 63.  Bass more than 16 inches in length accounted for 8% (n=9) of the sample.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Cedar Lake is part of the Sentinel Lakes program which began in 2008.  Northern pike are an indicator species for the study and are sampled at ice-out.  Cedar Lake also has conservation bag limits on walleye, northern pike, and black crappie, which were implemented in 2002.  <br> \n       The ice-out dates for Cedar Lake in both 2008 and 2009 were late.  Unlike 2008, all of the testnets were set on the same day in 2009.  The nets were lifted five times in 2008 (31 total lifts).  The netting was completed after three lifts (24 net lifts) when the pike catch dropped and recaptured fish made up a significant portion of the catch.  Many of the northern pike were either ripe or spent during the netting period.   Spines were taken from the walleye for aging in 2009.  Aging was done on the northern pike in the 2008 assessment.  All fish species except bowfin and hybrid sunfish were measured in the 2009 ice-out assessment. <br> \n       The 2009 trapnets captured 92 northern pike ( 3.8/trapnet) which measured from 14.2 to 35.4 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 23.4 inches and modal length  24 - 25 inches.  Pike exceeding 24 inches accounted for 36% (n=33) of the catch with 14% (n=13) more than 30 inches in length.  The modal length improved in the 2009 catch.  In the 2008 assessment, pike (n=157) ranged from 9.3 to 35.7 inches.  Mean length was 24.4 inches and the modal length for the sample was 21 - 22 inches.  Forty-five percent (n=71) of the fish were over 24 inches with 18% (n=29) exceeding 30 inches in length.  Ice-out assessments were also conducted in 2006, 2000, and 1995.  Catch rates for northern pike averaged 5.2 per lift in the four assessments between 1995 and 2008.  The 2006 assessment netted 150 northern pike between 10.4 and 35.4 inches in length.  Mean length was 24.7 inches with a modal length of 26 - 27 inches.  Sixty-one percent (n=91) of the pike exceeded 24 inches with 16% (n=24) more than 30 inches in length.   <br> \n        In 2000, 41% (n=50) of the fish were more than 24 inches and in 1995, 50% (n=50) of the pike were.   Pike exceeding 30 inches accounted for only 3% (n=4) of the 2000 catch, while 13% (n=13) of the 1995 sample were over 30 inches.  The 1995 and 2006 ice-outs were the only assessments to meet the management goal of at least 50% of the spring northern pike catch exceeding 24 inches in length.  An additional goal was to have at least 5% of the fish exceed 38 inches, however, this may be unattainable.   There have been northern pike that have exceeded 37 inches in past surveys and assessments, but none over 38 inches.  The proportion of pike in the samples exceeding 30 inches has remained relatively similar.  The northern pike sex ratio was  2 : 1 (males to females) in the 2009 assessment while in 2008, it was  1.5:1. <br> \n       Sixty-seven walleye were netted in the 2009 ice-out assessment.  Fish measured from 15 to 26.3 inches in length with a mean length of 21.6 inches.  Modal length for the catch was 22 - 23 inches with 72% (n=48) of the walleye exceeding 20 inches in length.  The 2008 ice-out assessment captured 40 walleye between 11 and 26 inches in length.  Mean length was similar to 2009 at 21.7 inches but modal length was smaller, 20 - 21 inches.  However, 80% (n=32) of the walleye were more than 20 inches in length.  In 2006, more walleye were caught in the panfish assessment (n=48) than the ice-out assessment (n=6).   More than twice as many males than females were caught in the 2009 assessment (2.3:1).  Ages 3, 4 and 6 thru 9 were represented in the 2009 walleye sample.  The 2001 year class accounted for 51% of the catch and came from the initial stocking year when both fry and fingerlings were stocked.  Two of the year classes, 2000 and 2002, may have been from limited natural reproduction or the fish may have been mis-aged.  Length at capture data suggests good growth.  The female walleye averaged from 1.5 to 3.6 inches longer than the males of the same age. <br> \n       Thirteen largemouth bass between 6 and 18.7 inches in length were also captured in the ice-out assessment as were 38 bluegill The bluegill measured between 3 and 7.8 inches in length.  Only one 13-inch black crappie was netted as well as a single 5-inch yellow perch.  There were three other panfish species, green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass in the catch.  The single green sunfish was 7 inches in length, three pumpkinseed, (5 - 6 inches), and 26 rock bass (4 - 10 inches).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Cedar Lake is unique for this area of the state.  The lake is deep and clear and provides anglers a chance to catch a trophy size walleye or northern pike.   As part of a SLICE (Sustaining Lakes In A Changing Environment) study the last four years, Cedar Lake has had numerous annual surveys and assessments monitoring fish species, habitat, water temperature and chemistry, along with other parameters.  In partnership with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data has been collected to establish baseline information to predict the outcome of various land use or climate change scenarios. <br> \n     \"Conservation\" bag limits were implemented on Cedar Lake in 2002 to protect the quality and quantity of the fish community.   The walleye possession limit was set at two with one over 20 inches, one northern pike is allowed with a minimum size of 40 inches, and a bag limit of five black crappie.  With the small size of the lake, anglers can have a major impact on fish community balance when removing larger fish.   <br> \n     Three types of assessments targeting northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegills have been conducted at various times in spring and summer to monitor annual changes in the fish community.   Northern pike ice out assessments indicate that the pike had been remarkably stable in terms of number, size, and recruitment.  Fish over 24 inches are common in the spring assessments with a fair number over 30 inches in length.  Trophy size pike over 40 inches have also been documented. <br> \n     Quality walleye over 20 inches were also common in the ice out assessments although fewer fish were caught in the 2011 assessment compared to previous ones.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in Cedar Lake in odd numbered years.   Largemouth bass are abundant.  The lake has produced some the highest electrofishing catch rates in the Area.  Most of the bass caught were small although there was an improvement in the average size compared to previous assessments.  While there are quality size bass over 18 inches, finding them could be a challenge. <br> \n     Black crappie may be rebounding after years of low numbers but they still do not appear to be abundant.  For anglers lucky enough to locate them, the fish are likely to be above average in length.  Bluegill, on the other hand, are abundant but small.  Few of bluegill caught in the any of the assessments were over seven inches, but several eight inch fish have been caught the last three years of netting.  Other panfish species in Cedar Lake include pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass. <br> \n     Cedar Lake supports low populations of both yellow perch and white sucker.  Tullibee or cisco are also known to reside in the lake, but this species has proven hard to capture in the types of assessments conducted on the lake.   The combination of the three species likely has provided the prey base responsible for the good growth rates in the gamefish.  All three species of bullhead have been documented in Cedar Lake with yellow bullhead the more abundant of the three.  An additional roughfish species caught was bowfin or dogfish.   <br> \n      A fish IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) has been conducted on the lake the past four years along with the other annual assessments.  The sampling includes near shore backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining. When combined with results from annual assessments, the data is used to characterize the fish species assemblage and assess overall lake conditions in terms of water quality and habitat.  Several pollution intolerant species which includes two species of special concern, Pugnose Shiner (Notropis anogenus) and Least Darter (Etheostoma microperca), have been sampled and Cedar Lake has produced some of the highest IBI scores in the State indicating that habitat conditions remain excellent. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is deep and clear and provides anglers a chance to catch a trophy size Walleye or Northern Pike. \"Conservation\" bag limits were implemented on Cedar Lake in 2002 to protect the quality and quantity within the fish community. The Walleye possession limit was set at two with one over 20 inches; one Northern Pike is allowed with a minimum size of 40 inches, and the bag limit for Black Crappie is five. With the small size of the lake, anglers can have a major impact on fish community balance when removing larger fish.   Cedar Lake is also part of a SLICE (Sustaining Lakes In A Changing Environment) study.  Numerous annual surveys and assessments were conducted from 2008 to 2011 monitoring fish species, habitat, water temperature and chemistry, along with other parameters. In partnership with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data has been collected to establish baseline information to predict the outcome of various land use or climate change scenarios.   <br> \n     Although rumors of trophy size pike being caught have been heard, the average size in the lake survey was 2.5 pounds or 22 inches.  Spring nets consistently show 30 - 35 inch pike.  Every other year stocking sustains the Walleye population.  While the average size in the summer survey was 1.3 pounds or 15 inches, quality Walleye over 20 inches have been common in ice out assessments.  Spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass has produced some the highest electrofishing catch rates in the Area.  Most of the bass caught have been small, however, there have been quality size bass over 18 inches observed.  Black Crappie abundance may still be low but numbers appear to be improving.  Spring assessments have proven more effective for sampling crappie than summer surveys.  For anglers lucky enough to locate them, the fish are likely to be above average in length.  Bluegill, on the other hand, are abundant but small.  Few Bluegill appear to reach more than seven inches in length, however, the first eight-inch Bluegill for Cedar Lake was documented in 2008. Other panfish species in Cedar Lake include Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and Rock Bass. <br> \n       Cedar Lake supports low populations of both Yellow Perch and White Sucker. Tullibee or Cisco are also known to reside in the lake, but this species has proven hard to capture in the types of assessments conducted on the lake. The combination of the three species likely has provided the prey base responsible for the good growth rates observed in the gamefish.  All three species of bullhead have been documented in Cedar Lake with Yellow Bullhead the more abundant of the three. An additional roughfish species caught was Bowfin or Dogfish. <br> \n       A fish IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) was conducted on the lake as part of the SLICE study.  The sampling includes near shore backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining. When combined with results from summer surveys, the data is used to characterize the fish species assemblage and assess overall lake conditions in terms of water quality and habitat. Several pollution intolerant species including two species of special concern, Pugnose Shiner (Notropis anogenus) and Least Darter (Etheostoma microperca), have been sampled and Cedar Lake has produced some of the highest IBI scores in the State indicating that habitat conditions remain excellent. <br> \n</p>",

There appears to be some evidence from the length-frequency distribution that artificially stocked walleye make up the bulk of the population, and that the natural reproduction is practically non-existent.  The walleyes which were taken were apparently quite old, so there is no way of ascertaining what angling success the past stockings provided as young fish.  Based on the present population, past stocking of walleye does not appear to have harmed the species composition.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a fairly small (253 acres), deep (84 feet), lake with a widevariety of fish habitats and 30 aquatic plant species.  Although the lake lacks apublic access Cedar Lake receives moderate fishing pressure and relatively heavyrecreational use due to the presence of a bible camp, private campground andswimming beach.  Minimizing impacts to undeveloped shoreline and protecting theremaining stands of bulrush and other valuable aquatic plants is needed to properlymanage the lake.     Northern pike are relatively abundant in Cedar Lake.  Forty-seven percent ofthe northern pike sampled during the survey were over 24 inches in length (averageweight = 3.4 pounds) and the lake has a reputation for producing big pike.  Localreports also indicate that large northerns are speared during the wintertime. Protecting this high quality pike population from overharvest is an importantmanagement goal for Cedar Lake.      Although the summer lake survey catch of largemouth bass has decreasedsignificantly since 1988, bass remain plentiful for its lake class.  Bass werenumerous in the spring electrofishing sample and ranged in size from 6.8 to 18.2inches.  Good recruitment from various year-classes was evident from the lakesurvey.     The walleye population is low for lakes of its type.  A limited amount ofnatural reproduction is assumed to be maintaining the population.  No walleyes havebeen stocked since 1967 due to the lack of a public access.  In July of 1994 a 5.5pound walleye was caught by an angler.     Cedar Lake has a high population of bluegills dominated by small, slow growingfish.  All of the measured bluegills were less than 7.0 inches.  The sample ofmeasured fish ranged from 3.0 to 6.6 inches in length.  Black crappies were notsampled during this survey and will be evaluated in the future by trapnettingduring spring ice-out.  There is some concern that crappies may be vulnerable tooverharvest by angling during the early spring.  Dark bottom, shallow bays whichundergo faster early spring warming attract fish.      Yellow perch have historically been present in low numbers.  During the surveyperch ranged in size from 5 to 10 inches.  Another important prey species presentin the lake is northern cisco (tullibee).  Tullibee help to maintain good growthof large predators like northern pike and walleye.  Tullibee prefer cool waterwhich is present in the deeper water areas of the lake during the summer.  Also,tullibees provide anglers with an additional fishing opportunity especially duringthe winter.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Cedar Lake is part of the Sentinel Lakes Program which began in 2008.  Northern pike are an indicator species for the study and are sampled at ice-out.  Cedar Lake also has conservation bag limits on walleye, northern pike, and black crappie, which were implemented in 2002.  The regulation limits the possession of northern pike to one fish that is a minimum of 40 inches in length.   The walleye possession limit is two and the crappie limit five.   Ice-out in 2011 was mid-April which was similar to three other assessments while the other three were late March or early April.  Six standard lake survey trap nets were set and lifted for a total of 23 lifts in the 2011 assessment.  Ice was still on part of the lake when the nets were set and the water temperature was around 34 degrees in the northwest bay.  All fish except bowfin were measured.  Both walleye and northern pike were given fin clips to aid in identification of recaptured fish.  Lengths from recaptured walleye and pike were not included in the length distribution data.  None of the walleye were recaptures while eleven female and sixteen male northern pike were caught more than once. <br> \n     The pike population, catch rate, size structure, and recruitment in Cedar Lake are all remarkably stable based on ice-out netting data going back to 1995.   Although the 2011 ice-out assessment had the highest northern pike catch rate (6.7/TN) of the seven ice-out assessments, the number of fish (n=155) caught was similar to previous assessments.  Previous catch rates ranged from 3.8/TN (2009) to 5.4/TN (2006) while the number of pike caught has been between 92 (2009) and 157 (2008).  The 2011 ice-out assessment was the first ice-out assessment to document a 40-inch northern pike although fishermen have reported catching 40+ inch northern pike since 2007.  There was also a report of a 47+ inch pike caught and released in 2011.  Mean length for the 2011 pike catch was 23.6 inches with 40% (n=62) of the catch exceeding 24 inches and 11% (n=17) more than 30 inches in length.  The pike sex ratio was about 1:1 in 2011 which was the closest to equal of the last four assessments.   <br> \n     Ice-out assessments have been conducted on Cedar Lake in 2010, 2009, 2008, 2006, and 1995.  Northern pike mean length has ranged from 22.8 inches (2000) to 24.7 inches (2006).  The proportion of pike exceeding 24 inches was highest in 2006 when 150 northern pike were caught.  Sixty-one percent of the fish (n=91) were over 24 inches while the lowest was 36% in both 2010 and 2009.  The 2010 assessment caught 129 pike and the 2009 assessment 92 pike.  The 2008 assessment (n=157) had the greatest percent (18%) of pike exceeding 30 inches (n=29).  Northern pike more than 30 inches in length comprised from 3% (2000) to 16% (2006) of the catches in the other five ice-out assessments.   Management goals for northern pike in Cedar Lake include a spring trap net catch where at least 50% of fish exceed 24 inches in length and 5% exceed 38 inches.  The 2006 and 1995 (50%) were the only two ice-out assessments to meet the 24 inch management goal.  None of the ice-out assessments have met the second goal.  Analysis of the data suggests that despite the public access opened in 2005, quality of the northern pike fishery has been maintained, but not necessarily improved.   <br> \n     The 2011 ice-out assessment sampled 20 walleye which was the lowest spring walleye catch since walleye stocking was re-initiated in 2001.  The fish ranged from 18.2 to 26.3 inches in length with 80% (n=16) exceeding 20 inches.  The 2010 and 2008 assessments both netted 40 walleye, the 2009 assessment 67 walleye, and the 2006 assessment 48 walleye.  Walleye over 20 inches also comprised the majority of the catches (68% to 85%) in those assessments.  The walleye management goal is to have each stocked year class represented in the ice-out trap net catches.  Aging structures were last taken in the 2009 ice-out assessment for walleye. <br> \n     Other fish species netted in the 2011 ice-out assessment included two black crappie, one which was almost 14 inches in length, 37 bluegill between 3 and 7.4 inches, and two largemouth bass about 6.5 inches in length.  Additional species included bowfin, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and yellow perch.  Some fish species that have been sampled in past ice-out assessments include common carp, green sunfish, white sucker, brown bullhead, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Cedar Lake is part of the Sentinel Lakes program which began in 2008.  Northern pike are an indicator species for the study and are sampled at ice-out.  Cedar Lake also has conservation bag limits on walleye, northern pike, and black crappie, which were implemented in 2002.  The regulation limits the possession of northern pike to one fish that is a minimum of 40 inches in length.  Unlike 2008 and 2009, the 2010 ice-out date for Cedar Lake was early (April 1).  The walleye possession limit is two and the crappie limit five.  All of the 8 test nets were set on April 1, however two new sites (STN 9 and 10) were substituted for STN 6 and 8 due to ice cover blocking access to the net sites.  The 2010 ice-out assessment had a total of 30 net lifts over four days.  Two trap nets checked on April 2 were knocked over by shifting ice and not counted.  No aging structures were taken during 2010 as spines were taken for aging from the walleye in 2009 and aging of northern pike was done in the 2008 assessment.  Most fish species except bowfin and hybrid sunfish were measured in the 2010 ice-out assessment.  Both walleye and northern pike were given fin clips to aid in identification of recaptured fish.   Lengths from recaptured northern pike and walleye were not included in the length distribution data.  None of the walleye were recaptures while 8 female and 22 male northern pike were caught more than once. <br> \n       The northern pike population, catch rate, size structure, and recruitment are all remarkably stable based on the ice-out netting data going back to 1995.  The 2010 trap nets caught 129 northern pike (4.3/trap net) measuring from 8.9 to 35.6 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 23.2 inches and modal length 21 - 22 inches.   Pike more than 24 inches in length accounted for 36% (n=46) of the catch with 11% (n=14) that exceeded 30 inches.   Ninety-two (92) northern pike were caught in the 2009 ice-out assessment.  The fish ranged from 14.2 to 35.4 inches in length with a mean length of 23.4 inches.  The 2009 pike catch displayed the more desirable modal length in the last three ice-out assessments at 24 - 25 inches.   Pike that exceeded 24 inches in 2009 accounted for 36% (n=33) of the catch with 14% (n=13) more than 30 inches in length.  In the 2008 assessment, the pike (n=157) ranged from 9.3 to 35.7 inches.  Mean length was 24.4 inches and the modal length 21 - 22 inches.  Forty-five percent (n=71) of the fish were over 24 inches and 18% (n=29) exceeded 30 inches in length.  The northern pike sex ratio was 2.2 : 1 (males to females) in 2010 compared to 2 : 1 in the 2009 assessment and  1.5 : 1 in 2008. <br> \n       Ice-out assessments were also conducted in 2006, 2000, and 1995.  Catch rates for northern pike averaged 5.2 per lift in the four assessments between 1995 and 2008.  The 2006 assessment netted 150 northern pike between 10.4 and 35.4 inches in length.  Mean length was 24.7 inches with a modal length of 26 - 27 inches.  Sixty-one percent (n=91) of the pike exceeded 24 inches with 16% (n=24) more than 30 inches in length.   In 2000, 41% (n=50) of the fish were more than 24 inches and in 1995, 50% (n=50) of the pike were.   Pike exceeding 30 inches accounted for only 3% (n=4) of the 2000 catch, while 13% (n=13) of the 1995 sample were over 30 inches.  The 1995 and 2006 ice-outs were the only assessments to meet the management goal of at least 50% of the spring northern pike catch exceeding 24 inches in length.  An additional goal was to have at least 5% of the fish exceed 38 inches.  Although there has been northern pike that have exceeded 37 inches in past surveys and assessments, none have been over 38 inches in any sampling efforts.  Fishermen, however, have reported catching 40+ inch northern pike since 2007.  The proportion of pike exceeding 30 inches in the ice out assessments has remained relatively constant.       <br> \n     The 2010 ice out assessment netted forty walleye between 15.3 and 27.3 inches in length.  Sixty-seven (67) walleye were captured in the 2009 ice-out assessment and forty (40) walleye in the 2008 assessment.  The 2009 fish ranged from 15 to 26.3 inches in length while those in the 2008 sample were between 11 and 26 inches in length.   The mean length of 21.9 inches in 2010 was comparable to those from 2009 and 2008, 21.6 inches and 21.7 inches, respectively.    Modal length was the same in both 2010 and 2009 at 22 - 23 inches while the modal length was smaller in 2008 at 20 - 21 inches.  Walleye exceeding 20 inches accounted for 68% (n=27) of the 2010 sample compared to 72% (n=48) of the walleye in 2009 and 80% (n=32) in 2008.  Walleye stocking was re-initiated in 2001 prior to the purchase of the public access. <br> \n      Additional species caught in the 2010 ice-out assessment included five largemouth bass between 9 and 13.3 inches, four black crappie between 10.2 and 12.8 inches in length, and 29 bluegill measuring from 3.6 to 7.6 inches.  There were some additional panfish species which included hybrid sunfish (n=6), pumpkinseed (n=4), and rock bass (n=1).   Fourteen bowfin along with a single yellow perch were also caught.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Eight ice-out assessments have been conducted on Cedar Lake since 1995. Four of the assessments were annually from 2008 to 2011 after Cedar Lake became part of the Sentinel Lakes Program initiated in 2008.  Northern Pike are an indicator species for the study and are sampled at ice-out.  Cedar Lake also has conservation bag limits on Walleye, Northern Pike, and Black Crappie, which were implemented in 2002.  The regulation limits the possession of Northern Pike to one fish that is a minimum of 40 inches in length.   The Walleye possession limit is two and the crappie limit five.  Six standard lake survey trap nets were set and lifted for a total of 18 lifts in the 2015 assessment.  Northern Pike were given fin clips to aid in identification of recaptured fish.  Lengths from recaptured pike were not included in the length distribution data.  Eleven male and six female Northern Pike were caught more than once. <br> \n     The 2015 Northern Pike trap net catch of 5.6/set (n=101) was the second highest catch rate of the eight ice-out assessments; 2011 being the highest with a  rate of 6.7 pike per trap net.  Earlier catch rates ranged from 3.8/TN (2009) to 5.4/TN (2006) while number of pike caught in all assessments has been between 92 (2009) and 157 (2008).   <br> \n      The pike population, catch rate, and recruitment in Cedar Lake seem to be remarkably stable based on ice-out netting data going back to 1995.  The one attribute that appears to have changed was the size structure of the population as few pike exceeding twenty-four inches were captured in the 2015 ice out assessment.   Pike in the assessment ranged from 8.2 to 30.9 inches in length with a mean length of 20.9 inches and mean weight of 2.14 pounds.  Northern Pike exceeding twenty-four inches accounted for 28% (n=28) of the sample with 1% (n=1) more than thirty inches in length; both which were the lowest proportions of the catches in  ice-out assessments.  (See Table 1.)  The pike sex ratio was 1.2 males to one female in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nTable 1. <br> \nCedar Lake NOP \t\t\t\t\t <br> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t <br> \nYear    (N) and Catch rate   Length range  Mean Lgth.

There was also a report of a 47+ inch pike caught and released in 2011.  Mean length for the 2011 pike catch was 23.6 inches with 40% (n=62) of the catch exceeding twenty-four inches and 11% (n=17) more than thirty inches in length.  The pike sex ratio was about 1:1 in 2011 which was the closest to equal compared to the previous four assessments.   <br> \n    Management goals for Northern Pike in Cedar Lake include a spring trap net catch where at least 50% of fish exceed twenty-four inches in length and 5% exceed thirty-eight inches.  The 2006 and 1995 (50%) were the only two ice-out assessments to meet the twenty-four inch management goal.  None of the ice-out assessments have met the second goal.  Prior to 2015, analysis of the data suggested that despite the public access opening in 2005, quality of the Northern Pike fishery had been maintained, but not necessarily improved.   <br> \n     The 2015 ice-out assessment sampled only one Walleye which was the lowest spring Walleye catch since Walleye stocking was re-initiated in 2001.  The 2011 ice-out assessment sample twenty Walleye while the 2010 and 2008 assessments both netted forty Walleye, the 2009 assessment sixty-seven Walleye, and the 2006 assessment forty-eight Walleye.  Walleye over 20 inches comprised the majority of the catches (68% to 85%) in assessments prior to 2015.  The Walleye management goal is to have each stocked year class represented in the ice-out trap net catches.  Aging structures were last taken in the 2009 ice-out assessment for Walleye. <br> \n     While the 2015 ice-out assessment sampled a total of nine fish species, numbers of each species was low.  The second most abundant species after the target species was Bluegill (n=34).  As with the Walleye, there was only one Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker caught.  Also sampled were three hybrid sunfish.  Some fish species that have been sampled in past ice-out assessments include Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Bowfin, Yellow Perch, Brown Bullhead, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Black Crappie can be a difficult species to evaluate in many lakes.  Cedar Lake has conservation limits for Black Crappie which restricts the daily possession limit to five fish.  Daytime electrofishing was conducted in early May targeting Black Crappie in Cedar Lake.   Most of the crappie were located on the east side of the north bay.  Many of the crappie observed in the posted bay were able to escape to deeper water before being netted. <br> \n    A total of twenty-nine Black Crappie were captured in 0.6 hour of on-time for a catch rate of 45/hour.  The fish ranged from 5.7 to 11.8 inches in length with a mean length of 10.4 inches.  Crappie exceeding nine inches accounted for 93% (n=27) of the sample with 76% (n=22) more than ten inches and 45% (n=13) over eleven inches in length.   Age groups 2-4 were found in the 2015 sample with a prominent 2011 year class accounting for 75% of the sample.  Crappies displayed fast growth rates. <br> \n     No Black Crappie were netted by gear types used in the 2013 summer survey.  Other methods of sampling such as ice-out assessments, spring electrofishing, and panfish assessments have all provided some data on the Black Crappie population in Cedar Lake.  The panfish trap net assessment conducted in 2006 appeared to be the most effective method for catching crappie.   A total of thirty-four crappie were netted compared to twenty-one in the 2008 ice-out assessment and fifteen in the 2009 spring electrofishing assessment.  Other ice-out assessments and spring electrofishing assessments have caught few Black Crappie. <br> \n       The 2009 spring electrofishing was conducted at night in mid-May and targeted Largemouth Bass.  The fifteen Black Crappie netted during that electrofishing effort were larger than those captured in the 2015 daytime electrofishing effort, ranging from 10.9 to 13.2 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 11.6 inches with fourteen (93%) of the fish exceeding eleven inches in length and three (20%) more than twelve inches in length. <br> \n     An ice-out assessment in late April of 2008 was targeting Northern Pike but also sampled twenty-one Black Crappie.   Fish in that catch measured from 8.2 to 13.3 inches in length with a mean length of 10.3 inches.  Seven of the fish (33%) were more than eleven inches with 24% (n=5) exceeding twelve inches in length.  The ice-out assessment in early April of 2006 caught only six smaller Black Crappie between 6.4 and 8.2 inches in length.   <br> \n    The thirty-four crappie caught in the 2006 late April Black Crappie assessment were a wide range of sizes, being from 5.8 to 13.4 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 10.3 inches with a modal length of 12 \u0013 13 inches.  Crappie exceeding nine inches comprised 73% (n=25) of the catch with 62% (n=21) more than ten inches, 41% (n=14) over eleven inches, and 23% (n=8) exceeding twelve inches in length.   <br> \n     Evaluation of the Black crappie population in Cedar Lake does appear to be possible using different sample methods.  Target species, sampling goal, and area work load will likely be factors in deciding which method to use.  The crappie sample size obtained by one method could dictate if another sampling method is needed. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>In this assessment, six standard lake survey trap nets were used to evaluate the Northern Pike regulation which was modified in 2018 to a 26 inch maximum, three fish bag limit due to an increasing abundance of small pike and an apparent decrease in large pike.  The 2023 ice-out resulted in a low catch that appeared to indicate a continuation of the reduced size structure of Northern Pike first observed in 2015. The low sample size obtained in 2023 suggests caution with regard to its accuracy in representing the pike population. It is unlikely the low catch is the product of a reduced pike density. Mean length, mean weight, maximum length, %>24 inches, and %>30 inches were all well below historical levels resulting in record lows for ice-out assessments.  No Pike exceeding 30 inches have been observed since 2015.  The reasons for the decline in pike size structure characteristics are not well understood, though the past protection of nearly all pike in the lake under the 40 inch minimum appears to have resulted in an increased abundance of small pike.  The modification of pike regulations in 2018 to a 26 inch maximum length was designed to protect larger fish while facilitating harvest of smaller pike. Ice-out assessments will be conducted every four years to evaluate changes in pike size structure and progress towards management goals. <br> \n <br> \nFive Walleye were captured in the 2023 ice-out assessment ranging in length from 18.1 to 23.4 inches. Mean weight was fairly large at 2.94 pounds which has been typical for these early spring efforts. Gill nets in 2021 captured 5.83 Walleyes per lift suggesting a favorable population level. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie sample consisted of 66 fish ranging in size from 4.2 to 14 inches. Mean length was 10.3 inches, however the most numerous size group was 11.5-11.99 inches.  The larger catches in recent years and the continued presence of crappies in the 14 inch size range are encouraging. Future crappie evaluations may include targeted spring electrofishing. Largemouth Bass and Bluegill were also measured in 2023 with the bass sample comprised of eight fish from 9.5 to 18.1 inches in length. A total of 38 Bluegill were measured which ranged in length from 3.4 to 7.9 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Cedar Lake is unique for this area of the state.  The lake is deep and clear and provides anglers a chance to catch a trophy size walleye or northern pike.  Two spring assessments incorporating non-lethal methods were conducted at ice-out and late April on the lake instead of the usual summer survey methods to avoid negative impacts to fish community.  To protect the quality and quantity of the fish community in the lake, a special regulation was implemented on the lake in 2002 which set the possession of walleye to 2 with one over 20 inches, northern pike possession limit of 1 with a 40-inch minimum size limit, and black crappie possession limit of 5.   The lake is a popular swimming lake with a beach on the east side of the lake run from the Cedar Lake Memorial Park.  Water clarity was excellent at the end of July with a secchi disk reading of 17.5 feet.  The most common species of submergent vegetation was muskgrass and sago pondweed which were found to grow to depths of 16 feet.  Marl and sand were the most common shoal water substrates around the lake.  A shallow shelf with a steep drop-off extends for a distance into the lake along the south and east shores of the lake.  The fisheries management focus on the lake is on largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and black crappie.\n     The lake appears to have a healthy bass population as they were commonly seen in the shallows while traveling around the lake and the lake has produced the highest electrofishing catch rate in the Area.  The average size seen in the two assessments was about 12.5 inches with some fish up to almost 18 inches being measured.  The ice-out assessment caught 150 northern pike that were between 10 and 35 inches in length.  While none of the pike were over 40 inches in length, past surveys have shown that the fish can attain that size.  More than half of the pike caught exceeded 24 inches which is a rarity in many of the lakes in Minnesota.  A total of 54 walleye were netted between the two spring assessments with most of the them being in the second one.  The fish ranged from 18 to 26 inches in length which appear to be from  from the 2001 and 2003 stocking.   Anglers report that fishing has been good for walleye in the past year.\n      Black crappies may be rebounding after years of low numbers but they are still probably not abundant.  Most of the crappies seen in the second spring assessment were over 9 inches in length with some up to 13 inches being measured.  A fair number of bluegills were sampled in the two spring assessments.  While there were some bluegills that were over 7 inches in length, about half of the fish were between 6 and 7 inches which may be of interest to anglers.  Other panfish species in the lake include green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, and rock bass.   Only 5 yellow perch were caught in the spring assessments but it may have been too early for the fish to be spawning.  The last lake survey in 2000 did indicate that perch abundance could be low in the lake but that appeared to be normal for the lake.  While perch can be an important prey species for northern pike and walleye in most lakes, Cedar Lake also supports a tullibee or cisco population.  That specie was found to be utilized by the pike as a food source more than the perch in the last survey.  \n     All three species of bullhead were caught in the assessment with the yellow bullheads being the most abundant.  Bowfin or dogfish and white suckers are two more fish species in the fish community of Cedar Lake.  \n     A new public access off of Highway 19 opened in 2005 which has increased fishing pressure on the lake.  Compliance with the regulations is vital to protecting this rare fishery.  Protecting bulrush beds on the lake is recommended as the beds provide important fish habitat as well as guarding the shorelines from erosion and stablizing shoal water substrates.  Protecting and improving the water quality of the lake should be a high priority of the lakeshore owners.  Buffer strips along the lakeshore and inlets and fencing animals away from the water are recommended to reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Buoys have also been posted for critical habitat protection; boaters PLEASE obey!</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Nine ice-out assessments targeting Northern Pike have been conducted on Cedar Lake since 1995.  Ice-out assessments were conducted annually from 2008 to 2011 due to the lake's inclusion in the Sentinel Lakes Program initiated in 2008.  Conservation regulations were implemented in 2002 which included a 40 inch minimum size limit for Northern Pike and a bag limit of one fish.  The bag limit for Walleye was changed to two fish and for Black Crappie to five fish.  The 40 inch minimum size for Northern Pike was modified to a 26 inch maximum, three fish bag limit in 2018 due to an increasing abundance of small pike and an apparent decrease in large pike <br> \n     The 2019 ice-out results indicated a continuation of the reduced size structure of Northern Pike first observed in 2015.  Mean length, mean weight, maximum length, %>24 inches, and %>30 inches were all well below historical levels resulting in record lows for ice-out assessments (See Table 1.)   The reasons for the decline in pike size structure characteristics are not well understood, though protection of nearly all pike in the lake under the 40 inch minimum appears to have resulted in an increased abundance of small pike, which was especially evident in 2016 gill nets.  Also, the protection of all pike up to 40 inches did not result in increased suppression of recruitment/density through cannibalism.  The number of pike captured during ice-out trap netting is not an accurate indicator of overall abundance due to high variability in spring conditions.   <br> \nTable 1.

The modification of pike regulations in 2018 to a 26 inch maximum length was designed to protect larger fish while facilitating harvest of smaller pike.  Anglers and spearers are encouraged to harvest pike under 26 inches.  Ice-out assessments will be conducted every four years to evaluate changes in pike size structure and progress towards management goals. <br> \n     Walleye catches have been variable during ice-out assessments on Cedar Lake, presumably due to the fact that these efforts are conducted very soon after ice-out at water temperatures more conducive to targeting Northern Pike.  Only one Walleye was sampled in the 2015 ice-out and the highest catch occurred in 2009 when 67 were caught.  Twenty-five Walleye were captured in the 2019 ice-out assessment ranging in length from 17.9 to 26 inches.   Mean weight was fairly large at 3.66 pounds which has been typical for these early spring efforts.   <br> \n     In the past, ice-out assessments on Cedar Lake have provided relatively small samples of Black Crappie ranging from 1 to 34 total fish.  The 2019 ice-out captured 165 crappies ranging in length from 5.2 to 14.4 inches.  Mean length was 11 inches.  Fish in the 10.5-13 inch range accounted for 77% of the sample.  The majority of these fish were observed in trap nets set in the posted dark-bottom bay on the north side of the lake.  Intensive evaluation of the 5 fish bag limit for Black Crappie has not been practiced up to the present time due to the fact that very few crappies were caught in any gear types until recent years.  Future crappie evaluations will include targeted spring electrofishing.  Largemouth Bass and Bluegill were also measured in 2019 with the bass sample comprised of twelve fish from 11.3 to 19.2 inches in length.  A total of 57 Bluegill were measured which ranged in length from 3.4 to 8.4 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   A special trapnet assessment was conducted on Cedar Lake in late April to evaluate the black crappie population.  Six lake survey trapnets were set over a four day period for a total of 15 lifts.  An ice-out assessment along with the crappie assessment were conducted to evaluate the fish population in the lake and replace the gillnets that normally would be used during the scheduled lake survey in July.  Cedar Lake has conservation limits in effect on the lake that limit the walleye possession to 2, northern pike possession to one with a 40-inch minimum, and black crappie possession to 5.  The lake has a quality fish population and is only 253 acres in size.  The use of gillnets in the past has lead to a excessive mortality of large northern pike.  All of the gamefish and crappies were measured while a subsample of the bluegills was measured.  The other fish species caught were identified and counted.  Scales were taken from the crappies, walleye, and largemouth bass for age and growth data.   <br> \n    The trapnets sampled 34 crappies between 5.8 and 13.3 inches in length. Modal length for the catch was 12 - 13 inches, mean length was 10.3 inches,  73% (n=25) exceeded 9 inches and 41% (n=14) exceeded 11 inches.  Anglers also suggest there has been somewhat of a rebound in black crappies.  The first special trapnet effort targeting black crappie was conducted in early May of 1995 using only 4 net lifts.  Local residents at that time expressed a concern that the crappie population had declined and was being over-exploited in the spring when the fish were spawning.  That netting effort captured 18 crappies between 7 and 11 inches.  Modal length for the catch was 10.5 - 11 inches, mean length 10.3 inches, and 94% (n=17) exceeding 9 inches and 17% (n=3) more than 11 inches.  Only 6 crappies ranging from 6 to 9 inches were caught in the 2006 ice-out assessment earlier in April.  Ages 3 - 7 were represented in the 2006 crappie assessment with the 2002 year class accounting for 38% of the sample.  All of the crappies caught in the 2006 ice-out assessment were from the 2003 year class.  The crappies in all of the age groups in both assessments displayed fast growth. <br> \n    The crappie assessment was also effective at sampling bluegill with 502 fish being caught.  The bluegills measured from 3 to 8 inches in length with a modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches, mean length of 6.2 inches, and 13% (n=64) exceeding 7 inches.  Some quality exists in the bluegill population that was not previously observed.  The 2006 ice-out assessment caught an additional 183 bluegills.  Those fish ranged from 3 to 7.7 inches in length with a modal length of 6 - 6.5, mean length of 6 inches, and only 8% (n=15) more than 7 inches.  The ice-out assessment in 2000 produced a catch of 1262 bluegills from 3 to 7.6 inches in length.  Smaller fish dominated the catch as the modal length was 4.5 - 5 inches with a mean length of 5 inches and 0.5% (n=7) of the sample exceeding 7 inches in length. <br> \n     The crappie assessment also produced a better catch of walleye than the ice-out assessment.  The 48 walleye sampled were between 18.7 and 23.9 inches in length compared to only 6 walleye in the ice-out that were from 19.7 and 25.6 inches.  Modal length for crappie assessment sample was 22 - 23 inches while it was 23 - 24 in the ice-out catch.  The mean length was also smaller in the crappie assessment, 21.7 inches compared to 22.8 inches in the ice-out.  The walleye exceeding 20 inches accounted for 85% (n=41) of the crappie assessment catch and 83% (n=5) of the ice-out catch.  These results may indicate we are too early at ice-out and may need to delay sampling when targeting walleye to when the fish are ripe.  Age 5 was represented in the 2006 crappie assessment  with 77% of the catch being females.  The females displayed fast growth while the male walleye showed normal growth.  The female walleye averaged 2.6 inches longer than the males at Age 5.  Five of the six walleye in the ice-out assessment were from the 2001 year class with the older fish being from the 1995 year class.  The younger fish displayed fast growth and the older fish normal growth. <br> \n     Only 7 northern pike were sampled in the crappie assessment ranging from 17 to 33.3 inches in length with a mean length of 27 inches. With the smaller sample size, more of the fish were quality size as 71% (n=5) were over 24 inches and 43% (n=3) were more than 30 inches in length.  The 2006 ice-out assessment captured 150 northern pike measuring from 10 - 35.4 inches in length with a mean length of 24.7 inches.  Pike exceeding 24 inches in length accounted for 61% (n=91) of the catch while 16% (n=24) were more than 30 inches. <br> \n     Largemouth bass were sampled in both of the 2006 assessments, 8 in the crappie and 9 in the ice-out.  Three of the bass in the crappie assessment were over 15 inches while only one in the ice-out assessment was.  Mean length was 12.7 inches in the crappie assessment and 11.9 inches in the ice-out.  The crappie assessment also produced a bigger size range, 8.2 to 17.7 inches while it was from 10 to 15.9 inches in the ice-out.  Spring night electrofishing has proven to be much a more effective method of sampling bass as past catch rates have been the highest in the Area at 222/hour.  Ages 4 and 6 - 8 were represented in the 2006 crappie assessment with Ages 4 and 6 showing slow growth and the older fish normal growth. <br> \n     An Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table was used to compare growth rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Night electrofishing was conducted in mid-May to collect data on the largemouth bass population in Cedar Lake.  The lake is part of the Sentinel Lakes Study and largemouth bass is an indicator species for the study.  Cedar Lake has an abundant bass population having produced catch rates of over 200/hour in the last three electrofishing efforts.  The 2009 catch rate was 343.8/hour (n=191) with catches of 259/hour (n=144) in 2008 and 222/hour (n=222) in 2000.  Although the 1994 catch rate was less at 107/hour, the rate was still high when compared to the area electrofishing average.  A new electrofishing boat was used in the 2008 and 2009 assessments along with 2 netters while with the older boat, usually only one netter was used.  All of the catch rates were the highest in the area with both the previous boat and new boat.  Smaller bass have dominated the electrofishing catches, although, Cedar Lake has produced some of the biggest largemouth bass in the area.   <br> \n        The bass in the 2009 sample measured from 5.3 to 19.4 inches in length with a mean length of 9.2 inches.  There were two modal lengths for the sample, 6.5 - 7 inches and 9.5 - 10 inches.  PSD was 12 and 8% (n=15) of the bass exceeded 12 inches in length.  Fish more than 16 inches in length accounted for only 1% (n=2) of the catch.   <br> \n        Fish ranged from 5 to 20.6 inches in the 2008 catch. The 20+ inch largemouth bass was one of the largest bass sampled to date in the area.  The size structure of the sample was slightly better than that in 2009.  Mean length for the sample was 10 inches.  While the modal length was 9 - 9.5 inches, PSD was 27 and 5% (n=7) of the bass were more than 16 inches in length.  Aging data was not collected from the 2009 catch, but data was taken in the 2008 assessment.  Ages 2 thru 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14 were represented in the sample.  Ages 6 and 7 displayed slow growth while the other age groups showed normal growth when compared to an area mean back-calculated length table.  A strong 2005 year class accounted for 46% of the catch in 2008. <br> \n       Earlier electrofishing efforts in 2000 and 1994 have shown mixed results.  Mean length for the 2000 catch was 10.2 inches with a modal length of 12 - 13 inches.   PSD for the sample was 37 but only one of the bass was more than 16 inches in length.  The 1994 electrofishing catch displayed the most desirable sample size structure.  Mean length for the sample was 12.1 inches with a modal length of 13 - 14 inches and PSD of 63.  Bass more than 16 inches in length accounted for 2% (n=2) of the sample.  \t <br> \n        Fifteen black crappie between 11 and 13 inches were also sampled during the 2009 electrofishing effort, although, a few more were observed but not netted.  Mean length was 11.6 inches with a modal length of 11 - 11.5 inches.  The single walleye captured was 15.6 inches in length and from the 2006 year class.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This standard survey was completed the week of July 19, 2021 and targeted Walleye, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch with gillnets, Bluegill and Black Crappie with trap nets, and Largemouth Bass with electrofishing. This report is an update from the ?Standard Survey' report dated 2016-07-25 that can be found on the DNR website under 'LakeFinder'. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are present in the lake, measuring up to 27 inches in length or about 8 pounds. Thirty-four percent of Walleyes measured were 20 inches or greater. Fingerlings have been stocked on an every-other-year basis since 2009. In addition, Walleyes spawn naturally in Cedar Lake and survival can be very good. The combination of stocking and natural reproduction appears to be working well in maintaining a good Walleye fishery. Cedar Lake has a special regulation for Walleyes which limits an angler's possession to two fish.  <br> \n  <br> \nCedar Lake is a good place to catch Northern Pike, but they're not as large as they used to be. In the mid-1990s through the early 2000s, pike approaching 40 inches were occasionally sampled and fish in the 30-35 inch-range were commonly measured. Today, we don't see the same numbers of large fish; instead, we consistently sample similar numbers of small to average size pike. The special regulation requiring the release of all pike >26 inches is intended to increase the numbers of larger pike. As a lake small in size, angler harvest of large pike, even a few, can negatively impact their size structure. Time will tell whether efforts to increase the proportion of large pike are successful while hoping there is a corresponding decline in numbers of smaller pike.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch and Cisco are present in very low numbers in Cedar Lake or they may not be present at all. Cisco, a cold-water prey species utilized by large pike, used to be more common in the lake 20 years ago. Their decline is perplexing given the very high quality Cisco habitat and apparent lower numbers of large pike.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in the spring using an electrofishing boat. There are consistently good numbers of bass in Cedar Lake. Our sampling typically includes fish measuring 8 to 18 inches. Bluegills caught in summer trap nets averaged about 5-6 inches and were abundant. Black Crappies require special targeted sampling in the spring in order to estimate their relative abundance and size structure. Spring trap netting for crappie will be completed as work plans develop. Currently there is a five-fish possession limit for Black Crappie on Cedar Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake remains a small, scenic lake with exceptional water quality. Overall, it provides high recreational value and can be regarded as one of the nicest lakes in southern Morrison County.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>WALLEYE only a remnant population remains from late sixties stockings.  There is no sign of natural reproduction.  There is excellent growth potential for walleye in this lake,  because of the large forage base of yellow perch and small tullibees.  The YELLOW PERCH net catch was up from the previous survey, but it is only about 25% of the state wide average.  Very warm shallow waters may have effected this catch.  The natural reproduction check with a 600' x 12' x 1/4\" net showed a very different picture of the yellow perch population.  Almost 33,000 other size perch were caught, many large adults, and about 5,000 YY size perch were caught in a single haul on the SE shore.  The net was stretched out horseshoe shape to a maximum depth of 12 feet and pulled straight into shore.  This may show that high shallow water temperatures could give the wrong picture in some of our stationary lake survey gear for some if not all species.  This may be most noticeable in yellow perch and black crappie populations.The NORTHERN PIKE population was excellent.  All fish taken were in excellent body condition.  Small (4-9\") tullibees were found in 14 stomachs and yellow perch in 2 stomachs.  The average weight was 4 pounds.  Natural reproduction is maintaining the proper population and growth potential levels.  TULLIBEES were not abundant in net catches, but were found in the stomachs of almost all the northerns that had anything in their stomach.  There was a tullibee die-off taking place on the lake during the survey period.  All the tullibees encountered were of the 4 - 10\" size.  This was the case in the 1959 survey too.The LARGEMOUTH BASS population is in excellent shape in terms of numbers and size.  They have very good spawning facilities and an excellent forage base that includes crayfish, perch and sunfish.BLUEGILLS and the other sunfish have shown an increase in numbers when compared to the 1959 survey, but they were small in average size.  GREEN SUNFISH were taken for the first time in this survey.The BLACK CRAPPIE population appears from the N.R.C. to be much better than the net catches showed.BULLHEADS have shown an increase with the yellow dominant, and the addition of the brown and black with this survey.  The bullhead population is small at this time and needs no special management.There appears to be little change in the WHITE SUCKER population, which is low to average at best.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    This ice-out assessment was conducted on Cedar Lake to evalutate the northern pike and walleye populations in the lake.  Cedar Lake has a conservation bag limit implemented in 2002 that limits the number of walleye to 2, northern pike possession to 1 with a 40-inch minimum size, and black crappies to a possession limit of 5.  A black crappie assessment was also conducted on the lake at the end of April and a lake survey was scheduled for the end of July.  Since Cedar Lake has a quality fish population and is only 253 acres in size, the summer gillnets and trapnets were eliminated to avoid any negative impact on the fish populations deemed unnecessary as spring sampling provides sufficient data.  Excessive mortality of large northern pike has been documented in gillnet surveys.  Between 8 and 10 lake survey trapnets were set in the ice-out over a 4 day period for a total of 28 lifts.  All of the gamefish, black crappies, and bluegills were measured and scales taken from the walleye, northern pike, and crappies for age and growth data.  All other fish species were identified and counted.   <br> \n      A total of 150 northern pike between 10 and 35.4 inches in length were caught of which 14 were recaptured fish.  Modal length for the sample was 26 - 27 inches, mean length 24.7 inches, 61% (n=91) were over 24 inches, and 16% (n=24) exceeded 30 inches.  The lake management goal for Cedar is to maintain a pike population where at least 50% of the pike in the ice-out trapnetting exceed 24 inches which was exceeded in the 2006 ice-out.  However, another goal of the plan is to have at least 5% of the pike exceed 38 inches in length which was not met at this time as the regulation has not been effect that long.  A similar netting effort in 2000 at the end of March captured 122 pike measuring from 11 to 37 inches in length.  Modal length for the sample was 23 - 24 inches and 26 - 27 inches and mean length was 22.8 inches.  Pike more than 24 inches in length accounted for 41% (n=50) of the catch while only 3% (n=4) were over 30 inches.  An ice-out was also conducted in 1995 where 101 northern pike between 11 and 35 inches were netted.  Modal length for the sample was 18 - 19 inches, mean length was 23.6 inches, and 50% (n=50) exceeded 24 inches in length with 13% (n=13) over 30 inches.  Improvements have been shown in the proportion of pike over 24 and 30 inches in length.  Ages 2 - 10 were represented in the 2006 ice-out assessment with all of the males showing normal growth while the females displayed normal growth thru Age 3 and fast growth thereafter.  Only 38 of the fish were females compared to 92 being males.  The female pike grew an average of 0.1 to 6 inches faster than the males of the same age. <br> \n     The 2006 ice-out netting caught only 6 walleye ranging from 19 and 26 inches in length with a mean length of 23 inches.   The 2006 crappie assessment was much more successful at sampling the walleye.  A total of 48 fish were caught that measured from 19 to 24 inches with a mean length of 22 inches.  Cedar Lake had been stocked in the 1960s and some limited natural reproduction kept a low population going the lake.   One of the goals of the management plan is to maintain a walleye population where all of the stocking years are represented in the catch.  Ages 5 and 11 were represented in the 2006 ice-out assessment with 5 of the 6 fish being from the 2001 year class.  The Age 5 fish displayed fast growth and the Age 11 fish normal growth.  All the walleye in the crappie assessment were from the 2001 year class with the females showing fast growth and the male displaying normal growth.  The females averaged 2.6 inches longer than the males at Age 5.   Female walleye accounted for 77% of the walleye catch in the crappie assessment. <br> \n    Other fish species sampled in the ice-out included largemouth bass, black crappies, bluegills, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullheads, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullheads, and yellow perch.  The 6 crappies caught were between 6 and 9 inches while the 9 bass sampled were between 10 and 16 inches in length.  A total of 183 bluegills were sampled that measured from 3 to 7.7 inches in length with only 8% (n= 15) exceeding 7 inches. <br> \n     An Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table was used to compare growth rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Night electrofishing was conducted in late May to evaluate the largemouth bass population in Cedar Lake.   The lake is part of the Sentinel Lake Study which began in 2008.  Largemouth bass is an indicator species for the study and spring electrofishing has been conducted annually since 2008 as part of the sampling protocol.  Cedar Lake has an abundant bass population and has produced some of the highest electrofishing catch rates for the Little Falls Area.  While the 2011 catch rate of 169/hour was the lowest of the catch rates since 2008, it continued the tradition of producing the highest catch of the year when compared to other lakes sampled.   <br> \n     The 2010 bass catch of 357/hour (n=191) was the record high for Cedar Lake as well as the record high for the Area.  The 2009 catch of 344/hour (n=191) was comparable to the 2010 catch while the 2008 electrofishing effort resulted in a bass catch of 259/hour.  While the lake has produced some the highest bass catch rates in the Area, the population size structure has displayed some of the lowest PSDs in the Area. <br> \n     Smaller bass typically have dominated the electrofishing catches, although Cedar Lake has also produced some of the largest largemouth bass in the Area.  The size structure of the 2011 bass catch (n=108) did display an improvement over the 2010 catch.  Although the largest bass caught in 2011 was smaller, 18.2 inches compared to 19.8 inches in 2010, the mean length was longer, 12.2 inches compared to 10.4 inches.  Modal length was also bigger in 2011, 12 - 13 inches compared to 9 - 9.5 inches in 2010.  The PSD of 57 was the highest recorded since 1994 where the PSD for the electrofishing catch was 62.5.  The PSD had shown a steady decline since 1994, dropping to 37 in 2000 and then 27 in 2008.  The catches in 2009 and 2010 had PSDs of 12 and 13, respectively.  Finding bass over 16 inches has been a challenge in Cedar Lake.  Only 2 were caught in 2011, 5 in 2010, and 2 in 2009.  The 2008 bass catch (n=144) had both the greatest number and highest percent of the sample exceeding 16 inches, n=7 and 5%, respectively.   <br> \n     Two black crappies, 11 and 13.2 inches in length, were netted along with five walleye between 10.5 and 19.5 inches, in the 2011 bass electrofishing effort.  Both crappie, Age 4 and 7, exhibited fast growth.  Four of the walleye were from the 2009 year class and one from the 2005 year class.  The Age 2 walleye displayed fast growth and the Age 6 normal growth. <br> \n       An area mean back-calculated length table was used to compare growth rates. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Cedar Lake was chosen for inclusion in the Sentinel Lakes program, which began in 2008.  Northern pike are an indicator species for the study and will be sampled via non-lethal ice-out assessments.  Cedar Lake also has conservation bag limits, which were implemented in 2002.  The bag limits include 2 walleye, 5 black crappies, and 1 northern pike over 40 inches in length.  Standard lake survey trapnets were set in the lake while a large part of the lake was still ice-covered.   A late spring, shifting ice, freezing rain, and cold weather were some of the challenges faced during the survey.  There were 11 net sites used over the duration of the survey with most of the locations being replicated from past ice-outs.  A total of 31 net lifts were used in the 2008 assessment.   <br> \n    A total of 157 northern pike were captured for a catch rate of 5.1/lift.  The catch rate was similar to those recorded in 2006 (5.4/lift), 2000 (5.1/lift), and 1995 (5.1/lift).  Pike in the 2008 assessment measured from 9 to 36 inches in length with a mean length of 24.4 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 21 - 22 inches with 38% (n=60) of the fish exceeding 24 inches and 19% (n=29) more than 30 inches in length, which was the highest proportion of pike over 30 inches yet in ice-out assessments.  The 2006 and 1995 assessments captured pike up to 35 inches in length while the 2000 assessment netted a 37-inch northern pike.   The mean length in 2006 was 24.7 inches with a modal length of 26 - 27 inches.  A larger proportion of the 2006 sample exceeded 24 inches in length (61%) compared to the 2008 catch, but fewer were over 30 inches (16%).  Northern pike exceeding 24 inches accounted for 41% of the 2000 catch and 50% of the 1995 catch.  Fish more than 30 inches in length, however, only accounted for 3% of the 2000 sample and 13% of the 1995 sample.  Part of the lake management goal for Cedar Lake is to maintain an ice-out pike catch where at least 50% of the fish exceed 24 inches and at least 5% more than 38 inches in length.  Results from some of the previous assessments met the goal for the portion of pike over 24 inches, however, catching fish over 38 inches in length continues to be an elusive goal.   <br> \n     Ages 2 thru 10 were represented in the 2008 ice-out assessment pike sample with the majority of the age groups displaying normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table.  The ratio of females to males was 1 to 1.5 in the 2008 assessment.  The female pike were an average of 2 to 7.3 inches longer than the males of the same age.  When looking at the growth rates of both sexes, the males displayed normal growth as did the females, Ages 2 thru 5.  After Age 6 the females exhibited fast growth.   Three year classes, 2002 thru 2004, accounted for 76% of the total pike catch in 2008. <br> \n    The 2008 ice-out assessment captured 40 walleye between 11 and 26 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 21.7 inches and modal length was 20 - 21 inches with 80% (n=32) of the fish exceeding 20 inches in length.  The 2006 ice-out assessment netted only 6 walleye ranging from 19 to 26 inches in length with a mean length of 23 inches.  A black crappie assessment later in the month was more successful at capturing walleye, netting 48 fish between 19 and 24 inches in length.   The walleye catch in 2008 was divided equally between males and females. <br> \n     Twenty-one black crappie ranging from 8 to 13 inches were caught in the 2008 assessment, most of which were on the last day of the assessment.  Ages 3 thru 6, and 8 were represented in the crappie sample with all of the age groups showing fast growth.  The 2005 year class accounted for 57% of the catch.  Only 6 largemouth bass up to 12 inches in length were caught in the ice-out, however, night electrofishing at the end of May netted 144 bass for a catch rate of 259/ hour which was 5 times the Area Mean CPUE of 51.8/hour.   Other species included 26 bluegill between 5 and 7.5 inches in length, along with one 7-inch rock bass, one 34-inch carp, and one 17-inch white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Night electrofishing was conducted in late May to evaluate the largemouth bass population in Cedar Lake.   The lake is part of the Sentinel Lakes Study and largemouth bass is an indicator species for the study.   Cedar Lake has an abundant bass population having produced catch rates of over 200/hour in the last four electrofishing efforts.  A new electrofishing boat and two netters were used in the last three electrofishing assessments, 2010, 2009, and 2008.  In 2000, Cedar Lake had the highest recorded bass catch rate in the Area with the old boat at 222/hour.  The last three bass catches on Cedar Lake have not only set new records for the lake annually but have been the highest catches when compared to other lakes that year as well as historically in the Area.  The 357/hour catch rate in 2010 was also a new record for the Area.  While the lake has produced the highest catch rates in the Area, the bass population size structure has displayed some of the lowest PSDs in the Area.   <br> \n      Smaller bass have dominated the electrofishing catches, although Cedar Lake has also produced some of the largest largemouth bass in the Area.   Fish (n=191) between 6.5 and 19.8 inches were measured in the 2010 electrofishing assessment with a mean length of 10.4 inches and PSD of 13.  Three percent (3%) of the bass (n=5) were more than 16 inches in length.  Similar results were recorded in the 2009 electrofishing assessment.  A total of 191 bass were netted for a catch rate of 344/hour.  The fish ranged from 5.4 to 19.4 inches.  Mean length was shorter at 9.2 inches with a PSD of 12.  Also there were fewer bass over 16 inches observed, n=2 or 1%.  The highest PSD, 62.5, was recorded in the 1994 bass electrofishing assessment.  <br> \n      The PSD has shown a steady decline since the 1994 assessment.  In 2000, the PSD was 37 and in 2008 it was 27.  The 2008 bass catch, however, had the greatest number and highest percent of the sample exceeding 16 inches, n=7 and 5%, respectively.  Mean length was similar in both 2000 and 2008 at ten inches while the 1994 bass sample had a mean length of 12.1 inches. <br> \n       Two 12-inch black crappie were also netted in the 2010 spring electrofishing assessment along with three walleye between five and nine inches in length.  Two of the walleye which were from the 2008 year class appear to be from natural reproduction as fingerlings were stocked in 2009 and yearlings in 2007.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake (DOW# 49-0140-00; Lake Class 23) is a 236 acre lake located near Upsala, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the south Shore. Cedar Lake has 3.41 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 88 feet. DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Cedar Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally very deep, have a very low amount of water less than 15 feet deep, have hard water, and are very clear. <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake is predominantly a Bass/Bluegill lake. Largemouth Bass should be the primary species for most anglers. Numbers are good and while Cedar Lake doesn't have the top end quality that other lake do there are still good numbers of 12-15 inch fish. Anglers may run into a bonus Walleye every now and then due to successful recent stockings. Anglers are reminded that there are special regulations on Cedar Lake for Walleye, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike. <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bluegill, Bowfin (Dogfish), Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Big Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
