                "narrative": "<p>Shallow Lake is located three miles west of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Shallow Lake has a surface area of 255 acres and a maximum depth of only 10 feet.  Shallow Lake has abundant stands of both emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation such as hardstem bulrush, cattail, and yellow water lilies.  There is a county owned public access with an earthen ramp located on the outlet channel at the south end of the lake.  The outlet channel of Shallow Lake connects to Belle Taine Lake to the south.  Shallow Lake provides angling opportunities for bass, panfish, and northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Shallow Lake is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: First Crow Wing, Fourth Crow Wing, Ham, Hart, Hennepin, Hungryman, Minnie, Paine, Peysenski, Portage, Rice, Stocking, Upper Twin, and Wolf. <br> \n <br> \nShallow Lake supports abundant populations of bass and sunfish.  Spring electrofishing survey sampled moderate numbers of largemouth bass (49 largemouth bass/hour) when compared to other area lakes.  Sampled largemouth bass had an average length and weight of 14.6 inches and 1.7 pounds, with fish measured up to 20.1 inches.  The number of larger bass (> 15.0 inches) was high when compared to other area lakes.  Smallmouth bass are also present and were sampled in low numbers during spring electrofishing (3 smallmouth bass/hour).  Panfish abundance was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range and black crappie in the 9-11 inch size range.  Abundant northern pike spawning habitat of shallow, submerged and emergent vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of northern pike in Shallow Lake.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.8 inches and 2.5 pounds, with pike measured up to 32.6 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead and moderate numbers of white sucker and rock bass.  Yellow perch, brown bullhead, and black bullhead were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shallow Lake is located three miles west of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Shallow has a surface area of 284 acres and a maximum depth of only 10 feet.  There is a county owned public access with an earthen ramp located on the outlet channel at the south end of the lake.  The outlet channel of Shallow connects to Lake Belle Taine.  Boating between the two lakes is not possible for most watercraft when lake water levels are high due to the bridge height on the County Road 18 crossing next to the public access.   Shallow provides multi-species opportunities for anglers, but is best known for its Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and panfish populations. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Shallow is in lake class 39.  Class 39 lakes have the characteristics of a shallow lake depth, high littoral zone (area of lake less than 15 feet deep), and having a regular shaped shoreline.  Other class 39 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include First Crow Wing, Fourth Crow Wing, Paine, and Upper Twin. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find that Shallow Lake supports good populations of Largemouth Bass and panfish.  Shallow has abundant stands of both emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation such as hardstem bulrush, cattail, and yellow water lilies that provide excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and panfish.  Spring electrofishing sampled moderate numbers of Largemouth Bass when compared to other area lakes.  Present and past surveys have shown the proportion of larger Largemouth Bass (>15.0 inches) is high when compared to other area lakes.  Largemouth Bass up to 18.5 inches were sampled.  Survey results showed healthy panfish populations.  Anglers will find good numbers of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 9-11 inch size range.  Anglers can expect to find an abundant population of small-sized Northern Pike, with an occasional larger fish.  Abundant Northern Pike spawning habitat of submergent vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of Northern Pike in Shallow.  <br> \n  <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Shallow Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. <br> \n</p>",
