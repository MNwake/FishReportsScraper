                "narrative": "<p>Mow Lake is a 100 acre lake located 10 miles south of Akeley in Hubbard County.  Mow Lake has a maximum depth of 34.0 feet.  Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (5.3/gillnet), which is very similar to past surveys.  Size of northern pike was fair, with an average length of 19.5 inches and 2.0 lbs.  Eighteen percent of the northern pike were larger than 25.0 inches with fish up to 32.1 inches sampled.Walleye have not been stocked in Mow Lake since 1982, since past walleye stockings did not produce a viable walleye population.  Historical stockings have consisted of walleye fry stockings in the 1960's, and fingerling stockings in the 1970's and early 1980's.  However, eight walleye were sampled in the gillnets (2.0/net), and one in the trapnets (0.1/net).  Walleye ranged in length from 10.9 to 29.5 inches.  With the exception of 1962 (5.3/net), historical gillnet catches have been low and similar to the 1995 catch: 1.0/net (1990), 1.3/net (1987), and 0.0/net (1983).  The walleye population in Mow Lake could come from three possible sources: 1. Unpermitted stocking of walleyes by private citizens.  2. Natural reproduction (unlikely due to limited walleye spawning habitat on Mow Lake).  3. Migration of walleye from Crow Wing chain of lakes through Tripp Lake to Mow Lake (unlikely due to a fixed crest sheet piling dam at the outlet of Mow Lake).Mow Lake has a history of having a good bluegill population and bluegill were sampled in high numbers in the 1995 survey (73.3/trapnet).  Size of bluegill was good, with an average length of 6.4 inches and with 25% of the sample 7.0 inches or larger.  Bluegill up to 8.9 inches were sampled.Standard survey sampling gear is usually not effective in evaluation of black crappie and largemouth bass populations, but some general conclusions can be made.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys, with fish up to 10.4 inches sampled.  Largemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers, higher than past surveys, with fish up to 14.8 inches sampled.Pumpkinseed were sampled in moderate numbers (6.1/trapnet), similar to past surveys.  Size of pumpkinseed was good, with an average length of 6.7 inches and 0.3 lbs, and with fish up to 8.5 inches sampled.Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers (4.5/gillnet). Historical gillnet catches of yellow perch have been lower: 2.0/net (1990), 0.5/net (1987), and 1.5/net (1983).  Yellow perch were small in size, with an average length of 7.3 inches and with fish sampled up to 8.2 inches.  The yellow perch are too small in size to provide a fishery for the angler.Yellow bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers (7.3/gillnet).  Historical catches of yellow bullhead have been higher.  Yellow bullhead had a mean length of 9.6 inches, with fish up to 12.6 inches sampled.Rock bass and hybrid sunfish were sampled in low numbers, while bowfin (dogfish) were sampled in moderate numbers.  Historical catches have been similar for all three species.  </p>",

It has a maximum depth of 34 feet with 60 percent of the lake shallower than 15 feet.  Shoal water soils are mainly marl over sand.Species of fish taken by test nets in numbers which exceeded the statewide median catch per set were: northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and rock bass.Precent developement includes one resort with two cabins and four boats, and two private cabins with three boats.  During the winter of 1962-63 there were four fish houses on this lake.</p>",

A carry-in public access is located on the south shore of the lake.  Mow Lake provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, panfish, and an occasional walleye.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Mow Lake is in lake class 29.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Cedar, Tenth Crow Wing, Little Island, Mirage, Palmer, and Spirit.Northern pike abundance (5.5 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, and similar to past surveys on Mow Lake.  Anglers will find \"hammer handle\" pike to be common, as average length and weight was only 19.1 inches and 1.6 pounds.  A few larger fish are present, with pike measured up to 28.7 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes.  Mow Lake has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that help to support a healthy largemouth bass and panfish population.  Good numbers of 12 to 16 inch bass and 6-8 inch bluegill and pumpkinseed were sampled.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has also been low.  Walleye were sampled in low numbers (1.0 walleye/gillnet), similar to past surveys.  Walleye have not been stocked into Mow Lake since 1982.  Other species sampled include moderate numbers of yellow perch, yellow bullhead, rock bass, bowfin (dog fish), and hybrid sunfish.</p>",
