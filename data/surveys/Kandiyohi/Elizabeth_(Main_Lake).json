                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Lake Elizabeth during September 10, 2018 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. Elizabeth is a large (1,023 acres), shallow (9 feet maximum depth), turbid, periodically aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Elizabeth is sporadic during most years based on previous surveys and analysis. Although, adequate windswept shoal water substrates for good Walleye spawning habitat are present in Elizabeth. Walleye egg take had occurred in recent years on Elizabeth for statewide quotas. Walleye fry (0.3-1.0 million) have been stocked generally every odd year since 1983 in Elizabeth. Spicer strain Walleye have been stocked into Elizabeth since 2005. There were 205,472 Walleye fry stocked in Elizabeth during 2018 (part of egg take return). In 2017, there were 510,003 Spicer strain Walleye stocked in Elizabeth. Approximately 1.06 million Walleye fry were stocked in 2014 (part of a 10% return for Walleye egg take) and 2013 (scheduled stocking and 10% return). Walleye fingerlings were only stocked with substantial numbers in 1996 (46,000 fish), however recruitment was poor due in part to a partial winterkill in 1997. <br> \n <br> \nModerate YOY Walleye numbers (52.00 YOY/hour, 6.8 inches) were captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (30.00 YOY/hour, 6.4 inches average) were captured in 2017. No yearling walleye were captured during the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Yearling Walleye numbers captured were low (4.00 fish/hour, 10.4 inches average) in 2017. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (77.42 YOY/hour, 6.3 inches) were captured in 2016 fall night electrofishing survey. There were no yearling Walleye captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. Low numbers of YOY Walleye (30.00 YOY/hour, 5.5 inches) were captured in the 2015 fall night electrofishing survey. These fish were from natural reproduction or/and movement into Elizabeth from connected Lake Ella. Abundant numbers of Walleye were captured in the 2014 (567.01 YOY/hour, 5.9 inches average) and 2013 (133.13 YOY/hour, 5.5 inches average) Elizabeth fall electrofishing surveys. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (78.00 fish/hour, 9.7 inches average) in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey.  <br> \n <br> \nWe observed abundant numbers of YOY Yellow Perch, Largemouth Bass and small Bluegill (about 4 inches) during the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. We observed abundant female Walleye (16-18\") during the 2018 Walleye egg take netting. Adult Walleye were also abundant (18.67 fish/gillnet, 1.04 pounds and 13.9 inches) in the most recent 2016 standard summer gillnet and trapnet survey. A partial winterkill of mostly Common Carp with lower numbers of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie occurred due to high snowfall accumulations resulting in low oxygen levels in late February of 2019. However, we caught abundant numbers of Walleye and other gamefish during our April egg take in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nThe Elizabeth fishery will be surveyed in the 2021 summer for all fish species. Walleye fry are scheduled to be stocked annually (up to 500,000 fish) during egg take years or every other year during non-egg take years. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings.  <br> \n</p>",

A targeted fall daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on Lake Elizabeth during September 28, 2022 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to fry stocking or natural reproduction. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nElizabeth was scheduled for a 2021 standard survey, but low water and high submergent vegetation densities precluded this survey. A standard survey was conducted during early June of 2022. However, low water levels and high submergent vegetation was still the norm in 2022. The secchi disc reading was 5.5 feet on June 8, 2022. Previous fall electrofishing surveys were generally conducted at three stations for a total of 30 minutes as was the 2022 survey. Unlike previous surveys, the 2022 electrofishing survey was conducted during the daytime due sampling conflicts with other lakes. A fall electrofishing survey was not conducted in 2021 for Elizabeth. Sampling conditions were difficult in both the 2022 June standard and fall electrofishing surveys due to low water levels. Submergent vegetation was varied at different electrofishing stations in 2022. Water temperature was 61 F. with a clarity of only six inches during the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. We observed abundant numbers of small Yellow Perch in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nElizabeth is a large (1,023 acres), shallow (9 feet maximum depth), turbid, periodically aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. A moderate sized cormorant rookery is present on one of the smaller islands. Water levels have been low since 2020. Submergent vegetation was abundant in 2020-2022. Winterkill rarely occurs in Elizabeth due to the operation of surface aerators. The aeration system was operational during the 2021-22 and 2022-23 winters. Oxygen levels were high during January of 2019. A partial winterkill of mostly Common Carp with lower numbers of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie occurred due to high snowfall accumulations resulting in low oxygen levels in late February of 2019. However, we caught abundant numbers of Walleye and other gamefish during our April Walleye egg take netting in 2019. We took 106 quarts of Walleye eggs during 2019, however the hatching/fertilization success was poor due in part to stress on fish by low winter oxygen levels and rapidly warming temperatures (>50 F) during egg take. Oxygen levels were low in February of 2022 even with the aeration system running, but no winterkill was observed. The Walleye spawning population consisted mostly of females in the 2022 egg take netting. Walleye hatch percentage was close to 69% from Elizabeth eggs due in part to ideal water temperature (44-50 F) during the 2022 spring egg take.  <br> \n <br> \nOxygen levels were low during February of 2023 due mostly numerous heavy snowfall events. The aeration system (northeast bay) was turned on December 29, 2022. Significant numbers of Walleye, Yellow Perch and Common Carp died due to winterkill in the immediate area of the shallow northwest access bay and Lake Ella outlet area. We did catch low numbers of Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Walleye from ice out trapnets during late April of 2023. Black Bullhead numbers were abundant in the nets. The aeration system did provide a refuge for some gamefish to survive in Elizabeth. Winterkill was more prevalent in southern and western Minnesota shallow lakes in 2023 than during other years. The June and September of 2022 survey results are no longer valid due to significant winterkill in 2023. <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye abundance was low (3.67 fish/gillnet) in the 2022 standard survey unlike a previous 2016 standard survey (18.67 fish/gillnet, 1.04 pounds and 13.9 inches). The Walleye historical average catch rate is 9.23 fish/gillnet. The Walleye average size was large (3.17 pounds and 20.8 inches) in 2022. The Walleye historical average size is 2.06 pounds and 17.0 inches. The Walleye catch rate of preferred size (20.0 inches plus) was low (2.0 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were good to excellent. The 2018 year class comprised 41% of the 2022 gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Elizabeth is sporadic during most years based on previous surveys and analysis. Although, adequate windswept shoal water substrates for good Walleye spawning habitat are present in Elizabeth. Walleye egg take had occurred in recent years on Elizabeth for statewide quotas. Walleye fry (0.3-1.0 million) had been stocked generally every other year from 1983 to 2013 in Elizabeth. Spicer strain Walleye have been stocked into Elizabeth since 2005. Walleye fry are currently stocked every year during egg take operations. Walleye egg take resumed in 2021 and 2022. Walleye fry were recently stocked in 2022 (511,500 fry) and 2021 (513,142 fry). No Walleye eggs were taken or fry stocked in 2020. In 2019, 251,955 Walleye fry were stocked in Elizabeth. There were 205,472 Walleye fry stocked in Elizabeth during 2018 (part of egg take return). In 2017, there were 510,003 Spicer strain Walleye stocked in Elizabeth. Approximately 1.06 million Walleye fry were stocked in 2014 (part of a 10% return for Walleye egg take) and 2013 (scheduled stocking and 10% return). Walleye fingerlings were only stocked with substantial numbers in 1996 (46,000 fish), however recruitment was poor due in part to a partial winterkill in 1997. <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers (92.00 YOY/hour, 6.0 inches) were captured in the 2022 fall daytime electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye catch rate would probably have been much higher if the 2022 survey was conducted at night. Low YOY Walleye numbers (1.00 YOY/hour, 5.6 inches) were captured in 2020 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye natural reproduction success was poor in 2020. Abundant YOY (80.00 YOY/hour, 6.5 inches) and Yearling Walleye numbers (24.00 fish/hour, 10.6 inches) were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (52.00 YOY/hour, 6.8 inches) were captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (30.00 YOY/hour, 6.4 inches average) were captured in 2017. Yearling Walleye numbers captured were also low (4.00 fish/hour, 10.4 inches average) in 2017. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (77.42 YOY/hour, 6.3 inches) were captured in 2016 fall night electrofishing survey. There were no yearling Walleye captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were abundant in June of 2022 (43.00 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average is 17.86 fish/gillnet. The Yellow Perch average size was small (0.12 pounds and 6.3 inches) in 2022. The historical average size is 0.23 pounds and 7.1 inches. The Yellow Perch catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches plus) was low (3.33 fish/gillnet). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were abundant in June of 2022 (16.00 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 7.38 fish/gillnet. The Northern Pike average size was small (2.24 pounds and 21.4 inches). The Northern Pike historical average size is 2.51 pounds and 22.2 inches. The Northern Pike catch rate of preferred size (28.0 inches plus) was low (1.00 fish/gillnet). Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Elizabeth in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26.0 inches; and all from 22.0 to 26.0 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22.0 and 26.0 inches or two larger than 26.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was low in June of 2022 (0.00 fish/gillnet and 0.60 fish/trapnet). The Black Crappie historical average catch rates are 2.88 fish/gillnet and 3.95 fish/trapnet. The 2022 Black Crappie average size was moderate (0.40 pounds and 7.8 inches) in trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in June of 2022 (10.10 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 8.41 fish/trapnet. The 2022 Bluegill average size was small (0.11 pounds and 5.4 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average size is 0.18 pounds and 4.9 inches from trapnets. The Bluegill catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches plus) was low (1.50 fish/trapnet). <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were abundant in the 2022 gillnets (76.67 fish/gillnet). The Black Bullhead average size was small (0.11 pounds and 6.2 inches). Yellow Bullhead numbers were moderate in the 2022 trapnets (1.40 fish/trapnet). Yellow Bullhead average size was moderate (0.40 pounds and 9.0 inches). Common Carp numbers were moderate in 2022 (1.70 fish/trapnet). The Common Carp average size was moderate (4.98 pounds and 20.4 inches). <br> \n <br> \nThe Elizabeth fishery will be surveyed in the June of 2023 to further assess the winterkill effects on the fish population. A full standard survey will be conducted in 2026 summer for all fish species. Walleye fry are scheduled to be stocked annually (up to 500,000 fish) during egg take years or every other year during non-egg take years. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Elizabeth is a shallow (maximum depth=9.0 feet) and productive lake. Historically,submergent vegetation was limited to protected bays and adjacent to shoreline areas, however,submergent vegetation was abundant throughout the lake in 1995 and 1996. Water clarity wasgenerally poor (< 3.0 ft) prior to 1995, however, water clarity has improved (4.1 feet on6/18/96) with the increased densities of submergent vegetation within the last two years. Themost frequently occurring submergent vegetation species include coontail, watermoss, northernwatermilfoil, sago pondweed, wild celery. Common cattail and hardstem bulrush were the twomost frequently occurring emergent species. Emergent vegetation was most common along theislands and south shoreline areas especially in the adjacent marshes and shallow bays. Theprimary shoalwater substrates were sand, silt, gravel, detritus, and muck are the mostfrequently occurring substrates within the lake. Potential walleye spawning sites includegravel and rubble areas located along the three islands, the east shore, and thegravel/rubble area of the Carrie fish trap. Fish movement into or out of Elizabeth ispossible via several connected lakes (Ella, Carrie) and a shallow marsh/lake basin (JohnsonLake). The primary northern pike spawning site is an inlet marsh area connected to CarrieLake. Other potential northern pike spawning sites include an inlet in the SW portion of thelake during high water, inlet marsh areas of Ella Lake, and perhaps some in-lake spawning(bay areas). There are three primary inlets that enter into Elizabeth from sources whichinclude Lake Ella, Lake Carrie, and a southwest marsh. A corrugated sheet piling dam islocated at the Lake Elizabeth outlet upstream of Johnson Lake. The surrounding watershed isprimarily agricultural row crops, marshlands, and hardwood groves. The surrounding shorelineis primarily hardwoods and marshlands. The lake is relatively undeveloped with most of thehomes/cabins located along the north shore. Partial winterkills have occurred periodically(once every ten to fifteen years) in Elizabeth. Both Elizabeth and Ella were opened tounlimited fishing in March of 1997 because these lakes had the potential to winterkill dueto low dissolved oxygen levels caused by heavy snowfall accumulation and the long durationof the 1996-97 winter. Spring test netting in April of 1997 determined that numerous gamefish(walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, black crappie) survived in both Elizabeth and Ella.Elizabeth is scheduled to be stocked with walleye fry in the spring of 1997. Lake Elizabethis managed for walleye as the primary species with black crappie, northern pike, largemouthbass, bluegill, and yellow perch as secondary species. Historically, Elizabeth has been apopular walleye and crappie angling lake.     Walleye abundance in 1996 (11.3 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (3.2 - 15.3 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41, but above the historicalaverage (5.6 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (2.5 lbs from gillnets) was above thehistorical average (1.8 lbs). The largest walleye captured in 1996 was 28.7 inches. The 1996PSD and RSD-P (gillnets and trapnets combined) was 84.3 and 39.8 respectively. Growth ratesappear average compared to other area lakes. Natural reproduction appears to occur withinElizabeth, but the extent is unknown. About 60% of the fish captured in the summer surveywere from year classes in which fry stocking occurred. In the fall 1995 electrofishingsurvey, the young of year \"YOY\" walleye abundance was 36.0 YOY/hour (average size=6.1inches). These fish were probably a result of a 1995 spring walleye fry stocking (2,000,810fish).     Northern pike abundance in 1996 (5.0 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.2 - 7.8 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41 and similar to the historicalaverage (5.4 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (3.2 lbs from gillnets) was above thehistorical average (2.5 lbs). The largest northern pike captured in 1996 was 32.3 inches. The1996 PSD and RSD-P (gillnets and trapnets combined) was 69.7 and 15.2 respectively. Growthrates appear good compared to other area lakes. About 48% of the fish captured belonged tothe 1994 year class.     Yellow perch abundance in 1996 (68.2 fish/gillnet) was above the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (3.0 - 22.5 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41 and above the historicalaverage (21.7 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (6.1 inches from gillnets and trapnets)was below the historical average (7.0 inches). The largest yellow perch captured in 1996 was9.8 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (gillnets and trapnets combined) was 6.4 and 0respectively. Growth rates appear good compared to other area lakes. The increase insubmergent vegetation densities has greatly improved potential spawning habitat for yellowperch in Elizabeth. In March of 1994, there were 15,800 adult yellow perch stocked to boostnatural reproduction. It appears that this stocking was successful in producing severalexcellent yellow perch year classes (1995 & 1994). The 1995 and 1994 year classes composed97% (617 fish) of the total yellow perch catch in 1996.     Both black and white crappies have been present within Elizabeth during past surveys.Black crappie abundance in 1996 (5.5 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.8 - 11.1 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41, but slightly above thehistorical average (3.1 fish/gillnet). There were no white crappie caught in 1996. The 1996black crappie average size (7.1 inches from gillnets and trapnets) was slightly below thehistorical average (8.0 inches). The 1996 black crappie PSD and RSD-P (gillnets and trapnetscombined) was 13.8 and 10.3 respectively. Growth rates appear average compared to other arealakes. The 1994 year class composed about 69% of the total black crappie catch in 1996.     Bluegill abundance in 1996 (11.9 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.0 - 14.9 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 41, but above the historicalaverage (3.8 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (4.8 inches from gillnets and trapnets) wasbelow the historical average (6.2 inches). The largest bluegill captured in 1996 was 6.3inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (gillnets and trapnets combined) was 5.9 and 0 respectively.Growth rates appear average compared to other area lakes. The increase of submergentvegetation densities and corresponding increase of water clarity has favored greaterreproductive potential and survival of bluegill (YOY and yearling). The 1993 year classcomposed about 59% of the total catch in 1996.     Black bullhead abundance in 1996 (4.8 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.3 - 78.1 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 41, but below the historicalaverage (13.9 fish/trapnet). The 1996 black bullhead average size (7.3 inches from gillnetsand trapnets) was slightly below the historical average (8.4 inches). Yellow bullheadabundance in 1996 (7.0 fish/trapnet) was above the 1st and 3rd median interquartile range(0.5 - 4.1 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 41 and above the historical average (3.6fish/trapnet). The 1996 yellow bullhead average size (9.1 inches from gillnets and trapnets)was similar to the historical average (9.0 inches).     Carp abundance in 1996 (5.0 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.5 - 9.1 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41 and similar to the historicalaverage (6.6 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (18.1 inches from gillnets and trapnets)was slightly above the historical average (16.7 inches).     Both Elizabeth and Ella did not winterkill during the 1996-97 winter. Walleye fry willbe stocked in the spring of 1997. One management option for reducing the risk of winterkillon both Elizabeth and Ella is to install and operate an aeration system (bubbler or Aire-O2)within each lake. However, the present limiting factors for installing aeration systems arethe initial cost and the annual operation expenses (electrical bills) for these systems.Kandiyohi County presently pays for the operation expenses of most aeration systems withinthe county, but funding for additional systems is not presently available. Other managementoptions include education and encouraging local landowners within the watershed to practicebest management practices (conservation tillage, planting buffer strips, restoring wetlands,updating dysfunctional septic systems, etc.). If submergent vegetation continues to beabundant within Elizabeth during the next few years, then changes may occur in the long rangemanagement plan in order to adjust for the different habitat conditions within the lake.These changes may include stocking walleye fingerlings instead of fry; managing for bluegill,largemouth bass, and black crappie as the primary species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Lake Elizabeth was conducted during mid June of 2006. Elizabeth is a large (1,054 acres), shallow (9 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Partial winterkills have occurred in Elizabeth, but are generally rare. An aeration system (two surface aerators) has been available for use on Elizabeth since the 1999-2000 winter. The aeration system was used in the 2000-2001 winter, but has not been used since due to mild winters and adequate oxygen levels during the 2002-2006. Moderate nutrient runoff inflows are possible into Elizabeth during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. Elizabeth is connected to two small lakes (Ella & Carrie) during moderate to high water level conditions. An outlet structure is located on the southeast side of the lake.  The outlet connects to a shallow winterkill marsh/lake (Johnson Lake). Water levels were below normal in 2006. Submergent vegetation densities were low during 2006 compared to the 2002 assessment. The most frequently occurring submergent species included sago pondweed, water celery, coontail, and bushy pondweed in 2006. Water clarity was fair to poor during late June of 2006 (secchi=3.0 feet) in Elizabeth. Total phosphorus (0.050 ppm) and chlorophyll-a (17.7 ppb) levels were moderate and high respectively in 2006. Residential homes/cabins (23 homes) are limited to the north and west portions of Elizabeth because of scant access and numerous low wetland areas. Hardwood trees and adjacent wetland areas surround the shoreline. An aquatic management area (Lake Elizabeth Aquatic Management Area) was purchased in 2000 along the south shore. A pair of eagles has nested along the south shore during recent years. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers low to moderate in 2006 (5.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 16.79 fish/gillnet. The yellow perch average size was small (0.14 pounds and 6.61 inches from gillnets). Yellow perch growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. The 2004 year class comprised the majority of the yellow perch catch in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate in 2006 (4.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 6.13 fish/gillnet. The northern pike average size was moderate to large (4.18 pounds and 25.92 inches from gillnets). The northern pike historical average weight is 2.69 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger northern pike was moderate (1.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2006 resurvey. Northern pike growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2006 (11.80 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 8.84 fish/trapnet. The 2006 bluegill average size was small (0.11 pounds and 4.78 inches from trapnets). The bluegill historical average weight is 0.19 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low (2.90 fish/trapnet) in the 2006 resurvey. Bluegill growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderate in 2006 (4.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 2.77 fish/trapnet. The 2006 black crappie average size was small (0.23 pounds and 6.81 inches from gillnets). The catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was low (0.10 fish/trapnet) in the 2006 resurvey. Black crappie growth rates were near or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass catch rate was moderate (40.00 fish/hour) in the 2006 spring electrofishing survey. The Spicer Area largemouth bass average catch rate is 46.60 fish/hour (1.23 pounds average weight). Previous spring electrofishing surveys were conducted on Elizabeth during 1991 (5.33 fish/hour, 2.27 pounds average weight) and 2002 (26.00 fish/hour, 2.54 pounds average weight). The 2006 largemouth bass average size was moderate (1.80 pounds and 13.79 inches from spring electrofishing). The catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches) and larger largemouth bass was high (21.43 fish/hour) in the 2006 spring electrofishing survey. Largemouth bass growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2001 year class comprised the majority of the 2006 spring electrofishing catch.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate in 2006 (8.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 6.51 fish/gillnet. The 2006 walleye average size was moderate to large (2.77 pounds and 18.11 inches from gillnets). The walleye historical average weight is 2.26 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was high (5.76 fish/gillnet) in 2006. Walleye growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. Walleye natural reproduction in Elizabeth is generally insignificant or rare based on previous fall and summer surveys. No fall electrofishing surveys were conducted during 2006. Elizabeth was stocked with 1.06 million walleye fry in the spring of 2005. The 2005 fall electrofishing survey indicated high numbers of young of year walleye (84.00 fish/hour, 6.79 inches average length) in Elizabeth. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were moderate in 2006 (19.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 34.05 fish/gillnet. The 2006 black bullhead average size was large (0.70 pounds and 10.76 inches from gillnets). The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.41 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were moderate in 2006 (2.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 5.20 fish/gillnet. The 2006 carp average size was large (7.62 pounds and 25.14 inches from gillnets). The carp historical average weight 3.49 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Elizabeth include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting Kandiyohi County in operating the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking walleye fry every other year. The Elizabeth fishery will be surveyed in the 2011 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Lake Elizabeth was conducted during late June of 2011. Elizabeth is a large (1,054 acres), shallow (9 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Partial winterkills have occurred in Elizabeth, but are generally rare. An aeration system (two surface aerators) has been available for use on Elizabeth since the 1999-2000 winter. The aeration system was used in the 2000-01 winter, 2007-08 winter and 2009-10 winter. Moderate nutrient runoff inflows are possible into Elizabeth during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. Elizabeth is connected to two small lakes (Ella & Carrie) during moderate to high water level conditions. An outlet structure is located on the southeast side of the lake.  The outlet connects to a shallow winterkill marsh/lake (Johnson Lake) within the South Fork of the Crow River Watershed. Water levels were above normal during the spring and early summer, but low by the fall of 2011. Submergent vegetation densities (coontail, pondweeds, etc.) were low during the 2011 assessment and 2006 resurvey, but high during 2002 assessment. Water clarity was fair to poor during late June of 2011 (secchi=3.4 feet) in Elizabeth. Dissolved oxygen levels were also low (4.9 ppm) throughout the water column during the 2011 assessment. Total phosphorus (0.050 ppm) and chlorophyll-a (17.7 ppb) levels were moderate and high respectively in the 2006 resurvey. Residential homes/cabins (23 homes) are limited to the north and west portions of Elizabeth because of scant access and numerous low wetland areas. Hardwood trees and adjacent wetland areas surround the shoreline. An aquatic management area (Lake Elizabeth Aquatic Management Area) was purchased in 2000 along the south shore. Walleye egg take operations were first attempted on Elizabeth during the spring of 2011 to supplement state-wide walleye egg take activities. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were moderate in 2011 (10.33 fish/gillnet) and within the normal ranges for Elizabeth and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 15.87 fish/gillnet. The yellow perch average size was moderate (0.33 pounds and 8.01 inches) from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was moderate (6.67 fish/gillnet) in the 2011 assessment. Yellow perch growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2008-2010 year classes comprised the majority of the yellow perch catch in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were high in 2011 (7.67 fish/gillnet) and near the upper ends of the normal ranges for Elizabeth and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 6.35 fish/gillnet. The northern pike average size was small (2.17 pounds and 21.04 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.61 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was high (4.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2011 assessment. Northern pike growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1 and 7-8, but within the normal ranges for ages 2-6. The 2009 northern pike year class comprised 38% of the 2011 northern pike assessment catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low to moderate in 2011 (4.00 fish/trapnet), but within the normal ranges for Elizabeth and similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 8.15 fish/trapnet. The 2011 bluegill average size was moderate (0.26 pounds and 5.90 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.20 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low (2.10 fish/trapnet) in the 2011 assessment. <br> \n  <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2011 (11.50 fish/trapnet) and above or near the upper ends of the normal ranges for Elizabeth and similar lakes (75th=12.33 fish/trapnet). The black crappie historical average catch rate is 4.42 fish/trapnet. The 2011 black crappie average size was moderate to large (0.55 pounds and 9.62 inches) from trapnets. The catch rate of preferred size (10.00 inches) and larger black crappie was high (4.70 fish/trapnet) in the 2011 assessment.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite crappie numbers were moderate in 2011 (1.70 fish/trapnet) and within the normal ranges for Elizabeth and similar lakes. White crappie historical average catch rate is 1.44 fish/trapnet. The 2011 white crappie average size (0.51 pounds, 9.88 inches) was large, but similar to the historical average (0.45 pounds) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were not captured in gillnets or trapnets in 2011. A spring electrofishing survey for adult largemouth bass was not conducted in 2011. Near shore electrofishing and seining gear captured moderate numbers of yearling and young of year largemouth bass during the late summer and fall of 2011. The largemouth bass catch rate was high to moderate (40.00 fish/hour, 1.80 pounds and 13.79 inches average size) in a previous 2006 spring electrofishing survey. The Spicer Area largemouth bass average catch rate is 46.09 fish/hour (1.25 pounds average weight). Other spring electrofishing surveys were conducted on Elizabeth during 1991 (5.33 fish/hour, 2.27 pounds average weight) and 2002 (26.00 fish/hour, 2.54 pounds average weight). <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye numbers were high in 2011 (21.67 fish/gillnet) and above the normal ranges for Elizabeth and similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 8.68 fish/gillnet. Abundant numbers of 10-12 inch walleye were captured in ice out trapnets during the 2011 egg take operations on Elizabeth. The 2011 walleye average size was small to moderate (0.99 pounds and 13.94 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 2.05 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was high (7.67 fish/gillnet) in 2011. The catch rate of preferred size (20.00 inches) and larger walleye was low (0.33 fish/gillnet) in 2011. Walleye growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3 and above for ages 4-8. The 2008 and 2009 year classes comprised 56% and 17% respectively of the 2011 assessment walleye catch. The 2008 year class is probably from natural reproduction or movement into Elizabeth from an Ella fryling stocking in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Elizabeth is probably insignificant during most years, although adequate windswept shoal water substrates for good spawning habitat are present in Elizabeth. Walleye fry (0.3 - 1.0 million) have been stocked generally every odd year since 1983 in Elizabeth. Approximately 1.08 million walleye fry were stocked in 2011 as part of a 10% return for walleye egg take and part of the scheduled stocking. Abundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" walleye (86.00 YOY/hour, 5.83 inches average length) were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY walleye were also captured in other fall electrofishing surveys during walleye fry stocked years of 2005 (84.00 YOY/hour, 6.79 inches), 2007 (196.00 YOY/hour, 6.29 inches) and 2009 (51.00 YOY/hour, 4.93 inches). Fish movement back and forth between Elizabeth and connected lakes of Carrie and Ella probably occurs frequently during high water connections via outlets flowing into Elizabeth. Abundant numbers of marked fingerlings from Carrie and unmarked fingerlings believed to be from Elizabeth (2009 unmarked fry stocking) were captured in a 2009 Carrie Lake fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish were first documented in Elizabeth during 2011. Low numbers of channel catfish (0.67 fish/gillnet, 0.20 fish/trapnet) were captured in gillnets and trapnets. The 2011 channel catfish average size was large (4.85 pounds and 4.41 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively). Channel catfish have been stocked (Big Kandiyohi) or moved (Lillian) into other lakes within the South Fork of Crow River Watershed. The channel catfish may have moved into the Elizabeth from the outlet via the South Fork of Crow River from connected tiles and ditches or were illegally stocked. <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth buffalo fish were first observed in Elizabeth during 2011 (2.00 fish/gillnet). The 2011 bigmouth buffalo average size was small (0.76 pounds and 10.39 inches) from gillnets. The bigmouth buffalo may have also moved into the Elizabeth from the outlet via the South Fork of Crow River from connected tiles and ditches or were illegally stocked. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2011 (2.60 fish/trapnet) and near the lower ends of the normal ranges for Elizabeth and similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 16.74 fish/trapnet. Black bullhead abundance in 2011 gillnets (2.00 fish/gillnet) was also below the historical average catch rate (29.47 fish/gillnet). The 2011 black bullhead average size was large (0.96 pounds and 11.53 inches) from trapnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.52 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were high in 2011 (6.30 fish/trapnet) and above the normal ranges for Elizabeth and similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 4.60 fish/trapnet. The 2011 carp average size was large (7.21 pounds and 24.55 inches) from trapnets. The carp historical average weight is 4.60 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Elizabeth include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting Kandiyohi County in operating the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking walleye fry every other year. The Elizabeth fishery will be surveyed in the 2016 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Lake Elizabeth was conducted during late June of 2016. A spring daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on June 2, 2016 to evaluate the Largemouth Bass population. A fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on September 8, 2016 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. Elizabeth is a large (1,023 acres), shallow (9 feet maximum depth), turbid, aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Partial winterkills have occurred in Elizabeth, but are generally rare. An aeration system (two surface aerators) has been available for use on Elizabeth since the 1999-2000 winter. The aeration system was used in the 2000-01, 2007-08, 2009-10, 2012-13 and 2014-15 winters. Moderate nutrient runoff inflows are possible into Elizabeth during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. Elizabeth is connected to two small lakes (Ella & Carrie) during moderate to high water level conditions. An outlet structure is located on the southeast side of the lake.  The outlet connects to a shallow winterkill marsh/lake (Johnson Lake) within the South Fork of the Crow River Watershed. Water levels were above normal during the summer and fall of 2016. Emergent vegetation consists mostly of cattail species, hardstem bulrush and river bulrush located along the south shoreline areas. Submergent vegetation densities (i.e. curly-leaf pondweed, water celery, chara, water moss, coontail, sago pondweed, bushy pondweed and various other pondweeds, etc.) were moderately abundant during 2016 and 2002 surveys, but low during the 2011 and 2006 surveys. Water clarity was poor during mid to late June of 2016 (secchi=1.7-2.6 feet) in Elizabeth. Dissolved oxygen levels were moderate (6.3-7.8 ppm) throughout the water column during the 2016 survey. Total phosphorus (0.042 ppm) and chlorophyll-a (14.2 ppb) levels were moderate in early June of 2016. Residential homes/cabins (23 homes, 2011 survey) are limited to the north and west portions of Elizabeth because of scant access and numerous low wetland areas. Hardwood trees and adjacent wetland areas surround the shoreline. A state aquatic management area \"AMA\" (Lake Elizabeth AMA) was purchased in 2000 along the south shore. Walleye egg take operations were conducted on Elizabeth during 2011 and 2013-2015 to supplement state-wide Walleye egg take activities. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2016 (6.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (14.72 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch average size was large (0.31 pounds and 8.6 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.24 pounds from gillnets. Yellow Perch growth rates were excellent.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were moderate in 2016 (6.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the historical average (6.31 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike average size was small (2.10 pounds and 21.2 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.55 pounds from gillnets. Northern Pike growth rates were fair to poor. The 2013 Northern Pike year class comprised 48% of the 2016 Northern Pike survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2016 (8.50 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (8.19 fish/trapnet). The 2016 Bluegill average size was small (0.11 pounds and 4.9 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.19 pounds from trapnets. Bluegill growth rates were excellent. The 2015 Bluegill year class comprised 82% of the 2016 Bluegill survey catch. <br> \n  <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were moderate in 2016 (4.00 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (4.36 fish/trapnet). Abundant numbers of variable size Black Crappie (6.33 fish/gillnet, 0.28 pounds average weight) were captured in the 2016 gillnets. The 2016 Black Crappie average size was moderate (0.46 pounds and 8.8 inches) from trapnets. The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.51 pounds and 0.30 pounds from trapnets and gillnets respectively. The Black Crappie catch rate of 10.0 inches and larger was moderate (1.40 fish/trapnet) in 2016. Black Crappie growth rates were excellent. Multiple Black Crappie year classes (2012-2015) were abundant within the 2016 Black Crappie survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass sampled were in post spawn condition during the 2016 spring daytime electrofishing survey. The Largemouth Bass catch rate was high (44.52 fish/hour), but the average size was small (0.21 pounds and 6.4 inches average size) in the 2016 spring daytime electrofishing survey. Largemouth Bass natural reproduction and recruitment has provided a modest fishery for large fish during the past in Elizabeth. Previous spring night time electrofishing surveys conducted during the spawning seasons on Elizabeth documented lower catch rates, but larger sized fish. <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2016 (18.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (9.92 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Walleye average size was moderate (1.05 pounds and 13.9 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.91 pounds from gillnets. The Walleye catch rate of 15.0 inches and larger was moderate (6.33 fish/gillnet) in 2016. The Walleye catch rate of 20.0 inches and larger was low (1.00 fish/gillnet) in 2016. Walleye growth rates were fair. The 2013 and 2014 year classes comprised 39% and 38% respectively of the 2016 Walleye survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Elizabeth is sporadic, although adequate windswept shoal water substrates for good spawning habitat are present in Elizabeth. Walleye egg take (minimal) last occurred in 2015 on Elizabeth for statewide quotas. Walleye fry (0.3-1.0 million) were stocked generally every odd year from 1983 to 2011 in Elizabeth. Spicer strain Walleye fry were recently stocked in 2016 (0.82 million fry), 2014 (1.0 million) and 2013 (1.0 million).  <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers (77.4 YOY/hour, 6.3 inches) were captured in a 2016 fall night electrofishing survey. There were no yearling Walleye captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (30.0 YOY/hour, 5.5 inches) were captured in the 2015 fall night electrofishing survey. These fish were from natural reproduction or/and movement into Elizabeth from connected Lake Ella. Walleye fry (152,000 fish) were stocked into Ella during 2015. Abundant numbers of Walleye were captured in the 2014 (567.0 YOY/hour, 5.9 inches) and 2013 (133.1 YOY/hour, 5.5 inches) Elizabeth fall night electrofishing surveys. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (78.0 fish/hour, 9.7 inches) in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. Fish movement back and forth between Elizabeth and connected lakes of Carrie and Ella probably occurs frequently during high water connections via outlets flowing into Elizabeth. High water conditions were present during June-July of 2014 and 2016. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish numbers were low (0.33 fish/gillnet, 0.40 fish/trapnet) in 2016. The 2016 Channel Catfish average size was moderate from both gillnets (2.12 pounds, 18.5 inches) and trapnets (2.63 pounds, 19.7 inches). Channel Catfish (0.67 fish/gillnet, 0.20 fish/trapnet) were first captured in the 2011 gillnets and trapnets. The 2011 Channel Catfish average size was large (4.85 pounds and 4.41 pounds) from gillnets and trapnets respectively. Channel Catfish have been stocked (Big Kandiyohi) or moved (Lillian) into other lakes within the South Fork of Crow River Watershed. The Channel Catfish may have moved into Elizabeth from the outlet via the South Fork of Crow River from connected tiles and ditches or were illegally stocked. <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth Buffalo numbers were moderate in 2016 (0.70 fish/trapnet, 1.67 fish/gillnet) Bigmouth Buffalo were first observed in Elizabeth during 2011 (2.00 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Bigmouth Buffalo average sizes were moderate (3.89 pounds and 2.05 pounds) from trapnets and gillnets respectively. The Bigmouth Buffalo may have also moved into Elizabeth from the outlet via the South Fork of Crow River from connected tiles and ditches or were illegally stocked. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were moderate in 2016 (17.80 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (16.87 fish/trapnet). Black Bullhead abundance in 2016 gillnets (30.67 fish/gillnet) was also near the historical average catch rate (29.62 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Black Bullhead average size was large (1.15 pounds and 12.5 inches) from trapnets. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.61 pounds from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers were moderate in 2016 (4.30 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (4.60 fish/trapnet). The 2016 Common Carp average size was large (7.73 pounds and 24.8 inches) from trapnets. The Common Carp historical average weight is 4.99 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Elizabeth include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting Kandiyohi County in operating the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, periodically using as a Walleye egg take lake and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2021. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

Elizabeth is a large (1,023 acres), shallow (9 feet maximum depth), turbid, periodically aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Elizabeth is sporadic during most years based on previous surveys. Although, adequate windswept shoal water substrates for good Walleye spawning habitat are present in Elizabeth. Walleye egg take had occurred in recent years on Elizabeth for statewide quotas. Walleye fry (0.3-1.0 million) had been stocked generally every other year from 1983 to 2013 in Elizabeth. Spicer strain Walleye have been stocked into Elizabeth since 2005. Walleye fry are currently stocked every year during egg take operations. In 2019, 251,955 Walleye fry were stocked in Elizabeth. There were 205,472 Walleye fry stocked in Elizabeth during 2018 (part of egg take return). In 2017, there were 510,003 Spicer strain Walleye stocked in Elizabeth. Approximately 1.06 million Walleye fry were stocked in 2014 (part of a 10% return for Walleye egg take) and 2013 (scheduled stocking and 10% return). Walleye fingerlings were only stocked with substantial numbers in 1996 (46,000 fish), however recruitment was poor due in part to a partial winterkill in 1997. <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY (80.00 YOY/hour, 6.52 inches) and Yearling Walleye numbers (24.00 fish/hour, 10.64 inches) were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (52.00 YOY/hour, 6.78 inches) were captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (30.00 YOY/hour, 6.44 inches average) were captured in 2017. Yearling Walleye numbers captured were also low (4.00 fish/hour, 10.39 inches average) in 2017. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (77.42 YOY/hour, 6.34 inches) were captured in 2016 fall night electrofishing survey. There were no yearling Walleye captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. Low numbers of YOY Walleye (30.00 YOY/hour, 5.52 inches) were captured in the 2015 fall night electrofishing survey. These fish were from natural reproduction or/and movement into Elizabeth from connected Lake Ella. Walleye fry (152,000 fish) were stocked into Ella during 2015. Abundant numbers of Walleye were captured in the 2014 (567.01 YOY/hour, 5.85 inches average) and 2013 (133.13 YOY/hour, 5.51 inches average) Elizabeth fall electrofishing surveys. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (78.00 fish/hour, 9.67 inches average) in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey.  <br> \n <br> \nWe observed abundant numbers of YOY Yellow Perch, YOY and adult Largemouth Bass; low/moderate numbers of Bluegill and Black Crappie during the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. Adult Walleye were also abundant (18.67 fish/gillnet, 1.04 pounds and 13.9 inches) in the most recent 2016 standard summer gillnet and trapnet survey. A partial winterkill of mostly Common Carp with lower numbers of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie occurred due to high snowfall accumulations resulting in low oxygen levels in late February of 2019. However, we caught abundant numbers of Walleye and other gamefish during our April Walleye egg take in 2019. We took 106 quarts of Walleye eggs during 2019. <br> \n <br> \nThe Elizabeth fishery will be surveyed in the 2021 summer for all fish species. Walleye fry are scheduled to be stocked annually (up to 500,000 fish) during egg take years or every other year during non-egg take years. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings.  <br> \n</p>",

Previous fall electrofishing surveys were conducted at three stations for a total of 30 minutes. The 2020 survey was conducted as part of a larger statewide research study to evaluate fall electrofishing catch effectiveness for different total shocking times. Initially, six stations were to be sampled for a total of 120 minutes. However, only four stations were sampled for a total of 60 minutes in 2020 due to difficult sampling conditions caused by low water levels and dense submergent vegetation. Water temperature was at 65 F. We observed abundant numbers of yearling Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch in the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nElizabeth is a large (1,023 acres), shallow (9 feet maximum depth), turbid, periodically aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Walleye natural reproduction in Elizabeth is sporadic during most years based on previous surveys. Although, adequate windswept shoal water substrates for good Walleye spawning habitat are present in Elizabeth. Walleye egg take had occurred in recent years on Elizabeth for statewide quotas. Walleye fry (0.3-1.0 million) had been stocked generally every other year from 1983 to 2013 in Elizabeth. Spicer strain Walleye have been stocked into Elizabeth since 2005. Walleye fry are currently stocked every year during egg take operations. No Walleye eggs were taken or fry stocked in 2020. In 2019, 251,955 Walleye fry were stocked in Elizabeth. There were 205,472 Walleye fry stocked in Elizabeth during 2018 (part of egg take return). In 2017, there were 510,003 Spicer strain Walleye stocked in Elizabeth. Approximately 1.06 million Walleye fry were stocked in 2014 (part of a 10% return for Walleye egg take) and 2013 (scheduled stocking and 10% return). Walleye fingerlings were only stocked with substantial numbers in 1996 (46,000 fish), however recruitment was poor due in part to a partial winterkill in 1997. <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers (1.00 YOY/hour, 5.63 inches) were captured in 2020 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye natural reproduction success was poor in 2020.

Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (52.00 YOY/hour, 6.78 inches) were captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (30.00 YOY/hour, 6.44 inches average) were captured in 2017. Yearling Walleye numbers captured were also low (4.00 fish/hour, 10.39 inches average) in 2017. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (77.42 YOY/hour, 6.34 inches) were captured in 2016 fall night electrofishing survey. There were no yearling Walleye captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey.

THE WAE CATCH INDEX (6.60 PER GN) WAS HIGHER THAN THE 1986 AND 1960 SURVEYS AND IS COMPARABLE TO OTHER LAKES WITHIN LAKE CLASS 40.  WAE SHOW ABOVE AVERAGE GROWTH RATES AFTER AGE 1+ AND THE SAMPLE WAS WELL REPRESENTED BY SEVERAL SIZE CLASSES UP TO 28 INCHES.  THE NOP CATCH INDEX (1.20 PER GN) WAS CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THE 1986 (6.00 PER GN) AND 1960 (9.43 PER GN) INDICES AND IS LOWER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 40 LAKES.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A SIGNIFICANT 1989 OR 1990 YEAR CLASS TO BE RECRUITED TO THE FISHERY.  NORTHERN GROWTH RATES WERE ABOVE AVERAGE.  THE CRAPPIE (BLACK AND WHITE COMBINED) CATCH INDICES WERE COMPARABLE TO THE 1986 SURVEY, HOWEVER, THE AVERAGE SIZE WAS LOWER IN THE 1991 SURVEY (FEWER > 10.0 APPEARS TO BE MODERATE YEAR-CLASSES BETWEEN 1988- 1990 THAT COULD BE RECRUITED TO THE FISHERY FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS.  GROWTH RATES WERE AVERAGE FOR BOTH WHITE AND BLC, BUT WERE FASTER FOR WHC. LMB WERE SAMPLED IN RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBERS COMPARED TO OTHER AREA LAKES, HOWEVER, THE AVERAGE SIZE OF THE SAMPLED FISH WAS GOOD (THE MAJORITY WAS 14-15 INCHES).  GROWTH RATES FOR BASS WERE SLOW FOR THE FIRST 2 YEARS AND AVERAGE THEREAFTER. THE YEP CATCH INDEX (1.80 PER GN) WAS CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THE 1986 SURVEY (15.5 PER GN) AND WAS LOWER THAN MOST OF THE LAKES IN CLASS 40.  YEP GROWTH RATES WERE BELOW AVERAGE FOR THE FIRST 2 YEARS AND AVERAGE FOR AGE 3.  BLB GILLNET AND TRAPNET CATCH INDICES WERE LOWER IN 1991 COMPARED TO 1986 (SEE HISTORICAL CATCH SUMMARY AT THE END) AND THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY STUNTING IN ANY OF THE BLH SPECIES (10-12 REPRESENTED.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Lake Elizabeth was conducted during mid June of 2002. Elizabeth is a large (1,054 acres), shallow (9 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Partial winterkills have occurred in Elizabeth, but are generally rare. An aeration system (two surface aerators) has been available for use on Elizabeth since the 1999-2000 winter. The aeration system was used in the 2000-2001 winter, but has not been used since due to good winter oxygen levels. Moderate nutrient runoff inflows are possible into Elizabeth during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. Elizabeth is connected to two small lakes (Ella & Carrie) during moderate to high water level conditions. An outlet structure is located on the southeast side of the lake.  The outlet connects to a shallow winterkill marsh/lake (Johnson Lake). Water levels in the 2002 spring were below normal, but normal by late summer. High densities of submergent vegetation (curly-leaf pondweed, northern water milfoil) were present during the spring and summer of 2002. Water clarity was fair to poor during late June of 2002 in Elizabeth. Hardwood trees and adjacent wetland areas surround the shoreline. An aquatic management area (Lake Elizabeth AMA) along the south shore was purchased in 2000. Residential development is limited to primarily the north and west portion of the lake. Yellow perch numbers were moderate in 2002 (9.0 fish/gillnet), but below the historical average (19.2 fish/gillnet). The 2002 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.22 lbs. and 7.4 inches) from gillnets. The largest yellow perch captured was 10.3 inches from the 2002 assessment.Northern pike numbers were high in 2002 (10.7 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (6.5 fish/gillnet).

Current fish management activities on Elizabeth include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting Kandiyohi County in operating the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking walleye fry every other year. The Elizabeth fishery will be surveyed in the 2006 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on Lake Elizabeth during September 7, 2023 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to fry stocking/natural reproduction. The 2023 fall electrofishing survey was conducted at three stations for a total of 25 minutes. Water levels were low with moderate sago pondweed present. Water clarity was poor (<1 foot). Water temperature was at 77 F. We observed low/moderate numbers of Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Black Bullhead and Common Carp in the 2023 fall electrofishing survey. Most species observed were YOY fish in addition to a few adults (Common Carp). A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nElizabeth is a large (1,023 acres), shallow (9 feet maximum depth), turbid, periodically aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. A significant winterkill of Walleye and Common Carp with a lesser degree of Northern Pike and Yellow Perch occurred during the 2022-23 winter. Many of the dead fish were observed in the access bay adjacent to the Ella Outlet. The surface aerators were run the entire 2022-23 winter (Northeast side of Elizabeth), but the fish kill occurred primarily on the northwest side of the lake. Lake Ella also experienced a significant winterkill of Walleye and Common Carp. The Elizabeth ice out trapnetting catch (9 single frame sets during late April of 2023) consisted of numerous adult Northern Pike and Black Bullhead in addition to low numbers of adult Common Carp, Walleye and Black Crappie. Ice out test netting was conducted for potential Walleye egg take and Northern Pike propagation. Poor conditions such as high snowfall, long winter duration, low water and high aquatic vegetation contributed to the winterkill severity in many local lakes for 2022-23 winter. The aeration system did provide a refuge for some gamefish to survive in Elizabeth. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Elizabeth is sporadic during most years based on previous surveys. Although, adequate windswept shoal water substrates for good Walleye spawning habitat are present in Elizabeth. Walleye egg take had occurred in recent years on Elizabeth for statewide quotas. Walleye fry (0.3-1.0 million) had been stocked generally every other year from 1983 to 2013 in Elizabeth. Spicer strain Walleye have been stocked into Elizabeth since 2005. Walleye fry are currently stocked every year during egg take operations. About 513,000 fry were stocked in 2023 and 2022. No walleye fry were stocked in 2020 due to Covid. In 2019, 251,955 Walleye fry were stocked in Elizabeth. There were 205,472 Walleye fry stocked in Elizabeth during 2018 (part of egg take return). In 2017, there were 510,003 Spicer strain Walleye stocked in Elizabeth. Approximately 1.06 million Walleye fry were stocked in 2014 (part of a 10% return for Walleye egg take) and 2013 (scheduled stocking and 10% return). Walleye fingerlings were only stocked with substantial numbers in 1996 (46,000 fish), however recruitment was poor due in part to a partial winterkill in 1997. <br> \n <br> \nModerate young of year \"YOY\" Walleye numbers were collected in a 2023 daytime electrofishing survey (16.80 YOY/hour, 5.66 inches). Abundant YOY (92.00 YOY/hour, 6.02 inches) were captured in a 2022 daytime electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye are probably more numerous than documented in 2022 and 2023 due to daytime electrofishing being less effective than nighttime electrofishing for catching YOY Walleye. A fall electrofishing survey was not conducted in Elizabeth during 2021. Low YOY Walleye numbers (1.00 YOY/hour, 5.63 inches) were captured in 2020 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye natural reproduction success was poor in 2020. Abundant YOY (80.00 YOY/hour, 6.52 inches) and Yearling Walleye numbers (24.00 fish/hour, 10.64 inches) were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (52.00 YOY/hour, 6.78 inches) were captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (30.00 YOY/hour, 6.44 inches average) were captured in 2017. Yearling Walleye numbers captured were also low (4.00 fish/hour, 10.39 inches average) in 2017. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (77.42 YOY/hour, 6.34 inches) were captured in 2016 fall night electrofishing survey. There were no yearling Walleye captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. Low numbers of YOY Walleye (30.00 YOY/hour, 5.52 inches) were captured in the 2015 fall night electrofishing survey. These fish were from natural reproduction or/and movement into Elizabeth from connected Lake Ella. Walleye fry (152,000 fish) were stocked into Ella during 2015. Abundant numbers of Walleye were captured in the 2014 (567.01 YOY/hour, 5.85 inches average) and 2013 (133.13 YOY/hour, 5.51 inches average) Elizabeth fall electrofishing surveys. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (78.00 fish/hour, 9.67 inches average) in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey.  <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye were low (3.67 fish/gillnet, 3.16 pounds and 20.8 inches) in the most recent 2022 June gillnet and trapnet survey. The 2018 year class comprised 41% of the 2022 survey catch. However, Walleye numbers are reduced as of 2023 due to the recent winterkill. A partial winterkill of mostly Common Carp with lower numbers of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie occurred due to high snowfall accumulations resulting in low oxygen levels in late February of 2019. However, we caught abundant numbers of Walleye and other gamefish during our April Walleye egg takes in 2019, 2021 and 2022. We took 106 quarts of Walleye eggs during 2019, however the hatching/fertilization success was poor due in part to stress on fish by low winter oxygen levels and rapidly warming temperatures (>50 F) during egg take. We took 160 quarts of Walleye eggs in 2021, but the hatch was poor (25%) likely due to warm water temperatures above 50 F. during the egg take. Oxygen levels were low in February of 2022 even with the aeration system running, but no winterkill was observed. The Walleye spawning population consisted mostly of females in the 2022 egg take netting. Walleye hatch percentage was close to 69% from Elizabeth eggs due in part to ideal water temperature (44-50 F) during the 2022 spring egg take. No Walleye eggs were taken in 2020 (covid) or 2023 (winterkill). <br> \n <br> \nThe Elizabeth fishery will be surveyed in the 2026 summer for all fish species. Walleye fry are scheduled to be stocked annually (up to 500,000 fish). Fall electrofishing surveys will be periodically conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
