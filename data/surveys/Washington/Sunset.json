Rd. 10 on the south end.  Boat access is available in the city property, but the access is in poor condition with no legal parking.  Bluegill is the most abundant species.  Bluegills up to 8.5 inches were sampled, but most are less than 6 inches, with an average of 4.5 inches.  Black crappie are moderately abundant.  There were two size groups of black crappie - 3 to 4.5 inches and 5.5 to 8 inches, with some up to 9 inches.  Northern pike are abundant, with lengths ranging from 14 to 27 inches and a 19.5 inch average.  Largemouth bass also appear to be abundant, but were not adequately sampled with the gears used during this survey.  Walleye were sampled in low to moderate numbers as the result of a private stocking in 1993.  Lengths ranged from 17 to 21 inches.  Moderate numbers of pumkinseed and hybrid sunfish were sampled - both species had average lengths of about 5.5 inches.  Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers with an average length of 7.5 inches.  Neascus (black spot) was prevalent in bluegill, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch.</p>",
