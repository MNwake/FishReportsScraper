                "narrative": "<p>Manuel Mine Pit Lake is a former open pit iron mine located northeast of Crosby that has filled with water.  Manuel is a Designated stream trout lake.  Designated stream trout lakes have additional angling regulations.  Be sure to consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations book for regulations, seasons, and possession limits before fishing trout streams or lakes.  Some of the additional regulations include:  A trout stamp is required of anglers ages 16-64 to possess trout and is required while fishing in a Designated lake or stream.  Fishing for any species in a Designated Trout Water when trout season is closed is prohibited.  Fishing for stream trout is allowed from one hour before sunrise until 11pm.  Using or possessing live minnows is prohibited.  Live leeches and worms are legal to use.  Manuel Mine and all other Designated stream trout lakes in Crow Wing and Cass counties are closed to winter fishing.   <br> \n <br> \nManuel Mine Pit is small at 40 acres, but deep with a maximum depth of 160 ft.  The water is very clear with visibility to a depth of nearly 30 ft.  The gravel access road is located on the west side of County Highway 31, 1 mile north of Highway 210.  Access to the lake is by a 400 ft. walking path from the parking lot.   <br> \n <br> \nOnly four fish species were captured in the June 2009 netting.  Yellow perch were the most common fish in the gill nets with an average catch of 49 per net.  Most perch were around 6 to 7 inches long with the largest at 8.7 inches.  Rainbow trout had an average catch of 4.5 fish per gill net and ranged 9.5 to 14.1 inches.  Most of the rainbow trout were from the May 2009 stocking of 4,000 yearlings, although four trout appeared to have been from the 2008 stocking.  White suckers were the second most common fish in the gill nets (7.8 per net) and ranged from 6.5 to 12.6 inches long.  A large number of bluegills were captured in the trap nets.  Most bluegills were from 4 to 6 inches long with the largest at 8.7 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Manuel Mine Pit Lake is a former open pit iron mine that has filled with water and is managed as a designated stream trout lake for Rainbow Trout. The dissolved oxygen and temperature profiles were measured on August 12, 2020 to monitor habitat for trout. Optimal thermal and oxygen conditions for Rainbow Trout (11-19? C [52-66? F] and greater than or equal to 5 ppm DO) occurred in about 8 vertical ft from a depth of 24 to 31 ft. At the maximum depth measured, 49 ft, the temperature was 6? C (42? F) with 10.1 ppm dissolved oxygen. The coldwater habitat index value of the temperature at a dissolved oxygen concentration of 3 ppm (TDO3) value was likely several degrees less than the 6? C minimum temperature measured. <br> \n <br> \nManuel is normally stocked with about 3,000 yearling Rainbow Trout each spring with additional surplus yearling or adult Rainbow Trout occasionally stocked in the fall, winter, or spring when available.  <br> \n <br> \nManuel is located in the Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area. Consult State Recreation Area regulations for vehicle permit and other use information. Designated stream trout lakes have additional angling regulations. Be sure to consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations book for regulations, seasons, and possession limits before fishing designated trout waters. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
