                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment was conducted at Lake Cornelia, Edina on the 29-30 of June 2005.  Lake Cornelia is a small lake in Edina; it is divided into an 18.9-acre northern and a 32.6-acre southern basin by West 66th Street.  Rosland Park is located on the east side of the northern basin.  Anglers can try their luck fishing at the pier in Rosland Park or from shore off 66th Street.  Since 2001, Cornelia Lake has been managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood Program (FiN), in cooperation with the City of Edina, and the northern basin has received annual stockings of adult bluegill. Bluegills and black crappies were the primary species sampled in Lake Cornelia.  The trap net catch of bluegills was 12.7 fish per net, above median levels for the lake type.    Bluegills ranged in length from 2.6 to 8.0 inches in length, with a mean length of 4.1 inches.  Most of the bluegills sampled during the survey were in the northern basin.The average catch of black crappies was 20.2 fish per trap net for both basins combined; black crappies were more abundant on the southern basin than on the northern basin.  Black crappies were 4.6 to 10.3 inches, with a mean length of 6.7 inches.  Many large crappies were sampled, with about 30% of catchable-sized crappies over 8 inches.Common carp were abundant in Lake Cornelia (33 per gill net, 26.8 per trap net), and were 9.6 inches mean length.  Dissolved oxygen readings indicate probable winterkills most winters; therefore though carp migrate into the lake annually, they do not survive most winters.Other species sampled included black bullheads, and low numbers of yellow perch, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, and gold fish.  Seven snapping turtles and three painted turtles were also captured during the survey.      Water quality measurements were taken on both the southern and northern basins in the deepest holes found.  In the southern basin, the sampling site was in 5.5 feet of water.  Dissolved oxygen ranged from 6.1 to 4.6 ppm and the water temperature was 23.5 C.   Water clarity was low, with a 0.75-foot secchi disk reading.  In the northern basin, the sampling site was in 4.25 feet of water.  Dissolved oxygen ranged from 7.2 to 4.1 ppm and the water temperature was 23.8 C.   The secchi disk reading was 1.25 feet.Rosland Park has many amenities in addition to Lake Cornelia.  The Park is a great place to spend a day fishing, swimming in the pool, and picnicking.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Cornelia is a small lake located within the Edina city limits. The lake is divided into an 18.9-acre northern and a 32.6-acre southern basin. Lake Cornelia was managed as a kid's fishing pond and was stocked with Bluegills, Black Crappies, Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass sporadically beginning in 1961. The most recent previous sampling of Lake Cornelia was a 2010 survey.  The lake has been managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2001.  Cornelia's last stocking was with Bluegill in spring 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was well-below average compared to similar lakes and individuals were small, averaging under 4.5 inches in length.  The largest Bluegill measured was just over 7.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead and Green Sunfish were the two most abundant species captured in the 2019 survey.  Black Bullhead catch had increased from 287 to 312 and their abundance was well-above average for both surveys.  Green Sunfish abundance had markedly increased between the 2010 and 2019 surveys.  Only 8 individuals were captured in 2010 compared to 314 in 2019.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, Goldfish, and Golden Shiner.  Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Common Carp were sampled in 2010 but were not captured in this survey.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Cornelia is a small lake located within the Edina city limits. The lake is divided into an 18.9-acre northern and a 32.6-acre southern basin.  Lake Cornelia was managed as a kid's fishing pond and was stocked with bluegills, black crappies, northern pike and largemouth bass sporadically beginning in 1961.  The last survey completed on Lake Cornelia was in 2005 and it has been managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2001, receiving annual stockings of bluegills. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance has decreased since the last survey in 2005.  Abundance of black crappies captured was below average.  Black crappies measured from 6.9 to 8.3 inches in length with an average length of 7.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThere were no bluegill sunfish captured during this survey, compared with 76 captured in the 2005 survey. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch was the primary species targeted in Lake Cornelia.  Yellow perch catch rates decreased from the last survey performed in 2005 but still remained relatively high for this type of lake.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 4.9 to 9.6 inches with an average of 7.6 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp abundance also decreased in Lake Cornelia and were 12.7 inches in average length.  Dissolved oxygen readings indicate a probably winterkill most winters; therefore carp migrate into the lake annually but do not survive most winters. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included black bullheads, which averaged a length of 5.8 inches. Low numbers of golden shiners, green sunfish, goldfish and pumpkinseed sunfish were also captured.  Five painted turtles and seven snapping turtles were captured during this survey. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at:  www.mndnr.gov/fishing/fin. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
