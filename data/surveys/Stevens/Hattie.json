                "narrative": "<p>Lake Hattie is a shallow, highly productive basin located in Stevens County, three miles south of Alberta. An improved DNR public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  Maximum depth is approximately 9.0 feet.  Low water and large rocks can restrict navigation in some areas.  Anglers can expect poor water clarity during much of the summer.  As a result of dense algal blooms and suspended sediment, summer water transparency measurements have rarely exceeded 3.0 feet.  Rooted aquatic plants are scarce due to poor water clarity.  <br> \n <br> \nDue to shallowness of the lake and nutrient enrichment, Lake Hattie's fish community is threatened by potential of winterkill.  An aeration system is operated by a sportsmen's group (Save-A-Lake Association) to prevent winterkill.  While potential for winterkill events has diminished with aeration, a rare and severe open water fish kill occurred in October 2009.  Walleye were most impacted, but other dead fishes such as Common Carp and Black Bullheads were observed.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in June 2017 to assess the restored fish community.  The gamefish community has recovered well following the most recent fish kill event.  Habitat characteristics favor Walleye and Black Crappie, thus management efforts have been directed towards these species.  Anglers will find quality fishing opportunities for Walleye, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike.  The walleye population is sustained by fry stockings.  Fry stockings have been successful.  Walleye are now very abundant.  Most gill net captures were cohorts of a strong 2013 year class and moderately strong 2014 and 2015 year classes.  Almost half of the Walleye sampled were over 15 inches.  Prior to 2001, Black Crappie were rare or absent in Lake Hattie.  Adult crappie were transferred into Lake Hattie in late spring of 2002 to establish a population.  A reproducing Black Crappie population has developed.  Black Crappie caught during the 2017 survey averaged 8.4 inches.  Some fish up to 12 inches were recorded in survey catches.  A quality Northern Pike fishery also exists in Lake Hattie.  Catch rates and average length of Northern Pike were moderate.  Northern Pike up to 31 inches were sampled.  Other fish species that were abundant during the survey include Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, and Black Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Despite winter operation of an aeration system, trap netting results suggested winterkill severity was high.  It is worth noting that low oxygen levels were already being observed in late December, prior to the aeration system being turned on.  A few large Bigmouth Buffalo and an abundant Black Bullhead population were the only fishes sampled.  No gamefish species were collected.  Walleye fry and adult Yellow Perch were stocked in spring 2023 to help restore this fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Hattie is a shallow, turbid, and hypereutrophic basin located in Stevens County.  Maximum depth is approximately 9 feet.  Dense algal blooms and suspended sediment limit water clarity.  Secchi disk measurements rarely exceed 3.0 feet.  These poor conditions provide little aquatic habitat for most gamefish, especially sunfish and bass.  Walleye are able to tolerate these degraded conditions and provide recreational fishing.  Lake Hattie is prone to occasional winterkill.  A pump and baffle aeration system is operated by a local sportsmens group to prevent winterkill.Walleye gill net catches averaged 7.3 fish/net in 2001 which is within the normal range of catch rates for similar lakes.  Mean weight of walleye captured was about 1.7 pounds.  Age-2 and age-4 fish comprised most of the fish captured in gill nets.  These year classes correspond to alternate year fry stockings in 1999 and 1997.  Northern pike fry were stocked in 1998 and 2000 to increase abundance and provide additional fishing opportunities.</p>",

This decline may be resultant of a recorded summer kill of 1987. Mean weight of Northern Pike has increased significantly from 1.56lbs to 2.79 lbs. Walleye abundance varied little from that of the 1984 survey. Mean weight increased from 2.5lbs to over 3lbs each. Bluegill numbers remain low after recent stockings of adult fish. Wave-induced turbidity and subsequent lack of vegetation in Lake Hattie may limit Bluegill and Largemouth Bass populations. Carp and Black Bullhead numbers have decreased since 1989 and average sizes captured have increased. These population responses may be attributable to recent mild winters and long-term presence of adequate numbers and sizes of predators. This fishery is in good condition given environmental limitations.</p>",

The assessment was conducted to determine if any fish had survived the winters that the system was in operation and what species of fish the aeration system is actually perpetuating.  Five species of fish were captured during the netting assessment. The Walleye catch rate was 23 fish/gillnet.  This catch rate is well above the third quartile (13.0 fish/gillnet) for lakes within lake classification 43.  The mean weight of Walleye captured was 1.26 lbs. Northern Pike were also present in Lake Hattie.  CPUE was 5.0 fish/gillnet.  The mean weight of Northern Pike captured in gillnets was 4.1 lbs. Bigmouth Buffalo, Carp and Black Bullhead were also collected in the test nets.  No Panfish species were captured during the survey.  The crew leader noted that strong winds had disrupted the trapnet sets, thus, Panfish may not have been sampled effectively.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Hattie is a shallow, hyper-eutrophic basin located in Stevens County, three miles south of Alberta.  An improved DNR public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  Maximum depth is approximately 9.0 feet.  Low water can restrict navigation in some areas.   Large rocks on the lake bed can cause watercraft damage. <br> \n  <br> \nDense algal blooms and suspended sediment limit water clarity during much of the summer.  Secchi disk measurements have rarely exceeded 3.0 feet.  Rooted aquatic plants are scarce due to poor water clarity.  In absence of vegetation and in response to poor water clarity, sunfishes and densities of sight-feeding predators such as northern pike and largemouth bass are usually low.   Lake Hattie's fish community has been chronically threatened by potential of winterkill.  An aeration system is operated by a sportsmen's group (Save-A-Lake Association) to prevent winterkill. <br> \n   <br> \nAn unusual and severe openwater fish kill occurred in October 2009.  It appeared that walleye were most impacted, but other fishes such as common carp and black bullheads were observed.  Fish community attributes described from the 2011 survey reflect this fish kill and other anomalies that would typically result from increased water clarity and improved habitat conditions.  Based on past survey documentation, such changes are likely to be temporary or short-lived. <br> \n  <br> \nBecause of limiting habitat conditions for sight-feeding predators, vegetation-dependent species such as bluegill, and fishes vulnerable to low dissolved concentrations during ice cover, management emphasis has been directed at walleye.  Walleye fry have been stocked annually from 2005 through 2011. Contributions of fry stocking to population abundance have been unpredictable and inconsistent, but generally successful.  An atypically low catch rate of only 1.3 walleye/gillnet during the 2011 survey reflected losses to the October 2009 fish kill.  Average weight of walleyes captured was 3.2 pounds.  Fortunately, walleye grow fast in Lake Hattie and approach 15.0-inches in 3 years.  It is anticipated that the walleye fishery will rebound quickly. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were rare or absent in Lake Hattie prior to 2001.  Adult crappie were stocked in late spring of 2002 to establish a population.   It has taken time, but a reproducing population has developed.   Survival and recruitment of young crappie to the population may have been enhanced but less predation from and competition with walleye.  Trapnet catches during the 2011 survey were dominated by one-year -old crappies averaging 4.5 inches in length.  In absence of future fish kill events, these crappies will grow to 10.0 inches in length by the 2013 fishing opener.  The largest crappie caught during the survey measured 13.8 inches.  <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike experienced very good spawning success in 2008.  Young pike showed up in gillnets this past year as three-year-olds averaging about 18-inches in length.  A promising yellow perch fishery was lost to the fish kill.  Most of the many 6.0 to 10.0 inch perch observed during the 2006 survey were absent from the 2011 survey.  No bluegill or largemouth bass were captured. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

High 1980 indices reflect excellent survival of stocked fry responding to a void niche resulting from the 1978-79 winterkill. Present walleye population is near average for this area and growth is excellent. Apparently emigration and/or natural reproduction have added year classes as represented by fish in 1980, 1981, and 1982 age groups, when no Walleyes were stocked. Northern Pike are above average in numbers with average growth rates. Yellow Perch and Bluegills are below average in abundance, while Black Crappies are above average in numbers. High populations of Carp and Black Bullheads are present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Hattie is a shallow, turbid, and hyper-eutrophic basin located in Stevens County, three miles south of Alberta.  An improved DNR public access is located on the northwest shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nMaximum depth is approximately 9.0 feet. Dense algal blooms and suspended sediment seasonally limit water clarity. Secchi disk measurements have rarely exceeded 3.0 feet.  Rooted aquatic plants are scarce due to poor water clarity.  In absence of vegetation and in response to poor water clarity, sunfishes and densities of sight-feeding predators such as northern pike and largemouth bass are low.   Lake Hattie's fish community is occasionally threatened by winterkill.  A pump and baffle aeration system is operated by a sportsmen's group (Save-A-Lake Association) to prevent winterkill.  <br> \n <br> \nPast and present fisheries management programming has been narrowly focused on walleye stocking and commercial harvest of underutilized species such as bigmouth buffalo and common carp.  Management emphasis on walleye is based on the walleye's greater tolerance to existing habitat conditions and readily availability for restocking should winterkill occur.   Alternate-year fry stockings sustain Lake Hattie's walleye fishery.  Approximately 500,000 newly hatched walleye are stocked in odd-number years.  Contributions from fry stocking have been unpredictable and inconsistent, but generally successful.  Average gillnet catches have varied from 4.2 walleye/net in 2006 to 31.8 fish/net during the 1980 survey.  Similar to large lakes with naturally reproducing walleye populations, fishing can be a \"boom or bust\" experience.   <br> \n <br> \nFishing interest is largely based on walleye's consumptive values rather than fishing quality.  Harvest can be very heavy when cohorts of a successful stocking reach age-3.  These are young fish, but walleye grow very fast in response to little competition with other gamefishes and a high-density yellow perch prey base.  Four-year-old walleye captured during the 2006 survey averaged 19.2 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Hattie is not a good pick for fishing other gamefishes.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill sunfish are not abundant.  Black crappie fishing opportunities look good for the immediate future.  This population was lost to winterkill prior to 1988.  Stocking of adult fish in 2002 has proven successful in re-establishing a self-reproducing population in absence of winterkill.  Trapnet catches during the 2006 survey averaged 7.1 crappie/net.  Cohorts of the 2003 year class will have grown to 10.0 inches in length by the 2007 fishing season.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers traveling to Lake Hattie from a significant distance should do some homework first to find out if walleye fishing is in a boom or bust state.  Please be aware that Lake Hattie is very shallow.  Low water can restrict navigation in some areas.  Large rocks could be navigation hazards.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Winter operation of an aeration system helped maintain adequate dissolved oxygen levels on Lake Hattie and gamefish losses due to winterkill were expected to be minimal.  Early-spring trap netting results suggested that winterkill was avoided.  Gamefish species present included Black Crappie, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.  Walleye and Yellow Perch were particularly abundant and size distribution indicated the presence of multiple year classes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Hattie is a shallow, turbid, and hypereutrophic basin located in the Northern Glaciated Plainsecoregion.  Dense algal blooms and suspended sediment limit water clarity.  Secchi disk depths rarelyexceed 2.0 feet during summer months.  Accordingly, the aquatic plant community is limited in terms ofboth density and diversity.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of only 4.0 feet and is sparse orabsent in most areas.  The coverage of emergent vegetation is also extremely limited.  Lake Hattie hasalso experienced periodic winterkill and a fish kill was reported during the summer of 1987.  A pumpand baffle aeration system was installed in 1989 and is operated in most winters to prevent winterkill. These adverse environmental conditions provide little habitat for most sportfish, especially sunfishand bass.  Walleye and northern pike have been able to tolerate these conditions and provide somerecreational fishing.Walleye catches averaged 7.8 fish/gillnet in 1996.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 6.2 to 31.8fish/net in past surveys dating back to 1980.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes withsimilar chemical and physical characteristics is 2.3 - 18.1 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish capturedwas 2.3 pounds.  Walleye fry stocking is apparently effective.  There is a strong correlation betweenyears of fry stocking and relative year class strength in recent years.  There is also evidence thatsuggests limited natural reproduction also occurs.  Northern pike catches averaged 3.2 fish/gillnetwhich is within the normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes (1.1 - 8.0 fish/gillnet). Gillnet catches have ranged from 4.3 to 10.8 fish/net in previous surveys.  Mean weight of fishcaptured was 3.6 pounds.  Common carp, bigmouth buffalo, and black bullhead were the only other speciesof fish captured.  Catch rates of these species fell within the historic range of catch rates from LakeHattie.  Common carp and bigmouth buffalo are relatively abundant and commercially harvested on aregular basis.</p>",
