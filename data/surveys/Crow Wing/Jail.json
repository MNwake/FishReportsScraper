                "narrative": "<p>Jail is a 170 acre lake located about five miles northeast of the City of Pine River, in Crow Wing County.  There is no public access.  Resort access is available.  Development is relatively low with about 6.5 homes/cabins per shoreline mile in 1998.  Two resorts were also  present.  The lake has a maximum depth of 22 feet and about 67% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  Water is classified as moderately hard and phosphorus fertility is also moderate.  Water clarity was about average for the area in 1998.  The lake had a rather diverse aquatic plant community and submergent plants were found to a depth of 10 feet.Test netting was done in June of 1998.  Previous nettings were done in early September of 1966 and June of 1983.  Northern pike was the most abundant gamefish.  Catches were in the \"high\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  Pike ranged from 17-29 inches and size averaged 21 inches and 2.8 lbs.  Several age classes were present in roughly equal abundances and growth was good.  Largemouth bass were sampled only by shoreline seine.  Bluegill was caught in \"high\" numbers and average size was about 6.5 inches.  About 37% were 7.0 inches or more in length.  Several age classes were present and growth rate was fast compared to other similar type lakes.  Black crappie was very abundant in 1983 but had only \"average\" abundance in 1998.  Two age classes were sampled in trap nets.  A few smaller crappies were sampled by gill net.  Yellow perch is an important forage base for gamefish.  Perch abundance was \"high\" again in 1998.  Two fairly strong year classes provided the bulk of the perch sample and growth was good.  Other species sampled included black bullhead, yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner, pumpkinseed and white sucker.  Catch rates for these species were all in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes.</p>",
