                "narrative": "<p>Lake John is a 411-acre lake located two miles west of Annandale. The lake has a maximum depth of 28 feet and good water clarity. The state owned public access is located on the south end of the lake. Lake John has been stocked with Walleye fingerlings every other year since 2005 and was stocked every third year prior to 2005. A standard lake survey was conducted in July to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2006. In addition to the standard survey, an index of biotic integrity (IBI) survey was conducted in August. <br> \n <br> \nLake John has a diverse aquatic plant community. While no aquatic plant survey was conducted in 2016, one conducted in 2006 identified 35 species of aquatic plants with coontail, flat-stemmed pondweed, Illinois pondweed, and water celery being the most common. Emergent plants were mapped in 2016 and found to cover 59% of the shoreline. The most common species found were cattail (88 acres) and white water lily (63 acres). Bulrush and yellow water lily covered less than one acre. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch in 2016 was similar to previous surveys and was within the expected range for similar lakes. Walleye ranged in length from 9.8 to 25.9 inches with an average length of 18.7 inches. Five-year classes were sampled during the survey with every stocked year since 2007 represented. Growth of Walleye was faster than the statewide average reaching 13 inches in two years. No natural reproduction takes place in Lake John and the Walleye population is sustained through fingerling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Northern Pike was lower than in 2006, but similar to 1996 and within the higher range of expected values for similar lakes. Northern Pike ranged in length from 10.7 to 29.9 inches with an average length of 20.1 inches and 16 percent of Northern Pike sampled were longer than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike (under 22 inches) and release the larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and promote good growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also increase the survival of young Walleye and allow Yellow Perch numbers to increase. Higher perch populations are desirable as they are an important prey species for both Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by night-time electrofishing on June 2, 2016. The Largemouth Bass catch rate was much higher than recent surveys and similar to the average night-time catch rate for Sauk Rapids area lakes. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 5.6 to 19.8 inches with a mean length of 11.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Bluegill in 2016 was lower than 2006, but within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Bluegill ranged in length from 3.6 to 8.6 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Black Crappie was similar to prior surveys and at the low end of the expected range of values for similar lakes. Black Crappies ranged in length from 5.3 to 10.7 inches with an average length of 8.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2016 surveys include: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>John Lake is a 411 acre lake located two miles west of the city of Annandale.  The maximum depth of the lake is 28 feet and during mid-July adequate oxygen is present down to 14 feet.  The public access for John Lake on the south end of the lake.       John Lake is located within 50 miles of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area and therefore it receives a moderate amount of fishing pressure for a lake of its size.  Black crappie, largemouth bass, bluegill, walleye and northern pike are all present in the lake.  In the summer of 1996, a population assessment was conducted on John Lake.  The netting of the lake revealed the following information about the fish population.        The northern pike catch rate in gill nets (8.0/lift) did not significantly change from the 1991 survey (5.0/gill net).  This catch rate of northern pike was within expected levels for lakes that are similar to John Lake.  The average size northern caught in gill nets weighed 1.3 pounds and was 18.3 inches long.  The growth rate of northern pike was average when compared with lakes similar to John Lake.       The gill net catch rate of walleye in John Lake (3.0/gill net) did not appear to change from the last survey (5.2/gill net) but did fall to within expected levels for this lake type.  The average size walleye caught in gill nets was 1.9 pounds.  The vast majority of walleye caught (95%) came from years when walleye fingerlings were stocked.  The growth rate of walleye in John Lake was average when compared with similar lakes.       The trap net catch of bluegills in John Lake (14.6/trap net)  appeared to change significantly from the previous netting (68.3/trap net) and fell to within average levels for this lake type.  The catch rates of bluegills in trap nets are highly variable and this is shown by the spring netting on John Lake (4/24-4/29/96) where a total of 960 bluegills were caught (24.0/trap net).  The average weight of  bluegill caught in trap nets (0.13 pounds) declined slightly from the 1991 survey (0.15 pounds) but stayed within expected levels for this lake class.  Bluegills caught in trap nets ranged in size from 2.6- 7.6 inches and averaged 5.5 inches in length.         The catch rate of black crappie in trap nets (1.1/trap net) appeared to drop from the last netting (5.1/trap net) and fell below expected values for lakes similar to John.  Changes in catch rates of panfish in trap nets are highly dependent on the weather, therefore a small change in catch rate like this may not mean a significant change in the fish population.  A total of 90 black crappie were sampled during spring sampling and these fish averaged over 9 inches.  The average size crappie caught during summer sampling was 5.4 inches.       The largemouth bass population was sampled by spring electrofishing.  A total of 7 bass were sampled at a rate of 3.7 per hour of run-time.  This catch rate is below the Montrose Area average for bass (16.0/hour shocking).  This reduced catch rate may be an artifact of the late sampling  date (6/3/96) rather than a decline in the bass population.  Largemouth bass sampled ranged  in size from 6.2-17.4 inches and averaged 12.0 inches in length.  A total of 27 bass were sampled  during the spring assessment and these fish averaged 14 inches, with the largest fish caught  weighing over 5 pounds.</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 28 feet and generally sustains adequate oxygen level down to 14 feet in mid-summer.  The state owned public access is located on the south end of the lake.  Lake John has been stocked with walleye fingerlings every third year, and more recently, every other year.  This is the first survey since 1991.  However, a population assessment was done in 1996. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were collected by night electrofishing on May 3, 2006.  The largemouth bass catch was higher than in 1996, but lower than the average catch rate for Montrose Area lakes.  Still, Lake John is known as an excellent lake for angling largemouth.  Bass ranged in length from 9-17 inches with an average length and weight of 12.4 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Reproduction was consistent with multiple year classes noted.  Largemouth bass from Lake John grow to 12 inches in 4-5 years. <br> \n <br> \nPrevious gill net surveys have found walleye at moderate levels of abundance.  The catch rate in 2006 (3.6/gill net) was similar to that reported in 1996.  Walleye ranged in length from 11-27 inches with an average length and weight of 19.3 inches and 2.7 pounds.  No natural reproduction takes place in Lake John and the walleye population is sustained through stocking fingerlings every other year.  Walleye grow to 15 inches in 3-4 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of northern pike was significantly higher than 1996.  At this level of abundance, northern pike can affect the abundance and survival of stocked walleye and naturally produced yellow perch.  Angling is good for this population which largely consists of \u001chammerhandles.\u001d  Northern pike from Lake John reach 24 inches in 5-6 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of bluegill (41.4/trap net) was higher than 1996, but similar to 1980 and 1986.  Bluegill ranged in length from the very small to 8 inches with an average length of 5.7 inches.  Consistent sunfish angling reports are gathered from Lake John.  Bluegills grow to seven inches in 6-7 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of black crappie was identical to 1996, however, it was lower than  expected for similar lakes.  Black crappie ranged in length from 3-10 inches with an average length of eight inches.  Reproduction appears to be consistent with multiple year classes collected during the survey.  Black crappies reach eight inches in 4-5 years. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included: blacknose shiner, bowfin, brown bullhead, common carp, hybrid sunfish, Johnny darter, pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Fish ranged in size from 11 to 32 inches and the average length group was 18 inches.  The sample consisted of primarily ages 2 and 3 and females were slightly more abundant than males.   Growth of males age 4 and older was slow.  Growth of females was average.  \n\nWalleye were abundant, captured at a rate of 5/gill net, above the range of expected values for lakes similar to John.  Eighty percent of the sample were females and these were primarily age 6 fish from the 1985 stocking.  Fish ranged in size from 10 to 27 inches and the average length was 20 inches. The average weight of Walleye was 2.7 pounds. \n\nImportant species captured in trap nets were: Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Bullhead.  Bluegill were abundant and captured at a rate of 68/trap net, above the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 3 to 7.5 inches and the average length group was 5.5-5.9 inches.  Growth was slow.  Black Crappie were average in abundance, 5/trap net, and the average length group was 7.5-7.9 inches.  Growth was average.  \n\nYellow Bullhead were abundant and the catch of 17.9/trap net was more than double the range of expected values.  Yellow Bullhead ranged in size from 5 to almost 15 inches and the average length group was 10.5-10.9 inches.  The average weight of Yellow Bullheads was 0.74 pounds.  \n\nFrom trap net and electrofishing catches and angler reports it appears that Largemouth Bass are abundant and trophy sizes are present.  Spring electrofishing produced a catch rate of 20 Largemouth Bass/hour.  The fish were generally less than 13 inches and growth was average.  During spring trap netting 38 Largemouth Bass were caught and 97% of catchable size bass were 12 inches or longer. The average length was 16 inches and the largest fish was 22 inches.\n\n</p>",

Forage species included White Sucker, Yellow Perch, Golden, Blackchin, Blacknose and Spottail Shiners, Northern Redbelly Dace, Bluntnose Minnow, Banded Killifish, Brook Silverside, Iowa and Johnny Darter. Other species included Bowfin, Common Carp, Black, Yellow, and Brown Bullhead, Green, Pumpkinseed, and Hybrid Sunfish. \n\nNorthern Pike, Walleye, Pumpkinseed, and Hybrid Sunfish catches indicated high populations since the catch rates were above the range of expected values for lakes similar to John. Bowfin, Common Carp, Yellow Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Bluegill, Black Crappie and Yellow Perch exhibited average size populations. White Sucker and Black Bullhead catches fell below the range of expected values. \n\nLargemouth Bass most likely have an average population, based on supplemental spring sampling. The Northern Pike population showed average growth. Fish ranging from 11.5-34.0 inches and representing eight year classes were caught. The catch was similar to 1980. Bluegill growth was below average with fish ranging in length from 3 to 8 inches. Fifty percent of the catch was from the 1982 year class with numbers remaining close to 1980. Pumpkinseed showed a dramatic rise in abundance compared to 1980. \n\nLargemouth Bass were only caught in gillnets in 1957, 1980, and 1986. The Largemouth Bass catch dropped to 0.2/gill net from 0.5/gill net in both 1957 and 1980. Spring seining of 2.7 acres captured 32 Largemouth Bass, equal to 11.9 bass per acre seined. Eight year classes were represented in fairly similar numbers. Growth was below average. The Walleye catch was up from 1980 and contained four year classes. The 1982 year class made up 75% of the catch with all fish resulting from fingerling stockings in 1978, 1979, and1982. Walleye sampled had average growth and ranged in length from 7.2-26.7 inches. \n\nWhite Sucker numbers dropped from 1980 while Yellow Perch increased since 1980. Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 5-6.9 inches. Black and Brown Bullhead had good size and populations increased slightly, while the Yellow Bullhead population remained the same. Common Carp abundance has risen slightly since 1980 and is now just within the range of expected values for trapnets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on August 22, 2016 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with four sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 17 native species of fish including several species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and a single species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in July 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for John Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and indicates a healthy fish community. Data from this survey will be included as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the North Fork Crow River watershed. <br> \n</p>",
