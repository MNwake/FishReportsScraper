                "narrative": "<p>West Crooked Lake is located seven miles northwest of Nevis in southern Hubbard County.  West Crooked has a surface area of 279 acres and a maximum depth of 50 feet.  There is county-owned land on the west shore of the lake that provides carry-in boat access.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  West Crooked is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Belle Taine, Big Mantrap, Ojibway, and Little Sand.West Crooked provides fishing opportunities for panfish, northern pike, and walleye.  West Crooked has good populations of both bluegill and black crappie.  Trapnet catch rates for both species were above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Good numbers of bluegill in the 7-8 inch range and black crappie in the 9-10 inch range are present.  Northern pike are abundant in West Crooked.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates were above the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  While larger fish are present, the northern pike population in West Crooked is known more for numbers than size and dominated by \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19.2 inches and 1.6 pounds, with pike measured up to 32.1 inches.  The northern pike population in West Crooked is limited by high reproduction and recruitment of young pike, and very slow growth rates.  Walleye abundance (2.1 walleye/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but below the management goal of 3.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has generally been around the management goal. Stocking by the DNR is maintaining the walleye population.  West Crooked is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  West Crooked also supports a good largemouth bass fishery.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in West Crooked.Other species sampled include high numbers of yellow bullhead and moderate numbers of black bullhead, pumpkinseed, and yellow perch.  White sucker and brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

It has a maximum depth of 50 feet with approximately 51 percent of the lake shallower than 15 feet.  The shoal water soils are mainly boulder, silt, and sand.  Fish taken by test nets at numbers near or greater than the statewide median catch per set were: golden shiner, northern pike, yellow perch, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and black crappie.There are three resorts on this lake with 19 units, three private cottages, and 29 boats.  During the winter of 1962-63 there were three fish houses located on West Crooked Lake.There is a county-owned public access in Section 8.Fish Stocking:Stocking records for all three Crooked Lakes have been combined for several years.  Walleyes were stocked in \"Crooked Lake\" in 1956, 1958, 1960, and 1961.  Northern pike were stocked in 1962.Walleye stocking will be necessary to maintain a fishery for this species on this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Crooked Lake is located seven miles northwest of Nevis in southern Hubbard County.  West Crooked has a surface area of 279 acres and a maximum depth of 50 feet.  A county-owned access with no developed ramp is located on the west shore.  Boating access is also available from resorts located on the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  West Crooked is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same class include: Belle Taine (located by Nevis), Big Mantrap (2 miles north of West Crooked), Ojibway (2 miles east of West Crooked), and Little Sand (3 miles southwest of West Crooked).  West Crooked is managed primarily as a walleye, northern pike, and panfish fishery.Walleye were sampled at a rate of 3.5/gillnet, similar to past surveys and within the range typical for lake class 25.  Walleye were a quality size, with an average length and weight of 16.6 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleye up to 27.0 inches were measured.  West Crooked receives walleye fingerling stockings every other year in even calendar years.  Seventeen of the 23 walleye that were aged (74%) corresponded to years of walleye stocking.  Walleye growth rates began to slow after age three when compared to other class 25 lakes.Northern pike were sampled in high numbers (10.2/gillnet), above the typical range for class 25, but similar to past surveys on West Crooked.  Sizes of northern pike were fair, with an average length and weight of 20.1 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Northern pike up to 35.5 inches were sampled.  Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to class 25 lakes.Both the black crappie catch rate of 2.4/trapnet and the bluegill catch rate of 21.6/trapnet are within the typical range for lake class 25.  Past surveys have had higher bluegill catches, while black crappie catches have been stable.  Sampled bluegill were an average length of 6.5 inches, with fish measured up to 8.0 inches.  Black crappie averaged 8.6 inches in length with fish measured up to 10.9 inches.  Both bluegill and black crappie exhibited growth rates typical for lake class 25.Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers (2.5/gillnet).  The previous survey in 1992 had a similar yellow perch gillnet catch (1.0/net), while historical catch rates have been much higher ranging from 25.7/net (1962) to 75.3/net (1982).  The yellow perch population in West Crooked not only provides a forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations, but are an acceptable size for angling.  Yellow perch up to 12.6 inches were sampled.Other species sampled during the 1997 survey were pumpkinseed and yellow bullhead.  Average size of pumpkinseed was small (5.1 inches), with fish measured up to 6.9 inches.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to larger fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in West Crooked and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in West Crooked Lake was conducted on August 10-12, 2020 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 11 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Blacknose Shiner) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured eight species of fish. Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number. Similarly, Bluegill and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the catch by biomass.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community during the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Crooked Lake is located seven miles northwest of Nevis in southern Hubbard County.  West Crooked has a surface area of 279 acres and a maximum depth of 50 feet.  There is county-owned land on the west shore of the lake that provides carry-in boat access. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  West Crooked is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Belle Taine, Big Mantrap, Ojibway, and Little Sand. <br> \n <br> \nWest Crooked provides fishing opportunities for panfish, northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye.  West Crooked supports good populations of both bluegill and black crappie.  Trapnet catch rates for both species were above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range and black crappie in the 9-10 inch size range.  Northern pike abundance (13.0 pike/gillnet) was above the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  While larger fish are present, the northern pike population in West Crooked is known more for numbers than size and dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19.3 inches and 1.7 pounds, with pike measured up to 37.8 inches.  The northern pike population in West Crooked is limited by high reproduction and recruitment of young pike, and very slow growth rates.  Walleye abundance (0.8 walleye/gillnet) was down from past surveys and below the current management goal of 3 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has generally fluctuated around the current management goal.  Stocking by the DNR is maintaining the walleye population in West Crooked.  Age analysis showed that the majority of sampled walleye corresponded to stocked years.  West Crooked is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  West Crooked supports a good largemouth bass fishery.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in West Crooked. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead, and low numbers of black bullhead and golden shiner.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Crooked Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, seven miles north of Nevis.  West Crooked has a surface area of 269 acres and a maximum depth of 50 feet.  There is a county-owned public access on the west shore of the lake.  West Crooked provides angling opportunities for Panfish, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and a bonus Walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  West Crooked is in lake class 25.  Class 25 lakes are generally deep, clear, hard water lakes, with irregular shaped shoreline.  Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, Eagle, Little Sand, Third Crow Wing, Island, Little Mantrap, and Ojbway. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice for anglers on West Crooked with good populations of Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Pumpkinseed.  Anglers will find Black Crappie in the 9-10 inch size range and Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-7 inch size range.   West Crooked supports a healthy Largemouth Bass fishery, with good numbers and sizes of Largemouth Bass.  Largemouth Bass up to 19.4 inches were sampled.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass and Panfish in West Crooked.  Northern Pike are abundant in West Crooked with the population dominated by smaller Pike in the 19-21 inch size range.  A few larger Northern Pike are present with fish measured up to 37.7 inches.  Walleye were sampled in low numbers.  Past surveys have shown the Walleye population to fluctuate from low to moderate levels. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of Yellow Bullhead, and low numbers of White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in West Crooked.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in West Crooked Lake was conducted on August 7, 2017 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 12 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Blacknose Shiner). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2012 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates West Crooked Lake is in poor health as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The present walleye population is comprised of two age groups, with age two the strongest.  Walleye spawning area is good but reproduction is poor.  Abundance was slightly below area average, growth average.  Northern pike above average both in abundance and growth, spawning area good.  Yellow perch five times the area average providing a good forage base.  L.M. bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed higher than area average.  Black crappie and suckers are present in low numbers.  Bullhead species about average.Management Recommendations:In view of the good existing population of northern pike, no stocking should be done.  The survey indicates prior stocking of walleye fingerlings in alternate years as successful; therefore, it should be continued.  The stocking rate should be one pound of fingerlings per littoral acre at fish 50 per pound, in alternate years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catch rates have increased from below the first quartile in 1962 to 3.40 fish/set and 9.50 lbs/set in 1992.  The number of walleye sampled in 1992 was within the normal range for lake class 25, but the weight per set was above the third quartile.  Mean weight of individual walleye was, therefore, high at 2.79 pounds.  The size structure (PSD=94, RSD-P=35) is also indicative of a large-sized, but unbalanced, walleye population.  Sixty-two percent of the sampled walleye were age 6 or older.  Growth rates are good through age 6, but then decline sharply due, likely, to depleted yellow perch densities.  Mean length at age 4 is 14.84 inches.  Some natural reproduction is occurring in West Crooked Lake, as evidenced by the 1987 year class, which accounted for 14% of the sampled walleye.Northern pike gillnet catch rates have generally increased since 1962, and the 1992 catches (14.20 fish/set and 29.22 lbs/set) were above the third quartile for lakes in class 25.  Mean weight of individual northern pike was 2.06 pounds.  Northern pike exhibit slow growth after age 1, averaging 18.06 inches at age 4.  The poor growth rates result in a small size structure (PSD=35, RSD-P=3).  Consistently high northern pike recruitment, along with declining yellow perch abundance, results in the slow growth rates and small size structure exhibited by the northern pike population.Pumpkinseed, bluegill and largemouth bass trapnet catches were all above the third quartile for this class of lakes.  None of the three species has shown a significant density fluctuation over the past 30 years.  The size structure for pumpkinseed (PSD=23), bluegill (PSD=24, RSD-P=1) and largemouth bass (PSD=17) is small.  The poor size structures may be the result of slow growth rates.  Mean length at age 3 for bluegill is 3.52 inches and for largemouth bass is 7.75 inches.  Black crappie exhibit better growth rates and a larger size structure than the other panfish species.  Black crappie average 6.75 inches at age 3 and 17% of the black crappie sampled were larger than 10 inches.  Trapnet catches for black crappie were within the normal ranges, but have decreased since 1962.  A large decrease has also occurred in the yellow perch population, which fell from 75.25 fish/gillnet in 1982 to 1.00 fish/gillnet in 1992 (below the first quartile).  No yellow perch sampled were greater than 7 inches.White sucker and yellow bullhead catch rates were within the normal ranges for lakes in class 25.  Bullhead densities were high in 1974.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Crooked Lake is located five miles north of Nevis in central Hubbard County. West Crooked Lake has a surface area of 270 acres and a maximum depth of 50 feet. There is a county owned public access located on the west end of the lake off Inspiration Drive. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. West Crooked is in lake class 25.  These lakes are generally are irregularly shaped, deep, have clear and hard water. <br> \nIn 2012, black crappie and bluegill numbers were lower than historic averages but still above similar lakes. Black crappies were sampled up to 11 inches, with most fish 7-10 inches in length.  Anglers will find most bluegills in the 5-8.5 inch size range. <br> \nThe walleye numbers were in line with historic surveys, with excellent size for anglers.  Walleyes ranged in size from 13 to 29 inches and averaged 20 inches.  West Crooked is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years, and aging shows a majority of walleyes come from stocked years.   Yellow perch sampled were 6-10.5 inches in length.  Yellow perch are not abundant enough to attract anglers, but do provide forage for both walleyes and northern pike.   <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was well above the normal range for similar lakes, but most are generally small.  Northern pike had an average length and weight of 18.5 inches and 1.5 pounds, with the largest fishing being 33 inches. <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled up to 17 inches in length, and were sampled in comparable numbers to similar lakes. <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of pumpkinseed and yellow bullhead, and low numbers of white suckers and brown bullhead. <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in West Crooked Lake.  These species are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake-shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.</p>",
