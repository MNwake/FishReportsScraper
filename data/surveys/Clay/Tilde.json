                "narrative": "<p>In August, 2020, a targeted survey was completed on Tilde Lake to assess status of a previously detected aquatic invasive species (Red Swamp Crayfish), and also to determine the effects of recent harsh winter conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nRed Swamp Crayfish were discovered in Tilde Lake in 2016 during a standard assessment.  No other reports of Red Swam Crayfish have been recorded within Minnesota, and the source of introduction is unknown.  During the 2020 assessment, six baited cylinder traps were used to target crayfish, along with five small, nonstandard trap nets and one gill net.  Baited cylinder traps captured Fathead Minnows and Brook Stickleback.  The small trap nets had similar catches, and also sampled Central Mudminnow, White Sucker, and Northern Pike.  The gill net caught two species - White Sucker and Northern Pike.   <br> \n <br> \nNo Red Swamp Crayfish were sampled through this assessment.  The low catch rate and low species diversity sampled indicate that Tilde Lake was impacted by winterkill at some point over the past few winters.  Periodic assessments will continue to assess the condition of Tilde Lake and the presence of Red Swamp Crayfish.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tilde Lake is a 259-acre, class 43 lake in northeastern Clay County, approximately five miles northeast of Hitterdal.  The maximum depth is 13 feet and the lake experiences occasional winterkill.  The lake's shoreline is undeveloped except for a single farmstead near the southeast shore.  The surrounding watershed is primarily agricultural (small grain croplands) although there is a fringe of hardwoods and wild grasslands around much of the lake.  While the vegetative fringe probably helps to buffer the lake from field runoff, there are at least three intermittently flowing ditches draining surrounding farmland into the lake.  Based on a total phosphorus concentration of 179 ppb in 2005, Tilde Lake could be considered hyper-eutrophic.  However, two other indicators of trophic state (water clarity and chlorophyll-a) were more indicative of late mesotrophy or early eutrophy.  Algal blooms are common during summer and Walleyes in this lake are reported by some to have an undesirable flavor when the water warms. <br> \n <br> \nTilde Lake experienced a significant winterkill during the winter of 2012-2013.  The highest dissolved oxygen reading found on April 3rd of that year was 0.3 ppm.  No test netting was done to confirm the extent of the winterkill, but a near total kill was assumed due to the low amount of oxygen and prolonged ice cover.  Walleye fry were stocked the following spring with the intentions of not only restoring the Walleye fishery, but also provide a unique opportunity to harvest Walleye fingerlings to transferring to other local fishing lakes.  This strategy proved successful as 858 pounds, or 25,740 fish, of Walleye fingerlings were harvested from Tilde Lake in the fall of 2013.  Walleye fry were again stocked in 2014, but this time the stocking did not result in an abundance of young fish that could be utilized for harvest.  Walleye fry stocking resumed to the normal every other year stocking rotation in 2016.  Despite the lakes history of winterkill and questionable water quality, Tilde Lake does appear to contain some good walleye-spawning habitat as the most abundant year class found in the 2005 population assessment was attributed to a non-stocking year (2003).   <br> \n <br> \nThe scheduled standard survey of Tilde Lake was abbreviated due extreme catches of young of year Walleye.  Only two gill nets and six trap nets were fished during the survey in 2016.  The gill net catch rate for Walleye was an astonishing 199.5 fish per net.  The historical average Walleye gill net catch rate prior to this survey was 19.6 fish per net.  As mentioned, the vast majority of sampled Walleyes were from the spring fry stocking just a few months prior.  These young of year fish grew fast despite their abundance, averaging 7.6 inches in length.  The dominance of these fish also skew any further value in size-based indices for the Walleye population as a whole.   The remaining sampled Walleye originated from the previous two fry stocking events following the winterkill in 2013.  These two- and three-year-old Walleyes were 14 to 18 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low numbers included Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Rock Bass and Yellow Perch.  In most of these instances it appeared only a single year class of adults were captured of each specie.  This would suggest a private stocking event had occurred following the winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were historically common and a recent presence of Common Carp had become established in Tilde Lake.  However, since none of these species were sampled in Tilde Lake in 2016 it can be assumed the winterkill experienced in 2013 was sever enough to even eliminate these tolerant species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tilde Lake has provided a good walleye fishery in between winterkills.  Walleye fry are stocked on a regular basis, as well as in years when winterkill happens.  When walleye fry are reintroduced to the lake following a severe winterkill, they grow quickly to \"keeper\" size in only two years.  The spawning habitat in this lake also allows walleyes to reproduce successfully when they survive to maturity.  Compared to historic high catches in 1996, catch rates of walleye declined in 2005 despite continued fry stocking after the 1997 winterkill.  Walleyes averaged 14.6 inches in 2005, but a few over 20 inches were also caught.Bluegills, black crappie, and largemouth bass have not survived and may not be good candidates for future stocking in this lake.  Carp have found their way into the lake (probably due to high water levels in recent years) and apparently are reproducing.As is common in most area winterkill lakes, black bullheads dominated the fish community.  They are tolerant of low levels of dissolved oxygen and can survive when most gamefish and panfish species cannot.  Consequently, bullheads have a head start over other fish species after a winterkill has occurred.Winterkills have been documented during five years since 1978.  All but one of those episodes occurred during the 1990's.  The most recent severe kill took place in 1997.  Winterkill is a common, but unpredictable occurrence in most shallow, prairie lakes like Tilde.  When severe ones occur, they devastate the gamefish fishery.  However, fish growth rates typically are much faster in these shallow, fertile lakes than in more permanent lakes.  Boom and bust fishing can happen in a relatively short period of time.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tilde Lake has provided a good walleye fishery in between winterkills.  When walleye fry are reintroduced to the lake following a severe winterkill, they grow quickly to \"keeper\" size in only two years.  The majority of walleye that were present in the lake during the 1996 survey were stocked following the severe winterkill in 1993 and were, at three years of age, about eighteen inches long and difficult to catch due to the large amount of available food (small bullheads and fathead minnows).Bluegills were also reintroduced in 1993 and were growing rapidly and reproducing.  A few of the stocked adults were nearly ten inches long.As is common in most area winterkill lakes, black bullheads dominated the fish community.  They are somewhat tolerant of low levels of dissolved oxygen and can survive when most gamefish species cannot.  Consequently, bullheads have a head start over other fish species after a winterkill has occurred.Winterkill has occurred very irregularly at Tilde Lake since 1978.  No heavy winterkill was documented from 1978 through 1988.  Then, beginning in 1989, severe winterkill occurred in four of the next five years.  Although water levels may have been down slightly during those years, the difference would not completely explain these occurrences.  Winterkill is rarely predictable in a given year and still not completly understood.  It is, however, a natural phenomenon in area lakes with shallow depths and abundant nutrients.One advantage of winterkill lakes like Tilde over more permanent fish lakes is that fish tend to grow rapidly due to little competition following winterkill.  Thus, boom and bust fishing can occur in a relatively short period of time.Unfortunately, a severe winterkill occurred in Tilde Lake early in 1997, a few months after the data for this report were collected.  Few, if any, of the walleye and bluegill sampled in the summer of 1996 survived the winterkill.  Walleye fry and \"pre-spawn\" adult bluegill were restocked in the spring of 1997 to again begin the boom-bust cycle.</p>",
