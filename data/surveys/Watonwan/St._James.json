                "narrative": "<p>St. James Lake is a 252-acre lake located within the city limits of St. James in Watonwan County.  It has a history of dredging and therefore has some deep holes that maintain a maximum depth of around 16 feet.  Historically, St. James Lake had good water clarity, abundant aquatic vegetation, and a respectable largemouth bass/bluegill fishery prior to 1995.  However by 1999, St. James Lake had poor water clarity, was devoid of aquatic vegetation, and had a less than respectable fishery for sportfish.  This change was likely a result of low dissolved oxygen during winter due to snow cover and an ineffective aeration system.  With support from the City of St. James, the lake was reclaimed (killed-off) in the fall of 2001.  At the time, there were a few concerned citizens and sportsmen not convinced the lake needed to be reclaimed.  During the reclamation, it was soon obvious common carp, black bullheads, and black crappie had dominated the fishery.  By the spring of 2002, water clarity and aquatic vegetation returned to foster a fabulous return of the fish community.  Since the city campground is now often full, it would be difficult to find a citizen now that would say the project was not a success.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 16, 2007.      <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 128 bass/hour in 2007, 104 bass/hour in 2005, and 394 bass per hour in 2003.  Total lengths of fish ranged from 6.5 to 15.6 inches with an average of 10.6 inches.  All year classes of bass were sampled, but 2-year old fish (fish naturally reproduced in 2005) dominated the population.  Most of these fish were 9-11 inches long.  The largemouth bass condition indicated the fish are likely finding plenty to eat, as they are plump and healthy.  St. James is a unique fishery as good bass lakes are not numerous in the Windom area.  Unlike many of our other area lakes, St. James now has aquatic vegetation that provides good cover for refuge and natural reproduction.  It is this in-lake structure that provides bass anglers areas to pinpoint to put fish in the boat. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate in trap nets was nearly twice the expected upper normal range.   Total lengths ranged from 3.1 to 8.2 inches with an average of 5.8 inches.  Five-year classes of bluegill were sampled with most of the fish being 2 (5 inches), 3 (6.8 inches), and 4 (7.4 inches) years old.  Growth rates of bluegill were excellent compared to several other upper midwest state averages.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite the fact that walleye are not a primary species of management, good numbers of walleye were sampled.  The catch rate for walleye was nearly twice the expected range and they averaged 17.2 inches in total length.  Many (69%) of the walleye sampled were from the yearlings (510 pounds) stocked in 2002.   <br> \n <br> \nIt would not be a surprise to catch some northerns while fishing for bass on St. James.  Total lengths ranged from 18.4 to 29.7 inches with a mean of 23.9 inches.  The condition of these fish was as expected, as they were plump and healthy. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers are as expected.  Total lengths range from 5.6 to 11.3 inches with an average of 7.5 inches.  The condition index (plumpness) of these fish was lower than expected, but yellow perch and bluegills often compete for similar resources.  Given the large bluegill population, the condition of the perch was not surprising.   <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate in trap nets was 10.7, which was within the expected range.  Total lengths ranged from 5.5 to 11.7 inches with an average of 6.5 inches.  Smaller fish dominated the crappie fishery.  Despite this, crappie condition index was good and there will be some good \"keepers\" in a year or two. <br> \n <br> \nThe reclamation of St. James Lake was done because a significant proportion of the fishery biomass was black bullhead and common carp.  Although no common carp have been sampled post reclamation, black bullheads were been sampled in 2005 (1) and 2007 (3).  The presence of black bullheads was likely a result of an illegal stocking or they entered the lake via an angler\u0019s bait bucket.  Due to the presence of a sizable predator population (walleye, largemouth bass, and northern pike), the presence of black bullheads is not an indication that they will begin to dominate the fishery as in the past.  However, it does raise concern that common carp might find their way into St. James via bait buckets. <br> \n <br> \nNo other species were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Ryan Doorenbos  <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>2 ADULT NOP WERE COLLECTED IN 3 GILLNETS.  THIS REPRESENTS NO CHANGE SINCE THE 1986 SURVEY. BACK-CALCULATED GROWTH OF ONE PIKE WAS FAIR.  PIKE REMAIN AT LOW DENSITIES DESPITE APPARENTLY GOOD SPAWNING HABITAT AND SOME RECRUITMENT (ONE YOY COLLECTED IN SHORELINE SEINE).  COMPETITION WITH OTHER PISCIVORES OR PREDATION ON JUVENILE FISH MAY BE IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR PIKE IN THIS LAKE. ELECTROFISHING FOR LMB PRODUCED 39.33 FISH PER HOUR AVERAGING SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A POUND.  THIS IS A SELF-SUSTAINING POPULATION WITH VERY GOOD RECRUITMENT IN 1991; 21 YOY WERE COLLECTED IN SHORELINE SEINES AND MANY SCHOOLS OF YOY OBSERVED. OTHER CENS ARE ALSO DOING WELL.  BLG NUMBERS AVERAGED 82.1 PER TRAPNET (ABOUT 40 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN), UP FROM 58.2 IN 1986.  PMKS ARE SLIGHTLY DOWN FROM PREVIOUS NUMBERS, BUT STILL 5 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AT 4.6 PER TRAP.  BLC NUMBERS ARE ABOUT THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR BLG, PMK, AND BLC ARE SIMILAR TO 1986 DATA, WITH MEDIAN LENGTHS BEING 6.2 INCHES, 6.2 INCHES, AND 7.2 INCHES, RESPECTIVELY, IN TRAPNETS.  WAE NUMBERS ARE BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN IN BOTH TRAPNETS AND GILLNETS, BUT HAVE APPROXIMATELY TRIPLED SINCE THE 1986 SURVEY.  WAE SIZE HAS ALSO INCREASED GREATLY, FROM AN AVERAGE WEIGHT OF ABOUT 0.5 POUNDS TO AN AVERAGE OF OVER FOUR POUNDS.  THIS AVERAGE IS SLIGHTLY MISLEADING, HOWEVER, BECAUSE RECRUITMENT IS POOR AND NO WAE UNDER 5+ WERE COLLECTED.  YEP NUMBERS HAVE DROPPED FROM 60 PER GILLNET TO 10.67 PER LIFT. AVERAGE WEIGHT HAS ALSO DECLINED.  THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THE PROPORTION OF OLDER PERCH IS GREATER IN THE 1991 SAMPLE.  A 1986 PERCH REACHED 6.2 INCHES AT THE FORMATION OF ITS SECOND ANNULUS, WHILE A FISH FROM THE 1991 SURVEY REACHED 6.3 INCHES AT AGE 4.  STUNTING FROM OVER POPULATION SEEMS UNLIKELY BECAUSE THE POPULATION APPARENTLY HAS DECLINED.  IN MANY OF OUR AREA LAKES, DECLINES IN YEP ARE CORRELATED WITH INCREASES IN BLBS.  HOWEVER, DESPITE A LARGE REDUCTION IN PERCH NUMBERS, BLH HAVE ALSO DECLINED FROM 76 PER TRAPNET TO 2.2 PER TRAPNET. A SIMILAR REDUCTION OCCURRED IN GILLNET CATCHES. THE DECLINE IN BLB NUMBERS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE HIGH NUMBERS OF LMB.  THE MEDIAN LENGTH OF BLH HAS INCREASED BY AN INCH TO ABOUT 10 INCHES.  CCF WAS ABSENT IN THIS SURVEY.  CAP HAS ESTABLISHED ITSELF IN ST. JAMES LAKE IN THE LAST 5 YEARS. ABSENT IN 1986, 26 CARP AVERAGING ALMOST 4 POUNDS EACH WERE SAMPLED IN TRAPNETS THIS YEAR.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>St. James Lake is a 252-acre lake located within the city limits of St. James in Watonwan County.  It has a history of dredging and therefore has some deep holes that maintain a maximum depth of 16 feet.  Historically, St. James Lake had good water clarity, abundant macrophytes, and a respectable sunfish fishery prior to 1995.  However by 1999, St. James Lake had poor water clarity, was virtually devoid of macrophytes, and had a less than respectable fishery for any sportfish.  This change was likely a result of low dissolved oxygen during winter due to snow cover and an ineffective aeration system.  With support from the community and anglers, St. James Lake was reclaimed in fall of 2001 by the DNR in cooperation with the City of St. James.  By the spring of 2002, water clarity and aquatic vegetation returned to foster a good return of the fish community through an intensive stocking program.  St. James Lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass and bluegill and secondarily for walleye, northern pike, black crappie, and yellow perch.  St. James Lake is one of the two lakes in the Windom Fish Management Area that was selected to be included in a study, known as SLICE (Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment), relating possible changes in fish and habitat as a result of a changing climate.  SLICE has several different components to monitor.  During 2011 a fish population assessment was conducted to monitor the change in the fish community over time and to assess the Windom area management plan for St. James. <br> \n <br> \nIt is apparent the partial winterkill of 2010-2011 did impact largemouth bass abundance.  Although their abundance is down, they are present in enough numbers to reproduce naturally.  Largemouth bass were sampled with spring night electrofishing and standard netting during 2011.  In 2011 the spring night electrofishing catch was 9 fish per hour with a mean length of 14.3 inches.  The 2011 electrofishing is the lowest catch rate since the 2001 reclamation.   Since 2001, the catch rates have ranged from a low of 71.5 fish per hour in 2010 to a high of 394.0 fish per hour in 2003.  While the spring night electrofishing was the lowest on record since 2001, the standard summer netting was the greatest on record at 2.6 fish per trap net. The long-term catch rate of largemouth bass via trap netting is 0.5 fish per net.  All 24 largemouth bass caught in trap nets were the same age and averaged 5.0 inches.  The size structure of the largemouth bass was good with most of the catchable size largemouth bass (usually 8 inches or more) greater than 12 inches but not exceeding 20 inches.  Additionally, the condition of largemouth bass is good indicating a population of largemouth bass that is finding adequate food.  Overall, the largemouth bass population is doing well and is approaching our management plan of maintaining an electrofishing catch of 30 or more per hour (which has happened every year since 2001 except for the present survey) and containing a good number of fish in the 12 to 20 inch range.  As the largemouth bass population matures over the next 2 to 3 years the 5 inch fish caught in the trap nets should reach catchable size and make for good largemouth bass fishing with many fish in the 10 to 20 inch range. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough the winterkill did influence bluegill abundance, the yellow perch abundance is probably driving their abundance down.  Both of these species can compete for similar resources, but yellow perch tend to thrive in scenarios when dissolved oxygen becomes low.  We believe this is what happened during the winter of 2010-2011.  The catch rate of bluegill in trap nets in 2011 was 4.9 fish per net, which is within the expected range of 1.9 to 29.5 per net.  In the 2011 survey bluegill ranged in length from 3.1 to 8.4 inches with a mean length of 4.2 inches.  The average weight per individual is low (0.1 pounds per bluegill) but their overall condition is above average compared to other populations of bluegill.  The St. James bluegill population appears to be robust and healthy.  Currently the population is favoring fish less than 6 inches.   St. James was historically a quality bluegill lake and it appears that water quality and habitat improvements gained through the reclamation are allowing the lake to sustain a bluegill population.  Overall, the population abundance is lower than we would like to see it but nearshore sampling with backpack electrofishing and seining showed good natural recruitment which should help to increase bluegill abundance over the next 2 to 3 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gillnet catch rate in 2011 was 2.3 per net, which is within the expected range of 1.0 to 7.3 per net for St. James but slightly lower than the long-term average of 4.2 per net.  The size structure is average with a mean weight of 1.6 pounds and fish ranging in length from 14.5 inches to 19.1 inches and a 16.1 inch average.  The size structure and overall condition of the walleye are good indicating the walleye are able to find adequate food.  It appears that the walleye population in St. James is doing well and fingerling stocking in the fall of 2011 will add more fish to the lake and add a chance to catch a walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundances increased dramatically.  Natural reproduction is the reason for their high abundance.  The northern pike catch rate was 31.3 fish per gillnet, which is the most on record and considerably more than the long-term average of 7.1 fish per gillnet.  While the catch rate was high, the mean length of northern pike was only 16.0 inches with a range of 9.8 to 27.6 inches.  Three ages of northern pike were represented in the catch (age 1, age 2, and age 4) and 90% of them were age 1.  This indicated a very successful hatch of pike in the spring of 2010.  In addition to the gillnet catch, the spring ice-out trap net catch targeting northern pike was 28.3 fish per trap net.  The size of fish caught was from 11.8 inches to 26.0 inches with a mean of 14.6 inches with 95% of the fish from the same 1 year old year-class.  The northern pike have a predominantly small size structure (10-16 inches) but they appear to be finding an ample supply of food due to good condition of the fish.  Northern pike should continue to maintain high numbers if fishing harvest does not significantly decrease their abundance because they are the top predator and their abundance is usually only tied to foraging success and angler harvest rates.  Northern pike made up 34% of the total catch in the 2011 survey and are a major component of the fish community at this point, and should continue to be for the next 2 to 3 years.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie in St. James Lake exhibit a boom and bust cycle.  The up and down abundance of crappie in a boom and bust cycle is typical in most southern MN systems, even with supplemental stocking.  Much of the cycle can be attributed to abiotic (temperature, rainfall, water level, runoff, etc.) factors at spawning times.  High catch rates were observed in 1986, 1999, and 2007 and were greater than the mean (5.8 fish per net) for trap nets.  In 2011 the trap net catch rate was low at 0.4 fish per net.  The black crappie ranged in length from 5.5 to 11.1 inches with a mean length of 8.1 inches.  The present sample of crappie indicated a low density population dominated by 8 to 12 inch black crappie all with good condition.  Given the cyclic nature of black crappie along with their popularity as a sport fish, it is difficult to manage a crappie population at a level that all anglers will find adequate from year-to-year.  All that can be expected for the St. James crappie population is to provide an adequate population for the fishery to reproduce successfully.  It is likely their abundance will increase dramatically when abiotic conditions are favorable for strong reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nLastly, the yellow perch catch rate was 67.3 fish per gill net which is the most on record.   The long-term yellow perch catch rate is 24.0 fish per net.  This indicated that the current yellow perch population is at a level nearly 3 times average abundance.  The yellow perch size structure was very good with fish ranging in length from 4.9 to 12.4 inches.  The overall condition of the yellow perch was also very good indicating the yellow perch are finding adequate food and are putting on good weight for their length.  Overall, the yellow perch population of St. James is doing very well and is the major component of the fishery given nearly 40% of all of the fish caught in the survey were yellow perch.  A great destination for those perch anglers in SW MN. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads were also caught in the sample, but they were at a very low abundance.  While the abundance was low the size structure of the bullhead was good with an average size of 10 inches.  Anglers wishing to target bullheads will find a few fish here and there and when they do land one, they should be happy with the size of the fish.  <br> \n <br> \nOverall, St. James offers many great fishing opportunities and provides a unique fishing experience in southern Minnesota due to great water clarity and abundant aquatic vegetation to fish in and around to target bluegill, crappie, bass, pike and perch.  St. James should be a good pick for sunfish, pike and bass anglers in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>St. James Lake is a 252-acre lake located in the City of St. James in Watonwan County. St. James Lake has a maximum depth of 15.4 ft.  Historically, St. James Lake was characterized as having good water quality and abundant aquatic vegetation.  Suspected winterkills in the mid-1990's suppressed gamefish populations enough that rough fish populations were able to become well established, thereby negatively affecting the water quality and the aquatic vegetation community in St. James Lake. In 2001, a rotenone reclamation was done on St. James Lake to eliminate rough fish populations and reestablish game fish populations.  Following the reclamation in the spring of 2002, water clarity improved and aquatic vegetation was able to reestablish, providing excellent habitat for desirable fish species.  St. James Lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill, and secondarily for Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  A standard survey was conducted the week of June 5, 2017 to monitor fish populations using 2 gill nets and 9 trap nets. Largemouth Bass were electrofished on May 26, 2017 to monitor their population. <br> \n <br> \nIn years following the reclamation, Largemouth Bass catch rates have varied from 9.0 per hour in 2011 to 394.0 per hour in 2003, and have averaged 103.0 per hour since 2003.  In 2017, Largemouth Bass were captured at a rate of 40.5 per hour, an increase from the 2015 catch rate of 27.0 per hour.  Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 10.1 to 21.2 inches and averaged 15.9 inches.  The bass population in St. James Lake is stable and should provide anglers with good action, with the potential to catch a 20 inch plus fish.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Bluegill catch rate was 44.4 per trap net, which is the highest Bluegill catch rate since 2007 (55.1 per trap net), and is higher than the long term average of 29.3 per trap net and the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.9 to 29.5 per trap net).  Overall, the size structure of the Bluegill population was small, as lengths ranged from 3.3 to 8.5 inches and averaged 6.2 inches.  If given another year or two to grow, Bluegill fishing should be very good on St. James Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate was 0.0 per gill net, a decrease from 4.5 per gill net observed in 2015.  The trap net catch rate was 0.9 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.4 to 1.9 per trap net).  Walleye lengths ranged from 19.3 to 26.6 inches and averaged 21.0 inches, suggesting that small Walleye are not present.  Fingerling stocking 1 of 2 years was deemed unsuccessful in recent years, so Walleye management was changed to stocking yearlings or adults when available.  In October of 2017, 528 adult Walleye were stocked in St. James Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Yellow Perch catch rate was 20.0 per gill net, an increase from the 2015 catch rate of 8.5 per gill net, and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 26.5 per gill net).  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5.3 to 7.2 inches and averaged 5.7 inches.  While Yellow Perch are abundant, they still need another year or two to grow before they reach an acceptable size for harvesting.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were captured at a rate of 18.5 per gill net in 2017, exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.5 to 7.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 19.7 to 29.3 inches and averaged 23.7 inches. The variety of sizes suggests that there are multiple year classes present.  Northern Pike have not been stocked within the last decade because natural reproduction has sustained the population.  Despite the high abundance, Northern Pike were plump and in good condition, indicating that prey abundance is high. Northern Pike angling should be excellent on St. James Lake.  Keep in mind the new 2018 Northern Pike regulations, 2 fish daily bag limit with all fish less than 24 inches needing to be released.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate in 2017 was 2.3 per trap net, a decrease from the 2015 catch rate of 4.2 per trap net, and below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.4 to 15.1 per trap net).  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 6.1 to 9.6 inches and averaged 8.0 inches.  While net catches indicate that Black Crappie abundance is low, anglers reported good crappie angling in 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate was 84.9 per trap net, which is the highest observed catch rate in St. James Lake since surveys began in 1986, and is above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.2 to 60.5 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 7.3 to 15.6 inches and averaged 8.5 inches.  No other species of fish were sampled, however, Common Carp have been documented as reentering the lake.  This is the first time they have been documented since reclamation, indicating reclamations are successful for about 15 years.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>St. James Lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass and for secondary populations of walleye, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch.  The city of St. James has been actively dredging since 1971 and has created some deep water habitat (16-18 feet).  During the 1995 survey on St. James Lake, aquatic vegetation, such as Sago, Bushy, and Curly pondweed, was abundant and flourishing.  During the survey in 1999, aquatic vegetation had diminished greatly.  Additionally, secchi disk readings revealed water clarity was reduced.  The secchi disk reading was 4.0 feet in 1995 and 1.7 feet in 1999.  In the spring of 1999, electrofishing captured largemouth bass at a rate of 17.00 fish/hour, with total lengths between 3.8 and 15.7 inches and an average of 9.5.  Five year classes of largemouth bass were captured with the 1997 and 1998 year classes dominating the age structure.  No young of the year and only two adult largemouth bass were captured shoreline seineing which may indicate very limited natural reproduction in 1999.  The significant depletion of aquatic vegetation likely impacted the largemouth bass reproduction and negatively affected the population.  Local stakeholders, sports clubs, and the lake association may be interested in reclaiming the lake but the effects of dredging on reclamation need to be determined.The average walleye gill net catch was 6.33 fish/net set which is close to the upper range (7.33 fish/net set) for this type of lake.  The catch rates in gill nets have been increasing steadily since 1986.  Catch rates for walleye have ranged between 0.5 and 6.33 fish/net set.  The 1999 survey had the highest average walleye catch rate ever recorded on St. James Lake.  Nineteen walleye among three gill nets were captured with total lengths ranging between 8.5 and 23 inches and had an average of 13.7.  Shoreline seining did not capture any walleye in 1999 or 1995.  The fact that few young of the year walleye have been captured by shoreline seining suggests limited natural reproduction in this system.  Walleye fry have been stocked in St. James Lake and is apparently working.  It would appear the density of walleye is as high as it has ever been so enjoy your walleye fishing.The average northern pike gill net catch rate was 2.33 fish/net set which was within the expected range (1.54 to 4.29 fish/net set) for this lake class.   Since 1986 the average northern pike catch rates have varied between 0.50 and 17.00 fish/net set.  The highest catch rate was recorded in 1995 when aquatic vegetation was thriving.  Total lengths of northern pike sampled in gill nets ranged between 17.5 and 41.7 inches, with an average of 25.1.  Most of the fish were measured in the 24 to 25 inch range.  No northern pike were sampled by shoreline seining which would indicate limited natural reproduction.  Due to the small amounts of aquatic vegetation and limited water clarity, northern pike natural reproduction was probably limited. The average bluegill trap net catch rate was 5.50 fish/net set which was below average for this lake class.  All previous surveys had bluegill catch rates above average until the 1999 survey.  Forty-four bluegill captured by trap nets had total lengths ranging between 3.8 and 8.2, with an average of 6.3.  Four year classes of bluegill were caught with the 1997 year class dominating the age structure.  Shoreline seining caught seven young of the year bluegill in 1999 and 85 in 1995 which probably indicates bluegill natural reproduction was not as successful as in previous years.  These data suggest the lake had a self-sustaining population that was relatively stable or \"balanced.\"  Reestablishing aquatic vegetation is crucial to the improvement of the largemouth bass and bluegill populations.  This may be obtained by reclamation in order to eliminate the underutilized species such as common carp and black bullhead.The average black crappie trap net catch rate was 29.38 fish/net set which was almost two times greater than the upper range for this type of lake.  Average black crappie catch rates have ranged between 1.29 and 29.38 fish/net set.  The crappie density was higher than it has ever been during a survey on St. James Lake.  Total lengths of black crappie sampled in trap nets ranged between 4.1 and 10.5 inches, with an average of 5.8.  Three year classes of black crappie were documented with the 1998 year class making up 93.2% of those captured.  Shoreline seining captured four young of the year black crappie which indicated some natural reproduction in 1999.  Black crappie fishing should be better than in previous years but the size of fish may be smaller.The average yellow perch gill net catch rate was 3.00 fish/net set which was equal to the lower normal range for this type of lake.  Total lengths of yellow perch ranged between 7.2 and 11.9 inches, with an average of 7.9.  Yellow perch were sampled for the first time in St. James Lake during the 1991 survey.  The average gill net catch rate in 1999 was the lowest since 1991 when 10.67 fish/net set were captured. The average black bullhead gill net catch rate was 99.00 fish/net set which was higher than the upper range for this type of lake.  The average black bullhead catch rates have not been this high since 1986.  Catch rates for black bullhead have ranged between 9.33 and 99.00 fish/net set.  Total lengths of black bullhead ranged between 5.4 and 8.9 inches, with an average of 8.1.  These data suggest a high density black bullhead population exists that is dominated by smaller individuals.  Efforts to increase the predator base may help control black bullhead numbers in the future.  This current fishery provides parents an opportunity to teach their kids how to fish because the chances of catching a bullhead are greatly improved.The average common carp trap net catch rate was 9.38 fish/net set which was almost three times the upper normal range for this type of lake.  Back in the days of abundant aquatic vegetation, the average common carp catch rate was 0.43 fish/net set.  The catch rate of common carp in 1999 was the highest ever recorded in St. James Lake.  Total lengths ranged between 8.2 and 21.7 inches, with an average of 17.7.  Efforts should be made to reduce the common carp density thereby aiding restoration of aquatic vegetation and reestablishing spawning habitats.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of St. James Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>St. James Lake has a complex assemblage of gamefish and is primarily managed for largemouth bass.  Species in the Sunfish Family which include largemouth bass, bluegill, crappie, and pumpkinseed do particularly well in St. James Lake because of the abundance of vegetation present.  It is very important to preserve the water quality in St. James Lake.  Pollution, nutrient, and sediment inputs must be controlled to at least maintain the current state of the lake.The lake suffered a partial fish kill in the winter of 1993-94 and was subsequently stocked with largemouth bass, walleye, bluegill, crappie, and pumpkinseed in 1994.The largemouth bass population in St. James Lake dropped since our last survey in 1991 probably due to the winterkill.  Largemouth bass lengths ranged from 8 to 16 inches with an average of 14 inches.  The data collected suggested that some largemouth bass were naturally reproduced in 1995.  The bass population appears to be recovering from the winter kill and most likely will reestablish as long as good numbers of larger bass remain in the lake to reproduce. Walleye numbers are considered to be normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  The majority of the fish were age-1 which corresponds to the stocking in 1994.  The average length of walleye collected in our samples was 11 inches.  Although absent in our samples, walleye of 2-3 lbs. were being caught during the 1995-96 ice fishing season.Yellow perch numbers remain relatively high compared to other lakes in our area.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5 inches to 10 inches with an average of 8 inches.  The population had good numbers of fish in the 8-10 inch range which should provide anglers with fish of preferred lengths during the 1996 fishing season.Northern pike numbers have increased since our last survey in 1991 and are currently considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 15 to 27 inches in length with an average of 20 inches.  Anglers should enjoy good pike fishing during the 1996 fishing season.The bluegill population is considered normal.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches with an average of 5 inches.  Although, black crappie numbers are below the normal range compare to similar lakes in our area, the majority of black crappie were relatively large at 8 to 10 inches in length.Black bullhead numbers are considered low compared to similar lakes in our areas.  Bullhead ranged in length from 5 inches to 14 inches with an average of 10 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>St. James Lake is a 252 acre lake in Watonwan County near the town of St. James with a maximum depth of 16 feet.  Managed primarily for largemouth bass, St. James Lake is also managed for walleye, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch.  Prior to 2001, the lake was overrun with black bullheads and common carp, making the lake undesirable from an economic, aesthetic, and recreational point of view.  In the fall of 2001, fisheries managers chemically reclaimed the lake and restocked it with adult bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, walleyes, and northern pike.  Since the reclamation, St. James has also been stocked with walleye fingerlings twice, in 2003 and 2005.  Water clarity and quality have greatly improved and aquatic vegetation has flourished since \"starting over\" in 2001.Electrofishing was used to document the largemouth bass population of St. James Lake.  In 2005, 104 bass per hour were sampled, compared to only 17 bass per hour in 1999 before the reclamation took place.  The largemouth averaged just over 9 inches in length, not what a \"trophy angler\" is seeking, but ideal for entertaining children with an afternoon of bass fishing.  Larger bass were not sampled in our efforts, which was no surprise as the population is only 3 years old.  The population does show the potential to put on good growth as the \"plumpness\" of the fish indicates there is ample forage in the lake.The walleye catch rate in 2005 of just over 3 fish per net was slightly lower than that seen in the 2003 assessment (just over 4 fish per net), but was still in the \"normal\" range for a lake like St. James.  The average length of the sampled fish was just under 12 inches, all from the fingerling stocking of 2003.  With the success of that stocking, an additional 9,684 fingerlings were stocked in 2005 and stocking will continue on an every-other-year basis. Northern pike gill net catch rates averaged over 2 fish per net, within the \"normal\" range for similar lakes.  This is up from the 2003 average of less than 1 fish per net.  Sampled pike ranged in length from 23 to over 31 inches, adults that were stocked after the reclamation.  We hope that northern pike will be able to self-sustain themselves within St. James Lake, but until we see evidence of natural reproduction, fingerlings will be stocked (when available) once every three years.The 2005 bluegill trap net catch rate was over 23 fish per net, lower than the nearly 102 fish per net of the 2003 survey.  This value is still towards the upper end of the \"normal\" range for lakes similar to St. James.  The office received many reports of anglers catching \"keeper\" bluegills in the summer of 2005 and our sampling revealed similar results.  Netted bluegills averaged just under 7 inches in length, ranging from just over 3 inches all the way up to 8 inches in length.  In addition, the bluegills were quite \"plump\", indicating that there is plenty of forage for the population.  Three distinct ages of bluegills are present in St. James Lake and their successful natural reproduction is vital to the fish community as bluegill are the primary forage for the predator species of the lake. Only 4 black crappie were sampled in the 2005 assessment, well below the \"normal\" range and also a historical low for St. James.  The \"good news\" is that 3 of the fish were the result of 2003 natural reproduction and have already grown to around 8.5 inches long.  In addition, the fish looked extremely healthy and well-fed.  Monitoring of black crappie natural reproduction will continue as we attempt to maintain the population as a secondary angling species.Yellow perch gill net catch rates in 2005 averaged about 14 fish per net, within the \"normal\" range for lakes with similar characteristics to St. James and up from the 2003 survey in which less than 3 perch per net were sampled.  Perch lengths ranged from 5.5 inches to just over 9 inches and the \"plumpness\" of the fish indicated adequate forage within the lake.  Since the 2001 reclamation, no common carp have been sampled in the lake, but 1 black bullhead was sampled in this most recent assessment.  Keeping the introduction of unwanted species out of St. James Lake is key in the lake's road to recovery back to a well-balanced fishery.  Please leave the stocking of all fish to the DNR.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not further improve the current water quality of St. James Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in St. James Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 15-16 June 2022. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with two sites sampled from the boat due to deep and soft sediments. A 50-foot seine was used to sample eight sites and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 7 native species of fish none of which are intolerant of disturbance and two species (Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish) that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate the fish community of St. James Lake is affected by disturbance as indicated by an FIBI score very near to the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. The results are similar to a previous assessment, which also had FIBI scores near the impairment threshold. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Watonwan River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

In 2001, a rotenone reclamation was done on St. James Lake to eliminate rough fish populations, reestablish the clear water state, and reestablish gamefish populations.  The project was successful; however, overtime non-desirable fish have made their way back into St. James Lake, although not overly abundant.  St. James Lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill and secondarily for Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie and Yellow Perch.  A survey was conducted the week of June 7, 2021 to monitor fish populations using gill nets and trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nSince the reclamation in 2001, Largemouth Bass catch rates have varied from 9.0 per hour in 2011 to 394.0 per hour in 2003, and have averaged 94.8 per hour since 2003.  Often times Largemouth Bass populations are linked closely with submergent vegetation abundance.  In 2021, the Largemouth Bass catch rate was 24.0 per hour, which is similar to catch rates observed in the last decade (9.0 to 40.5 per hour).  Lengths of Largemouth Bass ranged from 3.8 to 17.9 inches and averaged 12.5 inches.  Although Largemouth Bass abundance has been better, there is still a fishable population.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates in St. James Lake have varied from 1.3 per trap net in 2013 to 101.9 per trap net in 2003 and have averaged 32.7 per trap net since 1986.  In 2021, the Bluegill catch rate was 84.1 per trap net, greatly exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.9 to 29.5 per trap net).  Bluegill lengths ranged from 4.7 to 8.0 inches and averaged 6.3 inches.  Although the Bluegill are not large in size, it is good to see our numbers approaching the same abundances that we documented back in 2003.  Hopefully growth of those individual fish improves over time.  <br> \n <br> \nSince the reclamation in 2001, Walleye catch rates have varied from 0.0 in 2017 to 13.3 in 2007 and have averaged 4.4 per gill net.  In 2021, the Walleye catch rate was 3.5 per gill net, an increase from the 2017 catch rate of 0.0 per gill net, and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 7.3 per gill net).  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 9.0 to 26.7 inches and averaged 16.1 inches.  Adult Walleye (n=430) were stocked in St. James Lake in the fall of 2021 to supplement the existing population and create a put and take fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nSt. James Lake continues to have an abundant Northern Pike population.  In 2021, Northern Pike were captured at a rate of 12.5 per gill net, exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.5 to 7.0 per gill net).  Since 2011, Northern Pike catch rates have ranged from 12.5 per gill net in 2021 to 31.3 per gill net in 2011.  Although in the last 10 years each survey catch rates decline for Northern Pike, their abundance rivals most of our other lakes.  Northern Pike lengths have ranged from 20.3 to 30.5 inches and have averaged 24.8 inches.  Sixty-four percent of the Northern Pike sampled were of a harvestable size (24.0 inch minimum length in the Southern Zone).   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates have varied from 2.7 per gill net in 2003 to 67.3 per gill net in 2011 and have averaged 21.0 per gill net since 1986.  In 2021, Yellow Perch were captured at a rate of 25.0 per gill net.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.5 to 8.3 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were captured at a rate of 7.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.5 to 14.7 per gill net).  Historically, Black Crappie have occurred in low abundance except for a high catch rate in 1999.  Lengths of Black Crappie were small, ranging in length from 4.1 to 9.3 inches and averaging 7.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOne Channel Catfish was sampled, marking the first time that one has been sampled post reclamation.  Common Carp have been observed during various electrofishing surveys in recent years.  In 2021, three Common Carp were captured during the electrofishing survey, the first documented sample since the 2021 reclamation.  Other species sampled included Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish.  <br> \n</p>",

The population assessment in 1999 documented a fish community that provided little recreational or economical value in terms of angling, contributed to poor water clarity and quality, and was a general disappointment to the community.  Starting in the fall of 1999 and through the summer of 2001, efforts to foster public support paved the way for a successful reclamation in the fall of 2001.  The secchi disk reading was 4.0 feet in 1995; 1.7 feet in 1999; and 8.0 feet in 2003 which indicated a substantial change in water clarity.  The recovery was even more evident in the spring of 2002 when aquatic vegetation returned along with DNR stockings of adult brood stock of largemouth bass and bluegill and walleye yearlings.  St. James is managed primarily for largemouth bass and secondarily for walleye, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch. Electrofishing in 2003 documented the next step in the recovery of St. James lake, with a largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate of 394.0 bass/hour in 2003 compared to 17.0 bass/hour in 1999 (pre-reclamation).  Although it was a  record high catch rate, most of the fish were only about  6 inches long.  It is obvious that the bass are finding adequate forage as indicated by their \"plumpness\".   Larger bass were not sampled because the lake's fish population was only one year old.  The excellent return of submergent and emergent vegetation likely contributed to the successful year class of bass in 2002.   Fisheries personnel observed numerous schools of \"small\" bass swimming.  St. James' recovery will be continued to be monitored for unwanted \"introduced\" species.  The good news is that a healthy predator base is being established.  These bass will likely not be mounted on a wall yet but it would provide a great opportunity for kids to catch bass all afternoon long.The bluegill catch rate of nearly 102 fish per trap net set was more than 3 times the \"normal\" range, and they averaged 6.1 inches long.  So the take home message is that St. James has never had this many bluegills, but they are on the small side.  Except for the original bluegill broodstock, the population came from natural reproduction the last two years.  Large year classes of bluegills will play an important role in the recovery of St. James Lake because they are the forage base for the predators.  With the substantial recovery of submerged vegetation, it is likely that bluegill natural reproduction will continue.  These fish will provide some good action but are not likely to produce a bunch of \"keepers\" yet.Although walleye numbers were within the \"normal\" range, they're still a little small at about 8 inches long.  One of the walleyes captured in a gill net was about 19 inches long and indicated illegal stocking.  Despite the fact that this single fish will not threaten the overall recovery of St. James Lake, the potential of introducing an unwanted species threaten the fishery.  Please leave the stocking of fish to the DNR.  The DNR stocked 6,120 yearlings in 2002 and 13,299 fingerling walleye in 2003.  A total of 110 northern pike adults were stocked in 2003.  Only 1 northern pike was captured during the netting in 2003.  This poor catch rate could be a result of the good water clarity and possible net avoidance.The yellow perch catch rate was nearly within the \"normal\" range. Approximately 3,200 adult yellow perch were stocked in 2003.  If you are looking to catch some perch, perhaps Kansas Lake would be a better option. Black crappie numbers were within the \"normal\" range, and averaged 6.1 inches long.  Black crappie broodstock were stocked in 2003 (680 fish).More good news is that the 2003 survey found no black bullheads or common carp.  Although submerged vegetation flourished the last couple of years, it did not become over abundant to the point of being a nuisance for most anglers.  Anglers are beginning to understand that submerged vegetation creates excellent habitat for natural reproduction.  Good fishing and adequate amounts of vegetation go hand in hand.  Curlyleaf pondweed is found in St. James and should be monitored. A total of six species of fish were sampled. To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of St. James Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Ryan Doorenbos           </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nSt. James Lake is a 252-acre lake located in the City of St. James in Watonwan County. St. James Lake has a maximum depth of 15.4 ft.  Historically, St. James Lake was characterized as having good water quality and abundant aquatic vegetation.  Suspected partial winterkills in the mid-1990's suppressed gamefish populations enough that rough fish populations were able to become well established, thereby negatively affecting the water quality and the aquatic vegetation community in St. James Lake. In 2001, a rotenone reclamation was done on St. James Lake to eliminate rough fish populations and reestablish game fish populations.  Following the reclamation in the spring of 2002, water clarity improved and aquatic vegetation was able to reestablish, providing excellent habitat for desirable fish species.  Installation of an additional aeration unit has helped to prevent winterkill in recent years, which has aided in stabilizing game fish populations.  St. James Lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill, and secondarily for Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year (2011, 2013, 2015, 2017) at a rate of 2 pounds per acre.  The remaining management species have not been regularly stocked following the reclamation because they have maintained themselves through natural reproduction.  A standard survey was conducted the week of August 3, 2015 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and nine trap nets. Largemouth Bass were electrofished the week of May 21, 2015 to monitor their population.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLARGEMOUTH BASS <br> \n <br> \nIn years following the reclamation, Largemouth Bass catch rates have varied from 9.0 per hour in 2011 to 394.0 per hour in 2003, and have averaged 110.4 per hour since 2003.  In 2015, Largemouth Bass were captured at a rate of 27.0 per hour, which is within the desired range of 20-30 per hour, and is an increase from 18.4 per hour observed in 2013.  Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 4.0 to 18.5 inches and averaged 12.8 inches.  During electrofishing in 2015, decent numbers of 4.0 to 6.5 inch bass were sampled suggesting that natural reproduction occurred in 2014.  Largemouth Bass were plump, suggesting that they are finding plenty of food.  Although not highly abundant, a fishable population of Largemouth Bass exists, with good numbers exceeding 17.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 Bluegill catch rate was 15.6 per trap net, up from 1.3 per trap net in 2013, and the highest Bluegill catch rate since the 2007 survey.  Since 1986, Bluegill catch rates have averaged 28.2 per trap net, and have ranged from 1.3 per trap net in 2013 to 101.9 per trap net in 2003.  The 2015 catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.9 to 29.5 per trap net).  Lengths of Bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 8.6 inches and averaged 6.9 inches.  Bluegill were plump, indicating that there is plenty of food available.  Multiple year classes of Bluegill are present, suggesting that natural reproduction occurs in St. James Lake.  The Bluegill population is relatively balanced; however, Bluegill larger than 9 inches are lacking, which could be a result of angler harvest. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nSince the all-time high catch rate of 31.3 Northern Pike per gill net in 2011, the catch rate declined to 26.0 per gill net in 2013 and to 21.0 per gill net in 2015, continuing to be much greater than expected catch rates for this area (0.1 to 3.0 per gill net).  Prior to the increase in Northern Pike abundance in 2011, catch rates were typically less than 2.3 per gill net. The extreme increase in abundance was the result of a strong naturally reproduced year class in 2010.  Northern Pike were 12.7 to 29.2 inches and averaged 20.8 inches. Relative weight differed between size categories of Northern Pike.  Northern Pike greater than 21.0 inches were skinny, indicating that they are not foraging successfully and may be stunted. Anglers should not be afraid to harvest northern pike on St. James Lake, as plenty are available, and thinning them out may result in better growth of remaining Pike.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates on St. James Lake have varied from 0.5 per gill net in 1986 to 13.3 per gill net in 2007 and have averaged 4.2 per gill net since 1986.  The 2015 catch rate of 4.5 per gill net increased slightly from the 2013 catch rate of 4.0 and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (2.0 to 13.3 per gill net).  Walleye lengths ranged from 15.3 to 18.4 inches and averaged 16.6 inches. The Walleye population in St. James Lake is dependent upon stocking as natural reproduction likely does not occur.  Growth of Walleye is fast in St. James Lake, as they were 17.0 inches by age-3.  The abundant Northern Pike population may be limiting the success of Walleye fingerling stockings, as fingerlings are likely vulnerable to predation by Northern Pike.  Walleye yearlings, which are typically larger than fingerlings, were stocked in 2015, and may be less vulnerable to predation because of their larger size.  A fishable population of Walleye is present, and if angler hooks into one, it should be a decent size.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, Yellow Perch were captured at a rate of 8.5 per gill net, up slightly from 7.0 per gill net in 2013, but much lower than the catch rate of 67.3 per gill net observed in 2011.  The 2015 catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (3.0 to 67.3 per gill net).  Yellow Perch were small, ranging from 6.0 to 7.9 inches and averaging 6.8 inches.  The Yellow Perch population is likely being controlled by the abundant Northern Pike population, as well as Walleye and Largemouth Bass populations.  Additionally, an increase in the Bluegill population may be creating competition between the two species.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nFrom 2009 to 2013, Black Crappie abundance was less than 1.0 per trap net. The catch rate increased to 4.2 per trap net in 2015, which is the highest catch rate observed since 2007 (10.7 per trap net), and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 18.8 per trap net).  Black Crappie were small, ranging from 4.4 to 9.0 inches and averaging 6.9 inches.  It appears that the Black Crappie population in St. James Lake is mainly comprised of one abundant year class, with a few more year classes present in low numbers, which is typical of crappie populations.  Black Crappie should be a harvestable size within the next couple of years.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were sampled at a rate of 92.5 per gill net in 2015, slightly exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (9.6 to 91.4 per gill net).  The 2015 catch rate was the highest catch rate since the reclamation in 2001, as catch rates since 2003 have not exceeded 2.7 per gill net.  The trap net catch rate remained relatively low at 1.2 per trap net, but was also the highest catch rate since the reclamation.  Black Bullhead were 4.8 to 10.7 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.  With a wide range of lengths present, it appears that Black Bullheads have successfully reestablished their population.  <br> \n <br> \nAlthough not captured during August netting, Common Carp were observed while electrofishing in May 2015, which marks the first time that they have been sampled in St. James Lake since the reclamation in 2001.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nearshore fish community sampling (hereafter IBI sampling; seine, backpack electrofishing) was conducted June 19, 2017 to assess the reproductive capacity of the fish community and the overall health of the nearshore community in St. James Lake in Watonwan County.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing and seining was conducted at ten, 100 ft. long stations around the perimeter of St. James Lake.  The seine hauls captured four species of fish, including Black Bullhead (N=45), Bluegill (N=85), Largemouth Bass (N=6), and Yellow Perch (N=79).  Electrofishing captured four species of fish, Black Bullhead (N=8), Bluegill (N=35), Largemouth Bass (N=12), and Yellow Perch (N=16).  Reproduction exists for some of the species in Dead Coon Lake as, as young-of-the-year (YOY) Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch were sampled.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of St. James Lake.  The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community.  <br> \n</p>",
