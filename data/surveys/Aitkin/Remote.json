                "narrative": "<p>Remote Lake is, as its name implies, remote and can be reached only through a carry-in access.  It is a quiet, picturesque lake that is partially located within the Remote Lake Solitude Area and Savanna Portage State Park.  The lake provides an angling experience unique for its isolation and aesthetic appeal.  The lake has the added attraction of three island campsites.  These campsites are heavily used by boaters and campers and are in a degraded state, barren of topsoil.  Campers are urged to use care when using the campsites by keeping to already disturbed areas, thereby limiting impact to these sites.  With improved accessibility to the lake over the past two decades, angling pressure has increased.  The lake used to have larger bluegill and black crappie than it does today.  The average size of bluegill decreased from 7.4 inches in 1971 to the 5.8 inches from the 1999 assessment.  The indicator of abundance for bluegill, the number of fish per trap net, was 37 fish per net in 1999, which is high compared what is normal for this type of lake.  Given the current slow growth rate of bluegill, continued angling pressure for larger fish, and the reproductive ability to maintain high densities, the bluegill are likely to remain small.  Black crappie may follow a similar trend in average size with continued pressure.  Only two fish over 10 inches were caught in the 1999 assessment.  Low productivity of this lake may also limit growth in these species compared to other lakes.  The northern pike population appears to be relatively stable over the last five surveys and assessments.  The average weight of gill net caught fish is at a record high of 2.8 pounds.  The size structure is desirable, with 48 % of the fish caught over 21 inches long.  Yellow perch seem to be abundant enough to maintain good northern pike growth.  Anglers are encouraged to release larger northern pike in favor of keeping smaller ones in order to try to maintain this special fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Remote Lake is, as its name implies, remote and somewhat difficult to reach. Access to the lakehas been improved in recent years and angling pressure has probably also increased. It is aquiet, picturesque lake with the added attraction of three campsites on islands. However thecampsites are becoming degraded from use by boaters and campers. The very shallow soils in thearea are fragile and any disturbance results in erosion of the soil and loss of herbaceousvegetation. The recovery time for campsite revegetation is lengthy, however, and closing thesites will lead to the use of other, equally susceptible, areas. Campers should be very carefulwhen using the campsites.    The lake is very infertile. This infertility, or low productivity, has created difficulties inthe lake's fishery. Formerly the lake had larger bluegills and black crappies. Accessibility tothe lake increased over the previous two decades, and so did angling pressure. Subsequently thebluegill average size decreased and few large black crappie were caught in this assessment.Bluegill abundance increased from 5.1 per trapnet set in 1971 to 66.9 per set in this assessment. Given the current slow growth rate of bluegill, continued angling pressure for largerbluegills, and the reproductive ability of bluegills to maintain high densities, the bluegillswill continue to remain small. Black crappies may follow a similar trend in average size. Evenlight angling pressure will keep the populations from attaining their historical status.    The northern pike population appears to be relatively stable over the last four surveys and assessments. The sizestructure is desirable, with 40 to 79% of fish sampled being over 20 inches long. Yellow perchseem to be abundant enough to maintain adequate northern pike growth.</p>",

This survey was completed in addition to the standard resurvey conducted the week of August 18, 2014.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but three sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 50-foot seine was not used, a 15-foot seine was used at 4 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 6 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured few fish species including bluegill, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nRemote Lake falls within lake class 39 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 5 lakes for evaluating IBI data.  IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the preliminary draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 24 (90% CI 9-39) and the preliminary potential exceptional quality level is set at 61.  The IBI score, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2014 resurvey, and nearshore components calculated from this survey was 52. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Remote Lake is a soft water lake located in northern Aitkin County and is within the Remote Lake Solitude Area and Savanna Portage State Park.  Access to the lake can be gained from an unimproved carry in access on the north side of the lake.  Most of the lake's shoreline is in state ownership and remains undeveloped, which offers a unique experience to anglers who seek solitude and isolation from the crowds.  There are three primitive island campsites on the lake that have become increasingly popular with campers and anglers over the years.  Remote Lake anglers can expect to find northern pike, black crappie, bluegill and an occasional yellow perch in this fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population is in favorable condition for lakes of this type and has remained relatively stable over the years.  The 2014 catch (4.8/gill net) was the lower than 2004 catch (9.7/gillnet), and is within the normal range for this type of lake. The largest pike sampled was 29.6\" and the average length was 23.1\" with 42% longer than 24\".  Northern pike had an average weight of 2.8 pounds.  Anglers are strongly encouraged to release pike over 24\" to help maintain the integrity of the population size structure.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance has also remained stable over the years, but the present size structure remains below average due to the lower productivity of the lake, and possibly from angler harvest of larger crappie. Only two black crappie over 10\" were sampled in 2004 and only four in 2014.   <br> \n <br> \nThe size structure of the bluegill population in Remote Lake has declined over the past few decades.  The initial survey in 1971 documented the mean size of bluegill to be 7.4\" and over time the average length has decreased. Trap net indices displayed a significant rise in abundance increasing from 37 per net in 1999 to 83 per net in 2004, which is considered very high for this type of lake. Ten years later, in 2014, there was a significant decrease in bluegill catches (21.1/trap net).   Decreased catches may be due to partial winterkill or simply seasonal variations in recruitment. A lower density population may help improve the size structure. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Remote Lake, Aitkin County, is located within the Remote Lake Solitude Area and Savanna Portage State Park.  Access to the lake is from an unimproved carry in access on the north side of the lake.  Remote's shoreline in state ownership, remains undeveloped, and offers a unique experience to anglers who seek solitude and isolation from the crowds.  There are three primitive island campsites on the lake that have become increasingly popular with campers and anglers over the years. Remote Lake anglers can expect to find bluegill, black crappie, northern pike and an occasional yellow perch in this fishery.The cumulative effort of increased fishing pressure and resultant harvest over the past few decades has degraded the size structure of the bluegill population in Remote Lake. The initial survey in 1971 documented the mean size of bluegill to be 7.4 inches and over time the mean length has decreased to 5.1 inches. Trap net indices documented a significant rise in abundance increasing from 37 per net set in 1999 to 83 per net in 2004, which is considered very high for this lake class. Due to higher than normal densities and slower than normal growth it is likely that bluegills will remain small in Remote Lake.  Pumpkinseed sunfish have also increased significantly since 1999.The northern pike population is in favorable condition for lakes of this type and has remained relatively stable over the years. In 2004 the number of pike per gillnet lift reached an all time high at 9.7 per net with a mean weight of 2.6 pounds. The largest pike sampled was just over 31 inches and the mean length was 22.5 inches. Twenty eight percent of all gill net caught northern pike were longer than 24 inches. Anglers are strongly encouraged to release pike over 24 inches to help maintain the integrity of the population size structure.  Yellow perch may be adequately abundant to provide some value as forage for northern pike, but offer few opportunities in terms of angling.Black crappie abundance has remained stable over the years, but the present size structure remains below average due to the lower productivity of the lake, and probable impact from angler harvest of larger crappie. Only two black crappie over 10 inches were sampled in 2004.  The 2002-year class appears strong. </p>",
