According to past survey reports, it has gone dry during drought periods.  A limited     amount of winter oxygen data collected during recent years suggests partial winter kills occur on a frequent     basis.  Fish species tolerant of low winter oxygen levels were most abundant during a 1993 population     assessment.  These were yellow perch, black bullhead, white sucker, fathead minnow, and brook stickleback.      Yellow perch were moderately abundant.  The majority of them weighed less than 1/4 pound, but fish weighing     about 1/2 pound were also present.  Black bullhead were also moderately abundant and a good selection of sizes     were present up to about 1 pound. An appropriate fish community displaying reasonable population attributes appears to have existed for the     past several years at Hawks Nest Lake.  Winter aeration is not recommended because water levels would probably     be too low during many winters for it to be successful, and moderate populations of yellow perch and black     bullhead have persisted despite winters of low oxygen levels.  These species are well suited for the present     habitat conditions.  If a total winterkill of yellow perch occurred, a reintroductory stocking would probably     be appropriate.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hawks Nest is a shallow, 282 acres lake located three miles east of Ivanhoe in southwest Minnesota.  Due to the shallow and productive nature of the lake, it is prone to winterkill.  The latest winterkill occurred during the winter of 2000/2001.  This winterkill apparently eliminated yellow perch from the lake.  An abundant population of perch ranging from 5-13 inches was sampled in 1998.  However, no perch were sampled during the 2002 survey.     Black bullhead and fathead minnows were the only fish species sampled during the 2002 survey.  The majority of bullhead measured less than eight inches, but good numbers measuring 10-11.5 inches were also caught.  Anglers interested in pursuing black bullhead would likely find suitable numbers of quality sized fish.     Fisheries management plans include using Hawks Nest Lake for walleye rearing in 2003.  Approximately 1.4 million walleye fry will be stocked in the spring of 2003.  Walleye fingerlings will be harvested and stocked in other statewide lakes during the fall.  A fishable population of 12-16 inch walleye should also result within Hawks Nest Lake if winterkill does not occur for one or two consecutive years.    </p>",
