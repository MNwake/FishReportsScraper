                "narrative": "<p>Previous surveys have found that walleye numbers in Johnson Lake are usually higher than in similar small lakes. The 1994 assessment indicated walleye numbers continue to be high. Individuals up to 23.1 inches were sampled with nearly 66% of the fish sampled exceeding 16 inches. The walleye population is maintained entirely thru natural reproduction.     Test nets also indicate that smallmouth bass are fairly abundant, however the averge size of the fish sampled was only 9.6 inches, leaving them undesirable for most anglers. The largest smallmouth bass sampled in the 1994 assessment was 14.3 inches (1.4 pounds).     Yellow perch have become quite abundant following recent stockings (walleye forage), however most are not of sufficient size to interest anglers.     Access to Johnson Lake is controlled by the Wolf Ridge Environmental Learning Center. Access to the public is limited to foot travel (hiking trails) to the lake. No outboard motors or motorized vehicles are allowed on the lake. </p>",

The walleye population is high in Johnson Lake compared to similar lakes in this area.  The fish that were captured ranged in size from 7.5 inches to 19.5 inches but average size was only 12.1 inches (0.76 pound).     Yellow perch numbers are above average and there are a fair number of fish in the 9.5 inch to 10.5 inch range present.     Smallmouth bass are also in the lake however none were captured in the 1999 survey. Smallmouth bass collected in other surveys were usually too small to be of interest to anglers.</p>",

The simplistic fish community consists of: walleye, white sucker, smallmouth bass and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nEighteen walleyes were sampled in the 2009 survey, a decline from the 39 walleyes recorded in the previous investigation in 1999.  Lengths ranged from 7.1 to 21.8 inches with a mean of 14.8 inches.  Growth was very good with age-4 walleye averaging 16.9 inches at annulus formation, well above the area average of 13.1 inches.  Natural reproduction was consistent from year-to-year with 5 year classes present and no year classes dominating the walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass and yellow perch were also sampled, collecting low numbers of young fish.  White suckers dominated the sample as they have done in previous investigations. <br> \n</p>",
