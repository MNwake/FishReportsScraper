Both gillnet and trapnet catches declined by at least 50% in 1991, however; present densities are high for a lake in this classification. More large Yellow Perch are present in the lake than before as 25% of the sample was 9 inches or larger, none in 1963. White Sucker were not sampled in 1963, but low numbers were found in 1991. </p>",
