                "narrative": "<p>Diamond Lake is located about five miles south of Aitkin and is part of the Ripple River chain of lakes.  While there is no public access on the lake, small watercraft can navigate upstream from Hanging Kettle Lake.  Downstream navigation from Ripple Lake is limited to canoes and smaller crafts during normal or higher flow conditions, due to a water control structure located between the two lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers that venture to this small lake will find opportunities for Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike, with the possibility of catching a Walleye.  Black Crappie are abundant and tend to be on the small side with few fish over 10 inches, and which is consistent with adjacent lakes.  Bluegill abundance is typical of lakes with similar characteristics with some fish reaching quality size, with numbers of fish between 7 and 8.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are the primary predator species available to anglers.  While the lake is small it has the ability to produce some big Northern Pike with fish up to 32 inches captured in our assessment.  Larger Pike play an important role in regulating survival and growth of various species.  Fishing pressure is low due to the limited access, which helps to preserve the size structure of Bluegill and Northern Pike populations.  Anglers that fish the lake are encouraged to practice selective harvest to maintain the quality opportunities for these species. <br> \n</p>",

The trap net index for brown bullhead is below the first regional quartile. Northern pike ranged from two to five years of age with a strong year class indicated in 1984. Growth rates were normal for the first through the fourth increments. Bluegill ranged from two to five years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1983 and 1984. Growth rates for the first, third, fourth and fifth growth increments were normal. The growth rate for the second growth increment was thirty- three percent slower than normal. Black crappie ranged from two to five years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1984. Growth rates for the first, third, fourth and fifth growth increments were normal. The growth rate for the second growth increment was thirty- three percent slower than normal. Yellow perch ranged in age from two to five years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1984 and 1985. The growth rates for the first and second growth increments were twenty-seven and twenty-six percent slower than normal respectively the growth rates for the third through the fifth growth increments were normal. Walleye ranged from two to seven years of age. Growth rates for the first increment was twenty- five percent slower than normal. The growth rates for the second through the seventh growth increments were normal. Yellow perch showed a significant increase in abundance since the 1983 lake survey based on three gillnets.</p>",

Diamond Lake does not have a public access but anglers can gain access from the public access on either of those lakes.  While Diamond is not a large lake it can provide some good fishing and can be a great place for family fishing on those days when the larger lakes may be a little too rough for that family outing.  Anglers can find northern pike, bluegill, black crappie and an occasional walleye in Diamond Lake.  While the populations of these species are about average for this lake type there are also some quality size fish to enhance the angling experience and provide for that Saturday night fish fry.</p>",

While there is no public access on the lake, small watercraft can navigate upstream from Hanging Kettle Lake.  Downstream navigation from Ripple Lake is limited to canoes and similar crafts during normal flow conditions, due to a water control structure located between the two lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers that venture to this small lake will find opportunities for bluegill, black crappie, and northern pike, with the possibility of catching a walleye.  Black crappie are abundant and tend to be on the small side with few fish over 10\", which is consistent with adjacent lakes.  Bluegill abundance is typical of lakes with similar characteristics with some fish reaching quality size.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are the primary predator species available to anglers.  While the lake is small it has the ability to produce some big pike with fish up to 30 inches captured in our assessment.  Larger pike play an important role in regulating survival and growth of various species.  Fishing pressure is low due to the limited access, which helps to preserve the size structure of bluegill and northern pike populations.  Anglers that fish the lake are encouraged to practice selective harvest to maintain the quality opportunities for these species. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Diamond Lake does not have an access, and is basically a wide spot in the Ripple River between Hanging Kettle     and Ripple Lakes. The lake can be reached via the public access on Hanging Kettle Lake, or from the public     access immediately upstream, on Ripple Lake. Reaching Diamond Lake from the Ripple Lake access will require     going through a small dam which has only a few inches of clearance and a restricted width. The downstream     approach will require careful motoring through the Ripple River. The lake has a dense fringe of wild rice     around the lake that does not interfere with general navigation. Wild rice and other dense vegetation may     negatively affect angler catch rates, yet there is a reasonable chance of catching fish on Diamond Lake.     Bluegills in the trap nets averaged 6.1 inches and ranged up to 8.7 inches long and their abundance was     normal. The trap nets also caught a few 10 inch or larger black crappies. Northern pike abundance in this     survey was on the low end of normal and the lengths ranged up to 26.5 inches. The northern pike might be     difficult to catch given the current high abundance of their preferred prey, yellow perch. A few walleyes were     also caught in this survey, particularly near the outlet. No largemouth bass have been caught in the gill nets     or trap nets in any of the four surveys.</p>",
