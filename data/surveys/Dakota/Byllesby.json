                "narrative": "<p>The following species are present in numbers higher than the third quartile of the range of the local median: white sucker, northern pike, walleye, carp, and black bullhead. Species present in very low numbers are: yellow perch, bluegill, white crappie and hybrid sunfish. Black crappie, bigmouth buffalo, quillback, silver redhorse and shorthead redhorse appear present in expected (near average) numbers.The northern pike population is quite high and dominated by fish from the 1977, 1978 and 1979 year classes. This is difficult to explain. The 1977 year class could certainly have been fish spawned in the lake`s associated marshes and remained resident in the river channel in the lake bed or upstream. The gates of the dam were closed in June, 1979. This would preclude their having been spawned in the lake`s immediately associated marshes. Since no serious stocking of this species has occurred since the drawdown, it must be assumed they came from marshes far upstream during this period. Nearly all walleye taken were from the 1979 year class. It is assumed that a resident population remained after the drawdown and were able to spawn upstream of the lake in 1979. These fish were also evident in the August 1979 netting.Largemouth bass, corresponding to the 1979 stocking were found. No fish of the 1980 year class were found.Carp numbers are high. The length frequency distribution would indicate at least one and probably two large hatches occurred following the closing of the gates. Timing of the closing of the dam would have been ideal for their spawning.    Black bullhead numbers are high with the length frequency distribution indicating at least one good spawning season after the gates were closed.Black crappie numbers are higher than the 1977 season. Spawning appears to have been successful since the closing of the dam. White crappie numbers approach pre-drawdown levels and successful spawning for this species is also apparent.Bluegill numbers are low as they were prior to drawdown. Bluegill stocked in 1979 were young and would not be expected to have spawned in 1980. A good population was present prior to drawdown.White sucker numbers are high with the presence of many small fish indicating successful reproduction. Bigmouth buffalo are present but no good indication of their abundance can be judged from this netting.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carp were present in the gillnets almost nine times the local median and in the trapnets in numbers about 70 times the local median. The 1983 length-frequency of carp coupled with information from the 1980 survey suggests that at least three strong year classes are currently represented.lack bullheads were present in the trapnets in numbers about six times the local median and appear to be represented by several year classes, with good numbers of large fish represented.Freshwater drum, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, black crappie, white crappie, walleye, golden redhorse, white bass, northern pike, bigmouth buffalo, channel catfish, green sunfish, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass and quillback were represented in expected or near average numbers. Yellow perch and bluegill were present in low numbers.Growth of all species represented, except carp, is good or average for the area. Carp appear to be growing slowly and condition of these fish is poor.Ageing of northern pike, white and black crappie and walleye reveal that: 1) The northern pike population is represented by four year classes to age five. While the sample size (9) is small, no age class appeared to dominate. 1982 was the only year not represented in the sample. 2) The white crappie population is represented by three year classes to age four. The 1980 year class appears strong and again, the 1982 year class was not represented. 3) The black crappie population is represented by consecutive year classes to age five with no year class dominating. 4) The walleye population is represented by five year classes to age six. The 1982 year class was not represented in the sample. The 1979 year class which appeared strong in the 1980 survey was represented as five of the fourteen fish older than age one. No walleye stocking has occurred since 1974. Reproduction is most likely occurring in the Cannon River. Additional evidence for this supposition exists in the large numbers of walleyes taken by anglers near Northfield during and after spring runoff. The dam at Northfield, about ten miles from Byllesby, is a barrier to fish movement.Walleyes, northern pike, channel catfish, and white crappie are present in numbers near the pre-drawdown levels (1977). Black crappie numbers have increased slightly, while the black bullhead numbers are ten times greater than they were prior to the drawdown. Channel catfish fingerlings stocked in 1981 and 1982 were poorly represented in the catch.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carp were present in the gillnet in numbers 23 times the local median and in trapnets in numbers 8.5 times the local median. The mean weight of carp has increased 0.3 pounds since 1983. The 1985 length frequency of carp compared to the 1983 assessment suggests that only two strong year classes are currently represented. Black bullheads were present in the gillnet in numbers 15 times the statewide median and 2.5 times the local median. They were present in the trapnets in numbers 6.7 times and 2.5 times the local medians, respectively. The mean weight of black bullheads has nearly doubled since 1983.Black crappies have declined in abundance since 1983 and their mean weight has increased from 0.2 pounds to 0.5 pounds.Bowfin, bigmouth buffalo, and yellow bullhead are present in low numbers. All other species sampled were present in numbers similar to the local median. Growth of all species represented is good or average for the area.Ageing of northern pike, white and black crappie, and walleye reveal that:    1) The northern pike population is represented by four year         classes to age 4. Although the sample size is small (six)        no year class appears dominant and none are missing.    2) The white crappie population is represented by three year        classes to age 4. The 1983 year class dominates the              sample. The 1984 year class was not represented.    3) The black crappie population is represented by three year                classes to age 4. The 1982 year class dominates and the          1984 year class was not represented.    4) The walleye population is represented by six year classes        to age 6. The 1983 year class appears to be very strong          with over half of the 23 walleyes sampled in this age            group. No walleye stocking has occurred since 1974.              Reproduction is most likely occurring in the Cannon River.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Byllesby is located on the Goodhue and Dakota county line near the town of Cannon Falls.  It is a 1,435-acre run of the river reservoir on the Cannon River created by a hydroelectric dam.  Lake Byllesby has three public access, two on the lower end of the lake and one on the upper end.  A fisheries survey consisting of trap netting and gill netting was completed in June 2023.  A fall night-time electrofishing assessment was not completed as part of this survey.  The last gill net and trap net survey was completed June 2019, however surveys previous to 2014 were completed in July.  The gill-net catch rates of Walleye and Yellow Perch increased from the 2019 survey.  Channel Catfish, Northern Pike, and White Bass catch rates were similar to 2019 survey. However, Black Crappie catch rate decreased from historic high in 2019.  The trap-nets had an increase in Bluegill and Walleye, however other game species catch rates were similar to 2019.   <br> \n <br> \nExcess nutrients from run off create excessive algal blooms and high turbidity limits growth of aquatic vegetation.  The lack of aquatic vegetation likely impacts game fish species in Lake Byllesby. The timing of the annual drawdown that starts on October 1st and ends with refill of the reservoir by May 15 may limit the available spawning habitat for gamefish species.  The upper end of the reservoir is highly impacted by excessive sedimentation, creating shallow mud and sand flats at normal lake levels.  The fish community present in Lake Byllesby is similar to other reservoirs with a mix of lake and river species of fish.  Lake Byllesby can provide a decent fishery, especially in the winter when anglers typically target Black Crappie and Walleye.  The reservoir may provide over-winter habitat for many species of fish in the Cannon River, including Walleye.   <br> \n</p>",

Age and growth analysis indicate five year classes present with 70% being age I. The abundance of age I carp and the poor condition of the other year classes has resulted in a decrease in the mean weight of 0.89 pound as compared to the 1985 assessment. This decrease in mean weight and marked increase in numbers was also noted after the lake was drawn down in 1977. Black bullheads were present in the gillnets in numbers 26.7 times the statewide median and 4.4 times the local median. They were present in the trapnets in numbers 5.1 times and 2.0 times the state and local medians, respectively. The mean weight of the black bullhead has decreased 0.1 pound since 1985.Black crappie numbers have declined by 73 percent since 1985 and their mean weight has decreased by 0.2 pound.Northern pike were present in the gillnet in numbers 3.0 times and 2.8 times the state and local medians, respectively. They were present in the trapnets in numbers 11.0 times the state median and 13.7 times the local medians.Yellow bullhead, white bass, bowfin, bluegill, white crappie, black crappie, yellow perch, smallmouth bass, freshwater drum and green sunfish are present in numbers below the state or local medians.Northern pike, carp, white sucker, shorthead redhorse, black bullhead, channel catfish, bigmouth buffalo and quillback are present in numbers above the state or local medians.Walleye and silver redhorse are present in numbers similar to the state and local medians.</p>",

Age and growth analysis indicate four year classes present with 97% being ages II and III. The abundance of age II and III carp and the poor condition of the other year classes results in mean weight of 0.78 pounds. The recruitment of a strong, dominant carp year class was also noted after the lake was drawn down in 1977. The age III (1986) year class were not sampled or were not aged correctly in 1988. Black bullheads were present in the gillnet in numbers slightly higher than the local median. They were present in the trapnets in numbers 4.3 times the local median. The mean weight of black bullheads was 0.25 pounds.Black crappie numbers are below the local medians for gillnets and trapnets and below the levels historically recorded for the lake. The 1988 stocking appeared to have been unsuccessful for establishing a fishable population.Northern pike were present in the gillnets in numbers less than the local median, but were present in the trapnets in numbers 3.5 times yhe local median. The average weight was 4.4 pounds.Yellow bullhead, bluegill, white crappie, freshwater drum and pumpkinseed were present in numbers below the local medians.White bass, quillback, white sucker, shorthead redhorse, golden redhorse, and channel catfish were present in numbers above the local medians.Walleye, bigmouth buffalo, smallmouth bass and largemouth bass were present in numbers similar to the local medians.</p>",

Golden redhorse and channel catfish showed an increase in numbers and all other species declined in abundance. This may reflect the unusual sampling conditions present, rather than an actual decrease in numbers. Electrofishing for largemouth bass was also hampered by water levels and it is suspected that the good population noted in the 1991 assessment is still present.A review of historical netting data and stocking records from 1960-1993 indicate:1. No walleye stocking has been done since 1974 and abundance has shown little change during both pre and post stocking years.2. Channel catfish abundance has not increased despite extensive stocking of yearlings (approx. 90,000) from 1981-1989.3. Stockings of winter rescue northern pike appear to have had no significant impact on increasing abundance.4. Bluegill and black crappie stockings done in 1988 followed the total reservoir drawdown and re-filling in 1987. Abundance of both species increased for a three year period, but have since returned to more historic levels.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Byllesby is a 1,435 acre impoundment on the Cannon River created by a hydroelectric dam. A fisheries population assessment was conducted on Lake Byllesby in June, 2014.  Assessment work consisted of standard lake survey netting using gill nets and trap nets.   The last assessment netting on Lake Byllesby was completed in 2008.  Previous years assessments were usually completed in mid-July.  The assessment was moved to early June in 2014 to try to determine if fish numbers and catch rates were affected by seasonal migrations out of the reservoir and back into the Cannon River.  Catch rates of most gamefish species were similar to past surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nHigh turbidity levels from runoff and excessive algal blooms limit submersed vegetation and likely impact the fishery.  The reservoir is affected by excessive sediment loading in the upper reaches and much of the upper lake consists of shallow sand and mud flats at normal flow and lake levels.  The fish community is similar to many reservoirs with a diverse fish population that includes many riverine species.  Lake Byllesby can provide a fair fishery, especially in winter when many fish houses are present.  Anglers typically target Black Crappie and Walleye.  The reservoir may provide over-winter habitat for walleye and other species that move downstream from the Cannon River.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Byllesby is located on the Goodhue, Dakota county line near the town of Cannon Falls.  It is a 1,435 acre run of the river reservoir on the Cannon River created by a hydroelectric dam.  Lake Byllesby has three public access, two on the lower end of the lake and one on the upper end.  A fisheries survey consisting of trap netting and gill netting was completed in June 2019.  A fall night-time electrofishing assessment was completed October 2019.  The last gill net and trap net survey was completed June 2014, however surveys previous to 2014 were completed in July.  The catch rates of game fish in the gill nets were up considerably from previous surveys, however game fish in the trap nets were less than previous surveys.  Electrofishing had a slightly lower catch rates for Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass than previous surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nHigh turbidity and excess nutrients from run off create excessive algal blooms, which limits growth of aquatic vegetation.  The lack of aquatic vegetation likely impacts game fish species in Lake Byllesby.  The upper end of the reservoir is highly impacted by excessive sedimentation, creating shallow mud and sand flats at normal lake levels.  The fish community present in Lake Byllesby is similar to other reservoirs with a mix of lake and river species of fish.  Lake Byllesby can provide a decent fishery, especially in the winter when anglers typically target Black Crappie and Walleye.  The reservoir may provide over-winter habitat for many species of fish in the Cannon River, including Walleye.   <br> \n</p>",

Although few white bass have been known to be taken by anglers, there is some natural reproduction occurring which could produce some fishing in the near future. Carp, drum, and black bullheads are the predominant roughfish species. The carp population could be reduced by drawing the lake down during the peak spawning period to expose eggs deposited on the shallow west end which is the main carp spawning area.</p>",

Unusually high water levels and flows during test netting may have affected the catch rates of certain species traditionally sampled by a particular gear type. Carp again dominated the catch, represented mainly by two and three year fish. Black bullheads were sampled in gillnets about 1/10 as often as the local median and in trapnets about 1/3 as often as the local median. The mean weight of black bullheads increased 0.18 pounds. Black crappies were sampled in gillnets about 1/3 as often as the local median and in trapnets 2.1 times more than the local median. Northern pike were sampled in gillnets and trapnets 1/6 and 1/14 as often as local medians. Bluegill were present in trapnets 2.5 times more often than the local median and were not sampled in gillnets. Only one yellow perch was sampled by both gear types. Walleye were present in gillnets and trapnets slightly below the local medians, but good age distribution was noted. Yellow bullheads, channel catfish and golden redhorse were more abundant than local medians. White suckers were considerably less abundant than local medians. Bowfin, quillback, bigmouth buffalo, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, white bass, white crappie, and freshwater drum were present in both gear types at or near local medians. Electrofishing efforts showed a healthy adult largemouth bass population represented by apparently strong year classes of age two and four fish.</p>",

It is a 1,435 acre run of the river reservoir on the Cannon River created by a hydroelectric dam. Lake Byllesby has three public access, two on the lower end of the lake and one on the upper end. A fall night-time electrofishing assessment was completed October 2022.  Three stations were sampled, and the water temperature was 44.9 degrees Fahrenheit.  A total of 84 Walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 54.3/hour, this is slightly above the average of 47.2/hour. <br> \n <br> \nHigh turbidity and excess nutrients from run off create excessive algal blooms, which limits growth of aquatic vegetation. The lack of aquatic vegetation likely impacts game fish species in Lake Byllesby. The upper end of the reservoir is highly impacted by excessive sedimentation, creating shallow mud and sand flats at normal lake levels. The reservoir may provide over-winter habitat for many species of fish in the Cannon River, including Walleye. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Byllesby is a 1,435 acre impoundment created by a hydroelectric dam on the Cannon River.  Water level and clarity are subject to rapid change due to the rivers influence.  High turbidity levels also impact water quality by limiting aquatic vegetation.  This lack of vegetation contributes to intense summer algal blooms.  The reservoir is also affected by sediment loading in the upper reaches.  It is likely these factors have a strong impact on fish populations.  The fishery is similar to other reservoirs in that it has numerous riverine species, as well as species more typical of a lake environment.  The lake provides fair fishing during the open-water season for black crappie and channel catfish.  Bluegill, walleye and northern pike are present in low numbers, although angling success seems better for walleye during the ice-fishing season.  The lake may be an important wintering area for walleye and other riverine species that move downstream from the Cannon River.  Crappie fishing is also fair during the ice-fishing season. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Lake Byllesby is stocked with 1000 pounds of walleye fingerlings in even numbered years.  No stocking occurred in 2011.  Smallmouth and largemouth bass were also collected during the assessment.  Three stations were sampled and included a variety of habitat types.  Water temperature was 51 degrees F.    <br> \n <br> \nA total of forty-one walleye were collected for a catch rate of 43.9 per hour of on-time.  The walleye catch rate in 2010 was 80.0 per hour.  Scale samples were taken from a subsample of 17 walleye for age determination.  Of those, 12 were age-0 fish and the result of natural reproduction either in Lake Byllesby or upstream in the Cannon River.  The catch rate of age-0 walleye was 12.9 per hour.  The catch rate of age-0 walleye in 2010 was 47.6 per hour.  The age-0 walleye ranged in length from 6.2 to 8.6 inches and mean length was 7.1 inches.  Natural reproduction has been documented in several previous assessments.   <br> \n <br> \nForty largemouth bass were also collected, for a catch rate of 42.9 per hour of on-time.  This is similar to the 2010 catch rate of 37.2 per hour.  Largemouth collected in 2011 ranged in length from 6.5 to 13.7 inches and mean length was 10.4 inches.  Four smallmouth bass were collected for a catch rate of 4.3 per hour.  This is also similar to the 2010 assessment when 5 smallmouth bass were collected for a catch rate of 4.8 per hour.  Smallmouth bass collected in 2011 ranged in length from 11.5 to 15.9 inches and mean length was 13.2 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Night electrofishing was conducted on Lake Byllesby on October 24, 2016 to assess Walleye reproduction and other gamefish populations.  Lake Byllesby is stocked with 1000 pounds of Walleye fingerlings in even-numbered years.  Sampling took place before stocking occurred this year to assess natural reproduction.  All Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass and White Bass were collected.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were the most abundant gamefish sampled.  A total of 68 were collected for a catch rate of 79 per hour of on-time.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.4 to 18.4 inches with a mean length of 12.5 inches.  No obvious young-of-year (YOY) fish were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Byllesby appears to have a decent fishery for Largemouth Bass. Thirty-three Largemouth Bass were collected for a catch rate of 38 per hour of on-time.  They ranged in length from 4.4 to 16.8 inches and mean length was 12.6 inches. Smallmouth Bass were also sampled at a catch rate of 10.4 per hour.  They ranged in length from 9.5 to 17 inches and mean length was 11.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nEight White Bass were sampled for a catch rate of 9.3 per hour.  They ranged in length from 6.3 to 11.5 inches and mean length was 7.4 inches. Six Northern Pike ranging in length from 19.7 to 31.2 inches were also sampled.  Mean length of Northern Pike was 24.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of Black Crappie were also observed during sampling.  Many gamefish likely emigrate from the Cannon River to over-winter in the lake and winter fishing pressure is usually high.    <br> \n</p>",
