                "narrative": "<p>Siseebakwet, also known as Sugar Lake, is a 1,306 acre lake with 292 littoral acres (22%) and a maximum depth of 105 feet.  The 5.8 mile shoreline is heavily developed, but interspersed with quality stands of bulrush.  There are two inlets, Sugar Brook from the west connecting Little Siseebakwet and Spring Lake(s) and a channel connecting South Sugar Lake from the southwest.  The outlet, Sugar Brook, ultimately connects to Pokegama Lake to the east.  However, a low head dam at the outlet of Siseebakwet likely limits fish immigration.  There is a small county owned public access on the north shore with limited parking available.  Walleye had various stocking rates and frequencies in the past, but have been stocked at a rate of 2 pounds per littoral acre (584 pounds) every other year since 2007.  Rusty crayfish, an invasive species, has been documented at various abundances in past assessments. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were the most numerous species sampled in gill nets, at a rate of 22.4/net, exceeding the range for lakes similar to Siseebakwet, and exceeding the management goal (>15/net).  The 2012 catch was down slightly from the 2006 catch rate of 23.6/net, however netting effort was less in 2012.  Netting effort was decreased from the standard 12 nets to 8 due to the increasingly high catch, which was similar to what was observed in the 2006 assessment when netting effort was decreased from 12 to 11 nets.  Size structure was moderate to favorable, but down slightly from the previous assessment.  Lengths ranged from 8.2 to 26.8 inches with an average length of 12.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAge analysis identified eight year classes of fish from age 1-15.  The adjusted stocking rate from 1 pound/littoral acre to 2 pounds/littoral in 2007 appears to be favorable.  Ages 1, 3, and 5 were well represented, corresponding to the 2011, 2009, and 2007 fish stockings.  Natural reproduction was also evident because ages 2 and 4 comprised 24% of the aged fish since 2007.  Past assessments have indicated similar results as limited natural reproduction was evident, while stocking appears to be very successful.  Mean back-calculated length-at-age determined growth was similar to the statewide average.  Walleye averaged 16.4 inches by age-5. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 1.0/net, below the expected range and the same as the previous assessment.  Past catches have typically been from 1.0-8.0/net.  Lengths ranged from 13.9 to 25.0 inches with an average length of 20.1 inches.  The sample size was too small to accurately assess size structure, but past assessments suggest a quality fishery exists.  Scale and bone analysis identified ages 1-4 present in the sample, but the small sample could not accurately assess recruitment.  The lack of spawning habitat likely limits the pike population, which is conducive to quality size structure.  Mean back-calculated length-at-age determined growth was similar to the statewide average.  Northern pike averaged 23.9 inches by age-4. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled at a rate of 13.6/gill net, within the expected range, yet down from the previous assessment (24.1/net).  Past catch rates have ranged from 4.8 - 86.7/net.  Lengths ranged from 5.9 to 12.1 inches with an average length of 7.9 inches.  Size structure was favorable and likely an interest to anglers.  This was the first survey to assess age and growth.  Scale and otolith analysis identified ages 2 thru 7 in the gill net sample, with relatively consistent recruitment.  Growth was similar to the statewide average.  Yellow perch averaged 10.5 inches by age-6. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at a rate of 2.8/trap net, exceeding the expected range.  This was the first assessment to sample crappie since 1994.  Crappie have rarely been sampled and typically in low abundance when sampled (0.1/trap net in 1994 to 2.0/trap net in 1951).  Size structure was favorable with lengths from 5.9 to 11.3 inches and an average length of 9.5 inches.  Scale analysis identified ages 1-5 with consistent recruitment and year class strength.  Growth was similar to the statewide average.  Black crappie averaged 9.7 inches by age-5. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 8.5/trap net, within the expected range and higher than the previous assessments (4.8/net).  Catch rates have typically been low, less than 6.3/net, except for 1991 (19.2/net).  A quality size structure exists with lengths from 3.7 to 9.1 inches and an average length of 7.3 inches.  Scale analysis identified ages 2 to 10 in the sample suggesting relatively consistent recruitment.  However, some year classes were stronger than others.  Age-6 comprised 33% of the sample.  Growth was similar to the lake class 22 average.  Bluegill averaged 7.2 inches by age-7. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee tend to have variable catch rates due to their pelagic, schooling nature.  Catches have varied from 0 to 11.8/gill net.  Only one tullibee was sampled in 2012 with a length of 16.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included burbot, largemouth bass, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAs part of IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) near shore sampling, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, central mudminnow, mimic shiner, sand shiner, spottail shiner, and yellow perch were sampled in six 15 foot seine hauls, while Iowa darter, Johnny darter, banded killifish, black crappie, blacknose shiner, bluntnose minnow, largemouth bass, mimic shiner, sand shiner, spottail shiner, tadpole madtom, walleye, and yellow perch were sampled in nine 50 foot seine hauls.  Backpack electrofishing sampled Iowa darter, Johnny darter, banded killifish, blacknose shiner, bluntnose minnow, largemouth bass, mimic shiner, mottled shiner, northern pike, rock bass, sand shiner, and yellow perch at 15 stations. <br> \n</p>",

In 2006, the walleye gill-net catch rate of 23.6 fish/net exceeded the aggressive management goal of 15 fish/net, and was the second highest on record.  The sampled fish ranged from 9.0 to 30.1 inches and averaged 15.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye age and growth information was determined from scale, opercle, and otolith analysis.  Twelve year-classes were identified with fish from one to 20 years old present.  Surprisingly, some of the oldest fish were large females.  If anglers want to maintain a trophy component to the fishery, they may need to consider releasing some of the medium to large fish.  The 2001, 2003, and 2005 year classes were the most abundant and each corresponded to fingerling stockings.  Although some fish were aged from years with no stocking, it appears the fingerling stockings contributed substantially to the sample since more than 95% of the fish aged corresponded to years of stocking.  Growth was similar to the statewide average.  Walleye averaged nearly 17.0 inches after four years of growth.   <br> \n <br> \nGill-net catch rates for northern pike have ranged from a low of 1.0 fish/net in 2006 to a high of 8.0 fish/net in 1979.  The northern pike catch was 1.0 fish/net in 2006 compared to 2.9 fish/net in 2000.  Fish ranged from 17.9 to 27.1 inches and averaged 22.4 inches.  Five year-classes were identified from cliethra and scales ranging from one to eight years old.  Northern pike averaged 23.9 inches after four years of growth compared to the statewide average of 20.5 inches.  The lack of suitable spawning habitat limits northern pike numbers; however, this helps insure that northern pike will not become overabundant as is the case in many lakes.  The low density population, in conjunction with an excellent prey base in tulibees, should allow the lake to produce some large fish (>40 inches).  Anglers harvesting too many medium to large fish would be the only thing preventing northern pike from attaining such sizes. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 4.8 fish/net in 1951 to a high of 86.7 fish/net in 1984.  In 2006, the catch was 24.1 fish/gill net, nearly identical to the catch from 2000.  The catch was above average for lakes similar to Siseebakwet.  The sampled yellow perch ranged from 5.7 to 10.9 inches and averaged 7.3 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.\t\t\t\t <br> \n <br> \nTullibee can be difficult to catch because they frequently live over deep water, an area that our standard sampling gear was not designed to sample.  However, they are important to fish communities as a prey source for many predator species, especially northern pike and walleye.  Tullibee gill-net catch rates have been as low as 0 fish/net in 1975 and as high as 11.8 fish/net in 1984, with no apparent trend in abundance.  In 2006, the tullibee catch of 1.3 fish/gill net was the second highest ever recorded for the lake and approached the average of 1.6 fish/gill net for class 22 lakes.  The fish ranged from 7.6 to 13.7 inches while having an average length of 11.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population has been characterized by low trap net catch rates (<6.3 fish/net) in all assessments except 1991 when 19.2 fish/net were sampled.  In 2006, the trap net catch of 4.8 fish/net was similar to the last two assessments.  The most recent catch rates have been near the lower end of the normal range for lakes similar to Siseebakwet.  The lack of protected bays and vegetation likely limit the bluegill population from expanding substantially.  Bluegill ranged from 3.7 to 8.5 inches with an average length of 6.6 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sisseebakwet Lake, also called as Sugar Lake, has historically supported, and continues to support a very strong walleye population.  The gill net catch rate for walleyes in this assessment is well above the median value for similar type lakes.  The walleyes that were sampled were also above the median size for similar type lakes.  They had a mean weight of 1.9 pounds and a mean length of 16.6 inches.  The largest walleye sampled was 28.7 inches long.     Northern pike do not appear to be very abundant.  They were sampled in the gill nets at a rate below the median value for similar type lakes.  The northern pike that were sampled had a mean length of 19.9 inches and a mean weight of 2.3 pounds.     Yellow perch were sampled in the gill nets at a rate near the lake class median.  The perch that were sampled had a mean length of 7.8 inches.  Over 10% of these were between 10 and 11.9 inches.      Bluegills abundance appears to be low.  Trap net catch rates are below the median for this lake type but the mean size appears to be good.  The mean length of the sampled bluegills is 7.2 inches.     Largemouth bass and black crappies were sampled at low rates.  However, our methods do not sample these species effectively so it is difficult to determine their abundance from testnetting data alone.  Rock bass were sampled at a high rate and anglers report that they are often caught in high numbers while fishing with live bait.       White sucker, pumkinseed sunfish, tullibee, hybrid sunfish and several minnow species were also sampled.     Sisseebakwet Lake is a lake with very good water quality and very clear water.  The watershed surrounding the lake is forested, with development primarily limited to the lakeshore.  Lakeshore residents can play a big role in the water quality of the lake through the actions they take.  A set of lakeshore best management practices have been developed and the residents of Sisseebakwet are encouraged to implement these practices at every opportunity so that water quality can be maintained in the lake.     Anglers have expressed concern over the harvest of large walleyes from the lake.  Sisseebakwet Lake currently has a high quality walleye fishery.  Anglers can help maintain that quality through the practice of catch and release with fish greater than 17 inches. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 1995 Siseebakwet Lake management plan lists walleye as the primary species for management with northern pike as a secondary species.Northern pike catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 1.3 to 8.0 per gill net.  The 2000 catch rate of 2.9 per gill net was typical for the lake, and the high mean weight of 3.3 pounds was also about average for the lake.  The PSD (21 inches) was 88 and RSD-P (28 inches) was 6, indicating a high proportion of 21-28 inch individuals but few larger fish.  Growth rates were above the statewide averages for ages 1-4 (>15% above for age 4).  The oldest individual was 28.4 inches and 7 years old.Walleye catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 3.8 to 26.6 per gill net.  The 2000 catch rate of 10.8 per gill net was typical for the lake, and the high mean weight of 2.8 pounds was the highest on record.  Walleye were stocked in 12 of 20 years between 1980 and 2000; walleye have been stocked at various times in Siseebakwet Lake since 1943.  Of the 96 walleye aged, 96% were from stocked years.  Growth rates were similar to the statewide averages for ages 1-10.  Size structure was excellent, with a PSD (15 inches) of 87, a RSD-P (20 inches) of 32, and a RSD-M (25 inches) of 13.  The observed size structure was primarily due to the high proportion of older fish; 21% were 10 years or older.  The oldest individual was 27.7 inches and 19 years old.Yellow perch catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 16.0 to 86.7 per gill net.  The 2000 catch rate of 24.5 per gill net was a bit below average for the lake.  Size structure was fair, with a PSD (8 inches) of 51 and a RSD-P (10 inches) of 12.Bluegill catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 3.2 to 19.2 per trap net.  The 2000 bluegill catch rate of 3.4 per trap net was low for the lake.  The PSD (6 inches) was 61 and the RSD-P (8 inches) was 2, indicating a good proportion of 6-8 inch individuals but few larger fish.Shoreline owners can directly help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by following lakeshore development best management practices, such as maintaining or upgrading septic systems, minimizing nutrient inputs from fertilizer use, and leaving aquatic vegetation and terrestrial vegetation intact within at least 50 feet of the shoreline or restoring such vegetation to its native state.  Poorly-maintained septic systems and fertilizers contribute excess nutrients and bacteria to the lake, and removal of upland and aquatic vegetation can cause additional ecological problems.  Symptoms of impaired water quality can include increases in winter kills, summer kills, algae, aquatic plants, and fecal coliform bacteria.  Conversely, a naturally vegetated shoreline (not mowed grass) provides cover for young and adult fish, filters nutrients before they reach the lake, reduces erosion, and provides food and habitat for invertebrates and wildlife.

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 26 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 90.9 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 4.9?C (40.8?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a wide range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1979-2017 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2012. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress.  <br> \n</p>",

No tullibees were caught in this study but were abundant in the 1984 investigation.  Perch abundance remains well above state and local medians.  Northern pike abundance has remained unchanged and is similar to the state and local median.Ageing of the walleyes sampled indicates a very strong 1986 year class, this being a year in which fingerlings were stocked.  About 23% of the walleye were 8 years old or older.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Siseebakwet, also known as Sugar Lake, is a 1,306 acre lake with 292 littoral acres (22%) and a maximum depth of 105 feet.  The 5.8 mile shoreline is heavily developed, but interspersed with quality stands of bulrush, particularly in undeveloped areas.  There are two inlets, Sugar Brook from the west connecting Little Siseebakwet and Spring Lake(s) and a channel connecting South Sugar Lake from the southwest.  The outlet, Sugar Brook, ultimately connects to Pokegama Lake to the east.  However, a low head dam at the outlet of Siseebakwet likely limits fish immigration.  There is a small county owned public access on the north shore with limited parking.  Walleye are a primary management species and have been stocked at various rates and frequencies in the past, but have been stocked at a rate of 2 pounds per littoral acre (584 pounds) every other year since 2007.  Rusty crayfish, an invasive species, has been documented at various abundances in past assessments. <br> \n <br> \nThe fisheries lake management plan (LMP) was last revised in 2013.  Walleye was listed as the primary management species and Northern Pike was listed as a secondary management species.  The goal of the LMP was to maintain a Walleye catch rate of 15/gill net.  The 2017 survey included 10 gill nets and 15 trap nets.  The number of gill nets used was reduced from the scheduled 12 due to achieving an adequate sample size of Walleye.  The purpose of the survey was to evaluate fingerling stocking and the status of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nSiseebakwet Lake has a long history of high Walleye catches when compared to lakes with similar habitats.  The 2017 catch of 36.7/net, was the highest observed.  There was a diverse range of sizes sampled, similar to previous assessments.  However, the average size tended to be smaller.  Lengths ranged from 8.1 to 26.3 inches with an average length of 13.1 inches.  Age analysis indicates young fish dominated the sample, as 91% of the fish sampled were age 3 or less.  Walleye averaged 15.5 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were not abundant and typically sampled below the expected range for similar lakes.  The low catches are likely related to limited spawning habitat.  The 2017 catch was the lowest observed.  Lengths ranged from 23.1 to 27.9 inches with an average length of 25.6 inches.  Northern Pike averaged 23.9 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the second most abundant species sampled in gill nets, near what would be expected.  Catches have been within the range of expected catch rates since 1991.  Size structure was favorable with lengths from 3.5 to 13.2 inches with an average length of 7.9 inches.  Yellow Perch averaged 10.1 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were caught in relatively high numbers compared to lakes with similar habitats.  Black Crappie were rarely sampled prior to 2012.  Size structure was good, though dominated by a single year class.  Black Crappie averaged 12.1 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nCatches for Bluegill have typically been low and characterized by a moderate size structure, similar to what was observed in 2017.  Lengths ranged from 2.8 to 8.6 inches with an average length of 6.6 inches.  Bluegill averaged 7.4 inches by age-6. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee tend to have variable catches due to their pelagic, schooling nature, but were sampled near the lake average in 2017.  Other species sampled included Burbot, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eleven species of fish were sampled during the assessment with 4 species, yellow perch, walleye, rock bass, and bluegill accounting for 94% of the combined gillnet/trapnet catch.Walleye is the species most sought by anglers fishing Siseebakwet Lake.  Walleye abundance expressed as gill net CPUE (10.2/lift) is nearly twice the lake class median and corresponds closely with a historical unweighted mean catch rate of 12.4/gillnet lift calculated from 7 assessments conducted over the past 40 years.  The median length of 92 gill net sampled walleyes was 15.6 inches.  A mean weight of 1.6 pounds was calculated from the same sample.  A PSD of 67 further illustrates the length-frequency distribution of the sample and reflects a walleye population size structure desirable to the angler.  Ageing revealed eight year classes of walleyes with age II thru V strongly represented.  Growth rates of age II thru V fish correspond closely with statewide averages.Rock bass was the most common species captured during the assessment constituting 40% of the total number and 36% of the biomass of the combined gillnet/trapnet catch.  A gillnet CPUE of 42.1/lift for rock bass is 18 times the lake class median and is the highest ever reported from this lake.A bluegill CPUE of 19.2/trapnet lift is slightly higher than the lake class median and is 3 times higher than any previously reported from this lake.  Four year classes of bluegill were identified with ages II and III strongly represented. Growth rates for age II and III bluegill were nearly 20% behind averages established for this species.Yellow perch catch rates have ranged widely over the past 40 years.  The current yellow perch CPUE (31.4/gillnet lift) is exactly double the lake class median and is 30% behind the historical unweighted mean catch rate of 44.1/gillnet lift.  Length frequency distributions suggests a wide representation of year class strengths.  The median length of102 gillnet sampled perch was 8.1 inches.Northern pike have never been reported in great abundance from Siseebakwet Lake.  The current catch rate of 1.3/gillnet lift falls below the first quartile for lakes of this class and is the lowest ever recorded for this body of water.  The historical unweighted mean catch rate (3.5/gillnet lift) corresponds closely with the first quartile value of 3.0/lift.  Age and growth calculations were performed on the northern pike sample (n=12).  Three year classes were identified with age II fish comprising 67% of the total.  Growth of age II northern pike was nearly 44% ahead of averages established for this species.</p>",
