The  catch of Northern Pike in gillnets was almost twice the local average in both numbers and weight, but no fish over Age III were taken. Growth rate of Northen Pike is good.      Yellow Perch were sampled at their highest numbers in any assessment done on the lake.     Largemouth Bass were taken in 3/4\" mesh trapnets and young-of-the-year Largemouth Bass were taken in 1/4\" mesh trapnets.</p>",

This increase maybe reflected in the substantial reduction of Yellow Perch which are at their lowest densities in the last four assessments. Trapnet catches of Largemouth Bass are consistant with previous catches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The gamefish population in Swallow Lake is comprised of walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass and yellow perch. Test nets in 1995 indicates Swallow Lake supports a higher than average number of walleye compared to similar lakes in this class. The size range is well distributed with fish in the sample ranging from 9 inches to 24 inches (4.3 pounds). Average size of the walleye sampled was 15.4 inches with over one half of the fish 16 inches or larger. The walleye population is being maintained thru natural reproduction.     Northern pike abundance is higher than similar lakes in this class and average approximately 2.25 pounds each. Northern pike up to 27 inches (4.5 pounds) were sampled however northern pike over 8 pounds are rare.     Largemouth bass are present but are a difficult species to sample with nets however it is believed they are present in above average numbers for this lake class. All the largemouth bass sampled were less than 10 inches but individuals up to 17.5 inches were recorded in previous surveys. Occasionally reports are received of good catches of largemouth bass by anglers but most of the angling on Swallow Lake is directed at walleye and northern pike.</p>",

From Hwy 1 go 5 miles down the Deep Lake Road (USFS Rd. #1491) to USFS Rd. #1491K timber access road, then a 0.4 mile carry in, crossing Camp E Creek to the southeast corner of the deep basin.  This is a user developed non-motorized trail.  Contact the USFS Kawishiwi district or check the Superior NF website for information on camping in the area and activities in the Superior NF.  The lake has an area of 147 acres and a maximum depth of 38 feet.  The fish community consists of Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass and White Sucker.  The fish community is sustained by natural reproduction as no stocking has been done on the lake since 1988  <br> \n <br> \nA survey was completed in 2018 to update the status of the fish community, evaluate current management goals, and provide information to direct future management activities.  The last survey was done in 1995.  In 1997, the access was gated when that parcel of land was sold to private ownership.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill net catch in six sets of 4.2/net was slightly less than average when compared to other similar lakes, but still within the normal range.  Average weight and length was 2 pounds and 15.5 inches.  The largest fish sampled was 27.4 inches long and weighed 7.9 pounds.  Walleye recruitment was sporadic with seven year classes sampled and fish as old as 16 years.  Growth was fast for Finland Area standards.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch of 8.2/net was slightly higher than average when compared to other similar lakes, but again within the normal range.  Average weight and length was 2.6 pounds and 22.5 inches.  The largest fish sampled was 28.9 inches long and weighed 5.3 pounds.  Northern Pike recruitment was consistent with 10 year classes sampled and 2012, 2013 and 2014 the strongest year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass gill net catch of 0.5/net was average, while average weight of 2.2 pounds was above average compared to similar lakes.  The largest fish sampled was 18.7 inches long and weighed 4 pounds.  Six special mini trap nets sampled 225 young-of-the-year fish.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch of 14.2/net was slightly high while the average size of 6.3 inches was somewhat small.  The largest fish sampled was 7.6 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill special trap net catch was 8.5/net with an average length of 3.4 inches.  The largest fish sampled was 5.2 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker gill net catch of 3/net with average weight of 2 pounds would both be considered within the normal range for similar lakes.  The largest fish sampled was 21.9 inches long.  Other species sampled in the survey were Bluntnose Minnow, Common Shiner, Golden Shiner and Tadpole Madtom in special trap nets, and a Hybrid Sunfish, two Pumpkinseed and five Rock Bass in gill nets. <br> \n</p>",

The median depth is approximately 6 feet. The moderately hard-water supports a variety of floating leaved and submerged aquatic plants in a scattered to moderate density. A number of emergent plant species were seen, but they exhibited sparse growth. Soils of the shoal waters appeared to be 70% muck, 15% boulder, 5% rubble, 5% gravel, and 5% sand. Camp E Creek serves as both the inlet and outlet to the lake. Shoreline marshes or lowlands were seen on west and north shores of the main or center-most portion of the lake. A shoreline marsh was also observed on the north shore of the west bay. Water clarity is quite good as a secchi disc could be seen to a depth of 11.1 feet.     The numbers of White Sucker, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch taken by gillnetting were above respective state-wide and watershed averages. A goodly number of Walleye were also netted. In addition Rock Bass and Largemouth Bass are present.     There are no resorts or cottages at the lake and only 1 boat was seen during the survey. Access to Swallow Lake is restricted to a trail leading off from a road that leads to Pickerel Lake. No designated public access exists.     Swallow Lake appears to be producing and/or holding Northern Pike, Walleye, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch quite well. Stocking the lake with Black Crappie may produce some additional fishing pleasure with little or no ill effects on existing fish populations.</p>",
