BLC CATCH RATES REMAIN HIGH AT 63.00/TRAP NET, COMPARED TO THE 48.00/TRAP NET IN 1990.  AGE 3 BLC EXHIBIT SLOW GROWTH.

Black crappie averaged 39 per trap net.  Black bullhead averaged 78 per trap net with most fish 5.5 - 7.5 inches and a few making 9 inches.  Other species found in low numbers include bluegill, white crappie, pumpkinseed, largemouth bass, and yellow bullhead.

PRIOR TO THE CATFISH, STUDY, LION'S LAKE HAD BEEN MANAGED AS A SUSTAINING LMB, BLG, AND CRAPPIE FISHERY.  THE BLG CATCH RATE INCREASED FROM 24.57 IN 1985 TO 47.66/TRAP NET. BLGS SAMPLED WERE SMALL AND DOMINATED BY 2 YEAR OLDS (87%) WITH ALL FISH SAMPLED LESS THAN 7.0 INCHES IN LENGTH.  BLGS SHOW SIGNS OF SLOW GROWTH AFTER THEIR SECOND YEAR WITH 4 YEAR OLDS AVERAGING 4.7 INCHES IN LENGTH.  BLC CATCH RATES REMAIN HIGH AVERAGING 48.00/TRAP NET COMPARED TO 50.28/TAP NET IN 1985.  BLC CONTINUE TO GROW SLOWLY WITH 3 YEAR OLDS AVERAGING 4.7 INCHES COMPARED TO THE 3 YEAR OLDS SAMPLED IN 1985 THAT AVERAGED 5.7 INCHES. THE STATE AVERAGE IS 6.8 INCHES AT 3 YEAR OLD. EIGHT YEARLING LMB WERE SAMPLED COMPARED TO NONE SAMPLED IN 1985.  ONE CCF WAS SAMPLED AND IS PROBABLY A CARRY-OVER FROM THE STUDY.  BLBS WERE SAMPLED IN LOW NUMBERS AVERAGING 14.00/TRAP NET COMPARED TO 56.14/TRAP NET IN 1985.</p>",
