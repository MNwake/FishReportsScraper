                "narrative": "<p>Height of Land Lake is a large (3,520 acre) shallow lake located in central Becker County.  The lake is relatively lightly developed, and much of the north shore is included in the Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge.  Height of Land is in lake class 41.  Lakes of this class are relatively large, shallow, productive, and subject to periodic winterkills.  Other class 41 lakes in the area include Rock, Shell, Wolf, and Tamarac. <br> \n <br> \nHeight of Land Lake experienced a severe winterkill in 1996, while less severe, partial winterkills occurred in 1986, 1989, 1993, 1997, and 2001.  Height of land has experienced changes in its fish community in response to these winterkill events.  Bullheads, northern pike and yellow perch have generally survived quite well; but severe kills, such as the one in early 1996, mostly eliminated walleye, bass, and panfish populations.  Walleye fry and fingerlings, bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass adult broodstock were stocked in 1996 following the winterkill.  Walleye fry are stocked regularly during odd-numbered years and also during even-numbered years after winterkill occurs. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry stocking has proven successful at sustaining a modest (sometimes very good) fishery between winterkills.  There is also a modest level of natural reproduction in this lake when brood-sized fish are available.  Walleyes sampled in 2010 were slightly larger than those sampled five years prior with an average length of 16.0 inches and an average weight of 1.6 pounds.  Northern pike were generally abundant and small.  Sampled pike had an average length of 18.6 inches with an average weight of 1.4 pounds.  As well as being a primary forage species for walleye and northern pike, yellow perch are a popular angling target in Height of Land Lake.  Yellow perch abundance has remained high for this lake type since 1962.  The average size of yellow perch was down a bit at 6.6 inches.  Few perch larger than 10 inches were found in 2010, unlike some past reports. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass numbers have historically been low in Height of Land Lake.  Adults of all three species were stocked after the winterkill in 1996 and natural reproduction of each species has since been documented.  Bluegill catches have increased much more than those of either black crappie or largemouth bass.  In fact, bluegill catches were much higher in this lake in 2005 and 2010 than at any previous time since surveys began in 1962.  Bluegills have increased in size and those sampled averaged 7.0 inches in length.  Nearly one-third of them were over eight inches.  Bluegills grow rapidly in this lake and a couple of strong year classes under age five should continue to provide good fishing within the next couple of years if no winterkill occurs.  <br> \n <br> \nBullheads are common in lakes that occasionally winterkill.  They are the survivors after most winterkills and their numbers usually increase dramatically following winters with low oxygen due to the decreased competition.  Bullhead numbers continue to decline in Height of Land Lake, however.  The lack of winterkills in recent years has allowed gamefish species to survive and compete with bullheads for available food and space.   <br> \n <br> \nHeight of Land has a small but active lake association.  Shoreland owners are concerned with lake level and water quality issues.  Even though periodic winterkills are inevitable, good fishing opportunities are possible between winterkill events.   <br> \n</p>",

It is sometimes subject to low dissolved oxygen levels during the winter.  The most severe winterkill occurred in 1996, eliminating most of the Walleye and panfish populations.  Anglers reported dead fish following the 2022-2023 winter.  A targeted fisheries survey was completed in May 2023 to assess the severity of the winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nDead fish of all species were observed while surveying.  Five trap nets were used to sample Height of Land Lake.  Bullheads were the most abundant species captured, but Black Crappie, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, Northern Pike, and White Sucker were also captured.  Northern Pike had an average length of 17 inches.  Walleye were reintroduced during 2023.  Angling opportunities for Northern Pike are still available and maybe an occasional crappie, but it will likely take a several years to have quality fishing for other species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Height of Land Lake is a large (3520 acre), shallow (mean depth 7.6 feet) central Becker County lake with a history of periodic partial winterkill.  Those winterkills have undoubtedly influenced the fish community in the lake more than fishing has.  In recent years, documented winterkill has occurred during 1986, 1989, and 1993.  However, even the most severe winterkills have not totally eliminated the fish community and northern pike, yellow perch, and bullhead populations have generally thrived.  Walleye, bluegill, and largemouth bass populations have been impacted the most by low dissolved oxygen levels.  Restocking of these species following winterkills has resulted in increased fishing opportunity in the lake between winterkills.  Since the initial fisheries survey in 1962, test net catches of northern pike averaged well above normal in Height of Land compared to ecologically similar lakes.  The 1995 net catch remains high at 18.6 per experimental gillnet.  Northern pike have not been stocked since 1951 and natural reproduction is more than sufficient to maintain the population.  The northern pike population continued to consist mostly of small, young pike.  In seven mid summer surveys since 1962, no pike larger than 30 inches have been sampled.  In 1995, mean length of sampled pike was 17.2 inches and mean weight was 1.0 pounds.  Of 87 pike analyzed for age and growth, only one was older than age four and over half were age two.  Northern pike growth rates are considered normal.  Height of Land's walleye population has fluctuated within or below the normal range depending upon winterkill.  The historical mean gillnet catch of walleye in the lake was 4.1 per net.  The 1995 catch was 3.4 per gillnet.  Walleye fry have been stocked frequently since 1948.  Most of the walleyes measured were either eight inch yearlings or eighteen inch five year olds.  Consequently, the average length fell in between the two groups at 14.4 inches.  Walleye growth rates were considered slightly faster than normal.  There was an abundant supply of yellow perch and other forage fish.  Yellow perch remained relatively abundant and relatively large.  Approximately 10% of the yellow perch sampled were larger than 10 inches.  Abundant perch, along with abundant bullheads, may act to suppress the bluegill population in Height of Land Lake.  Bluegill numbers remain low at 0.5 per trapnet.  This species appears to be quite vulnerable to winterkill in this lake.  Although spawning cover and substrate appear favorable (bulrush beds and firm bottom are abundant), natural reproduction appears to be lacking.  No bluegill younger than age seven were sampled in 1995.  Those present in the lake are good sized with an average length of 8.1 inches.  Largemouth bass appear to be present in normal abundance.  The trapnet catch was well within the normal range at 0.5 per net.  Largemouth bass also appear to have been greatly impacted by winterkill in the lake.  However, they may be better able to repopulate the lake than are bluegill.  Electrofishing is required to get a better handle on the bass population in Height of Land Lake since they are not especially vulnerable to test nets.  Along with abundant and fast growing populations of northern pike and yellow perch, occasional winterkill lakes typically have large populations of black bullhead, since this species is tolerant of low dissolved oxygen.  Height of Land Lake is no exception.  However, brown bullheads are even more abundant and the net catch remained well above normal compared to similar lakes.  Yellow bullheads were present in normal numbers.  It is clear from historical data that Height of Land Lake is ecologically best suited for northern pike, bullhead, and yellow perch.  Although definite changes have occurred in the fish community during the past thirty years, those species remain most abundant and able to sustain themselves.  Walleye and centrarchid stocking following winterkill has also provided additional fishing opportunity in Height of Land Lake.  A small but active lake association is concerned with water quantity and quality in Height of Land Lake.  Continued concern by members with issues of nutrient input, upstream and lakeshore watershed practices, and run of the river flows will increase the sustainability of the fishery.  Even though periodic, partial winterkill is inevitable, wise land and water stewardship will insure that fish populations are able to continue to rebound following those events.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The hard water of Height of Land Lake covers an area of 3,520 acres.  About 91 percent of this area or 3,190 acres is shallower than 15 feet.  Maximum depth of the lake is 21 feet and the median depth is 7 feet.  Lake bed soils in the most shallow waters are estimated to be 80% sand, 10% gravel, 10% rubble, and a trace of boulder.  About 15 percent of the present lake water surface area is covered with emergent vegetation-mostly bulrush and wild rice with some cattail, cane, and spikerush.  Much of the lake's area has a good growth of submerged aquatic plants dominated by coontail, flatstem pondweed, bushy pondweed, muskgrass (Chara spp.), sago pondweed, and claspingleaf pondweed.  The Ottertail River serves both as inlet and outlet to the lake.  In addition, there are 5 other inlets.  Shoreline marshes exist along the Ottertail River inlet and outlet and in the southeast lake corner.  Clarity of the lake water permitted sighting of a secchi disc in water up to 5.5 feet deep.There were 4 resorts (25 resort cabins), 36 boats, and 24 other homes and/or cottages counted during the survey.  A county-owned public access on the northeast shore is in the process of development.  The public also uses the parking area and access at the state-owned dam on the west shore.  Fishing pressure is thought to be no more than moderate at the best.Test netting of the lake revealed that northern pike, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and bullhead numbers were quite dense.  White sucker, perch, largemouth bass, and bluegill populations were above those indicated by respective regional medians.  Walleye numbers were lower than, but near, the regional median.  A limited number of dogfish were netted.</p>",

Some other class 41 lakes in the area are:  Rock, Shell, and Tamarack.Height of Land Lake experienced a severe winterkill in 1996, while less severe, partial winterkills occurred in 1986, 1989, 1993, and 1997.  Height of land has experienced changes in its fish community in response to these winterkill events.  Bullheads, northern pike and yellow perch have generally survived quite well, but walleye and centrarchid populations are mostly eliminated by severe kills, such as the one in early 1996.  Walleye fry and fingerlings, and bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass adult broodstock were restocked in 1996.  Walleye fry were also stocked again in 1997 and 1999.Walleye fry stocking has proven successful.  The 2000 survey found a good population of walleyes in Height of Land Lake.  The gill net catch rate of 11.25/net is the highest reported since test netting began in 1962.  The walleye gill net sample from the 2000 survey was made up mostly of fish from the 1997 year class.  The majority of walleyes (86.7%) were \"keeper\" sized fish from 13-16 inches long.  The lake is scheduled for fry stocking again in 2001.Historically, gill net catches of northern pike have averaged well above the normal range for class 41 lakes.  Northern pike have not been stocked since 1951 and natural reproduction is more than sufficient to maintain the population.  The 2000 gill net catch rate of 10.6/net was a decrease from the 1995 survey, but still above the normal range.  As in previous surveys, the northern pike sample in 2000 was dominated by small fish.  Sampled pike had an average length of 17 inches with an average weight of approximately 1 pound.  Of the 70 pike analyzed for age and growth, most were age 2 or 3.  Most of the pike were rather skinny and growth rates are considered slower than normal.Yellow perch abundance has remained within or above the normal range since 1962.  The yellow perch net catch in 2000 was similar to previous surveys at 16.25/net.  Average size of yellow perch was quite good at 8.8 inches.  Approximately 42% of yellow perch sampled were larger than 10 inches.Bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass numbers have historically been low in Height of Land Lake.  Adults of all three species were restocked after the winterkill in 1996, and natural reproduction of each species has since been documented.  These species were captured in very low numbers in the 2000 survey, and it appears their populations are still in a recovery phase.As expected with lakes that occasionally winterkill, Height of Land Lake has a high abundance of bullheads.  Black, brown, and yellow bullheads are present in Height of Land.  Brown bullheads appear to be the most abundant, with net catches for this species well above the normal range at 77.3/trap net.It is clear from historical data that Height of Land Lake is ecologically best suited for northern pike, bullheads, and yellow perch.  These species have consistently remained the most abundant and able to sustain themselves.  Walleye and centrarchid stocking following winterkills has also provided additional fishing opportunities.  Anglers have reported good fishing for walleye and yellow perch over the past year.Height of Land has a small but active lake association.  Shoreland owners are very concerned with lake level and water quality issues.  The lake association's continued concern with upstream and lakeshore watershed practices will increase the sustainability of the fishery.  Even though periodic winterkills are inevitable, it is important that nutrient inputs to Height of Land Lake be minimized to reduce the winterkill potential.  Wise land and water stewardship will insure that fish populations are able to continue to rebound following those events.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This assessment was conducted in June 2015 to assess the fish population within Height of Land Lake.  Height of Land Lake is a large (3,520 acre) shallow lake located in central Becker County.  The lake is relatively lightly developed, and much of the north shore is included in the Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge.  Height of Land is in lake class 41.  Lakes of this class are relatively large, shallow, productive, and subject to periodic winterkills.  Other class 41 lakes in the surrounding area include Rock, Shell, Wolf, and Tamarac. <br> \n <br> \nHeight of Land Lake experienced a severe winterkill in 1996, while less severe, partial winterkills occurred in 1986, 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2014.  Height of Land Lake has experienced changes in its fish community in response to the severe winterkill events, and recovered naturally following the partial winterkills.  The severe winterkill in 1996 mostly eliminated Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and panfish populations.  Walleye fry and fingerlings, Bluegill, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass adult broodstock were stocked in spring of 1996.  Test netting is done following each partial kill to assess the severity of the winterkill, and to help determine if it is necessary to stock broodstock of any species. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked during odd-numbered years, and also during even-numbered years after a severe winterkill.  There is a modest level of natural reproduction of Walleye within the lake, and combined with fry stocking, the Walleye population in Height of Land Lake has fluctuated within the normal range for lakes of similar characteristics.  In 2015, the Walleye catch rate (3.9 per gill net) was just slightly below the historical average for Height of Land Lake (4.7 per gill net).  Walleyes sampled in 2015 were slightly smaller than those sampled five years prior, with an average length of 14.9 inches and an average weight of 1.3 pounds.  Walleyes from seven different ages were sampled.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike sampled in 2015 were generally abundant and small, with an average length of 18.4 inches, and an average weight of 1.3 pounds.  Yellow Perch abundance has been on a downward trend since the 1986 survey, but it remains within the normal range of lakes with similar characteristics.  As well as being a primary forage species for Walleye and Northern Pike, Yellow Perch are a popular angling target in Height of Land Lake.  The average size of Yellow Perch increased slightly from the previous survey, and is 6.9 inches.  Few perch larger than 10 inches were found in 2015, unlike some past reports. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Largemouth Bass numbers have historically been low in Height of Land Lake, but are within the normal range for lakes of similar characteristics.  During the 2015 survey, a historically high number of Bluegills were sampled.  While average size is small at 6.1 inches, a small proportion of the sample exceeded eight inches.  Bluegills grow rapidly in Height of Land Lake, and fish under age five years old should continue to provide good fishing within the next couple of years if no winterkill occurs.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow, Black, and Brown Bullheads are all found in Height of Land Lake.  While Black and Brown Bullhead catch rates are low, Yellow Bullheads were sampled at a historical high in 2015.  Commercial Fish Removal was permitted during 2015 for Bullheads, removing 300 pounds of Bullheads for human use.  Bullheads removed were under 0.5 pounds each. <br> \n <br> \nBefore flowing through Height of Land Lake, the Otter Tail River begins at Elbow Lake and flows south through several lakes such as Little Bemidji, Many Point, and Round Lake.  Tullibee, Lake Sturgeon, and Muskellunge all exist in these upstream lakes either naturally or through stocking.  Therefore, not surprisingly, recent assessments have also documented Tullibee, Lake Sturgeon, and Muskellunge within Height of Land Lake.  Tullibee were documented in 1975 and 2010, but not sampled during this assessment.  Lake Sturgeon were sampled in this assessment (two fish captured) and in 2005 (one fish captured).  In addition, one Muskellunge was documented during a separate assessment in 2015.  Although fish must travel downstream through the Otter Tail River over 15 river miles, through three shallow, heavily vegetated lakes within Tamarack National Wildlife Refuge before reaching Height of Land Lake, it is likely the documented presence of Muskellunge and Lake Sturgeon are a result of fish moving downstream through the Otter Tail River.  While no angler reports of Lake Sturgeon or Muskellunge have been recorded, it is possible that anglers may encounter these species in the future.  Documented movement of multiple fish species through the Ottertail River emphasizes the importance of habitat preservation within this system. <br> \n <br> \nWith continuing shoreline and watershed development, this diverse, productive, and valuable fishery will need help on several fronts to be sustained.  Anglers can help to maintain balance in fish populations by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium and large fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.  This is particularly true for Northern Pike and Bluegill.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, by taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and by using wise land management practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Height of Land Lake is a 3,795-acre lake located in central Becker County 15 miles east of the city of Detroit Lakes. Height of Land possesses a moderately developed shoreline, primarily along its southern shore. The lake is designated as moderately productive and is occasionally subject to low dissolved oxygen levels during the winter, with the last severe winterkill occurring in 1996. Height of Land Lake's fishery provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and other species. A standard fisheries survey was completed on Height of Land Lake in June 2021. <br> \n <br> \nStocking sustains the Walleye fishery in Height of Land Lake as spawning habitat is very limited. Walleye fry are stocked during odd-numbered years, when surplus fry are available, or following winterkill events. Catch rates of Walleye have fluctuated in Height of Land Lake, ranging from one to about 11 Walleye per net. The average catch rate of Walleye in 2021 was roughly three per net. Walleye sampled in 2021 ranged in length from 11.7 to 26.1 inches, averaging 16.1 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Northern Pike in gill nets increased dramatically in Height of Land Lake in 1986 but have since declined. The average catch rate of Northern Pike in 2021 was about 13 pike per gill net. Northern Pike sampled in 2021 ranged in length from 9.3 to 34.5 inches, averaging 17.2 inches long. Pike between 13 and 18 inches accounted for 64% of sampled pike, characteristic of a population dominated by small-sized fish. <br> \n  <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates have declined in Height of Land Lake, paralleling the timeline of increased Northern Pike catches. On average, about seven Yellow Perch were caught per gill net in 2021. Sampled Yellow Perch ranged in length from 4.9 to 11.4 inches, averaging 6.8 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nPast surveys documented very low catch rates of Bluegill in Height of Land Lake, likely a result of periodic winterkills. Catch rates have since increased and the average catch rate of Bluegill in 2021 was almost 13 per trap net. Bluegill sampled in 2021 ranged in length from 4.9 to 9.3 inches and averaged 7.8 inches. Age structures show that Bluegill do not reach eight inches until around seven years old. Beginning March 1, 2021, a special sunfish regulation (10 fish daily bag limit) was implemented on Height of Land Lake as part of the Quality Sunfish Initiative, a statewide effort to maintain the opportunity to catch large sunfish by reducing harvest limits.  <br> \n <br> \nOnly 25 Black Crappie were caught during the 2021 standard survey. Sampled Black Crappie ranged in length from 3.9 to 12.6 inches. A total of 11 Largemouth Bass were also caught, ranging in length from nine to 19 inches. Additional species sampled in the 2021 survey included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Bowfin, and White Sucker.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline owners can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat in Height of Land Lake by maintaining shoreline buffer zones and leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact. Anglers and recreationalists can protect Height of Land Lake's fishery by doing their best to stop the spread of aquatic invasive species and by releasing larger fish/harvesting smaller fish (specifically Northern Pike and Bluegill).   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Height of Land Lake is a large (3,520 acre) shallow lake in central Becker County.  The lake is relatively lightly developed, and much of the north shore is part of the Tamarack National Wildlife Refuge.  Height of Land is in lake class 41.  Lakes of this class are relatively large, shallow, productive, and subject to periodic winterkills.  Other class 41 lakes in the area include Rock, Shell, and Tamarack.Height of Land Lake experienced a severe winterkill in 1996, while less severe, partial winterkills occurred in 1986, 1989, 1993, 1997, and 2001.  Height of land has experienced changes in its fish community in response to these winterkill events.  Bullheads, northern pike and yellow perch have generally survived quite well; but severe kills, such as the one in early 1996, mostly eliminated walleye, bass, and panfish populations.  Walleye fry and fingerlings, bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass adult broodstock were stocked in 1996 following the winterkill.  Walleye fry are also stocked during odd-numbered year and after winterkill occurs.Walleye fry stocking has proven successful at sustaining a modest (sometimes very good) fishery between winterkills.  Walleyes sampled in 2005 were larger than those sampled five years prior with an average length of 15.6 inches and an average weight of 1.6 pounds.  Northern pike were generally abundant and small.  Sampled pike had an average length of 19 inches with an average weight of 1.3 pounds.  As well as being a primary forage species for walleye and northern pike, yellow perch are a popular angling target in Height of Land Lake.  Yellow perch abundance has remained high for this lake type since 1962.  The average size of yellow perch was 8.2 inches.  About one-fourth of yellow perch sampled were larger than 10 inches.Bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass numbers have historically been low in Height of Land Lake.  Adults of all three species were stocked after the winterkill in 1996 and natural reproduction of each species has since been documented.  Bluegill catches have increased much more than those of either black crappie or largemouth bass.  In fact, bluegill catches were much higher in this lake in 2005 than at any previous time since surveys began in 1962.  Most bluegills were young and small with an average length of 5.2 inches, but some were over eight inches.  Bluegills grow rapidly in this lake and three strong, consecutive year classes from 2001 through 2003 should provide good fishing within the next couple of years if no winterkill occurs. Common in lakes that occasionally winterkill, bullhead numbers are high on Height of Land Lake, and black, brown, and yellow bullheads are present.  Height of Land has a small but active lake association.  Shoreland owners are concerned with lake level and water quality issues.  Even though periodic winterkills are inevitable, good fishing opportunities are possible between winterkill events.  </p>",
