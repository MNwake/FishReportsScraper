                "narrative": "<p>Twin Lake consists of three basins located within the cities of Robbinsdale, Crystal, and Brooklyn Center.  All three basins have public accesses and are connected via navigable channels.  The primary boat launch is located in the south basin.  Although this survey treats the lake as one waterbody, fish populations and water quality are markedly different between the basins.  The lake is primarily managed for northern pike and secondarily for largemouth bass and bluegill.  The south and middle basins have better water quality, are fairly deep, and provide better habitat conditions for fish species.  The north basin, on the other hand, is very shallow, has poor water quality, and has a higher abundance of rough fish.  As a result, the gamefish and panfish populations sought after by anglers are concentrated in the south and middle basins of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 7.5 per gill net, which is moderately high compared similar lakes in the state.  Mean length and weight were 25.6 inches and 3.9 pounds, with the largest fish captured measuring 31.7 inches.  Seventy-eight percent of northern pike were between 21 and 28 inches, and only 20% were greater than 28 inches.  Ages 3 and 5-9 were represented and 78% were either age 5 or 6.  Growth was slower than average compared to other lakes in the West Metro Area.  Relative population abundance and mean length were similar to the previous survey in 2002.     <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  No largemouth bass were collected in this assessment of Twin Lake, however, largemouth are present as one adult and two young-of-the-year were sampled in 2002. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance is high at 66.4 fish per trap net, which is greater than many other lakes in the state.  Abundance is higher than the previous survey as trap nets caught nearly 30 more bluegill per net than the 2002 assessment.  Twin Lake bluegill have a small average length and weight at 5.5 inches and 0.1 pounds.  The longest measured 7.0 inches and only 10% were 6 inches or longer.  Ages ranged from 2 to 6 and 95% were age 3 or 4.  At age 3, bluegill averaged 4.8 inches in length.       <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to the 2002 assessment, the 2008 black crappie abundance is high and size structure is small.  Gill nets sampled 26.0 per lift and trap nets captured 26.9 per lift.  Mean length for black crappies was 6.7 inches and the longest was 7.8 inches.  Ages 1 through 4 were represented in the sample and 92% were age 3 or 4.  Growth was slower than average for lakes in the West Metro Area.       <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers are down from the previous assessment.  In 2002, 27.3 per gill net and 1.2 per trap net were sampled, compared to 10 per gill net and 0.6 per trap net in 2008.  Ten yellow perch per gill net is around the median for similar lakes in the state.  The average length of a yellow perch was 6.1 inches and the largest measured 7.0 inches.  The majority (73%) were age 4, and ages 1, 2, and 5 were also observed.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp catch declined from 2002 when 16.1 per trap net were collected.  During the 2008 assessment 4.7 per net were collected, however, 4.7 per net is still well above the third quartile for class 35 lakes.  Other species collected in lesser abundance were bowfin (dogfish), black bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Twin Lake is a 217-acre lake in Hennepin County.  Twin Lake consists of three distinct basins that are connected by navigable channels.  Although this survey treats the lake as one waterbody, the three basins are different from one another. The south and middle basins have less algae and vegetation, with maximum depths of 20 and 44 feet, respectively, and provide better habitat conditions for fish species.  The north basin, with a maximum depth of 8 feet, is characterized by abundant algae and submerged vegetation during summer months, and hosts a higher abundance of Common Carp and Black Bullhead.  Twin Lake is infested with Eurasian watermilfoil.  The primary boat launch is located on the south basin.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2018, Northern Pike were moderately abundant.  Fish ranged in length from 19.4 inches to 33.9 inches, with an average size of 25.5 inches and 3.75 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were highly abundant in 2018; however, the fish were not very large.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 4.1 to 7.3 inches, with an average of 6.2 inches and 0.12 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were highly abundant in 2018; however, only 5% of the sample exceeded 6 inches, and only one fish exceeded 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThree Walleye were sampled in 2018; one in the gill nets and two in the trap nets.  The fish measured 20.7 inches, 14.7 inches, and 19.7 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Twin Lake consists of three basins between North Minneapolis and the city of Brooklyn Center.  All three basins have boat accesses and are connected via navigable channels.  Although this survey treats the lake as one waterbody, fish populations and water quality are markedly different between the different basins.  The South and Middle Basins have better water quality, are fairly deep, and provide better habitat conditions for fish species.  The North Basin, on the other hand, is very shallow, has poor water quality, and has a higher frequency of rough fish and snapping turtles.  As a result, the gamefish and panfish populations sought after by anglers are concentrated in the South and Middle Basins of the lake.Black crappie are the most abundant panfish species in the lake.  Although an abundant population was found during the survey, black crappie sizes are fairly low.  Average length was 6.2 and 7.0 inches for gill net and trap net sampled fish, respectively.  Only 4 out of 587 total black crappie sampled were over 8.5 inches in length.  Average black crappie weight has remained stable over the last 20-year period with fish being sampled at a rate of 5-6 to the pound.  Growth rates were considered below average on Twin Lake suggesting that the crappie population will take several years to reach a quality size for anglers.Similar to black crappie, bluegill were found to be abundant in numbers but small in size.  Bluegill attained an average size of 6.1 inches long (range of 2.5-8.4 inches) and had an average weight of 0.19 pounds.  Only 20 of 341 observed BLG were larger than 7.0 inches in length. Northern Pike remain the most abundant predator species in Twin Lake.  Catch rates for this species have remained high for the last 20-years on this lake.  Average northern pike length and weight have increased slightly over this same time period from 21.4 inches and 2.3 pounds per fish in the 1980's, to a respectable 23.1 inches long and 3.0 pounds per fish from the 2002 survey.  Forty-four percent of northern pike captured were over 24 inches in length with five individual fish greater than 30 inches (9.3%).  The largest northern pike sampled during this survey was 32.6 inches. Pumpkinseeds and green sunfish are present in the lake; however, they were both sampled with low abundance and weight for this lake class.  Yellow perch can also be found in Twin Lake.  Although yellow perch are very abundant their small size (12.5 per pound) makes them unattractive for most anglers.Bowfin (dogfish), common carp, and black and yellow bullhead populations are also commonly found in the lake.  Bowfin averaged 22.1 inches in length and weighed an average of 3.6 pounds, whereas carp averaged 3.5 pounds and 18.6 inches in length.  </p>",
