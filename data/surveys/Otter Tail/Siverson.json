Other area lakes in this class include:  Alice, German, Pine, Tenter, and Twenty One. <br> \n     The northern pike gill net catch rate of 8.0 per lift is within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  The average weight of individual pike was 2.4 pounds and the mean length at capture of age-III pike was 23.2 inches.  Age II and III pike were well represented in the age class distribution.   <br> \n     Yellow bullhead abundance, as indexed by a trap net catch rate of 10.2 per lift, slightly exceeded the upper limit of the normal range.   <br> \n     The trap net catch rate of bluegill was 85.6 per lift which is 2.2 times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.  Sixteen percent of the Bluegills measured were seven inches or greater in length.  Bluegill recruitment appears to be consistent as six consecutive year classes were represented in the sample.  Bluegill growth rates are slower than statewide averages, with a mean length at age-VI of 5.9 inches.   <br> \n    Largemouth bass were not represented in the trap net sample; however; the gill net catch rate of 2.5 per lift is 1.8 times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.  Largemouth bass growth rates surpassed statewide averages with a mean length at age-II of 10.7 inches.   <br> \n     Black crappie abundance is below the normal range with a trap net catch rate of 0.2 per lift.   <br> \n     The gill net catch rate of yellow perch was 28.5 per net, which slightly exceeds the normal range.  Nine percent of the perch sample was 8.0 inches or greater in length.   <br> \n</p>",
