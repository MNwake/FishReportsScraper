                "narrative": "<p>Ivans Lake is a small 24 acre lake located two miles northeast of Park Rapids.  Ivans has a maximum depth of 35 feet.  There is no public access on the lake with private ownership around the entire lake shore.  Only trapnets were used due to the small size of the lake.  The only other fisheries survey was done in 1991.  Ivans supports populations of northern pike, panfish, and largemouth bass.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Ivans lake was assigned to lake class 33 using the limited physical information that was available.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Bass, Buck, Gulch 2, Ida, Ingram, Kane, Little Long, Morgan, Mud, and Star.Bluegill were the most abundant of the panfish species sampled in Ivans.  Bluegill abundance (22.6 bluegill/trapnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Bluegill numbers were lower in 1991 (5.2 bluegill/trapnet).  Bluegill were small in size with an average length of 5.3 inches.  Bluegill growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes.  Moderate numbers of pumpkinseed sampled.  Pumpkinseed had an average length of 5.1 inches with fish measured up to 7.8 inches.  Black crappie abundance (1.2 black crappie/trapnet) was at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Black crappie growth began to slow after age 4.Largemouth bass abundance (2.4 bass/trapnet) was just above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Largemouth bass growth rates were slightly slower than other area lakes.Two northern pike were sampled in the trapnets (0.4/net), similar to the catch rate in 1991.Other species sampled included moderate numbers of brown bullhead (1.4 brown bullhead/net) and low numbers of yellow perch and golden shiner.  Brown bullhead abundance was much higher in the 1991 survey (40.4 brown bullhead/net).</p>",

There is no public access on Ivan Lake. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Ivan is in lake class 33. Class 33 lakes are generally small lakes, have a very high percentage of littoral area (depths less than 15 feet), hard water, and a very regularly shaped shoreline. Other class 33 lakes in the Park Rapids area include:  Bass, Buck, Gulch 2, Ida, Ingram, Kane, Little Long, Morgan, Mud, and Star. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance was average compared to class 33 lakes, and past surveys of Ivan. Bass ranged from 6.5 to 15 inches in length, with an average size of 8.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nAngling opportunities for panfish include Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappies. Bluegill and Pumkinseed abundance was normal compared to lake class 33 lakes. Average size of Bluegills sampled was 5 inches with fish up to 9 inches, while Pumpkinseed had an average size of 6 inches with fish sampled up to 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was similar to past surveys of Ivan.  They ranged from 16 inches to 20.5 inches in length, with an average length of 18.5 inches and weight of 1.1 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Ivan. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat when leaving the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ivans Lake has not been mapped, therefore there is not enough available data to classify it according to Schupp's Classification System.  The population status is based soley on trapnet catches.The three northern pike sampled were small, averaging 1.27 lbs.  The two largemouth bass caught were also small, however, the sample numbers of these two species appear to be average for this area.  Pumpkinseed, bluegill and yellow perch abundances are low.  Bluegill PSD equals 0, indicating a very poor size distribution.  The black crappi population is the best in terms of numbers and sizes of all fish species in Ivans Lake.  Although sample size is small (N=11), the black crappie growth rates start out high, but gradually decline through age 6.  Mean length at age 3 is 6.65 inches.  Brown bullhead numbers (40.40/trapnet) are very high and may be detrimental to the other species.</p>",
