MEAN WEIGHT DECREASED FROM 2.43 LBS/FISH IN 1986 TO 2.25 LBS/FISH IN 1991.  AGES II,III,VI,VII,AND VIII+ WERE OBSERVED IN THE SAMPLE WITH THE MAJORITY (74%) AGE II. GROWTH OF AGE II WAS FAST AND ALL OTHER AGE CLASSES NORMAL WHEN COMPARED TO STATEWIDE MEANS. LENGTHS OF NOP RANGED FROM 17.0 TO 33.9 INCHES WITH THE MAJORITY (74%) OF THE FISH UNDER 22 INCHES.  YEP GILLNET CATCHES WERE AVERAGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS AT 41.50/SET IN 1991.  (1986  5.50/SET) YEP LENGTHS RANGED FROM 5.0 INCHES TO 9.4 INCHES WITH THE MAJORITY (74%) BETWEEN 5 AND 6 INCHES. AGES II THROUGH V WERE PRESENT IN THE AGED SUBSAMPLE WITH AGES II AND III DOMINATING (83%). GROWTH FOR ALL AGE CLASSES WAS NORMAL WHEN COMPARED TO STATEWIDE MEANS, HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE ABUNDANCE OF AGE II AND III INDIVIDUALS, AVERAGE SIZE WAS BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE AND THUS SMALLER THAN OTHER LAKES IN THIS CLASS.  BLG AND BLC TRAPNET CATCHES (0.25/SET FOR BOTH) WERE BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE RANGE INDICATING A LOW POPULATION STATUS.  ONLY THREE BLG AND TWO BLC WERE CAPTURED IN THE COMBINED GEAR.  BLB AND PMK NUMBERS WERE AVERAGE BUT SIZES WERE SMALL FOR THIS LAKE CLASS TYPE.  BOF TRAPNET CATCHES WERE AVERAGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS.  SIZE, HOWEVER, WAS ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE INDICATING THAT FISH FROM PELKEY LAKE ARE LARGER THAN FISH FROM OTHER LAKES IN THIS CLASS.  THE WTS GILLNET CATCH DECREASED FROM 33.50/SET IN 1986 TO 19.50/SET IN 1991.  THIS, HOWEVER, IS STILL ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE RANGE INDICATING A HIGH POPULATION.
