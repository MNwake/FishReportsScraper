                "narrative": "<p>Susan is a 300 acre, Class 16 lake, located 7 miles southeast of Orr, MN. Maximum depth is listed as 10.0 feet, however, a maximum of 7.0 feet was found during this investigation.  The Susan Lake shoreline is a mixture of rock outcrops and low, either bog or black spruce dominated, vegetation types. Susan Lake is strongly bog-stained and secchi visibility was 4.0 feet on August 15, 2005 indicating poor water clarity.  Previous investigations have indicated that Susan Lake has low fertility. The outlet flows into Elbow Lake and forms the headwaters of the Elbow River.  There are seven islands on the lake, some of which are weakly connected to mainland by bog. A State owned carry-in access exists on the south shore. Parking is limited.  All other access to the lake is private. Six fish species were caught during the 2005 fisheries assessment on Susan Lake.  Yellow perch was the most common species in the catch followed by walleye.The abundance of walleye (4.17/net) in 2005 was less than that recorded during the previous assessment in 1996 (9.50/net), but was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes in the same class as Susan.  Walleye sizes ranged from 8.3 to 21.9 inches during this investigation.  The average length in 2005 of 14.1 inches (1.1 pounds) was less than the 16.1 inches (1.7 pounds) recorded in 1996. Three year old walleye (2002 year-class) were the most abundant in the 2005 catch and averaged 13.4 inches. Twenty-eight percent of the catch were over 17 inches in length. Walleye growth was average when compared to other lake in the International Falls Management Area (IFMA). Yellow perch abundance (23.0/net) in 2005 was high exceeding the abundance recorded in two of the previous three investigations on Susan Lake. Abundance in 2005 also fell within the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Yellow perch size structure also was exceptional.  Lengths of captured perch averaged 9.50 inches (0.51 pounds). The largest individual was 13.4 inches in length and weighed 1.16 pounds. Sixty-four percent of the perch captured were over nine inches in length.  Yellow perch growth rates were some of the fastest recorded in the IFMA.Northern pike abundance (2.00/net) was below average for Susan Lake and other Class 16 lakes.  As in past investigations, the pike catch consisted of small individuals.  Lengths of captured northern pike ranged from 11.5 to 25.9 inches with an average of 17.8 inches.  The average weight for captured northern pike (1.32 pounds) was below average for this lake class (1.86 pounds).  Elbow Lake northern pike growth ranked in bottom 10% for the IFMA.Other species captured during the 2005 investigations included black crappie (0.70/net), bluegill (0.40/net) and pumpkinseed (1.30/net).  Sizes of black crappie ranged from 10.0 to 11.7 inches and averaged 11.0 inches. Abundance in 2005 of black crappie was lower than all previous investigations of Susan Lake.  Growth of Susan Lake black crappie was fast.  This investigation was the first to report bluegill from Susan Lake.  Their origin is unknown although Elbow Lake has bluegill present. Unlike the previous three investigations, no white sucker were captured in Susan Lake during the 2005 survey.</p>",

Walleye recruitment appears limited but adequate for this lake.  Abundance is normal to high for this lake type.  The high proportion of older fish and the large average size of 16.3\" suggest that the population is healthy and that fishing has had little impact on the size structure.     Northern pike, which are native to this lake, do not seem as successful as the walleye.  Although the growth rates look about average, only one pike older than age 3 was sampled.  Because the population is so young, the average length was only 17.2\".  Based on previous assessments, small northern pike appear to be the norm in this lake.     Panfish are doing well in Susan Lake.  Yellow perch and black crappie both showed excellent growth.  Yellow perch averaged 9.7\", with 20% between 11\" and 13\".  The crappie tended to be young, but because of the fast growth, even 2 year olds were larger than 8\" by late August.  Pumkinseeds were also present.     A few white suckers were sampled, but numbers were low.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Susan is a 276 acre lake located approximately nine miles north of Cook, Minnesota.  Susan Lake is shallow and has a maximum depth of less than 10 feet.  The shoreline is a mixture of rock outcrops and bog.  <br> \n <br> \nSeveral species of panfish were captured during the survey.  A few Pumpkinseed were captured; Black Crappie and Bluegill were captured more frequently.  Black Crappie abundance and size were within the expected range for this lake type.  Length ranged from 7.5-11.1 inches with an average of 9.4.  Growth was similar to the area average.   Average weight for Black Crappie captured in the sample was 0.49 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Abundance measured in 2015 was above the level in the previous investigation (2005).  Length ranged from 7.0-9.2 inches with an average of 8.0.  Average weight was above the expected range for this lake type.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike is probably not the best choice when deciding what to fish for on Susan Lake.  Abundance was below the expected range and sizes were small.  Length ranged from 14.2-19.7 inches and the average weight was only a pound. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was slightly above the bottom of the expected range.  Fishing should continue to remain stable in the future.  Eight year-classes were present, recruitment was consistent, and several solid year-classes were observed.  Especially notable were the 2012 and 2013 year classes which represented 61 percent of the sample.  Total length ranged from 9.0-20.1 inches and the average was 14.1.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch is another choice for anglers visiting Susan Lake.  Abundance was at the top end of the expected range and sizes were impressive.  Total length ranged from 5.8-13.4 inches and average weight was 0.52 pounds, which was much greater than the top end (0.34 pounds) of the expected range for this lake type.  Twelve year-classes were present which should provide stable fishing in future years.   </p>",
