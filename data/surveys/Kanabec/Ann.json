                "narrative": "<p>Based on respective local medians the present fish population is as follows:  The walleye gillnet catch (1.00/set) has shown a real decline from the 1983 survey (3.56/set) to a historic low that is well below the local median (3.52/set).  The trapnet catch for walleyes (1.80/set), however, remains above the local median (0.62/set) as it previously has.  The walleye population has been the product of natural reproduction in the past.  Fingerling stocking in 1984 and 1985 has failed to produce year classes of sufficient size to distinguish them from natural reproduction.  The growth rate for walleyes appears to be considerably below average.  Slow growth is possibly responsible for the absence of large numbers in the gillnets of the walleye fingerlings stocked in 1984 and 1985, as they may not yet be susceptible to the gear.  Northern pike (4.44/set) have shown a real increase from 1983 (1.73/set) to a level above the local median (3.88/set) and far greater than any previous survey.  Northern pike growth rates appear near normal with good year class representation.  Yellow perch (19.22/set) have shown a real increase from 1983 (8.67/set) to a historically high level, but still below the local median (24.27/set).  The mean length of yellow perch is 6.0 inches.  Largemouth bass were not taken in test nets but 52 young of the year were recorded during shoreline seining.  The bluegill population (33.80/set) has apparently undergone a very large expansion since 1983 (9.22/set) to a level well above the local median (25.67/set).  The current level is far greater than any previous survey.  Over 1500 young of the year bluegills were recorded during shoreline seining.  Bluegills ranged in size from 2.5 inches to 9.4 inches with an excellent overall mean length of 7.0 inches.  Pumpkinseeds (6.80/set), also, increased significantly from the 1983 survey (0.83/set).  Black crappies (2.40/set) appear to have declined since 1983 (6.83/set) to a level far below the local median (18.45/set).  Black crappies have not been abundant since test netting in 1977 indicated a high of 38.60/set.  White suckers (8.44/set) remain consistent with previous surveys that were above the local median (2.61/set).  The black, yellow, and brown bullhead populations remain at low levels with the black bullhead (0.40/set), in particular, far below the local median (24.47/set).  Other species taken in test nets (bowfin, carp, channel catfish, freshwater drum, silver redhorse, shorthead redhorse, golden shiner, and hybrid sunfish) do not appear to have undergone significant increases or decreases nor do they appear to be substantially above or below local medians.  Although not specifically indicated by test net data, a large carp population is suspected and has been utilized by commercial fishermen in the past.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann Lake is a 653-acre lake located in Kanabec County managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike. The water level is maintained by a DNR dam on the north end of the lake. Lakeshore development is relatively light due largely to the wildlife management area on the southeast and northeast shores. Shallow water substrates are dominated by sand but water quality can be an issue. Like most shallow fertile lakes, Ann is subject to fairly heavy algae blooms in summer which limit water clarity. An additional concern is curly-leaf pondweed densities in late spring and early summer. There is currently only one public boat access on the lake with limited parking. Although natural Walleye reproduction occurs, the lake is stocked with Walleye fry in even numbered years. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the fishing on Ann Lake for many species should be good, with opportunities to catch Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, and Channel Catfish. The 2021 Walleye catch of 1.9/gill net was slightly below the long-term average on the lake, but the average fish sampled was 17.8 inches, about two inches longer than the long term average. Northern Pike populations tend to be low but the size range of 20-31 inches sampled in 2021 should provide harvest opportunities below and above the north central pike zone protected slot (22-26 inches).  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers vary from year to year, but the 2021 gill net catch rate was the highest recorded for Ann Lake. Lengths ranged from 4.5 to 11 inches. Bluegill numbers remained within the average for this lake type, with a good average length of 7.1 inches and fish up to 9 inches present.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch rate was 30.5 per hour in 2021, similar to 31.7 per hour caught in 2015.  Mean length was 11.3 inches with a range of 5.4 to 16.2 inches. As an added bonus for anglers, the Channel Catfish population appears to be near an all-time high based on historical information. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann Lake is a 653 acre lake located in Kanabec County that has been assigned to lake class 35.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondly for northern pike, bluegill sunfish, largemouth bass and black crappie.Historically, Ann Lake had a surface area of 367 acres.  After a sheet piling dam was constructed during 1965 in the outlet area of the Ann River, the surface area increased to 653 acres as a result of a four foot water level increase.  Consequently, additional habitat, primarily suitable for largemouth bass and sunfish, was created.  Lake water levels during the 1998 survey were at what is considered to be a normal summer level since the construction of the dam.In response to the United States District Court decision, which upheld the hunting and fishing rights of several bands of Chippewa Indians within the 1837 ceded territory, creel surveys and special regulations have been and will continue to be utilized on lakes that are likely to undergo spearing or netting by the bands to monitor non-band fish harvest and to ensure that the safe harvest level (harvestable surplus) is not exceeded.  The safe harvest level is the level at which enough walleye reach maturity to maintain the longterm health and productivity of a fish population.  The combined catch of band and non-band anglers will not be allowed to exceed the safe harvest level.  Currently (as of 03/25/1999), Ann Lake has a 16-24 inch protected slot that was put into place during the Spring of 1998 to ensure that the safe harvest level is not exceeded.  Future regulations may by continued, discontinued, or modified based on the percentage of the harvestable surplus the bands declare that year, which can be anywhere from 0-50% and the projected non-band angler harvest.  Projected non-band angler harvest is the amount of harvest by non-band anglers that is predicted for the upcoming season, which is determined from previous angler (creel) surveys.  During the summers of 1996, 1997, and 1998 and the winters of 1996/97, 1997/98 and 1997/98 angler surveys (creel surveys) were conducted on Ann Lake to estimate the fishing effort and total harvest by non-band anglers.  During the open water season (May 5-September 30) of 1996, non-band fishing effort was estimated at 43.1 hours/acre.  Non-band total harvest by species was also estimated and was as follows: northern pike-3576 pounds, walleye-1556 pounds, bluegill sunfish-748 pounds, black crappie-384 pounds, and largemouth bass-275 pounds.  The most sought after species during this open water season was walleye and northern pike followed by crappie, sunfish and largemouth bass.  The open water season of 1997 survey, which extended from May 10 to September 30, found a lower effort/acre (30.5 hours/acre) estimate than 1996.  Total harvest by species was calculated to be 2,107 lbs. of northern pike, 1,882 lbs. of crappie, 1,414 lbs. of sunfish, 966 lbs. of walleye, and 183 lbs. of largemouth bass.  The primary species fished for by anglers were crappie, northern pike, sunfish, and walleye followed by largemouth bass.  From May 9 to September 30, 1998, the estimate for open water fishing effort was 29.0 hours/acre, which differs slightly from the 1997 effort of 30.5 hours/acre.  Total pounds of each species harvested were determined to be as follows: crappie-3,071, northern pike-1,507, sunfish-676, largemouth bass-210, and walleye-178.  Crappie were the most sought after species followed by (in descending order) walleye, northern pike, sunfish, and largemouth bass.  The winter of 1996/97 suvey (Dec. 2-March 26) reported 21.2 hours/acre of fishing effort and a total harvest by species of 2,284 lbs. of crappie, 1,585 lbs. of sunfish, 429 lbs. of northern pike, 66 lbs. of walleye, and 21 lbs. of largemouth bass.  Species that were most sought after during this winter season were crappie and sunfish followed by northern pike and walleye.  Currently, creel summaries for winter surveys conducted in 1997/98 and 1998/99 have not been formally compiled.  The band harvest from Ann Lake has been zero fish (as of 12/31/1998) since their hunting and fishing rights were upheld.Fish stocking in Ann Lake dates back to 1913 and consisted of sporatic stocking of such species as northern pike, crappie, sunfish, and bass.  Northern pike were last stocked in 1989, crappie in 1967, sunfish in 1960, and bass in 1945.  Walleye stocking has been on an alternate year basis since 1996.  Preceeding 1996, walleye stocking was sporatic from 1946 to 1987 and annual from 1987 to 1992, which were the years (1988-1992) when the Ann River inlet was a walleye egg collecting site for the MN DNR.A standard lake survey was conducted during the week of June 22, 1998 to evaluate the current status of the fish population, the physical, chemical, and biological factors concerning habitat, and the water quality.  Evaluation of the fish population utilized spring night electrofishing, nine gill nets, nine trap nets, and four shoreline seine hauls.  The selected gear types were chosen based on guidelines obtained from the MN DNR Manual of Instructions for Lake Survey.  Habitat and water quality data were also collected based on guidelines from this manual.Walleye abundance along with the average weight (1.4 lbs.) were typical of normal for this type of lake.  The current catch rate remains consistent with the 1993 catch rate.  Measured walleye ranged from 7.2 to 21.5 inches with an average length of 15.3 inches.  Ann Lake walleye growth was within a normal range when compared to statewide averages for walleye at each age.  According to historical records, Ann Lake natural walleye reproduction in some years has been the major contributor to year class strength while stocked walleye have contributed some supplemental fish to the natural population.  The presence of strong year classes during non-stocked years determined from the 1998 survey and several years of fall electrofishing for age 0 walleye again indicates that Ann Lake natural walleye reproduction has been a major contributor to year class strength.Numbers of northern pike were below normal for this type of lake, but the average weight, at 2.4 pounds, was above normal.  Measured northern pike ranged in length from 20.3 to 29.5 inches with an average length of 23.2 inches.  Growth was determined to be at a normal level when compared to statewide averages at each age.Nighttime spring electrofishing was utilized for largemouth bass sampling on May 27, 1998.  Four electrofishing stations sampled shoal water areas suitable for spawning largemouth.  A catch rate of 3.7 fish/hour was calculated and found to be down from the 1993 catch of 13.2 fish/hour.  Since catch rate averages for this gear type by lake class have not been formally developed, comparisons were not made.  However, this catch rate appears to be low.  Because most of the largemouth sampled were not identifiable by gender and appeared to be done spawning, lower catch rates in 1998 may have been a result of the early spring in 1998 which caused water temperatures to warm earlier and potentially produce an earlier spawn.  Consequently, some bass may have completed spawning and moved out of the shoal water area before electrofishing was conducted.The abundance of bluegill sunfish was within a normal range while the average weight, at 0.5 pounds, was found to be well above normal for this lake type.  The average weight calculated in 1998 was the highest ever recorded.  Bluegill sunfish lengths extended from 3.1 to 10.2 inches with an average length of 7.8 inches.  When the 1998 average bluegill growth at each age was compared to statewide averages from similar lakes, Ann Lake bluegill growth was above average.Black crappie numbers were found to be above normal for lakes of this type while the average weight, at 0.4 pounds, was within a normal range.  The 1998 catch rate along with the average weight were the highest recorded since 1977.  Crappie total lengths ranged from 3.8 to 10.9 inches with a mean length of 8.9 inches.  Black crappie growth was representative of normal when compared to statewide averages.During the 1998 survey, three channel catfish were sampled with an average weight of 10.9 pounds.  Catfish lengths extended from 28.9 to 29.9 inches.Yellow perch abundance along with the average weight were within  a normal range for lakes of this class.  The current catch remains consistent with historical records dating back to 1987.  Sampled perch lengths ranged from 5.2 to 9.0 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches.On August 25, 1998, four shoreline seine hauls sampled shoal water areas for age 0 fish.  Young of the year bluegill sunfish, largemouth bass, white sucker, and yellow perch showed good reproductive success while black crappie and northern pike showed some natural reproduction.In addition to the above species, the fish composition of Ann Lake also consisted of black, brown, and yellow bullhead, dogfish, common carp, freshwater drum, golden redhorse, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, Johnny darter, logperch, tadpole madtom, and various minnow species (emerald shiner, fathead minnow, golden shiner and hornyhead chub).  Black, brown and yellow bullhead, common carp, and freshwater drum abundance were below normal while dogfish and pumpkinseed sunfish numbers were within a normal range.  Moreover, white sucker abundance was determined to be above normal for lakes of this type.</p>",

The walleye was slightly low in the gillnet catch but is high in the trapnet.  All walleyes are from natural reproduction.  The white sucker was high at 6.89 while the yellow perch was low at 5.33 per set.  The white and black crappie had very low population figures as did the freshwater drum.  The bowfin had an average population while the channel catfish was slightly low.  The bluegill, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish all had low populations as did the carp and yellow bullhead.  The largemouth bass was absent in the net catches but did show up well in the shoreline seining results.  Note:  Carp figures are misleading as they do appear to be numerous as observed by sonar during winter scanning for removal work.</p>",

As has been its history in Ann Lake, the northern pike was low at 1.78 per set with an average weight of 3.0 pounds.  The walleye was average at 3.56 per set in the gillnet and high at 1.33 per set for the trapnet.  Average weight came to 1.54 pounds per fish.  Walleye population is from natural reproduction.  The panfish population of pumpkinseed and bluegill sunfish, white and black crappie had low median figures but were of a fair to good average size.  Representing the main forage species, the common sucker was high at 8.11 while the yellow perch was low at 8.67 per set.  The bowfin was slightly high at 1.00 per set while the channel catfish, black, brown and yellow bullhead, carp, golden shiner, freshwater drum, and northern redhorse all had low population figures.  The largemouth bass was well represented in the shoreline seining results.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  In June, 1990, a lake survey was conducted on Ann Lake.  To determine the status of the fish populations, nine gillnets and six trapnets were set and three shoreline stations were seined.  Based on the results of these efforts the status of the fish populations compared to previous surveys and to lakes of the same classification statewide are as follows: \n  The walleye net catch (1.11/set) was lower than the statewide median catch (1.87/set) and remained above the first quartile (1.00/set).  The 1990 walleye net catch was slightly higher than the net catch of the previous survey in 1987 (1.00/set).  The fourteen walleyes that were captured in the gillnets and trapnets measured 5.0 to 24.9 inches in total length with a median length group of 10.0 to 10.4 inches and an average weight of 1.19 pounds.  Age analysis determined that these fish ranged in age from one to nine years.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were typical for walleyes throughout the state, indicating average growth.  The walleye population in Ann Lake is composed of both natural and stocked fish.  A walleye egg take stations has been maintained on Ann River since 1989.\n  The northern pike net catch (1.89/set) was lower than the statewide median (6.50/set) and was below the first quartile (3.33/set).  The 1990 northern pike net catch was lower than the net catch of the previous survey (4.44/set).  This net catch indicated a real decrease in northern pike abundance from the previous survey but was within the range of values recorded in other previous surveys.  The 17 northern pike that were captured ranged in length from 18.0 to 29.9 inches with a median length group of 21.0 to 21.9 inches and an average weight of 3.00 pounds.  Age analysis determined that captured fish were from one to six years old with three-year-old fish being most abundant.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were typical for northern pike throughout the state, indicating average growth.  Northern pike are apparently self-sustaining in Ann Lake as indicated by rather consistent year classes without stocking. \n  The bluegill net catch (16.17/set) was higher than the statewide median (11.88/set) and remained below the third quartile (31.00/set).  The 1990 bluegill catch was lower than the net catch of the previous survey (33.80/set) but was consistent with other, previous surveys.  The bluegills ranged in length from 3.5 to 9.9 inches with a median length group of 6.5 to 6.9 inches and an average weight of 0.34 pounds.  Age analysis estimated that fish ranged in age from one to nine years with four and five-year old fish representing 65 percent of the catch.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were typical of bluegills throughout the state, indicating average growth.  Natural reproduction was evident from the abundance of young-of-the-year and juvenile bluegills in the seine catches. \n  The black crappie net catch (1.67/set) was below the statewide median (2.50/set) and was above the first quartile (0.80/set).  The 1990 black crappie catch was the lowest ever recorded for Ann Lake.  The black crappies ranged in length from 6.0 to 9.9 inches with a median length group of 6.5 to 6.9 inches and an average weight of 0.27 pounds.  Age analysis estimated that fish ranged in age from two to seven years with four year old fish representing 42 percent of the catch.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were lower than typical of black crappies throughout the state, indicating slow growth.  Natural reproduction in Ann Lake was evident from the presence of young-of-the-year and juveniles in seine catches. \n  The yellow perch net catch (22.56/set) was higher than the statewide median (10.00/set) and was below the third quartile (26.71/set).  The 1990 yellow perch catch was the highest ever recorded for Ann Lake.  The subsample of yellow perch that were measured (84 of 203 captured) ranged in length from 5.0 to 9.4 inches with a median length group of 7.5 to 7.9 inches and an average weight of 0.23 pounds. \n  Largemouth bass were not represented in the gillnet or trapnet catches.  Forty-two young-of-the -year largemouth bass were captured in seine hauls. \n  Eleven other species were captured in gillnets and trapnets during the survey (bowfin, common carp, white sucker, golden redhorse, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, channel catfish, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, freshwater drum).  Catch rates of these species, excluding bowfin, common carp, and freshwater drum, were slightly below their respective statewide medians.  Catch rates of common carp and freshwater drum were just above their respective statewide medians.  The bowfin catch rate (2.33/set) was higher than the statewide median (0.38/set), the third quartile (1.43/set), and was the highest ever recorded for Ann Lake.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  The fish population in Ann Lake is more typical to what might be expected in a reservoir rather than a lake.  The lake acreage nearly doubled following placement of the outlet dam in the mid 1960's.  This increase provided new habitat for fish species, primarily largemouth bass and panfish.  The original lake basin seems to be best suited for walleyes, northern pike, and perch, however, panfish are very abundant in this portion of the lake.  Walleye abundance in Ann Lake has remained average with most fish being 12 to 15 inches.  In 1992, the DNR trapped and released a 13 pound walleye during egg take operations.  Ann Lake has provided an attraction for walleye angling for many years.  The population is largely a result of natural reproduction in the lake and adjoining rivers/streams.  Northern pike abundance remains low compared to similar type lakes, however, the average length (22 inches) is fairly respectable.  Bluegill abundance has consistently stayed at normal levels over the years.  The average size is 7 inches with some up to 9.5 inches not uncommon.  Black crappies have also remained at normal levels compared to similar type lakes.  Most crappies are in the 8-9 inch range with some up to 11 inches.  Largemouth bass have historically been found in low numbers in Ann Lake.  The best habitat seems to be in the eastern portion of the lake where shallow water and vegetation are dominant.  Yellow perch abundance has remained at normal levels with average sizes of 8 inches.  Maximum lengths of 10.5 inches were recorded during this survey.  Carp abundance has been stable for several years.  Removal efforts by commercial fishermen is still practiced on an occasional basis.   Channel catfish have provided an exciting alternative for angling in Ann Lake.  They reach lengths over 30 inches and can weigh over 20 pounds.  This species is common throughout the Ann/Snake River system.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann is a 653 acre lake in Kanabec County managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  The water level is maintained by a Division of Fish and Wildlife, sheet piling dam on the north end of the lake.  Lake shore development is relatively light due largely to the wildlife management area on the southeast and northeast shores.  Shallow water substrates are dominated by sand but water quality can be an issue.  Like most shallow fertile lakes, Ann is subject to fairly heavy algae blooms in summer which limit water clarity.  An additional concern is curly leaf pondweed densities in late spring and early summer.  An aquatic plant management plan is now being developed.  There are two public boat accesses on the lake but parking is limited at both.  Although natural walleye reproduction likely accounts for a large part of the population, 600 pounds of walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year.  Ann Lake receives high fishing pressure at times especially when the panfish are biting in early spring, early fall and winter.  Anglers can expect quality sized bluegill and black crappie. Though their numbers are down a little since the 1998 survey, catch rates of both species were within the normal range when compared to similar lakes.  While few crappies over 10 inches were sampled, 78% of the catch exceeded 8 inches.  Bluegill ranged up to 9 inches with over half the sample 7.5 inches or larger.  The northern pike catch rate was similar to the 2000 gill netting and within the normal range for the lake class.  Northerns ranged from 11.9 to 37.2 inches but nearly half were between 20 and 23 inches.  Walleye abundance, though down from the 2000 sample, was typical of both the lake and the lake class.  Lengths ranged from 6.1 to 26 inches with a 14.7 inch and 1.4 pound average.  The yellow perch population continues to be high.  But with less than 10% exceeding 8 inches, perch function mostly as a forage base for walleye and northerns.  Other species present in the lake include black, brown, and yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), channel catfish, common carp, freshwater drum (sheepshead), white sucker, and pumpkinseed sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann is a 653 acre lake in Kanabec County managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike.  The water level is maintained by a Division of Fish and Wildlife sheet piling dam on the north end of the lake.  Lakeshore development is relatively light due largely to the wildlife management area on the southeast and northeast shores.  Shallow water substrates are dominated by sand but water quality can be an issue.  Like most shallow fertile lakes, Ann is subject to fairly heavy algae blooms in summer which limit water clarity.  An additional concern is curly-leaf pondweed densities in late spring and early summer.  There is currently only one public boat access on the lake with limited parking.  Although natural Walleye reproduction likely occurs, 300 pounds of Walleye fingerlings are stocked every fall.   <br> \n <br> \nAnn Lake receives high fishing pressure at times, especially when the panfish bite is hot.  Although the abundance of Black Crappie and Bluegill is normal compared to similar lakes, both have had higher catch rates in previous assessments.  Nonetheless, anglers can expect quality fishing for both species.  During the May netting crappies averaged 9.6 inches with fish over 12 inches present.  Bluegills ranged up to 10.6 inches with a third of the catch exceeding 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate increased compared to the 2010 assessment but remains below the normal range for the lake type.  Northerns ranged from 17.5 to 31.2 inches.  The bulk of the pike captured were young fish less than 23 inches in length.  Walleye abundance continues to trend downward despite the switch to annual fingerling stocking in 2010.  However, the catch rate is still typical for the lake class.  Lengths ranged from 9.3 to 23.3 inches with a 1.1 pound average.  Trends in both Walleye and Northern Pike abundance have closely followed that of the Yellow Perch population.  One fourth of the perch catch exceeded 8 inches in length, an acceptable size for some anglers.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann is a 653 acre lake in Kanabec County managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  The water level is maintained by a Division of Fish and Wildlife, sheet piling dam on the north end of the lake.  Lake shore development is relatively light due largely to the wildlife management area on the southeast and northeast shores.  Shallow water substrates are dominated by sand but water quality can be an issue.  Like most shallow fertile lakes, Ann is subject to fairly heavy algae blooms in summer which limit water clarity.  An additional concern is curly leaf pondweed densities in late spring and early summer.  There are two public boat accesses on the lake but parking is limited at both.  Although natural walleye reproduction likely occurs, 300 pounds of walleye fingerlings are stocked every fall.   <br> \n <br> \nAnn Lake receives high fishing pressure at times especially when the panfish bite is on.  Anglers can expect quality sized bluegill and black crappie.  Though their numbers have climbed only slightly since the 2005 sampling, catch rates of both species are within the normal range when compared to similar lakes.  Few crappies over 10 inches were sampled and only 17% of the catch exceeded 9 inches.  Bluegills ranged up to 9.7 inches, with over half exceeding 7.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate decreased since the 2000 gill netting and fell below the normal range for the first time since 1998.  Northerns ranged from 17.4 to 36.4 inches with over half the catch was larger than 24 inches.  Walleye abundance, though down from the 2005 sample, was typical of both the lake and the lake class.  Lengths ranged from 8.1 to 21.9 inches with a 1.01  pound average.  Trends in both walleye and northern pike abundance have closely followed that of the yellow perch population.  With relatively few individuals exceeding 8 inches, perch function mostly as a forage base for walleye and northerns.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in the lake include black, brown, and yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), channel catfish, common carp, freshwater drum (sheepshead), white sucker, and pumpkinseed sunfish.</p>",
