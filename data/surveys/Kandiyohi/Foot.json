                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted on Foot Lake during mid-July of 2014. Foot is a moderate sized (544 acres), multi basin, aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Foot Lake is part of the Hawk Creek Watershed. Foot Lake is located within the city limits of Willmar. A large city park is located along the east side of the lake. There are two distinct basins (northwest and southeast) bisected by a county road, but connected via several large culverts. Foot Lake has two public boat access sites with one site on each basin and two shore fishing piers on the north shore of the southeast basin near the two large culverts. The fishing piers are popular spots for catching walleye, northern pike and channel catfish in the lake. Foot Lake is also connected to Willmar Lake via an upstream navigable channel. Fish movement between the Foot Lake basins and Willmar Lake probably occurs frequently. The Foot Lake outlet is considered the headwaters of Hawk Creek, although there are several shallow lakes upstream of Foot Lake connected via ditches and inlets to Willmar Lake. Nutrient inputs into Foot Lake are from varied sources such as road runoff via Highway 23/71, storm sewer runoff from the city of Willmar, residential lawn runoff, fecal droppings from local Canada goose populations, and agricultural runoff primarily in the northwest basin. Shoalwater substrates were varied in both basins with sand, silt, muck, gravel, boulder, and rubble.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northwest basin is 6 feet deep maximum with moderate to abundant submergent vegetation (coontail, northern milfoil, water moss) and moderate water clarity. The southeast basin has a maximum depth of 24 feet with sparse submergent vegetation (sago pondweed) and poor water clarity (secchi=2.5 feet on July 14, 2014). Emergent vegetation (cattails, bulrush) is common near the Willmar Lake channel area and scattered throughout the near shore areas of the northwest basin. Blue-green algae blooms are common occurrences during the late summer months of most years. Water levels were high during June and July of 2014 from inlets due to rain events, but low by fall. A slow no-wake zone was put in place for lakes in Kandiyohi and Stearns Counties during June thru early July of 2014. Foot Lake has been a popular fishing lake for black crappie, walleye, northern pike, bluegill, channel catfish and largemouth bass in recent years.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers and average sizes were moderate in 2014 (16.00 fish/gillnet, 0.19 pounds and 7.14 inches). The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 7.14 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.18 pounds from gillnets. Moderate numbers of larger sized (8.00 plus inches) yellow perch (6.00 fish/gillnet) were caught in the gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low in 2014 (1.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 3.26 fish/gillnet. The 2014 northern pike average size was small (2.30 pounds and 22.19 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.54 pounds from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates were excellent. The largest northern pike captured was 33.8 inches from a trapnet.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2014 (4.00 fish/trapnet) and below the historical average (8.02 fish/trapnet) for Foot Lake. The 2014 bluegill average size was small (0.13 pounds and 5.40 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.26 pounds from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderately abundant in 2014 trapnets (8.67 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average of 5.93 fish/trapnet. The 2014 black crappie average size was moderate (0.28 pounds and 6.90 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.34 pounds from trapnets. Abundant numbers of small black crappie (12.50 fish/gillnet, 0.07 pounds average weight) were captured in the gillnets. Moderate numbers of larger sized (8.00 plus inches) black crappie (3.50 fish/trapnet) were captured in 2014. Black crappie growth rates were moderate to excellent. The largest black crappie captured was 11.6 inches from a trapnet in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2014 (2.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 5.43 fish/gillnet. However, walleye were abundant in connected Willmar Lake (14.00 fish/gillnet, 1.63 pounds average weight). The walleye average size was moderate (2.87 pounds and 18.86 inches) from Foot gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.76 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were excellent for ages 1-4. Walleye natural reproduction in Foot Lake is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Walleye fry have been stocked (250,000- 670,000 fish) in Foot every even year since 1982. Young of year \"YOY\" walleye due to fry stockings have been generally abundant in recent fall electrofishing surveys since 2008. Abundant numbers of YOY walleye were present in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey (216.00 YOY/hour, 5.59 inches average) due to the recent fry stocking (499,182 fish). <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2014 (26.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (137.26 fish/gillnet), but moderate compared to similar lakes. Low numbers of black bullhead were captured in the 2014 trapnets (0.67 fish/trapnet). The 2014 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.76 pounds and 10.90 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were moderate in 2014 (3.33 fish/trapnet) and similar to the historical average of 3.29 fish/trapnet. The 2014 carp average weight and length were moderate (5.62 pounds and 22.18 inches) from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater drum numbers were moderately abundant in 2014 (6.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (4.62 fish/gillnet). The freshwater drum average size was moderate (1.11 pounds and 13.12 inches) from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish were not captured in 2014 gillnets or trapnets. Channel catfish were last captured in 2009 gillnets (0.33 fish/gillnet, 15.35 inches average length). Channel catfish fingerlings (4,891 fish, 75 pounds) were last stocked into Foot in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Foot include protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species in Foot Lake will be surveyed again in the summer of 2019. <br> \n</p>",

Water clarity is generallypoor on Foot (secchi disk=2.7 ft on 6/12/95). Blue-green algae and sediment turbidity limitswater clarity and submergent vegetation growth. Foot Lake was dredged on a regular basis fromthe late 1960's up to the mid 1980's in the south bay adjacent to Robbin's Island. In 1933-34, both Willmar and Foot were mostly dry. Foot is connected to Willmar Lake via a boatchannel located along the northwest tip of Robbin's Island City Park. Fish movement betweenthe two lakes is a likely occurrence. A concrete dam outlet (Hawk Creek) and fish barrier wasconstructed in 1960 on the southwest shore of the northwest basin of Foot Lake. The HawkCreek headwaters starts at the Eagle Lake outlet dam and flows through Swan Lake, Willmar,the southeast basin of Foot, and into the northwest basin of Foot. There are manyintermittent culverts and tiles that drain (i.e. nutrient runoff, road salt, etc.) into thelake from the city of Willmar, Robbin's Island Park, several small marsh areas, and Highway23/71. Nutrient runoff sources are primarily from municipal/residential (lawns, storm sewer)and agricultural. An aeration (6 helixors) system was first installed in the winter of 1982-83 and operated to the present on Foot Lake (southeast basin, mid lake) to preventwinterkill. A pump and baffle aerator was installed (north shore) and operated on WillmarLake during the 1987-88 winter through 1992-93. A 6-unit helixor system (north shore)replaced the pump and baffle system during the 1993-94 winter to the present on Willmar Lake.Winterkill was a common occurrence in Foot prior to 1982. A partial winterkill occurred onWillmar Lake in 1989 due to a mechanical failure of the pump and baffle aeration system.Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail) was moderate to sparse throughout theadjacent shoreline areas of the both basins of Foot, but common near the bay areas (WillmarInlet, marsh inlets areas). Emergent vegetation (cattail, bulrush) was reported as limitedalong the majority of the shoreline in a 1952 minnow survey report. Submergent vegetation wassparse (Willmar Inlet Bay adjacent to Robbin's Island, NW and NE bay areas of NW basin) toabsent around the majority of the shoreline areas. The most common submergent species wassago pondweed. The 1952 survey indicated that submergent vegetation (sago pondweed, coontail,northern watermilfoil) was moderate to abundant. Filamentous algae can become moderate toabundant on the shoalwater substrates. The shoalwater substrates are mostly silt, sand,detritus, silt, gravel, and marl. Boulder and rubble areas are limited to the west shorejetty of Robbin's Island and the radio station point of the southeast basin, countyfairgrounds shoreline of the northwest basin. There are 51 homes/cabins, several businesses,a county fairgrounds, a radio station, a state hospital (across Highway 23/71), a golf course(north of Willmar Lake), and several city parks (i.e. Robbin's Island City Park). The 1952(seining) minnow survey indicated that yellow perch, white sucker, carp, spottail shiners,brook sticklebacks, brassy minnows, and fathead minnows were abundant within the lake. Inaddition, bullheads were present in moderate numbers in 1952. Gamefish were limited due tofrequent winterkill conditions. Presently, Foot and Willmar Lakes are managed for walleye asprimary species and black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, channel catfish, and yellow perchas secondary species. Walleye fry were first stocked into Willmar during 1986 (328,000 fish)and Foot Lake during 1981 (106,500). Walleye fry are currently scheduled to be stocked (about600,000 fry for Foot and 400,000 for Willmar) every even year or the following year after onedocumented unsuccessful spring fry stocking as determined by fall electrofishing. Presently,walleye numbers are abundant and angling success has been good during recent years. Footreceives moderate to heavy angling pressure, especially from shore anglers along the jetties,culverts/inlets, and park areas.     Walleye abundance in 1995 (9.0 fish/gillnet) from Foot was within the normal range (3.2- 15.3 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but above the historical average (7.6 fish/gillnet).Willmar Lake walleye abundance was 35.0 fish/gillnet (average size=1.2 lbs). An importantforage species for walleye, black bullhead, has decreased substantially in recent years. TheFoot Lake average size in 1995 (0.7 lbs from gillnets) was similar to the historical average(0.8 lbs). The largest walleye caught from Foot was 21.5 inches. Growth rates appear good toexcellent for ages II-VI, but poor for age I. There appears to be good walleye numbers froma 1994 year class. Large numbers of walleye young of year \"YOY\" were documented in 1994 fromboth Foot (516.0 YOY/hour) and Willmar (528.0 YOY/hour), but no or few YOY were documentedin 1995 from Foot (0.0 YOY/hour) and Willmar (12.0 YOY/hour, natural reproduction). Theaverage YOY sizes were small from Foot (4.8 inches) and Willmar (4.6 inches) in 1994. The1994 year class may have been the result of a fry stocking (Foot=665,880 fry andWillmar=716,000 fry in 1994) and/or natural reproduction. The 1995 fall electrofishing surveyindicated an abundance of 231.0 YRL/hour (1994 year class) remaining in Foot Lake (about 44%of 1994 fall abundance). The 1995 fall electrofishing survey abundance in Willmar Lake was126.0 YRL/hour with an estimated survival of 24% from the previous fall. The average size ofyearling fish caught during the fall 1995 electrofishing survey from Foot and Willmar wassmall (Foot=7.4 inches, Willmar=8.7 inches). About 70% (33 fish) of the summer walleye netcatch (range=6.0 - 9.5 inches) from Foot and 64% (102 fish) from Willmar belonged to the 1994year class.      Northern pike abundance in 1995 (2.0 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (1.2 -7.8 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and comparable to the historical average (1.9fish/gillnet). The 1995 catch rate from Willmar Lake was 2.3 fish/gillnet (average size=4.8lbs). The 1995 average length (23.1 inches gillnets and trapnets) from Foot was similar tothe historical average (23.0 inches). The average weight was 2.6 lbs (gillnets) in 1995. Thelargest northern pike caught in Foot was 27.1 inches. Growth rates appear good. All of thenorthern pike captured from Foot and 91% from Willmar belonged to the 1993 or 1992 yearclasses. There were no northern pike YOY captured during the 1994 and 1995 fallelectrofishing surveys.     Yellow perch abundance in 1995 (7.3 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.0 -22.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but above the historical average (2.6 fish/gillnet).The Willmar Lake abundance in 1995 was 1.0 fish/gillnet. The 1995 average size (5.9 inchesfrom gillnets and trapnets) from Foot was below the historical average (7.2 inches). Thelargest yellow perch caught from Foot was 8.5 inches. Growth rates appear good. About 64% ofthe fish captured from Foot and 67% from Willmar belonged to the 1994 year class. The 1995August seining survey documented 2.8 YOY fish/seine haul and 5.3 YOY fish/seine haul fromFoot and Willmar respectively.     Bluegill abundance in 1995 (8.7 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (1.0 - 14.9fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but above the historical average (4.3 fish/trapnet). TheWillmar Lake abundance was 3.2 fish/trapnet. The 1995 average size (6.4 inches from gillnetsand trapnets) from Foot was below the historical average (7.0 inches). Growth rates appearbelow average for age I and good for ages II-VII. YOY bluegill were documented during the1995 August seining survey from both Foot (14.0 fish/seine haul, average size=1.4 inches) andWillmar (21.5 YOY/seine haul). YOY orangespotted sunfish (20.0 fish/seine haul, averagesize=1.4 inches) and green sunfish (6.8 YOY/hour) were also captured from Foot during the1995 August seining survey.      Black crappie trapnet abundance (2.0 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (1.0 -12.3 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but slightly below the historical average (3.6fish/trapnet). The Willmar Lake abundance was 2.3 fish/trapnet in 1995. The 1995 average size(6.4 inches from gillnets and trapnets) from Foot was below the historical average (8.5inches). Growth rates appear average. About 44% of the fish caught were from the 1994 yearclass.     Largemouth bass were not captured during the spring electrofishing or during the summergillnet and trapnet survey from Foot or Willmar in 1995. One YOY largemouth bass (0.3YOY/seine haul, average size=2.6 inches) was caught from Foot and 1.8 YOY/seine haul (averagesize=3.9 inches) from Willmar during the 1995 August seining survey.     There were no channel catfish caught from Foot Lake in the 1995 summer survey nets.Although, the Willmar Lake abundance in 1995 was 1.0 fish/trapnet (average size=14.2 inches.The largest fish captured from Willmar was 22.1 inches. Channel catfish stockings include2,180 yearlings into Willmar and 3,320 yearlings into Foot during 1994. It appears thatchannel catfish may have initially moved into Foot and Willmar Lakes from Hawk Creek(connects to the Minnesota River).     Black bullhead abundance in 1995 (0.5 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (1.3 -78.1 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and the lowest recorded value for Foot Lake (historicalaverage=331.7 fish/trapnet). Black bullhead abundance was 860.7 fish/trapnet in 1984 and133.8 fish/trapnet in 1989. Black bullhead abundance in 1995 from Willmar Lake was 2.5fish/trapnet and has followed a similar abundance trend as Foot in recent years. The 1995average size (5.4 inches from gillnets and trapnets) from Foot was below the historicalaverage (6.4 inches). One YOY black bullhead was caught (0.3 YOY/seine haul) during the 1995August seining survey. Commercial fishermen removed 800 lbs in 1985, 100 lbs in 1988, and3400 lbs in 1990 from Foot Lake. Commercial fishermen removed 2,000 lbs in 1990, 4,100 lbsin 1991, 5,400 lbs in 1992, 200 lbs in 1994 from Willmar Lake. A combination of factorsprobably resulted in the black bullhead population decline which includes high predator fish(walleye) abundance during the late 1980's, high cormorant numbers within the local area, andcommercial removal. Black bullhead numbers throughout Kandiyohi County lakes havesignificantly declined in the last five years.     Freshwater drum gillnet abundance in 1995 (0.7 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range(3.6 - 24.2 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and below the historical average (4.4fish/gillnet). However, the freshwater drum trapnet abundance in 1995 (8.0 fish/trapnet) wasabove the normal range (0.4 - 4.0 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and above the historicalaverage (4.0 fish/trapnet). The 1995 Willmar Lake abundance was 19.7 fish/gillnet and 9.3fish/trapnet. There were no freshwater drum caught in Foot or Willmar during the 1984 survey.Freshwater drum was first documented in Foot during a 1966 seining survey (1 adult). The 1995average size (10.6 inches from gillnets and trapnets) from Foot was below the historicalaverage (11.9 inches). There were no YOY freshwater drum caught from Foot during the 1995August seining survey, but 18.0 YOY/seine haul were caught from Willmar. There were 4,000 lbsof freshwater drum removed by commercial fishermen during the 1995-96 winter from Foot, butonly 65 lbs were removed prior to 1995. Only 150 lbs of freshwater drum had been removedprior to 1996 from Willmar Lake.     Carp abundance in 1995 (7.0 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (0.7 - 5.1fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and above the historical average (5.3 fish/trapnet). TheWillmar Lake abundance was 5.5 fish/trapnet in 1995. The 1995 average size from Foot was 4.4lbs from trapnets (historical average=2.5 lbs). In the 1995-96 winter, commercial fishermenremoved 32,200 lbs of carp from Foot and 63,000 lbs from Willmar.     Bigmouth buffalo abundance in 1995 (0.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (0.3 -6.1 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and comparable to the historical average (0.6fish/gillnet). The Willmar abundance was 3.3 fish/gillnet in 1995. The 1995 average size(18.0 inches) from Foot was above the historical average (13.8 inches). The largest bigmouthbuffalo caught in Foot Lake was 18.7 inches. There were 0.3 YOY bigmouth buffalo caught perseine haul during the 1995 August seining survey. Commercial fishermen removed 28,800 lbs ofbigmouth buffalo from Foot and 25,400 lbs from Willmar during the 1995-96 winter.     White sucker abundance in 1995 (0.7 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (0.8 - 5.9fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and below the historical average (1.3 fish/gillnet). TheWillmar abundance was 7.3 fish/gillnet. The 1995 average size (12.8 inches) from Foot wasbelow the historical average (14.0 inches).     Foot and Willmar are important fisheries (shore, boat) due to their proximity to thecity of Willmar (population size about 15,000). Recreational activities (boating, skiing,swimming) are low to moderate (mostly jet ski activity on Willmar, swimming in Foot) due inpart to the poor water quality and problems with high bacterial outbreaks at the Foot Lakeswimming beach several years ago. Both Foot and Willmar have undergone changes in the fishcommunity structure since the start of winter aeration in 1982 on Foot Lake. Walleye numbersare presently high to moderate in both lakes. Non-gamefish such as black bullhead (importantforage for walleye in some lakes) have steadily decreased since aeration was initiated.However, other non-gamefish such as carp have not declined, but these fish grow rapidly andmay be in a predator's \"window of opportunity\" for only a short period of time. The abundantcarp (non-native) numbers are probably increasing turbidity in the lake (stirring up thebottom during feeding), thus inhibiting submergent vegetation growth. Other non-gamefish suchas bigmouth buffalo (native planktivores/bottom feeders) appear abundant in Foot and Willmarbased on the large commercial harvest (54,200 lbs) in the 1995-96 winter. Bigmouth buffalo'svalue as a prey species, like carp, is limited to its first year. The abundance of yellowperch (important forage for walleye and northern pike) is low to moderate. Adult whitesuckers appear abundant (Willmar Lake) which may produce adequate numbers in a given year(YOY, YRL suckers) as forage for predators. Freshwater drum have become abundant within Footand Willmar Lakes during recent years. It appears that some shore anglers are utilizing thisfish resource, however, increasing numbers of freshwater drum may compete with walleye forlimited resources in the future. Walleye fry stocking which produces large numbers of smallfingerlings (< 5 inches) by the fall in shallow productive aerated lakes during some yearsmay also provide an important forage base for both northern pike and adult walleye when otherforage numbers are low. There appears to be natural reproduction occurring in Willmar/FootLakes (fall electrofishing, age distributions from summer survey catches), however it appearsto be relatively low during most years. Additional channel catfish stockings are presentlyon hold in order to evaluate the present population size and the occurrence of naturalreproduction within Foot and Willmar. Future management activities include monitoring fishpopulations through lake population assessments and electrofishing surveys, stocking walleyefry as needed, protecting emergent vegetation habitat from increasing development pressures,and encouraging the implementation of best management practices within the watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Foot is a moderate sized, shallow, aerated, and productive lake located in KandiyohiCounty. A six unit subsurface helixor aeration system is operated each winter in thesoutheast basin in order to prevent the winterkill of gamefish. The immediate watershed ismoderate in size and varied for land use (city of Willmar, wetlands, residential development,hardwood trees, agricultural row crops). There are 76 homes, Robbin's Island City Park, andthe Kandiyohi County Fairgrounds located along the Foot Lake shoreline. Foot Lake is composedof two distinct basins (NW & SE) connected by two large culverts and bisected by KandiyohiCounty Road #119. Foot Lake is also connected to Willmar Lake via a large inlet channel nearRobbin's Island Park. There are 16 small inlets entering the lake. Most of the small inletswere dry during the 2000 summer survey. Water levels were normal to low in Foot during 2000.The outlet is comprised of two concrete box culverts, a concrete fixed sill dam, and aswinging finger fish barrier. The outlet is the official start of Hawk Creek. The mostfrequently occurring submergent vegetation species were muskgrass, sago pondweed, andcoontail. Submergent and emergent stands (hardstem bulrush, cattails) were most frequentlyfound throughout the northwest basin of Foot Lake, and adjacent to the Willmar - Foot Lakechannel area of the southeast basin. Shoalwater substrates were mostly sand, gravel, andsilt. The water clarity was poor (3.5 feet secchi disc) on June 12, 2000 and July 17, 2000(2.50 feet secchi disc) for Foot Lake. Nutrient and chlorophyll levels were moderate to high(0.066 ppm total phosphorus, 29 ppb chlorophyll a) in Foot. Algae blooms are common in FootLake during the late summer months. Dissolved oxygen levels on July 17, 2000 were above 5 ppmfrom 0-6 feet of water depth.     Walleye numbers were moderately abundant in 2000 (8.67 fish/gillnet) and slightly abovethe historical average (7.83 fish/gillnet). The 2000 walleye average size was moderate (1.66lbs. and 16.07 inches, gillnets). The largest walleye captured was 26.65 inches from the 2000survey nets. The 1998 year class comprised 55% of the 2000 total walleye catch from summersurvey nets. Walleye growth rates were generally above normal in Foot compared to other arealakes. Foot Lake is stocked with walleye fry every even year. It appears that the 2000 springwalleye fry stocking was successful as measured by the 2000 fall electrofishing surveyresults (58.00 YOY/hour, 5.71 inches average size).     Black crappie were abundant in 2000 (11.33 fish/gillnet) and above the historicalaverage (3.83 fish/gillnet). The black crappie average length was small to moderate (7.31inches, gillnets and trapnets combined). The largest black crappie captured was 11.54 inchesin the 2000 survey nets. The 1999 year class comprised 47% of the 2000 total black crappiesurvey catch.     Yellow perch numbers were low in 2000 (2.33 fish/gillnet), but similar to the historicalaverage (2.50 fish/gillnet).  The 2000 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.15 lbs. and6.70 inches, gillnets).     Bluegill numbers were low in 2000 (3.00 fish/trapnet), but similar to the historicalaverage (3.96 fish/trapnet). The 2000 bluegill average size was small (0.09 lbs. and 4.39inches, trapnets). The 1999 year class comprised 71% of the 2000 total bluegill catch.      Freshwater drum were abundant in 2000 (11.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the historicalaverage (6.17 fish/gillnet). The 2000 freshwater drum average size was small (0.89 lbs. ,gillnets).     Black bullhead were moderately abundant in 2000 (54.67 fish/gillnet) but below thehistorical average (161.17 fish/gillnet). The 2000 black bullhead average size was moderateto large (0.54 lbs. and 9.84 inches, gillnets).     Other species captured in the 2000 survey nets included low numbers of channel catfish(0.67 fish/gillnet, 9.69 lbs. average weight), moderate numbers of carp (1.50 fish/trapnet,6.89 lbs. average weight), and low numbers of northern pike (0.33 fish/gillnet, 2.71 lbsaverage weight). Shortnose gar were also captured (0.5 fish/trapnet, 1.88 lbs. averageweight) in the 2000 survey nets.     Foot Lake receives moderate to heavy fishing pressure in the winter for walleye andblack crappie during most years. Summer fishing pressure is mostly from shore anglers.Although, some boat anglers also fish Foot, especially during the months of May-July.

                "narrative": "<p>A re-survey was conducted on Foot Lake during July of 2009. Foot is a moderate sized (694 acres), multi basin, aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Foot Lake is located within the city limits of Willmar. A large city park is located along the east side of the lake. There are two distinct basins (northwest and southeast) bisected by a county road, but connected via several large culverts. Foot Lake has two public boat access sites with one site on each basin and two shore fishing piers on the north shore of the southeast basin near the two large culverts. The fishing piers are popular spots for catching walleye in the lake. Foot Lake is also connected to Willmar Lake via an upstream navigable channel. Fish movement between the Foot Lake basins and Willmar Lake probably occurs frequently. The outlet dam is located along the west shore of the northwest basin. There are 27 inlets/tiles/gullies that enter Foot Lake. Nutrient inputs into Foot Lake are from varied sources such as road runoff via Highway 23/71, storm sewer runoff from the city of Willmar, residential lawn runoff, fecal droppings from local Canada goose populations, and agricultural runoff primarily in the northwest basin. Nutrient levels (total phosphorus=0.067 ppm, chlorophyll a=33.8 ppb) were moderate to high in the southeast basin on June 9, 2009. Shoalwater substrates were varied in both basins with sand, silt, muck, gravel, boulder, and rubble.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northwest basin is 6 feet deep maximum with moderate to abundant submergent vegetation (coontail, northern milfoil, water moss) and moderate water clarity. The southeast basin has a maximum depth of 24 feet with sparse submergent vegetation (sago pondweed) and poor water clarity (secchi=3.0 feet on 6/9/09). Emergent vegetation (cattails, bulrush) is common near the Willmar Lake channel area and scattered throughout the near shore areas of the northwest basin. Blue-green algae blooms are common occurrences during the late summer months of most years, but not during 2009 on Foot Lake. The 2009 summer was cooler with moderate rainfall around the Foot Lake vicinity. Foot Lake has been a popular fishing lake for black crappie, walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and largemouth bass in recent years. Walleye fry are generally stocked into Foot every other year. If a fry stocking is a failure, then the lake will generally be stocked again with fry the following spring.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were abundant in 2009 (9.33 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches, but moderate compared to similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 5.67 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. The 2009 yellow perch average size was small to moderate (0.15 pounds and 6.73 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.18 pounds from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. The 2007 yellow perch year class comprised 33% of the 2009 gillnet and trapnet catch. Young of year \"YOY\" yellow perch abundance was moderate (27.25 YOY/seine haul, 2.88 inches average length) in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2009 (5.33 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The northern pike historical catch rate is 3.56 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. The 2009 northern pike average size was moderate (2.91 pounds and 23.31 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.59 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality (21.00 inches and larger) size northern pike was high (4.00 fish/gillnet) in 2009. Northern pike growth rates for Foot Lake were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-2, but within the normal ranges ages 3-6. The 2004 northern pike year class comprised 37% of the 2009 re-survey northern pike catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2009 (8.67 fish/trapnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The bluegill historical catch rate is 8.69 fish/trapnet for Foot Lake. The 2009 bluegill average size was moderate (0.20 pounds and 6.03 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.28 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality (6.00 inches and larger) size bluegill was high (6.33 fish/trapnet) for Foot in 2009. Bluegill growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2006 bluegill year class comprised 47% of the 2009 trapnet bluegill catch. YOY bluegill were abundant (43.75 YOY/seine haul, 1.38 inches average length) in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderate in 2009 (6.83 fish/trapnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. Black crappie gillnet catch was moderate (3.33 fish/gillnet, 0.19 pounds average size) in 2009. The black crappie historical catch rates are 5.47 fish/trapnet and 4.83 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. The 2009 black crappie average size was moderate 0.32 pounds and 8.03 inches from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.35 pounds from trapnets. Black crappie growth rates were near the low end of the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2007 and 2006 black crappie year classes comprised 44% and 27% respectively of the 2009 black crappie gillnet and trapnet catch. YOY black crappie were abundant (64.00 YOY/seine haul, 2.49 inches average length) in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low to moderate in 2009 (4.33 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 6.00 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. Walleye were abundant in 2009 gillnets for connected Willmar Lake (24.67 fish/gillnet, 1.26 pounds average weight). The 2009 walleye average size was moderate to small (1.20 pounds and 13.66 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.57 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality (15.00 inches and larger) size walleye was low (1.67 fish/gillnet) in 2009. Walleye growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2006 and 2008 walleye year classes (fry stocked years) comprised 50% and 30% respectively of the 2009 walleye re-survey catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Foot Lake is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Abundant numbers of YOY walleye (fry stockings) were sampled in fall electrofishing surveys for 2006 (204.00 YOY/hour, 6.24 inches average length) and 2008 (472.00 YOY/hour, 5.94 inches average length). <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were abundant in 2009 (165.00 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes, but moderate compared to historical catches. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 155.72 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. The 2009 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.36 pounds and 8.61 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.28 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were low in 2009 (0.83 fish/trapnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 3.28 fish/trapnet for Foot Lake. The 2009 carp average size was moderate (4.92 pounds and 21.85 inches) from trapnets. The carp historical average weight is 4.09 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater drum numbers were moderate in 2009 (1.33 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches, but low compared to similar lakes. The freshwater drum historical average catch rate is 4.39 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. The 2009 trapnet catch rate was (2.67 fish/trapnet) also moderate compared to historical catches. The 2009 freshwater drum average size was large (2.53 pounds and 17.09 inches) from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance was low in the 2009 trapnets (0.17 fish/trapnet). YOY largemouth bass numbers (27.00 YOY/seine haul, 2.55 inches average length) were moderate in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Foot include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the county with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Foot fishery will be sampled in the 2014 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Foot Lake during September 18, 2018 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. Foot is a moderate sized (503 acres), multi basin, shallow, aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Foot Lake is located within the city limits of Willmar. There are two distinct basins (northwest and southeast) bisected by a county road, but connected via several large culverts. Foot Lake is also connected to Willmar Lake via an upstream navigable channel. Fish movement between the Foot Lake basins and Willmar Lake occurs frequently.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in both Foot and Willmar is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous surveys and the analysis. Walleye fry have been stocked (250,000 to 670,000 fry) into Foot Lake during even years since 1982. Walleye fry were recently stocked into Foot and Willmar during 2016-2018. Walleye fry are stocked in both Willmar and Foot during the same time and stocking successes or failures almost always mimic each other. <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers were captured in the 2018 (6.00 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches) and 2017 (12.00 YOY/hour, 7.0 inches average) Foot Lake fall night electrofishing surveys. No YOY Walleye were captured in the 2016 Foot Lake fall night electrofishing survey. Low or no YOY Walleye numbers were captured in connected Willmar Lake during 2018 (0.00 YOY/hour), 2017 (3.00 YOY/hour) and 2016 (12.00 YOY/hour). YOY Walleye numbers were abundant during fry stocked years in other Foot fall electrofishing surveys of 2008 (472.00 YOY/hour, 5.94 inches average), 2010 (141.00 YOY/hour, 7.9 inches average) and 2014 (216.00 YOY/hour, 5.6 inches average). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were documented in Foot during 2012 (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.7 inches average). No yearling Walleye were captured in Foot or Willmar during the 2018, 2017 and 2016 fall night electrofishing surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nWe observed abundant numbers of YOY/adult Bluegill, YOY/adult Black Crappie, Bigmouth Buffalo, Freshwater Drum and shiners in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Adult Walleye abundance was low in Foot (2.00 fish/gillnet, 2.87 pounds and 18.9 inches), but high in connected Willmar Lake (14.00 fish/gillnet, 1.63 pounds and 15.6 inches) in the 2014 standard summer survey. <br> \n <br> \nFoot Lake will be surveyed for all fish species in the summer of 2020. Walleye fry will be stocked into Foot and Willmar during 2019. A fall night electrofishing survey will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment was conducted on Foot Lake during mid July of 2004. Foot is a moderate sized (694 acres), multi basin, aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Foot Lake is located within the city limits of Willmar. A large city park is located along the east side of the lake. There are two distinct basins (northwest and southeast) bisected by a road, but connected via several culverts. Foot Lake is also connected to Willmar Lake via an upstream shallow channel. Foot Lake has two public access sites with one site on each basin. The northwest basin is 6 feet deep maximum with abundant submergent vegetation (coontail, northern milfoil) and moderate water clarity. The southeast basin has a maximum depth of 24 feet with sparse submergent vegetation (sago pondweed) and poor water clarity (secchi=3.0 feet). Blue-green algae blooms are common occurrences during the late summer months on Foot Lake. The Foot Lake outlet is considered the headwaters of Hawk Creek, although there are several shallow lakes upstream connected via ditches and inlets to Willmar Lake. Foot Lake has been a popular fishing lake for black crappie, walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and largemouth bass in recent years. Walleye fry are generally stocked into Foot every other year. If a fry stocking is a failure, then the lake will generally be stocked again with fry the following spring. Walleye fingerling stocking is contingent upon two successive walleye fry stocking failures in Foot Lake.Yellow perch numbers were moderate in 2004 (14.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 4.93 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. The 2004 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.18 pounds and 7.13 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.19 pounds from gillnets. Northern pike numbers were abundant in 2004 (10.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical catch rate is 3.20 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. The 2004 northern pike average size was moderate (2.45 pounds and 22.01 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.51 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of northern pike 21.00 inches and larger was moderate (5.67 fish/gillnet) in the 2004 assessment. Northern pike growth rates for Foot Lake were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. The 2001 northern pike year class comprised 44% of the 2004 assessment northern pike catch. Bluegill numbers were abundant in 2004 (27.67 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical catch rate is 8.70 fish/trapnet for Foot Lake. The 2004 bluegill average size was moderate (0.23 pounds and 6.34 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.29 pounds from trapnets. Black crappie numbers were abundant in 2004 (8.17 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical catch rate is 5.20 fish/trapnet for Foot Lake. The 2004 black crappie average size was small (0.16 pounds and 6.20 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.35 pounds from trapnets. The 2003 black crappie year class comprised 59% of the 2004 black crappie assessment catch.Walleye numbers were low in 2004 (0.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The Foot Lake walleye historical catch rate is 6.33 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. The 2004 walleye average size was large (4.28 pounds and 22.68 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.65 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates for Foot Lake were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2000 walleye year class comprised 52% of the 2004 walleye assessment catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Foot Lake is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate a 2004 spring walleye fry stocking (494,712 fry). There were low to moderate young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (44.12 YOY/hour, 6.04 inches average length) captured in 2004. Other area walleye fry stocked lakes had generally low YOY walleye catch rates in 2004 fall electrofishing surveys. The Foot Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 158.69 YOY/hour and 5.67 inches respectively. Walleye fry have been stocked recently into Foot during 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002. The Foot Lake highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye occurred in 1994 (516.00 YOY/hour, 4.80 inches average length) for a fry stocked year.Black bullhead numbers were abundant in 2004 (124.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 153.87 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. The 2004 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.34 pounds and 8.30 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.26 pounds from gillnets.Carp numbers were moderate in 2004 (1.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 3.77 fish/trapnet for Foot Lake. The 2004 carp average size was moderate (5.37 pounds and 21.98 inches) from trapnets. The carp historical average weight is 3.93 pounds from trapnets.Freshwater drum numbers were low in 2004 (1.50 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The freshwater drum historical average catch rate is 3.27 fish/trapnet for Foot Lake. The 2004 freshwater drum average size was moderate (2.48 pounds and 17.23 inches) from trapnets.Current fish management activities on Foot include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the county with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Foot fishery will be sampled in the 2008 summer for all fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Foot Lake was conducted during August 30, 2017. Foot is a moderate sized (503 acres), multi basin, shallow, aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Foot Lake is located within the city limits of Willmar. There are two distinct basins (northwest and southeast) bisected by a county road, but connected via several large culverts. Foot Lake is also connected to Willmar Lake via an upstream navigable channel. Fish movement between the Foot Lake basins and Willmar Lake probably occurs frequently.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in both Foot and Willmar is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous surveys and historical data review. Walleye fry have been stocked (250,000 to 670,000 fry) into Foot Lake during even years since 1982. Walleye fry were last stocked into Foot (404,208 fry) and Willmar (402,090 fry) during 2017. Walleye fry are stocked in both Willmar and Foot during the same time and stocking successes or failures almost always mimic each other. <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers (12.00 YOY/hour, 7.01 inches average) were captured in the 2017 Foot Lake fall night electrofishing survey. No YOY Walleye were captured in the 2016 Foot Lake fall night electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in connected Willmar Lake during 2017 (3.00 YOY/hour, 6.14 inches average) and 2016 (12.00 YOY/hour, 6.94 inches average). YOY Walleye numbers were abundant during fry stocked years in other recent Foot fall electrofishing surveys of 2008 (472.00 YOY/hour, 5.94 inches average), 2010 (141.00 YOY/hour, 7.85 inches average) and 2014 (216.00 YOY/hour, 5.59 inches average). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were documented in Foot during 2012 (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.74 inches average). No yearling Walleye numbers were caught in the 2017 Foot Lake fall electrofishing survey. No yearling Walleye were captured in Foot or Willmar during the 2016 fall night electrofishing surveys. <br> \n <br> \nFoot Lake will be surveyed for all fish species in the summer of 2020. Walleye fry will be stocked into Foot and Willmar during 2018. A fall night electrofishing survey will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The survey was done with a boat set up with electrofishing equipment to evaluate fry stocking success in 2016. The electrofishing equipment puts electricity into the water and fish are attracted to the positive charge in the front of the boat.  We then net the fish and take lengths and weights to determine what condition the fish are in (etc.). Foot is a moderate sized (544 acres), multi basin, shallow, aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Foot Lake is located within the city limits of Willmar. There are two distinct basins (northwest and southeast) bisected by a county road, but connected via several large culverts. Foot Lake is also connected to Willmar Lake via an upstream navigable channel. Fish movement between the Foot Lake basins and Willmar Lake probably occurs frequently.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in both Foot and Willmar is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Walleye fry have been stocked (250,000 to 670,000 fry) into Foot Lake during even years since 1982. Walleye fry were last stocked into Foot (504,388 fry) and Willmar (333,629 fry) during 2016. <br> \n <br> \nNo YOY Walleye were captured in the 2016 Foot Lake fall night electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (12.0 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches) were captured in connected Willmar Lake during 2016. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant during fry stocked years in other recent Foot fall electrofishing surveys of 2008 (472.0 YOY/hour, 5.9 inches), 2010 (141.0 YOY/hour, 7.9 inches) and 2014 (216.0 YOY/hour, 5.6 inches). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were documented in Foot during 2012 (42.0 YOY/hour, 6.7 inches). No yearling Walleye were captured in Foot or Willmar during the 2016 fall night electrofishing surveys. <br> \n <br> \nFoot Lake will be surveyed for all fish species in the summer of 2019. Walleye fry will be stocked into Foot and Willmar during 2017. A fall night electrofishing survey will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on Foot Lake during late July of 2020. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).   <br> \n <br> \nFoot is a moderate sized (503 acres), multi basin, aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Foot is part of the Hawk Creek Watershed. Foot Lake is located within the city limits of Willmar. There are two distinct basins (northwest and southeast) bisected by a county road, but connected via several large culverts. A large city park \"Robbin's Island\" is located along the east side of the southeast basin. The Kandiyohi County Fairgrounds is located along the south shore of the northwest basin. Ridgewater College is located on the north shore of the northwest basin. There are 86 homes and several nearby apartment buildings (adjacent) on Foot Lake. There are two public boat access sites with one site on each basin, and one shore fishing pier on the north shore of the southeast basin near the two large culverts. The fishing pier is popular spot for catching Walleye, Northern Pike and Channel Catfish in the lake. Foot Lake is also connected to Willmar Lake via an upstream navigable channel. Fish movement between the Foot Lake basins and Willmar Lake occurs frequently. The Foot Lake outlet is considered the headwaters of Hawk Creek, although there are several shallow lakes upstream of Foot Lake connected via ditches and inlets to Willmar Lake. The outlet dam is located along the southwest shore of the northwest basin. There are 27 inlets/tiles that enter Foot Lake. Nutrient inputs into Foot Lake are from varied sources such as road runoff via Highway 23/71, storm sewer runoff from the city of Willmar, residential lawn runoff, fecal droppings from local Canada goose populations, and agricultural runoff primarily in the northwest basin. Nutrient levels are high in Foot. Shoalwater substrates were varied in both basins with sand, silt, muck, gravel, boulder, and rubble.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northwest basin is approximately 6 feet deep maximum, moderate to abundant submergent vegetation (coontail, northern milfoil, water moss) and moderate water clarity. The southeast basin has a maximum depth of 24 feet, sparse submergent vegetation (sago pondweed) and poor water clarity (secchi=1.0 feet on July 27, 2020). Emergent vegetation (cattails, bulrush) is common near the Willmar Lake channel area and scattered throughout the near shore areas of the northwest basin. Blue-green algae blooms are common occurrences during the late summer months of most years. Dissolved oxygen levels were low (<1.0 ppm) at depths greater than 15 feet. Water levels were low during 2020. Foot Lake has been a popular fishing lake for Black Crappie, Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Channel Catfish and Largemouth Bass in recent years.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were moderate in 2020 (9.33 fish/gillnet, 3.83 fish/trapnet). Black Crappie historical average catch rates are 1.85 fish/gillnet and 5.67 fish/trapnet for Foot Lake. The Black Crappie average sizes was moderate from gillnets (0.33 pounds, 8.12 inches) and trapnets (0.40 pounds and 8.81 inches). The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.34 pounds from both gillnets and trapnets. The largest Black Crappie captured was 10.83 inches. Black Crappie growth rates were fair for ages 1-5. The 2018 and 2016 year classes comprised 41% and 22% respectively of the 2020 Black Crappie catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2020 (23.67 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 9.98 fish/trapnet for Foot Lake. Abundant numbers of moderate sized Bluegill (5.00 fish/gillnet, 0.23 pounds average weight) were also captured in the 2020 gillnets. The 2020 Bluegill average size was moderate (0.16 pounds and 5.77 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.24 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.00 plus inches) Bluegill was high (12.00 fish/trapnet) in 2020. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were not captured in 2014 or 2020 survey nets. Channel Catfish were last captured in 2009 gillnets (0.33 fish/gillnet, 15.35 inches average length). Channel Catfish fingerlings (4,891 fish, 75 pounds) were last stocked into Foot during 2013. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were abundant in the 2020 gillnets (1.67 fish/gillnet). A spring electrofishing survey was not conducted for Largemouth Bass in 2020. The Largemouth Bass average weight was moderate (1.27 pounds) in 2020. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were moderate in 2020 (3.33 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 3.27 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. The 2020 Northern Pike average size was moderate (2.81 pounds and 23.06 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.58 pounds from gillnets. Northern Pike growth rates were fair for ages 1-5. The 2015 and 2014 year classes comprised 38% and 31% respectively of the 2020 Northern Pike catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Foot Lake in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate in 2020 (8.00 fish/gillnet). The Walleye historical average catch rate is 5.75 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. Walleye were moderately abundant and similar size in connected Willmar Lake (12.00 fish/gillnet, 2.02 pounds average weight). The 2020 Walleye average weight and length were 1.90 pounds and 16.79 inches from gillnets in Foot. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.77 pounds from gillnets. There were abundant Walleye of 15.00 plus inches (6.00 fish/gillnet) in 2020. Walleye growth rates were fair for ages 1-4, but slow for ages 5-8. The 2014 year class (fry stocked) comprised 57% of the 2020 Walleye catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Foot Lake is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Walleye fry have been generally stocked (250,000-670,000 fish per lake) during even years since 1982 in both Willmar and Foot. Recent Walleye stockings include 2019 (300,000 fry; 6,019 fingerlings, 521 pounds), 2018 (357,952 fry), 2017 (404,208 fry), 2016 (504,388 fry), 2014 (499,182 fry) and 2012 (527,482 fry). Young of year \"YOY\" Walleye (fry stockings) were last abundant in the 2014 fall electrofishing surveys for Foot (216.00 YOY/hour, 5.59 inches average length) and connected Willmar (192.00 YOY/hour, 5.63 inches). YOY Walleye abundance was low (15.00 YOY/hour or less) in 2016-2019 fall electrofishing surveys for both Foot and Willmar. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2020 (3.67 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 6.71 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. The 2020 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.13 pounds and 6.48 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.18 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (8.00 plus inches) Yellow Perch was low (0.67 fish/gillnet) in 2020.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2020 (1.00 fish/gillnet, 0.50 fish/trapnet). The Black Bullhead historical average catch rate is 120.23 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. The 2020 Black Bullhead average size was small (0.27 pounds and 7.56 inches) from gillnets. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.34 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers were low in 2020 (1.00 fish/trapnet). The Common Carp historical average catch rate is 3.00 fish/trapnet for Foot Lake. The 2020 Common Carp average size was large (7.41 pounds and 24.65 inches) from trapnets. The Common Carp historical average weight is 4.70 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum numbers were abundant in 2020 (16.33 fish/gillnet). The Freshwater Drum historical average catch rate is 6.08 fish/gillnet for Foot Lake. The 2020 Freshwater Drum average size was moderate (1.25 pounds and 13.98 inches) from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Foot include protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species in Foot Lake will be surveyed again in the summer of 2025. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Foot Lake during September 12, 2019 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. Foot is a moderate sized (503 acres), multi basin, shallow, aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Foot Lake is located within the city limits of Willmar. There are two distinct basins (northwest and southeast) bisected by a county road, but connected via several large culverts. Foot Lake is also connected to Willmar Lake via an upstream navigable channel. Fish movement between the Foot Lake basins and Willmar Lake occurs frequently.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in both Foot and Willmar is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous surveys. Walleye fry have been stocked (250,000 to 670,000 fry per lake) into Foot and Willmar generally during even years from 1982-2016. Walleye fry were recently stocked into Foot and Willmar during 2016-2019. Walleye fry are stocked in both Willmar and Foot during the same time and stocking successes or failures almost always mimic each other. Approximately 300,000 fry were stocked in each Foot and Willmar during 2019. <br> \n <br> \nNo YOY Walleye were captured in the 2019 Foot electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in the 2018 (6.00 YOY/hour, 6.89 inches) and 2017 (12.00 YOY/hour, 7.01 inches average) Foot Lake fall night electrofishing surveys. No YOY Walleye were captured in the 2016 Foot Lake fall night electrofishing survey. Low or no YOY Walleye numbers were captured in connected Willmar Lake during 2019 (15.00 YOY/hour, 7.28 inches), 2018 (0.00 YOY/hour), 2017 (3.00 YOY/hour, 6.14 inches average) and 2016 (12.00 YOY/hour, 6.94 inches average). YOY Walleye numbers were abundant during fry stocked years in other Foot fall electrofishing surveys of 2008 (472.00 YOY/hour, 5.94 inches average), 2010 (141.00 YOY/hour, 7.85 inches average) and 2014 (216.00 YOY/hour, 5.59 inches average). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were documented in Foot during 2012 (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.74 inches average). No yearling Walleye were captured in Foot or Willmar during the 2016-2019 fall night electrofishing surveys. Spicer Strain Walleye fingerlings were stocked into Foot (6,009 fish, 521 lbs.) and Willmar (7,963 fish, 668 lbs.) during the 2019 fall due to poor fry success from 2016-2019. <br> \n <br> \nWe observed abundant/moderate numbers of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Freshwater Drum and Common Carp in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. Adult Walleye abundance was low in Foot (2.00 fish/gillnet, 2.87 pounds and 18.86 inches), but high in connected Willmar Lake (14.00 fish/gillnet, 1.63 pounds and 15.63 inches) from the most recent 2014 standard summer survey. <br> \n <br> \nFoot Lake will be surveyed for all fish species in the summer of 2020. Walleye fry will be stocked into Foot and Willmar during 2021. A fall night electrofishing survey will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
