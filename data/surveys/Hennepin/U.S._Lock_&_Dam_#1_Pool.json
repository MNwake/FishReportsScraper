                "narrative": "<p>Pool 1 of the Mississippi River is a short, impounded reach beginning at the Lower St. Anthony Falls Lock & Dam (LSAF), extending 5.6 miles downstream to Lock & Dam #1 (LD1) between Minneapolis and St. Paul.  Commercial barge traffic through LD1 and LSAF virtually ceased following the permanent closure of the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock (USAF) in 2015 as there is no barge loading/unloading facilities within Pool 1 or the LSAF Pool.  Lockage through LD1 and LSAF is still possible on a limited basis and is largely limited to tour boats and smaller recreational and government vessels.  After the USAF lock was closed, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) initiated disposition studies to evaluate the fate and ownership of USAF, LSAF, and LD1 structures and property given the cessation of commercial barge traffic.  This Pool 1 fish survey was conducted to provide background information on species present, quality of the fishery, and compare to past surveys within Pool 1 and neighboring pools. <br> \n <br> \nAlmost 43% of the fish sampled by boat electrofishing were game species which included Smallmouth Bass, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Walleye, Flathead Catfish, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike.  Almost 87% of the game fish were Smallmouth Bass which is comparable to findings in the 2009 survey.  Catch per hour (CPH) for the four most abundant species sampled was 84.07 for Smallmouth Bass, 24.41 for Shorthead Redhorse, 23.73 for Highfin Carpsucker, and 18.31 for Common Carp. <br> \n <br> \nThe proportion of larger Smallmouth Bass increased from 2009 to 2022.  Proportional Size Distribution (PSD) increased from 33 to 60 and PSD14 increased from 10 to 20.  The two largest Smallmouth Bass sampled were both over 18 inches and 3 pounds.  The Smallmouth Bass fishery appears to be the best angling opportunity in Pool 1, has been improving, and is a dominant component of the fishery with a quality size structure.  Catch rates and size structure are better when compared to a 2008 Pool 2 survey as well.  This should not come as a surprise as the fishing pressure and harvest is extremely limited on Pool 1 with no public boat access available within the pool. <br> \n <br> \nMuch of the standard boat electrofishing sample that was not Smallmouth Bass consisted of various species in the sucker family such as Shorthead Redhorse, Highfin Carpsucker, Bigmouth Buffalo, and River Carpsucker, with lower numbers of River Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, Smallmouth Buffalo, and Quillback.  These eight sucker species accounted for just over 36% of the standard boat electrofishing sample.  The large size of Highfin Carpsuckers stood out as the average length was 15.96 inches with 24 (68.6%) measuring at least 17 inches.  While Common Carp were relatively common comprising about 8% of the fish sampled, they accounted for a far less percentage as compared to the 2009 Pool 1 (29.1%) and 2008 Pool 2 (16.8%) summer electrofishing surveys.  Improving water quality and limited spawning habitat are the likely contributing factors to lower Common Carp abundance. <br> \n <br> \nThis was the second time a targeted Flathead Catfish survey was conducted on Pool 1 utilizing low frequency (15 Hz) electrofishing and the first-time pectoral spines were removed to age the fish.  The 2022 survey was conducted in mid-June and collected 14 Flathead Catfish at a rate of 7.02 fish per hour.  As a comparison, Pool 2 surveys yielded 13.57 Flathead Catfish per hour in 2008 and 9.64 per hour in 2017.  Even though this survey improved upon the 2011 numbers, it was still disappointing as more and larger Flathead Catfish are known to inhabit Pool 1.  Thirteen of the 14 pectoral spines were able to be aged and ages ranged from 2-14 years old.  Length-at-age was comparable, and sometimes below average when compared to Flathead Catfish that have been aged in Pool 2 over the last 12 years.  The average length of the 14 Flathead Catfish sampled in this survey was 13.61 inches with the two largest being 19.65 inches, 3.2 pounds and 14 years old, and 19.88 inches, 3.14 pounds and only 6 years old. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets and variable mesh gill nets were used to supplement the electrofishing data.  Three trap nets caught 27 fish represented by seven species.  Six Black Crappie were collected and ranged from 5.12-11.61 inches and was the only additional fish species collected that was not observed electrofishing.  Ten Bluegill were collected which was four more than boat electrofishing sampled, although they were all relatively small, less than six inches.  Three gill net sets only sampled 22 fish and five species.  Seven Channel Catfish were sampled in the gill nets, which is one more than was sampled by electrofishing.  The two largest Channel Catfish were quality size measuring 25.67 and 33.27 inches long.  Three Walleyes were sampled in the gill nets and ranged from 11.81-13.58 inches.  The low catch in the gill nets is not surprising as there are few locations where nets can be set unaffected by the current.  Nets are set parallel to the river flow to reduce the effects of currents impacting the net set which also reduces the likelihood of fish encountering the net. <br> \n <br> \nNear-shore seining and backpack electrofishing were used to collect small fish species in near shore habitats that the other gears typically miss.  Seining collected 159 fish represented by six species plus one unidentified species.  About 66% of the fish collected seining were Bluntnose Minnows and 15.7% were Emerald Shiners.  Backpack electrofishing sampled 43 fish represented by seven species plus one unidentified species, with Bluntnose Minnows and Spotfin Shiners the two most common species sampled.  The seining and backpack electrofishing sampled five additional species not sampled with the other gears (Blackside Darter, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Silverside, Johnny Darter, and Orangespotted Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe fish assemblage within Pool 1 is comparable to other Mississippi River pools however, there are some noticeable differences.  The habitat within Pool 1 is not as diverse as lower pools as it is short, lacks backwater habitat, islands, and side channels.  Fish residing in Pool 1 must self-sustain within the 5.6 miles between dams.  Fish movement is restricted by the lock and dam system.  The only way for fish to pass upstream from Pool 2 is through the lock at LD1.  The reduced usage of that lock further restricts fish passage.  A fish telemetry study that started in 2013 has shown very limited movement past LD1.  Thirty-eight fish were implanted with transmitters in Pool 1 which included Common Carp, Flathead Catfish, Freshwater Drum, and Smallmouth Buffalo.  Much of the movement past LD1 was by fish leaving the pool never to return.  Not a single Gizzard Shad, Sauger, or White Bass were sampled in this survey and only one White Bass was sampled in the 2009 survey.  Those three species are common to abundant below LD1.  Freshwater Drum exist in Pool 1, but at much lower levels and smaller sizes when compared to the lower pools. <br> \n <br> \nThe sport fishery in Pool 1 is primarily Smallmouth Bass.  The catfish population is likely better than this survey indicates.  Self-sustaining Channel Catfish and Flathead Catfish populations exist with quality sizes present.  Low levels of Walleye, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike are present, but probably not at levels that would attract many anglers to specifically target them.  Nongame species that would provide recreational opportunities to anglers include Common Carp and redhorse species and what could likely be viewed as a trophy population of Highfin Carpsuckers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>US Lock & Dam # 1 Pool stretches for 6.3 miles upstream of US Lock & Dam # 1 (Ford Dam) to Lower Saint Anthony Falls Dam in downtown Minneapolis, covering 491 acres.  This entire section of Pool #1 is included in the US Army Corps of Engineers' 9-foot channel maintenance project.   Historically, the area below Saint Anthony Falls contained the only true gorge along the entire length of the Mississippi River.  Before US Lock & Dam # 1 Pool was created, the Mississippi River Gorge was a high gradient reach of rapids and riffles.  Bank walls towered nearly 100 feet.   Rock fell into the river as bluffs were eroded, creating reefs that served as additional fish habitat.  Today, the average depth of US Lock & Dam # 1 Pool is approximately 20 feet.     Construction of the Ford Dam in 1917, and subsequent reconstructions, combined with the building of both Upper and Lower Saint Anthony Falls Lock and Dam created the present day pool.   <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing during the 2009 population assessment resulted in the sampling of six gamefish species.  Smallmouth bass were the only gamefish sampled at every site.  Smallmouth bass in US Lock & Dam # 1 Pool averaged 9.3 inches and 0.48 pounds.  Few large smallmouth bass were sampled in this stretch of river.  Less than 5% of sampled fish were 15 inches or larger.  It is possible larger fish escaped sampling by seeking refuge in deep water.  Steeply sloping banks and depths in excess f 20 feet did not allow sampling of main channel structure.  Only shorelines were sampled in this section of the Mississippi River.      <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike was the second most common gamefish.  Only four pike were sampled.  Channel catfish, flathead catfish, green sunfish and white bass were also sampled.  All were sampled in abundance lower than that of northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nThirteen species of rough fish were sampled: bigmouth buffalo, bowfin, common carp, freshwater drum, highfin carpsucker, quillback, northern hogsucker, northern redhorse, river redhorse, smallmouth buffalo, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse and white sucker.  Common carp were the most abundant, followed by freshwater drum and quillback. <br> \n <br> \nCompared to the previous population assessment conducted in 1995, smallmouth bass abundance has increased significantly.  No walleye were sampled in 2009.  Special sampling is needed to better quantify walleye abundance in US Lock & Dam # 1 Pool.  The shoreline drops almost immediately into water too deep to allow for effective electrofishing.     <br> \n</p>",
