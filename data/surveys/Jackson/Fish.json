                "narrative": "<p>Fish is a 300-acre lake located southeast of Windom in Jackson County.  The lake has 3.4 miles of shoreline, has a maximum depth of 26.0 feet, and is a class 24 lake.  Fish Lake is one of only two lakes we manage for smallmouth bass.  The secchi disk reading on July 11, 2006 was 20+ feet.  It was determined that this reading was likely due to a whole lake copper sulphate treatment just prior to the assessment.  The lake is managed for smallmouth bass and walleye primarily while channel catfish, yellow perch, black crappie, and bluegill are managed secondarily.  Smallmouth bass spawning structures were placed in the lake in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population is similar to other lakes like Fish.  Catch rates were down a little from previous years.  High water clarity in 2006 may have contributed to the lower catch rate.  Lengths of walleye caught in gill nets ranged from 12 to 25 inches and averaged 14.5 inches.  Three year classes of walleye were observed during the assessment.  No fish were observed from the 2004 fry stocking.  This may be attributed to the fish being too small to be captured in the nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe smallmouth bass spring electrofishing catch rate was 18.0 fish per hour in 2006.  The electrofishing catch rates were 3.3 in 2002, 42.0 in 1998, and 18.4 fish per hour in 1994.  Smallmouth bass fingerlings were stocked in 1991 and 2003.  Lengths of smallmouth bass caught electrofishing ranged from 8.5 to just under 18 inches with an average length of just over 10 inches.  Age classes from 1998, 2002, and 2003 were observed during the assessment. <br> \n <br> \nThe channel catfish population is quite high especially considering the fact we have not stocked channel catfish since 1981.  Lengths of channel catfish caught in our gill nets ranged from 13 to 16 inches and averaged about 14 inches.  All fish aged in the assessment were age 11.  Channel catfish growth rates are very slow in Fish Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population is doing very well in Fish Lake.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 5 to 10.5 inches and averaged almost 8 inches.  Five successive age classes starting in 2001 were observed during the assessment, which indicates good natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead population is similar to other lakes like Fish.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in our trap nets ranged from 4 to 10 inches and averaged just under 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and black crappie numbers are fairly low in Fish Lake.  Numbers of bluegill and black crappie were down a bit from the previous assessment in 2002. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Fish Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMPs) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is located 2.5 miles southeast of Windom.  Fish lake is the deepest lake in the Windom management area with a maximum depth of 26 feet.  The lake is managed for walleye as the primary species with black crappie, bluegill, channel catfish, smallmouth bass and yellow perch as secondary species.Walleye numbers have increased for the last four assessments.  In 1998, walleye numbers were higher than 75% of  lakes similar to Fish Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 11.2 to 28.7 inches, and averaged 19.0 inches.  Management goals for the walleye population in Fish Lake were reached in 1998.  Walleye fishing should be good for the next couple of years.  However, as with any fishing, if the walleye have abundant prey to eat, it will make them more difficult to catch.Seven walleye year classes were identified by age analysis.  Two year old walleye represented 42% of the sample and these fish were a result of stocking walleye fry (fry are about a day old and the size of a mosquito larvae).  Walleye fry and fingerlings (fingerlings generally range from 5 to 9 inches) have successfully produced year classes.  If fry stockings continue to be successful, fingerling stocking may be discontinued to improve our cost effectiveness.  In 1990, no channel catfish were sampled.  However, the remnant adult channel catfish population produced a strong 1990 year class that resulted in 30 fish per net in 1994, which is very high.   Channel catfish numbers declined from 30 fish per net in 1994 to 10 fish per net in 1998.  In 1998, lengths of channel catfish ranged from 10.7 to 14.1 inches, with an average of 11.6 inches.  Growth for the 1990 year class is slow but these fish should provide some exciting fishing experiences once they get larger.Smallmouth bass are very rare to southwestern Minnesota.  Even more rare is a self-sustaining fishable population.  Spring electrofishing was conducted to sample smallmouth bass in 1998.  During one hour of electrofishing, 42 smallmouth bass were collected.  Smallmouth bass ranged from 3.9 to 17.8 inches, and averaged 9.9 inches.  Smallmouth bass from one to six years old were aged from scale samples.  No smallmouth bass were sampled from the fingerling stocking in 1991.  Smallmouth bass grew to about 11.0 inches in three years and 14.0 inches in four years.  The smallmouth bass population looked good in 1998.  Unfortunately, we do not know how much fishing pressure and harvest occurs on the population or how much it can withstand and still provide a quality fishing experience.Fish populations often fluctuate from year to year.  Spring weather conditions, water levels, and the other species in the lake all effect the success of a given year class.  In 1994, nearly all the panfish populations were high.  Unfortunately, these populations all declined from 1994 to 1998.  Black crappie and bluegill were the most effected panfish species during the four years.  However, there should be enough adults for the populations to bounce back.  Yellow perch numbers also declined since 1994, but were still higher than 75% of lakes similar to Fish Lake.  Yellow perch ranged from 5.8 to 9.3 inches, and averaged 7.8 inches.  Any increase in the available spawning and nursery habitat, such as vegetation and overhanging tree branches, should help to improve the panfish populations.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to improve the water quality of Fish Lake through watershed management.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these can be areas of concern, lakeshore property owners also contribute to water quality problems.  Some examples include putting in sand beaches, removing trees and vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Improved land use practices by everyone should insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 300-acre lake located southeast of Windom in Jackson County.  The lake has 3.4 miles of shoreline, has a maximum depth of 26.0 feet, and is a class 24 lake.  The lake is managed for smallmouth bass and walleye primarily while channel catfish, yellow perch, black crappie, and bluegill are managed secondarily.  Fish Lake is one of only two lakes the Windom Fisheries Management Area manages for smallmouth bass.  A fish population assessment was conducted with 3 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and day electrofishing (targeting bass) during the summer of 2015 from May (electrofishing) through July (netting).  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net and trap net catch rates in 2015 were 5.7 per gill net and 0.3 per trap net.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7 to 25 inches with an average length of 16 to 17 inches.  Seventy-three percent of Walleye caught in trap nets and gill nets were over 15 inches.  Six different ages of Walleye were sampled in 2015; fish from 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014.  Three of the 6 age groups were from non-stocked years (2007, 2011, and 2013) indicating some natural reproduction exists.  Stocking was continued in 2015 with 2,500 Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fingerlings in October.  Lower Mississippi strain fingerlings are genetically unique and may have a genetic advantage to spawn more regularly in conditions currently found in SW MN.  Stocking coupled with natural reproduction in Fish Lake should help to increase the abundance of Walleye in the lake and increase the number of smaller Walleye in the lake.  Having smaller Walleye in the lake will ultimately balance the population and help to increase future opportunities for successful fishing year after year.  The outlook for the 2016 ice and open water season should be good with decent abundances of 15 inch and larger Walleyes.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nSMALLMOUTH BASS <br> \n <br> \nFifty-two Smallmouth Bass were sampled in gill nets, trap nets, and daytime electrofishing on Fish Lake in 2015.  The gill net catch rate was 1.0 per gill net, the trap net catch rate was 0 per trap net, and the electrofishing catch rate was 48.4 per hour of electrofishing.  The electrofishing sample is the most accurate indication of the abundance of Smallmouth Bass in the lake because Smallmouth Bass are not easily caught in nets.  The long-term electrofishing catch rate of Smallmouth Bass on Fish Lake is near 30 per hour, so the current catch rate is well above the long-term average indicating an abundant population exists in the lake.  The size of Smallmouth Bass in the sample ranged from 4 to just shy of 20 inches with a mean length of 11 inches.  The Smallmouth Bass population appears to be balanced based on the data calculated from the sample collected.  The trophy potential of the population appears to be increasing as well.  Trophy Smallmouth Bass are considered those fish that reach 20 inches or larger.  The largest fish in the sample was just shy of 20 inches with a length of 19.7 inches.  Overall, the Smallmouth Bass population is doing well and angling opportunities for Smallmouth Bass should be good over the next several years with a balanced size structure.     <br> \n       <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nForty-three Yellow Perch were caught in the 2015 survey.  All 43 were caught in the gill net sample for a catch rate of 14.3 per gill net.  The catch rate was within the expected range.  The 2015 catch is an increase over the previous survey in 2011 when the gill net catch rate was only 1.7 per net.  The 2011 catch rate triggered a need for stocking.  Adult Yellow Perch were stocked in 2012, 2013, and 2014 with a total of nearly 6,600.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 7 to 10 inches.  Good numbers of large Yellow Perch are present in the lake and should be able to spawn and sustain the population over the next 5 years.  The presence of a viable and healthy population of Yellow Perch is good for the Walleye and Smallmouth Bass population as a source of food and is good for anglers looking to catch harvestable Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL  <br> \n <br> \nFifty-nine Bluegill were caught in gill nets (6.3 per gill net) and trap nets (4.9 per trap net) ranging in length from 4 to 10 inches with an average length of 6 inches.  The size distribution of Bluegill in the nets was good with 76% larger than 6 inches and 12% larger than 8 inches.  Larger Bluegill should help to add to the number of potential spawners in the lake that may result in more regular natural reproduction over the next several years.  Anglers reported good fishing for Bluegill during the entire open water season in 2015.  The outlook for Bluegill fishing is good on Fish Lake and a large number of 6 inch plus Bluegill should result in good catch rates of larger Bluegill as the fish grow.      <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to Walleye, Smallmouth Bass, Yellow Perch, and Bluegill there were 6 other species sampled.  The 6 species included Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Common Carp, Channel Catfish, Largemouth Bass, and Pumpkinseed.  Black Bullhead were 9 to 12 inches, Black crappie were 6 to 10 inches, Common Carp were 16 to 20 inches, Channel Catfish were 9 to 23 inches, Largemouth Bass were 4 to 20 inches, and the only pumpkinseed caught was 7 inches.  Black Bullhead catch rates in gill nets (45.7) and trap nets (47.2) were above average.  Black Crappie catch rates in gill nets (4.3) and trap nets (5.2) were within the average range.  Common Carp were only caught in gill nets and the catch rate of 4.0 per gill net was above average.  Channel Catfish were caught in both gill nets (10.0 per gill net) and trap nets (8.11 per trap net) and both catch rates were above average.  Largemouth Bass were not caught in gill nets or trap nets, but 19 were caught by electrofishing with a catch rate of 18.8 per hour.  The electrofishing catch rate of Largemouth Bass was the highest on record for Fish Lake!  Finally, the Pumpkinseed catch rate was low with only 1 caught.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead should provide a good forage base for the large Walleye in the lake.  Positively, Common Carp abundance was not extremely high.  Negatively, the top predator in the lake by biomass was not Walleye but instead was Channel Catfish.  Continued stocking of Walleye should help to increase the biomass of Walleye but Channel Catfish should provide some decent fishing action at times.  In addition, an abundant Black Bullhead forage base will improve the growth of large walleye also leading to a potential increase in Walleye growth.  High abundances of Bass, as indicated by electrofishing, are also available as predators to control Black Bullhead and young Common Carp.  At this time, the goal of fish management over the next 4 years is continued stocking of Walleye with another netting survey in 2019.  Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fingerling stocking was initiated in 2015 with the hope of increasing the potential of a naturally reproducing population of Walleye.  The stocking of Lower Mississippi strain Walleye will continue and genetics of Walleye during the 2019 survey will be evaluated to determine contribution of this strain to the Fish Lake Walleye population.  Overall, Walleye, Bass, Channel Catfish, and Bluegill fishing should be good over the next several years.  <br> \n <br> \nPrepared By Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

Lower Mississippi strain Walleye have been stocked since 2015 with no stocking in 2023, which allowed for determination of natural reproduction potential of the establishing LMS walleye. Night electrofishing was conducted October 2, 2023 to determine if natural reproduction is contributing to the population in non-stocked years.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 catch rate of Walleye fingerlings was 42.5 per hour.  Age-0 Walleye lengths were variable. Lengths ranged from 4.7 to 7.6 inches and averaged 5.6 inches. In southwest Minnesota, a year class may be produced if the fall electrofishing catch rate is above 20.0 per hour. However, survival of age-0 Walleye can be low when the length is near to or less than 5 inches during the first year of growth. Additional sampling will be conducted to determine the success of the Walleye population. The next standard gill net and trap net survey is during the summer of 2027.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 300-acre lake located near Windom in Jackson County.  The lake has just over 3 miles of shoreline, a maximum depth of 26 feet, and is more similar to north central Minnesota Lakes.  Therefore, Fish Lake is a unique southwest Minnesota lake.  Fish Lake is managed for Walleye, Smallmouth Bass, Yellow Perch, and Bluegill.  A fish population assessment was conducted with gill nets and trap nets during the week of July 18, 2019.  No spring electrofishing was conducted for Smallmouth Bass, but fish collection for county fairs in 2019 indicated a healthy Smallmouth Bass population.    <br> \n <br> \nFish caught during the 2019 survey were Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.   Pounds of fish in the gill nets was dominated by Walleye, Black Bullhead, Channel Catfish, and Yellow Perch.  Fish, by weight, in the trap nets was dominated by Bluegill and Black Bullhead.  This is a change from the 2015 survey when Channel Catfish and Common Carp dominated the catch by weight.   <br> \n <br> \nA new development was the discovery of Freshwater Drum.  Freshwater Drum are native to southern Minnesota Rivers and Lakes but they have the ability to become overabundant and can outcompete gamefish for limited food resources.  Freshwater Drum abundance will be monitored.  There was a period of time during high water in the spring of 2019, the mechanical barrier (fish screen) failed and needed to be repaired.  During the repair period, it is possible Freshwater Drum may have immigrated in from downstream sources.   <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nWalleye are one of the top predators in Fish Lake and are maintained by stocking.  Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fingerlings from the Lake Sarah egg take have been stocked into Fish Lake since 2015 (approximately 2,500 in 2015, 4,500 in 2016 and 2,000 in 2018). This strain originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes. The gill net catch rate was 7 per net and the trap net catch rate was just over 1 per net, both greater than the 2015 catch rates.  Gill net and trap net catch rates were above the upper normal value for similar lakes.  Additionally, the gill net catch rate of 7 per net is equal to the long-term catch rate for Fish Lake.  Length of the Walleye in the sample was good with many fish in the 15 to 20 inch range.  Growth of Walleye was good with an average length of 16 inches at age-3.  Finally, overall health of the Walleye in the sample was good.  It is apparent that the Walleye in Fish Lake are doing well.  Abundance, growth, and health were good in 2019 and should remain stable or increase slightly with continued stocking of Lower Mississippi strain fingerling every other year (2020, 2022, 2024, etc.).  <br> \n <br> \nPANFISH  <br> \nYellow Perch and Bluegill are important panfish species managed in Fish Lake. Other panfish in Fish Lake are Black Crappie and Pumpkinseed Sunfish.  The Yellow Perch population has experienced an increase since a low of just under 2 per gill net in 2011.  The 2019 gill net catch rate was just over 54 per net, the third highest catch rate on record!  This follows a restocking effort that started in 2012 with 290 large adult fish and continued in 2013 with 681 large adult fish and finally 5,625 small adult fish in 2014.  Additionally, Yellow Perch in the gill nets ranged from 5.5 inches to just shy of 11 inches with an average of 8 inches.  Health of the Yellow Perch was average.  However, it appeared that they got skinnier as they got larger.  This could have been a natural fluctuation in weight or it may be a more long-term indication of food scarcity and increased competition with other panfish.  The Yellow Perch will continue to be monitored to determine if future stocking is necessary.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill in Fish Lake are the most abundant they have ever been.  The 2019 trap net catch rate was nearly 86 per net.  Bluegill are dependent on good habitat.  Fortunately, aquatic plants in Fish Lake have been on the increase since 2015.  During that same time, Bluegill abundance has increased.  The size of Bluegill in the sample was decent with lots of fish in the 6 to 8 inch range.  They appeared to be in good health.  However, as with Yellow Perch, it appeared they became skinnier as they aged.  This decrease also could have been a natural fluctuation in weight.  But it could be due to decreased food for large Bluegill due to potential competition with other panfish.  Bluegill will continue to be monitored, but some decrease in their abundance could be good for growth of the remaining Bluegill.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were very abundant. The gill net catch rate was just over 28 per net and the trap net catch rate was 12 per net.  Black Crappie ranged in length from just under 5 inches to nearly 9.5 inches with a majority of fish in the 7 to 8 inch range. Overall health of Black Crappie was excellent.  Black Crappie appear to be doing well, and they could have the upper hand in the panfish battle and become more abundant.  Continued monitoring will be done.   <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nOther species of interest include Common Carp, Black Bullhead, and Channel Catfish.   <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were caught in gill nets and trap nets, however, the gill net catch was the lowest on record at just over 1 per net.  The trap net catch was within typical levels at just shy of 2 per net.  Interestingly, over the past 5 years, there has been the observation of floating dead Common Carp in the summer. In 2018, samples of dead and just dying fish were sent to the University of Minnesota pathology laboratory where it was confirmed that they died as a result of Koi Herpes Virus.  Koi Herpes Virus affects specific species of fish, like Common Carp, and results in a weakened immune system where they may die as a result of a secondary infection.   Koi Herpes Virus cannot be transmitted to humans and is limited to Common Carp at this time based on current knowledge.  A current University of Minnesota study is being conducted to determine cross species infection of Koi Herpes Virus and it includes Fish Lake as a study lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead and Channel Catfish were still abundant in Fish Lake, and both species were caught at or above long-term catch averages for Fish Lake.  Anglers looking to target either Black Bullhead or Channel Catfish could find some success on Fish Lake during the hot summer days.     <br> \n     <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \nOverall, it appears that the fish community at Fish Lake is responding well to current stocking.  The Walleye population is trending upward and the panfish community is thriving.  The future looks bright, and clear, for Fish Lake as the lake is experiencing a resurgence of aquatic vegetation that is helping stabilize the gamefish community in the lake as well as increasing the clarity of the water and the enjoyment of aquatic recreation on the lake.         <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

THE 1989 CPUE INDICATES THAT THE WALLEYE ABUNDANCE HAS NOT CHANGED CONSIDERABLY SINCE 1984. THE MEAN WEIGHT OF THE WALLEYE CAPTUR- ED IN THE GILL NETS WAS 1.94 PDS IN 1989 AND 0.17 PDS IN 1984 FOUR OF THE SEVEN WALLEYE CAPTURED IN THE GILL NETS WERE AGE ONE FISH RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 7.5 TO 11.0 INCHES. THE WALLEYE TRAPNET CPUE WAS 4.25 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. EIGHTY-FIVE PER- CENT OF THE WALLEYE CAPTURED IN THE TRAP NETS WERE LESS THAN 11.5 INCHES IN LENGTH AND WERE PROBABLY AGE ONE FISH. THE 1988 COHORT APPEARS TO HAVE RISEN FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. BASED ON REPRODUCTION CHECKS, WALLEYE ALSO SPAWNED SUCCESS- FULLY IN 1985 AND 1989. GROWTH RATES FOR THE WALLEYE CAPTURED IN THE GILL NETS EQUALLED OR EXCEEDED THE STATE AVERAGE FOR ALL LENGTHS SAMPLED THE BLUEGILL CPUE OF 5.60 FISH PER TRAP NET IS 2.7 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND INDICATES AN INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE SINCE 1984. THE MEAN WEIGHT OF THE BLUEGILL WAS 0.49 IN 1989 AND 0.35 IN 1984. BLUEGILL HAVE SPAWNED SUCCESSFULLY IN EVERY YEAR SINCE 1982. FISH LAKE BULLGILL GROWTH RATES EXCEED THE STATE AVERAGE EARLY IN LIFE BUT FROM 6.5 INCHES ON, GROWTH APPROXIMATELY THE STATE AVERAGE. THE BLACK CRAPPIE CPUE OF 1.00 FISH PER TRAP NET FALLS WITHIN THE FIRST QUARTILE OF ALL WINDOM AREA LAKES THAT CONTAIN BLACK CRAPPIE. THE 1984 CPUE WAS 28.9 FISH PER TRAP NET. OF THE FIVE BLACK CRAPPIE CAPTURED IN THE TRAP NETS, FOUR WERE AGE FOUR AND ONE WAS AGE FIVE. ALL FISH CAPTURED IN BOTH THE 1984 AND 1989 SURVEYS WERE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. ALTHOUGH 10,000 LARGEMOUTH BASS FINGERLING WERE STOCKED IN 1981 AND 1984, NO LARGEMOUTH BASS ADULTS WERE CAPTURED IN EITHER THE 1984 OR THE 1989 SURVEY. ONE HOUR OF ELECTROFISHING ON MAY 24, 1987 ALSO FAILED TO COLLECT ANY LARGEMOUTH BASS ADULTS. IN 1981, 8,640 SMALLMOUTH BASS FINGERLINGS WERE STOCKED IN FISH LAKE. THE 1984 CPUE WAS 0.06 SMALLMOUTH BASS PER TRAP NET. DURING THE 1989 SURVEY NO SMALLMOUTH BASS WERE CAPTURED. NO NORTHERN PIKE WERE CAPTURED IN THE GILL NETS DURING THE 1989 SURVEY. THE 1984 CPUE WAS 0.25 PIKE PER GILL NET. ONE 7.5 POUND NORTHERN PIKE WAS CAPTURED IN THE TRAP NETS. BASED ON REPRODUC- TION CHECKS, IT APPEARS AS THOUGH NORTHERN PIKE SPAWNED SUCCESSFULLY IN 1986 WHICH COINCIDES WITH THE LAST ACCESS TO SUITABLE SPAWNING HABITAT IN THE SLOUGH NORHTEAST OF THE OUTLET. THE YELLOW PERCH CPUE OF 5.60 FISH PER GILL NET FALLS WITHIN THE FIRST QUARTILE OF ALL WINDOM AREA LAKES THAT CONTAIN YELLOW PERCH. THE 1984 CPUE WAS 26.25 FISH PER GILL NET. THE PRESENT YELLOW PERCH STOCK IS DOMINATED BY AGE TWO FISH. AGE ONE, THREE, FOUR AND SIX FISH ALSO ARE PRESENT ALL YELLOW PERCH CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY APPEAR TO BE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. YELLOW PERCH GROWTH EXCEEDS THE STATE AVERAGE EARLY IN LIFE BUT DROPS TO APPROXIMATE THE STATE AVERAGE BY THE TIME THE FISH ATTAIN A LENGTH OF 8.5 INCHES. THE CARP CPUE WAS 2.00 FISH PER TRAP NET. THE 1984 CPUE WAS 0.06 CARP PER TRAP NET. THE GILL NET CPUE IN 1989 WAS 8.20 CARP PER NET AND THE 1984 GILLNET CPUE WAS 1.75. THE CARP CAPTURED IN THE TRAP NETS DURING THE 1989 SURVEY HAD A MODAL LENGTH OF 17.5 INCHES AND A MEAN WEIGHT OF 2.65 PDS. THE WHITE SUCKER CPUE WAS 0.80 FISH PER GILL NET IN 1989 AND 2.00 FISH PER GILL NET IN 1984. THE BLACK BULLHEAD CPUE OF 77.4 FISH PER TRAP NET APPROXIMATES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND IS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE 1984 CPUE. THE MEAN BLACK BULLHEAD WEIGHT IN 1989 WAS 0.47 PDS AND IN 1984 IT WAS 0.26 PDS. NO BLACK BULLHEAD LESS THAN EIGHT INCHES WERE CAPTURED DURING THIS SURVEY.</p>",

The number of walleye sampled per net increased from 1.8 in 1990 to 8.3 fish per net in 1994.  Walleye lengths ranged from 17 to 23.5 inches and the average weight was just over 3 1/2 lbs.Black crappie numbers would be considered high for lakes similar to Fish Lake.  The number of black crappie sampled per net increased from 3.8 in 1990 to 63.2 fish per net in 1994.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 4 to almost 13 inches.  The majority of the fish were in the 6 to 9 inch range.Bluegill numbers would be considered average for lakes similar to Fish Lake.  The number of bluegill sampled per net increased from 3.4 in 1990 to 19.3 fish per net in 1994.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 5.5 to 8 inches.  The average weight of bluegills was about 1/4 of a pound.Yellow perch numbers would be considered extremely high for lakes similar to Fish Lake.  The number of yellow perch sampled increased from 19.8 in 1990 to 233.3 fish per net in 1994.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5.5 to 10 inches.  The majority of the yellow perch were rather small in 1994 but should provide an excellent perch fishery in years to come.  Channel catfish numbers are high in Fish Lake according to our survey and should provide an excellent fishery in future years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 300-acre lake located southeast of Windom in Jackson County.  The lake has 3.4 miles of shoreline and has a maximum depth of 26.0 feet.  Fish Lake is one of two lakes the Windom Fisheries Management Area manages for smallmouth bass.  The Fish Lake Association, which is mostly comprised of lakeshore property owners have historically treated the lake around the 4th of July time period with copper sulphate to reduce the severity of algae blooms and increase water clarity.  In recent years, the Fish Lake Association has not treated due in part to the lack of perceived need because of better water clarity in recent years, but also the associations understanding of the long term negative ecological consequences of using copper.  In 2006 a secchi disk depth reading was observed to be 20 or more feet subsequent to a treatment.  The water clarity in August of 2011 was 4.0 feet.  In addition to smallmouth bass, Fish Lake is managed primarily for walleye while channel catfish, yellow perch, black crappie, and bluegill are managed secondarily.  Smallmouth bass spawning structures were placed in the lake in 2006 to promote natural reproduction.  A fish population assessment was conducted with gill nets, trap nets, electrofishing targeting bass, and IBI sampling (seines and backpack electrofishing targeting juvenile fish) during the summer of 2011 from June (bass electrofishing) through August (netting and IBI sampling).  An aquatic vegetation survey was also conducted to determine species presence and abundance. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nFish Lake is limited in the amount of aquatic vegetation and therefore limited in the amount of aquatic habitat.  The vegetation survey revealed 4 species of aquatic plants, 1 submergent, 2 emergents, and 1 terrestrial.  The submergent plant species was common hornwort, often referred to as coontail, found in rare abundance.  The 2 emergent species were narrow-leaved cattail and river bulrush both rare in abundance.  The terrestrial species was reed canary grass, which was also rare in abundance.  Aquatic vegetation is good for lakes as they provide habitat and nursery for fish and invertebrate species, absorb nutrients so they are not available for algae production, as well as providing dissolved oxygen production via photosynthesis.  Expansion of the coontail in Fish Lake would be beneficial for the lake; vegetation should be left alone on Fish Lake to encourage the expansion.  In general, there is a direct relationship in the amount of aquatic vegetation (fish habitat) and abundance of fish.  In other words, you can expect more fish with more aquatic vegetation/habitat.      <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 walleye gill net catch rate was 20.0 fish per net which was greater than the normal range of 1.2 to 6.3 and the greatest on record since sampling began in 1984.  The long-term catch rate is 7.3 fish per net and the management goal is 6.0 fish per gill net, both of which were exceeded by the 2011 catch rate.  Lengths of walleye sampled in gill nets ranged from 10.3 to 24.5 inches with a mean length of 18.1 inches.  Six year classes of walleye (ages 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, and 10) were observed during the assessment.  Surprisingly, 3 of the 6 years were not from stocking (ages 4, 8, and 9) indicating some natural reproduction exists in Fish Lake.  Two of the stocked years (ages 1 and 3) were fryling stocked and the fish were marked with Oxytetracycline (OTC; shows up as fluorescent mark on ear bone).  All of the age 1 (2010) and 3 (2008) year old fish sampled had OTC marks, and 58% of the walleye in the sample were from 2008 and 2010 indicating the success of fryling stocking in Fish Lake.  Additionally, the overall condition of the walleye was fair for an August sample indicating some foraging stress is occurring in a very abundant walleye population.  In summary, Fish Lake walleye are at an all time high abundance and likely to provide good fishing.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to the abundant walleye population, the smallmouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 54.6 fish per hour in 2011 which met the management goal of maintaining a catch rate above 20.0 per hour.  Since 1994, the electrofishing catch rates have varied from a low of 3.3 per hour in 2002 to a current high of 54.6 in 2011 with a long-term average catch rate of 27.3 fish per hour.   Lengths of smallmouth bass sampled by electrofishing in 2011 ranged from 3.4 to 17.9 inches with a mean length of 13.1 inches.  The sample indicated that the population had an excellent size structure.  The overall body condition was average compared to other lakes.  Year classes from 2005 (age 6), 2006 (age 5), 2008 (age 3), 2009 (age 2) and 2010 (age 1) were observed during the assessment with larger fish present in the sample that were not aged and young-of-the-year (YOY; newly hatched) present in the nearshore IBI sampling indicating natural spawning.  Bass anglers should choose Fish Lake as a destination to catch some very nice fish.       <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe channel catfish gill net catch rate was 3.3 fish per net in 2011.  The historical catch rate average is 6.6 fish per net with a high of 29.3 fish per net in 1994 and a low of 1.0 fish per net in 1984.  Lengths of channel catfish sampled in gill nets ranged from 13.4 to 17.0 inches with a mean length of 14.9 inches.  The population was dominated by fish in the 13 to 16 inch range in below average condition.  Three year classes were represented in the sample from 2002 (age 9), 2003 (age 8), and 2004 (age7).  Channel catfish growth rates are very slow in Fish Lake.  Angling for channel catfish in Fish Lake will yield lots of small fish and can be fun when the bite for walleye slows down. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill net catch rate was 1.7 fish per net in 2011 which was below the normal range of 2.0 to 27.9 fish per net.  Prior to 2011, the gill net catch rate has never been below 2.0 fish per net with a long-term average catch rate of 50.8 per gill net.  Lengths of yellow perch sampled in gill nets ranged from 6.3 to 6.9 inches with a mean length of 6.6 inches indicating only 1 year class of yellow perch remained in Fish Lake.  The population was in poor condition indicating possible reproductive and foraging stress.  Fish Lake will be restocked with pre-spawn yellow perch in the spring of 2012 in hopes of producing a year class in Fish Lake to jump start the population.  Yellow perch are an important forage species for walleye as well as a target species for some anglers.  Fishing for yellow perch will be a challenge for the next couple years, but a strong year class as a result of the 2012 stocking could boost the population quickly.  It is likely the high abundance of both walleye and smallmouth bass are impacting the abundance of yellow perch in Fish Lake. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie trap net catch rate was 2.2 fish per net in 2011 which was within the normal range of 1.8 to 21.2 fish per net.  The historical long-term average trap net catch rate is 13.3 fish per net which is skewed by two very high catch rates of 28.9 fish per net in 1984 and 63.2 fish per net in 1994, without those the catch rate has been between 0.2 and 5.1 fish per trap net.  The average size of the black crappie in the trap nets was 7.5 inches with a range from 6.0 to 8.8 inches indicating 2 or 3 year classes make up the population.  The sample indicated a population with a balanced size structure and good average body condition.  Fishing for black crappie in the next 2 to 3 years should be above average for Fish Lake, as the fish mature the chance of catching a 10 incher will be good. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 bluegill trap net catch rate of 0.6 fish per net was below the normal range of 7.5 to 62.5 fish per net.  The historical trap net catch rate is 4.4 fish per net which is skewed by a catch rate of 19.3 in 1994, otherwise the trap net catch rate has never exceeded 5.6 fish per net (1989) and is usually below the normal range.  However, the catch rate in 2011 is the lowest on record indicating a very low population abundance of bluegill in Fish Lake in 2011.  The average length of fish in the trap net sample was 7.7 inches with a range from 7.6 to 7.8 indicating only 1 year class remains in Fish Lake.  The sample shows that the population of bluegill is at a very low abundance with only 1 year class and is in good condition.  Bluegill fishing success on Fish Lake will be hit or miss, the population abundance will only increase with spawning success in 2012 or future bluegill stocking.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 black bullhead gill net catch rate was 42.3 fish per net which was within the normal range of 2.5 to 45.0 fish per net.  No black bullheads were caught in the trap nets.  The long-term gill net catch rate in Fish Lake is 69.5 fish per net so the current catch rate is below typical.  Lengths of black bullhead sampled in gill nets ranged from 8.0 to 9.7 inches with a mean length of 8.9 inches.  The sample of bullhead indicated a population dominated by smaller fish with average to fair condition.  The black bullhead population appears to be the dominant forage base for predators in Fish Lake as their abundance makes them more available over species such as yellow perch and bluegill. Angling for black bullhead is popular with kids because they provide consistent action and they will continue to do so.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 common carp gill net catch rate was 11.0 fish per net which was above the normal range of 0.3 to 3.0 fish per net and more than the long-term average of 7.7 fish per gill net.  Only 1 common carp was caught in the trap nets.  Lengths of common carp sampled in gill nets ranged from 14.4 to 21.9 inches with a mean length of 16.3 inches.  The overall body condition of the fish in the sample below average.  Overall, it appears that the common carp population is at a very high abundance made up of 2 or 3 year classes that are experiencing some foraging stress as seen from the low body condition.  Unfortunately, commercial fishing for common carp is challenging due to the deep morphology of Fish Lake.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the gill nets, trap nets, and IBI sampling were bigmouth buffalo, emerald shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, johnny darter, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, and spotfin shiner.  All of these species appear to be at low abundance (bigmouth buffalo, largemouth bass, northern pike, hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish) or difficult to sample due to small size or seasonal fluctuations (emerald shiner, green sunfish, johnny darter, and spotfin shiner).  Including the managed species of walleye, smallmouth bass, channel catfish, yellow perch, and black crappie as well as black bullhead and common carp, Fish Lake had 16 species of fish that were sampled. Sixteen species is very good diversity and indicates adequate habitat and resources exist to support a vast fish community.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a quality fish community in Fish Lake, best management practices should be used in the watershed to reduce impacts of landuse on the water quality and habitat in Fish Lake.  A project involving the use of field tile outlet filters will be implemented on Fish Lake to help reduce the impacts of farming practices on the water chemistry and overall water quality in Fish Lake.  Continued efforts should include use of buffer strips and other erosion prevention methods to reduce overland runoff into the streams that feed the lake, and the lake itself.  Wise use of our resources makes us good stewards to the land and water that all of us use every day. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 300-acre lake located southeast of Windom with the lake in both Cottonwood and Jackson County.  The lake has 3.4 miles of shoreline, a maximum depth of 26 feet, and is a class 24 lake.  Class 24 lakes are relatively deep and typically found in the north central portion of Minnesota.  Therefore, Fish Lake is a unique southwest Minnesota lake.  Fish Lake is managed for Walleye, Smallmouth Bass, Yellow Perch, and Bluegill.  The Fish Lake Association has had a history of treating the lake, prior to the 4th of July, with copper sulphate to reduce the severity of algae blooms and increase water clarity and perceived recreational value of the lake.  However, no copper sulfate treatment has been done since 2013.  Since 2015, water clarity readings (Secchi disk) have been systematically obtained by a lakeshore resident to begin establishing a water transparency baseline.  Over that time, open water clarity has ranged from 2.6 feet to 15.3 feet. In 2023, open water clarity ranged from 3.3 to 5.9 feet. Typically, water clarity was greatest in May or June and then decreased. It appears copper sulfate treatment may no longer be necessary, and should be discouraged, to maintain the aquatic vegetation community.  A caveat to this trend in increasing water clarity is the re-emergence of curly-leaf pondweed in 2017.   In 2023 it was reduced from densities seen in 2019-2022, but still abundant in some areas of the lake. A fish population assessment was conducted with gill nets (3) and trap nets (9), during the week of July 10, 2023.  No spring electrofishing was conducted for Smallmouth Bass, but fish collection for county fairs in 2023 indicated a healthy Smallmouth Bass population.   <br> \n  <br> \nFish caught during the 2023 survey were Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.  Biomass of fish in the gill nets was dominated by Black Bullhead, Channel Catfish, and Walleye.  Biomass of fish in the trap nets was dominated by Black Bullhead.  Interestingly, Freshwater Drum were first sampled in 2019 likely due to a mechanical barrier failure due to high water.  No Freshwater Drum were sampled in 2023 indicating there is a possibility they are not present.  Although, Freshwater Drum are native to southern Minnesota Rivers and Lakes, they have the ability to become overabundant and can outcompete gamefish for limited food resources. <br> \n       <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are one of the top predators in Fish Lake and are maintained by fingerling stocking.  Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS or Lake Sarah Strain) Walleye have been stocked into Fish Lake since 2015. The gill net catch rate was 3.3 per net and the trap net catch rate was 0.2 per net, both less than during the last survey in 2019.  The gill net catch rate was within the normal range, but the trap net catch rate was below what is expected for class 24 lakes.  Additionally, the gill net catch rate is the lowest since 2006 while the trap net catch rate is the lowest since 2011.  However, trap nets can be poor indicators of Walleye abundance.  Size structure of the Walleye in the sample was good.  Walleye ranged in length from 11 inches to 23 inches with a mean of just under 19 inches in the gill net sample and 16 inches in the trap net sample. Most Walleye were between 16 and 20 inches in the gill net sample. Based on the netting the Walleye population is at a lower level in Fish Lake, although they are healthy and appear to be finding adequate prey.  Lower Mississippi strain (Lake Sarah egg take) fingerling (or other sizes) Walleye will continue to be stocked every other year.    <br> \n <br> \nPANFISH <br> \n  <br> \nYellow Perch and Bluegill are important managed species in Fish Lake and important panfish species within the fish community.  Fish Lake also has Black Crappie and Pumpkinseed Sunfish.  The Yellow Perch population has experienced an increase since a low of 1.7 per gill net in 2011.  The 2023 gill net catch rate was 19.7 and follows the third greatest catch rate of 54.3 per gill net in 2019.  Yellow Perch were restocked starting in 2012 with 290 pre-spawn adult fish and again in 2013 with 681 adult fish and 5,625 yearling adults in 2014.  Yellow Perch in the gill nets ranged from 5.5 inches to 7 inches with an average of 6 inches.  Health of Yellow Perch was average. We will continue to monitor the Yellow Perch population to determine if future stocking is necessary to maintain abundance and keep Yellow Perch available for anglers.  <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill in Fish Lake are extremely popular and have been abundant for anglers over the past 4 years. However, in 2023 the catch rate declined to 7 per trap net after being the most abundant they have ever been documented at 85.7 per trap net in 2019. Bluegill are typically dependent on available habitat, and aquatic vegetation in Fish Lake has decreased since 2019.  During that same time, Bluegill abundance has decreased.  The size structure of Bluegill in the sample favored small fish.  Fish ranged in length from 3 to 6.5 inches in the trap net sample.  The overall health of the Bluegill was excellent even though they were small. Angling for larger fish will be difficult over the next several years, however, large fish could become more abundant as the young fish age.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were present at a lower catch rate compared to past years. The gill net catch rate was 2 per net in 2023, a decline from 28.7 per net in 2019.  The trap net catch rate trend was similar with 0.3 caught per net in 2023 and 12.2 caught per net in 2019.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 7 to 9 inches with a majority of fish in the 7 to 8 inch range. This is similar to past years, indicating stagnant growth of crappie. Overall health of Black Crappie was excellent.   <br> \nYellow Perch are the most dominant panfish species at this time. Bluegill and Black Crappie populations are low at this time, but they should cycle to higher levels as habitat favors panfish. Future restocking may be necessary and population monitoring will continue with another survey in 2027.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species of interest include Common Carp, Black Bullhead, and Channel Catfish.  Common Carp were caught in gill nets and trap nets, however, the gill net catch was the lowest on record at 0.7 per net with none sampled in trap nets. Interestingly, over the past 9 years there has been the observation of summer mortality of Common Carp. In 2018, samples of dead fish were sent to the University of Minnesota pathology laboratory where it was confirmed that they died as a result of Koi Herpes Virus.  Koi Herpes Virus affects specific species of fish, like Common Carp, and results in a weakened immune system where they may die as a result of a secondary infection.  Koi Herpes Virus cannot be transmitted to humans and is limited to Common Carp based on current knowledge. Black Bullhead and Channel Catfish were still abundant in Fish Lake, and both species were caught near or above long-term catch averages in gill nets for Fish Lake.      <br> \n  <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nOverall, it appears that the fish community at Fish Lake is experiencing some stress.  The Walleye population is trending downward and the panfish community is mixed with Yellow Perch doing above average and Bluegill and Black Crappie numbers trending lower. Also, the emergence of curly-leaf pondweed, Freshwater Drum, and Koi Herpes Virus in Common Carp are items of concern. Continued monitoring will be conducted to track the progression of those issues. Even in the midst of all of those issues, the future looks bright for Fish Lake Walleye as the lake will continue to be stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain fish. Stocking a different size Walleye (fry or fryling) may be warranted if the catch rate does not increase in 2027. Overall, while the fish community is under some stress, it is not doing poorly. Aquatic vegetation was not as abundant as in previous years and may be leading to some changes in the fish community. With that said, Smallmouth Bass size and numbers appear to be doing well with many caught during summer electrofishing for southwest Minnesota county fair fish displays. Fish Lake will continue to be a unique angling destination in southwest Minnesota.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish is a 300 acre lake located southeast of Windom in Jackson County.  The lake has 3.4 miles of shoreline and has a maximum depth of 26 feet.  Fish Lake is the only lake in the Windom Fisheries Area that is managed for smallmouth bass.  Natural reproduction of smallmouth bass has been well documented.  On two different occasions, smallmouth spawning structures have been placed in the lake with cooperation from the local fishing club.  The lake is presently managed for walleye and smallmouth bass as the primary species while channel catfish, yellow perch, black crappie, and bluegill are managed secondarily.The walleye population looks good when compared to other lakes like Fish Lake.  Lengths of walleye caught in our trap nets ranged from 8.4 to 27.7 inches and averaged 17.7 inches.  The average weight was 2.7 pounds.  Five different age groups of walleye were sampled during the survey.  It appears the fish that hatched in 2001 and 1999 were from natural reproduction.Data collected during our survey indicated the smallmouth bass population may be down when compared to the 1998 assessment.  Local residents have reported many smallmouth bass being caught and kept.  Smallmouth bass are sometimes more susceptible to being caught than some other species.  Keeping this in mind, it may be necessary to practice better catch and release techniques in order to keep a strong smallmouth bass fishery going in Fish Lake.  Smallmouth were stocked in 1991 and have reproduced and done very well since.  Lengths of smallmouth caught during our survey ranged from 4.8 to 15.8 inches with an average of 10.4 inches.  The bluegill population is below average when compared to lakes similar to Fish Lake.  Lengths of bluegill sampled in trap nets ranged from 7.9 to 9.3 inches and averaged 8.3 inches.  Three different age groups were caught during the survey but none of them were younger than five years old.The black crappie population also appears to be down from previous years.  Lengths of crappie caught in our trap nets ranged from 5.5 to 10.6 inches and averaged 9.2 inches.  The population was dominated by three year old fish.The yellow perch population is similar to other lakes like Fish Lake.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 5.6 to 10.1 inches and averaged 8.3 inches.The channel catfish catch rates have decreased from a high of 29.3 in 1994 to 4.3 fish per net in 2002.  Lengths of channel catfish caught in our gill nets ranged from 11.9 to 12.6 inches and averaged 12.3 inches.  We took 15 spine samples to age the fish and all the fish aged were from a hatch of catfish in 1995.Black bullhead catch rates were similar to other lakes like Fish Lake.  Lengths of bullhead caught in our trap nets ranged from 7.2 to 9.1 inches and averaged 8.5 inches.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Fish Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

The seine hauls captured 12 species of fish including Johnny Darter (N=68), Bigmouth Buffalo (N=4), Black Bullhead (N=736), Bluegill (N=3), Fathead Minnow (N=107), Largemouth Bass (N=9), Pumpkinseed Sunfish (N=4), Smallmouth Bass (N=6), Spotfin Shiner (N=100), Walleye (N=1), and Yellow Perch (N=1,739). Young-of-the-year Black Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, and Yellow Perch were sampled indicating that natural reproduction occurs in Fish Lake for these species.  Walleye were not stocked in 2023, so these are the result of natural reproduction. The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of Fish Lake. The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community. The IBI score at Fish Lake is below the impairment threshold of 36. <br> \n</p>",
