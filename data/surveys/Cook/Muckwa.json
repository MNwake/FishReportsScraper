This survey was the first of two scheduled in the latest (2009) lake management plan to evaluate a reduction in stocking frequency (from annual to alternate years) that began in 2011.  Because of the low number of gill net sets used in surveys of these very small stream trout lakes, multiple surveys must be completed before results of management changes can be assessed with any confidence. <br> \n <br> \nOnly three Rainbow Trout were collected in 2017, a relatively low catch for this lake historically.  Fish from stocked 2013 and 2011 year classes contributed to the catch, and survival of some fish to six years of age boded well for the lake's continued ability to produce some trophy-sized Rainbow Trout.   <br> \n <br> \nSurvival of the 2015 stocking may have been unusually low.  In a typical survey of a stream lake with a similar stocking history in this area, two-year-old fish would be vulnerable to our sampling gear, and would usually make up the bulk of the catch; however, no fish of that age were collected in this survey.  There had been no change in stocking method or the strain stocked in 2015.  Fingerlings stocked in 2015 were larger than those stocked in 2013 and 2011, but were still well within the acceptable size range for aerial stocking.  With the low number of net sets used, it is possible that young fish were present, but were simply not caught. <br> \n <br> \nNo undesirable fish species were collected in Muckwa Lake in 2017.  Minnows appeared to have been abundant.  Temperature-oxygen conditions measured on 19 July were suitable for Rainbow Trout from the surface to a depth of at least 15 feet.</p>",
