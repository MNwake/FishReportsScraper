From the 1937 map it was found that the maximum depth was 10 feet and the median depth 6.5 feet. However 6 feet was the deepest water found in 1961. Lake bottom soils are divided into approximately 40% muck, 30% gravel, 20% sand and 10% mixed boulder/rubble. A moderate to good growth of various floatingleaf and submerged aquatic plants exists. Emergent vegetation covers less than 1 percent of the present lake surface. A sedge mat borders both sides of the outlet and a northeastern bay of the lake. Except for a series of springs on the bed of the southern-most bay of the lake there are no inlets. A secchi disc could be seen through the light green lake water to be resting on the bottom.     Test net catches indicated that goodly numbers of White Sucker, Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass were present. The Yellow Perch population appeared to be very dense. Common Shiner were also netted but in numbers somewhat less than the state-wide median.     Two cabins and 2 boats were seen at the lake. There is no designated public access. Fishing pressure would appear to be light. At times the pressure may be moderate.</p>",

The public access to the lake is a rough logging road, then foot travel (1500 feet) on an unimproved trail.A lake survey was conducted in the summer of 2003.  Species sampled were: northern pike, largemouth bass, yellow perch and common shiner.  Due to the small size of the lake a low number of gill net sets were made to prevent unnecessary loss of game fish; therefore, catch rate data may be less reliable.Northern pike were sampled in above average numbers compared to other lakes in this lake class.  The fish ranged in size from 14.8 to 27.6 inches (4.0 pounds).  The average weight of northern pike in the 2003 survey was 2.4 pounds.Yellow perch were sampled in fairly high numbers with fish up to 10.2 inches collected.  Yellow perch of this size were unncommon, and 86% of the yellow perch ranged from 6.0 to 7.5 inches.Largemouth bass are found in Pike Lake; however, based on the 2003 survey, the status of the largemouth bass population remains uncertain.  Only two largemouth bass were collected in 2003, the largest 15.7 inches (1.5 pounds). In a previous survey, a small number of largemouth bass between 18.0 inches and 19.9 inches were sampled.  Largemouth bass are difficult to catch in gill nets, and low gill net catches may not be indicative of their abundance. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pike Lake is 77 acres, has a maximum depth of 8 feet, and is located approximately 11 miles northwest of Isabella, MN.  There is a 900 foot carry-in access to the southwest side of the western bay that starts at the end of U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Road #1491A.  There is a small parking area for two vehicles.  USFS Road # 1491A begins approximately 2.4 miles north on USFS Rd. #1491 (Deep Lake Road) from State Highway 1.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 standard survey was conducted to monitor the fish community in Pike Lake.  The Northern Pike catch was above average compared to similar lakes in the area and was the highest catch recorded for the lake.  Fifty Northern Pike were caught and had an average length of 23.8 inches with a weight of 2.9 pounds.  Twenty pike were over 24 inches in length for 41% of the total catch.  Growth of Northern Pike was above average and five consecutive year classes were present in the catch showing good natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass catch was above average compared to similar lakes in the Finland Area.  Ten Largemouth Bass were caught in gill nets with an average size of 16.9 inches and 3.1 pounds.  The biggest Largemouth Bass was 18.7 inches and 4.1 pounds.  Natural reproduction success may be sporadic with noticeable gaps in year classes but growth was average for the area.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled in average numbers relative to similar lakes in the area.  This is similar to past investigations on the lake.  The average length was 6.7 inches and likely not worth targeting for an angler.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled for the first time in Pike Lake in 2018.  Two Black Crappie were caught and measured 5.2 inches and 8.5 inches.  It is unclear how Black Crappie got into the lake and we do not know if Black Crappie have fully established a population in the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 survey was the first time Bluegill were sampled in the lake.  It is unclear how Bluegill got into Pike Lake and if a population has fully established.  A total of four Bluegill were caught in gill nets and nine more were sampled with mini trap nets.  The average size of Bluegill was 6.6 inches with an individual over 9 inches sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker were sampled in average numbers relative to similar lakes and size averaged 18.5 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Bluntnose Minnow, Golden Shiner were also sampled with the survey gear.  <br> \n <br> \nPike Lake has a decent Northern Pike population and can produce some quality Largemouth Bass.  The Bluegill and Black Crappie populations might offer angling opportunities if the populations are able to become fully established in the lake.  Angling pressure is presumed to be light due to the difficulty in getting to the lake.  Pike Lake offers a scenic setting in the woods with only two cabins located along the shoreline.    <br> \n</p>",

The largest individual sampled in test nets in 1993 was 5.2 lbs however 67% of the catch exceeded 3 lbs.          Largemouth Bass are present in the lake however the low number caught during this assessment may not be a true indication of their numbers as they are a difficult species to sample with nets. Pike Lake historically has provided some quality size Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass to anglers however the difficult access limits the amount of fishing on the lake.</p>",
