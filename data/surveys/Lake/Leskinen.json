Fish species sampled during the survey were black bullhead, white sucker and several species of minnows.  No game fish were sampled and none have been known to inhabit the lake since the late 1950's, when brook trout were last stocked.  Conditions at that time were marginal for game fish.  Since the failure of the dam on the outlet conditions are less suitable for game fish.There is no developed public access to Leskinen Lake.  The public can access the lake by carrying from the right-of-way off of Lake County Road #6 to the outlet above the road.</p>",
