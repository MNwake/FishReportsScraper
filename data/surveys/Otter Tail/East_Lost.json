                "narrative": "<p>East Lost Lake is a 501-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County.  The Otter Tail River runs through East Lost Lake.  East Lost Lake is approximately three river miles downstream of Otter Tail Lake and is immediately downstream of Deer Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots. East Lost Lake has a maximum depth of 36 feet; however, 65% of the lake is less than fifteen feet in depth.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  The secchi disk reading at the time of this survey was 10.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.2 to 9.5 feet.  East Lost Lake is included in lake class 32 of the MNDNR lake classification scheme.       An unimproved, carry-in public access is located on the west end of  East Lost Lake off of County Road 45.  East Lost can also be accessed from the concrete public access located at the east end of adjacent Deer Lake.  Shoreline development is increasing, and approximately 50% of the shoreline is presently developed.  Homes and cabins compose the majority of the development.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are located at various locations around the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush, common cattail and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion, and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish. They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their important ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     East Lost Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in the fish community of East Lost Lake.     The walleye test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 32 lakes.  Walleye fry are stocked on a biennial basis; however, age data indicate that natural reproduction is also contributing to the population.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.2 to 22.9 inches with an average length and weight of 16.6 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.0 inches at five years of age.     The northern pike test-net catch rate has historically remained at a moderate level.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 13.2 to 22.8 inches with an average length and weight of 17.0 inches and 1.0 pound.  Growth rates are slow with an average length of 17.0 inches at four years of age.     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that a balanced largemouth bass population with consistently good reproduction exists.  Bass ranged in length from 7.1 to 20.0 inches with an average length and weight of 13.2 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Bass growth is good with an average length of 13.1 inches at four years of age.     Bluegill abundance has historically fluctuated.  The test-net catch rate in this survey is within the normal range for lake class 32.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is inconsistent which is the most likely reason for the fluctuations in abundance.  Bluegill size structure is good with forty-two percent of the sample exceeding 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegill growth is moderate with an average length of 7.2 inches at seven years of age.     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    East Lost Lake is a 501-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately five miles north of Battle Lake, MN.  The Otter Tail River flows through East Lost Lake, which is approximately three river miles downstream from Otter Tail Lake. The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  East Lost Lake has a maximum depth of 36 feet; however, 65% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Historical secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.2 to 11.5 feet.   <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cabins.  An unimproved, carry-in DNR public access is located on the west shoreline.  Boat access can be obtained through the DNR public access located on adjacent Deer Lake.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and common cattail are located at various locations around the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     A reduced daily bag limit regulation for sunfish (10 per day) was implemented in 2021.  The objective of the regulation is to improve and maintain the quality of the Bluegill size structure.  A special spring trapnetting survey was conducted to collect baseline data on the Bluegill population, which will be used for regulation evaluation purposes in future surveys.  The Bluegill population is extremely abundant and has a moderate quality size structure.  Seventy-five percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length, while 19% was 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegills attain an average length of 8.3 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     <br> \n     East Lost Lake was designated as infested with zebra mussels in 2017.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     East Lost Lake is a 501-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately five miles north of Battle Lake, MN.  The Otter Tail River flows through East Lost Lake, which is approximately three river miles downstream from Otter Tail Lake. The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  East Lost Lake has a maximum depth of 36 feet; however, 65% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 8.3 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.2 to 10.5 feet.   <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cabins.  An unimproved, carry-in DNR public access is located on the west shoreline.  Boat access can be obtained through the DNR public access located on adjacent Deer Lake.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and common cattail are located at various locations around the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> \n     A moderate density Northern Pike population exists.  Age and length data from recent surveys indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 11.2 to 27.3 inches with an average length and weight of 18.3 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 18.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that there is a balanced Largemouth Bass population.  Age data indicate bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 7.4 to 19.9 inches with an average length and weight of 12.5 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Bass reach an average length of 14.0 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     The Bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for similar lakes.  Bluegill size structure remains good with 48% of the Bluegill sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills reach an average length of 7.0 inches at six years of age.  <br> \n     The Walleye test-net catch rate was within the normal range for similar lakes.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.8 to 27.2 inches with an average length and weight of 16.5 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleyes reach an average length of 16.5 inches at five years of age.       <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     East Lost Lake is a 501-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately five miles north of Battle Lake, MN.  The Otter Tail River flows through East Lost Lake, which is approximately three river miles downstream from Otter Tail Lake. The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  East Lost Lake has a maximum depth of 36 feet; however, 65% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading, which is a standard measure of water clarity, was 10.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.2 to 10.2 feet.   <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cabins.  An unimproved, carry-in DNR public access is located on the west shoreline. Boat access can be obtained through the DNR public access located on adjacent Deer Lake.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and common cattail are located at various locations around the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.  With recent high water levels, shoreline erosion has become an increasing concern for lakeshore owners.  By using shoreline best management practices (BMP's) and \"lakescaping\" concepts, impacts of development and shoreline erosion can be minimized.  Contact any County Extension Office for information on BMP's and the local DNR Fisheries Office for information on lakescaping techniques. <br> \n     The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the normal range for similar lakes.  Age and length data from recent surveys indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 10.4 to 23.3 inches with an average length and weight of 16.4 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Northern pike reach an average length of 19.3 inches at age three. <br> \n     Data from recent assessments indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Age data indicate bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 8.6 to 15.4 inches with an average length and weight of 12.4 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Bass reach an average length of 11.7 at age four. <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for similar lakes; however, it was the lowest recorded for this lake.  Bluegill size structure remains good with 27% of the bluegill sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills reach an average length of 7.0 inches at age six.  <br> \n     The walleye test-net catch rate was within the normal range for similar lakes.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.5 to 23.7 inches with an average length and weight of 16.7 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Walleyes reach an average length of 15.3 inches at age four.       <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff conducted a targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on July 31, 2017. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with three sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at five sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 21 native species of fish including six species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) as well as one tolerant species (Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  The FIBI score for East Lost Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

There has been a decline in average size from 2.8 lbs. to 1.6 lbs.  Ages I+ to VI+ were well represented in the age-class distribution.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased to 70.8 per trap net lift. Growth appears to be average.  Length data indicate an increase in the number of bluegills greater than 7.0 inches compared to 1983.  Largemouth bass abundance is nearly four times the area median, which is similar to the 1983 survey.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance was 4.3 per gill net lift.  This is the highest walleye catch rate recorded for this lake.  The average weight of walleye declined from 1.5 lbs. In 1983 to 0.9 lbs.  Ageing information indicates that the strongest year class is age-III+, which corresponds to a skip year in the stocking sequence. This year class was also well represented in the Deer Lake survey and may indicate good walleye natural reproduction or a significant annual migration (drift) of walleye fry from Otter Tail Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     East Lost Lake is a 501-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately five miles north of Battle Lake, MN.  The Otter Tail River flows through East Lost Lake, which is approximately three river miles downstream from Otter Tail Lake. The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  East Lost Lake has a maximum depth of 36 feet; however, 65% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 11.5 feet.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.2 to 11.5 feet.   <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cabins.  An unimproved, carry-in DNR public access is located on the west shoreline.  Boat access can be obtained through the DNR public access located on adjacent Deer Lake.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and common cattail are located at various locations around the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 9.6 to 19.7 inches with an average length and weight of 15.2 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill size structure remains good with 53% of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length and 10% measuring 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.5 inches at six years of age.    <br> \n     A low density Northern Pike population exists.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 12.2 to 32.2 inches with an average length and weight of 19.7 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 20.1 inches at four years of age.    <br> \n     A Lake Sturgeon re-introduction plan was implemented in 2002 when yearling Lake Sturgeon were stocked into Otter Tail Lake.  Lake Sturgeon fingerlings have been stocked into Otter Tail Lake on an annual basis since 2004 and will be stocked annually through 2022.  The objective of the re-introduction plan is to re-establish a self-sustaining Lake Sturgeon population in the Otter Tail River system.  Lake Sturgeon sampled in the 2019 standard survey ranged in length from 28.9 to 52.9 inches with an average length and weight of 36.8 inches and 6.4 pounds. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     <br> \n     East Lost Lake was designated as infested with zebra mussels in 2017.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  <br> \n</p>",
