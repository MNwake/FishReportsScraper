All year classes above II+ were well represented.  Natural reproduction excellent.  Quality size fish were abundant in the sample.Bluegill:  Net catches of bluegill were high and growth rates are slow.  Sixty-three percent of the bluegill were over seven inches in length in the 1969 survey compared with seven percent in 1987.  Quality size bluegill appear to have greatly declined.Black Crappie:  Net catches of black crappie are fairly high indicating a good population.  All year classes are well represented and growth rate is good.Walleye:  Walleye catch was low and made up of older fish.  No natural reproduction evident during this survey.  Stocking records and the 1981 survey indicated good natural reproduction.</p>",
