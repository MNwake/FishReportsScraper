                "narrative": "<p>     East Silent Lake is a 310-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles west of Dent, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 45 feet; however, 18% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 20.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 12.5 to 22.0 feet. <br> \n    The east shoreline of East Silent Lake has been extensively developed.  Development is also scattered along the north and south shorelines.  Homes, cabins, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A county owned public water access is located off of County Road 41 along the west shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as hardstem bulrush or common cattail are extremely rare. <br> \n     Walleye and Northern Pike are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community of East Silent Lake.   <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 10.4 to 27.0 inches with an average length and weight of 17.7 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike ranged in length from 16.7 to 33.9 inches with an average length and weight of 22.1 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Northern Pike growth is fast with an average length of 26.1 inches at four years of age.        <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality fishing that this lake has to offer by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n     East Silent Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2018.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     East Silent Lake is a 310-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles west of Dent, MN.  The immediate watershed is primarily composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 45 feet and 18% of the lake is fifteen feet or less.  The secchi disk reading was 12.6 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 12.5 22.0 feet. <br> \n    The east shoreline of East Silent Lake has been extensively developed.  Development is also scattered along the north and south shorelines.  Homes, cabins, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A county owned public water access is located off of County Road 41 along the west shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as hardstem bulrush or common cattail are extremely rare. <br> \n     East Silent Lake is a popular Walleye angling lake.  Walleye is a primary management specie and data from recent lake surveys indicate that they are abundant.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.2 to 25.0 inches with an average length and weight of 15.9 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Walleye growth is fast as they attain an average length of 15.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     A low-density Northern Pike population exists due to a lack of suitable spawning habitat.  Pike ranged in length from 16.7 to 30.8 inches with an average length and weight of 22.2 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Northern Pike grow fast with an average length of 23.1 inches at four years of age.        <br> \n     Bluegills are abundant.  Bluegill size structure is good as 44% were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.2 inches at six years of age.    <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality fishing that this lake has to offer by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Silent Lake is located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles west of Dent, MN.  East Silent Lake is a 310-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The immediate watershed is primarily composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of East Silent Lake is 48 feet.  The secchi disk reading during the 2000 lake survey was 16.0 feet which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 12.5 to 18.5 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics of the lakes.  East Silent Lake is included in lake class 23 of this classification scheme.  East Silent Lake is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.       The east shoreline of East Silent Lake has been extensively developed.  Development is also scattered along the north and south shorelines.  Homes, cabins, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  Thirty-three homes/cabins and two resorts were counted during the 2000 lake survey.  A county owned public water access is located off of County Highway 41 along the west shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as hardstem bulrush or common cattail are rare.     East Silent Lake is a popular walleye angling lake.  Walleye is the primary management specie and data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye are abundant.  The test-net catch rate of walleye in the 2000 survey exceeds the upper limit of the normal range for class 23 lakes.  The walleye test-net catch rate has exceeded the upper limit in every survey conducted on East Silent Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.5 to 21.9 inches with an average length and weight of 13.0 inches and 0.8 pounds.  The 1998 year class appears to be strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.7 inches at four years of age.  Growth rates are equivalent to average growth rates for walleye in class 23 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.       Data from recent test-netting and electrofishing assessments indicate that walleye natural reproduction can be substantial and that it is contributing significantly to the walleye population.  Strong year classes that are the result of natural reproduction appear to be maintaining the walleye population above management goals.  This is an indication of the excellent water quality and walleye spawning habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent walleye fishing that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the water quality and spawning habitat.       Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    </p>",

The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 45 feet; however, 18% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2022 survey was 14.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 12.5 to 22.0 feet. <br> \n    The east shoreline of East Silent Lake has been extensively developed.  Development is also scattered along the north and south shorelines.  Homes, cabins, and two resorts compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned public water access is located off of County Road 41 along the west shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as hardstem bulrush and common cattail are extremely rare. <br> \n     Walleye and Northern Pike are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community of East Silent Lake; however, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie abundance has increased in recent surveys. <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has declined over the most recent series of surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 11.3 to 23.7 inches with an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has increased slightly over the most recent series of surveys.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 11.8 to 29.5 inches with an average length and weight of 19.0 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 25.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 8.7 to 18.9 inches with an average length and weight of 12.3 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Smallmouth Bass attain an average length of 13.8 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Black Crappies ranged in length from 4.4 to 12.4 inches with an average length of 9.9 inches.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 9.9 at five years of age.        <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality fishing that this lake has to offer by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n     East Silent Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2018.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
