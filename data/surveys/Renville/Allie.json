                "narrative": "<p>Lake Allie, Renville County, is a 451 acre lake with a maximum depth of 12 feet.  During the July 25, 2000, population assessment eleven species (including hybrid sunfish) of fish were sampled.  The lake management plan lists walleye and black crappie as primary management species.  Northern pike and black bullhead are listed as secondary management species.A total of 131 walleye were sampled by gill nets for a catch rate of 14.6 per net.  Walleye ranged in length from 3.6 to 19.3 inches and averaged 15.7 inches.  Average weight was 1.4 pounds.  The catch rate was within the expected range for lakes of this type.  Growth was average.  Walleye fry (1,000 per littoral acre) are stocked on a two-out-of-three-year rotation.A total of 683 black crappie were sampled by trap net for a catch rate of 75.9 per net.  Black crappie ranged in length from 3.8 to 7.8 inches and averaged 6.1 inches.  All black crappie sampled were age I and growth was fast.  The catch rate was above the expected range.A total of nine northern pike were sampled for a catch rate of 1.0 per net.  Northern pike ranged in length from 9.6 to 25.7 inches and averaged 19.3 inches.  Average weight was 2.0 pounds.  The catch rate was below the expected range.  Growth was average. Northern pike were young-of-the-year to three years old with four year classes represented.  The northern pike spawning area was operated in the spring.  An unknown number of frylings and 16 adults were released into Lake Allie.A total of 733 bluegill were sampled by trap net for a catch rate of 85.9 per net.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3.2 to 7.2 inches and averaged 4.6 inches.  The catch rate was above the expected range.  Growth was fast and four year classes were present.  A total of 22 channel catfish were sampled by gill net for a catch rate of 2.4 per net.  Channel catfish ranged in length from 6.8 to 24.1 inches and averaged 18.1 inches.  Channel catfish were last stocked in 1989.  Ageing catfish spines revealed that most of the fish present were a result of natural reproduction.  Channel catfish were II to XIV years old.A total of 19 black bullhead were sampled by gill net for a catch rate of 2.1 per net.  Black bullhead ranged in length from 5.2 to 12.3 inches and averaged 9.7 inches.Erosion of banks, due to increased water levels after an outlet structure was built in 1960s, has been a problem on Lake Allie.  A number of projects have recently taken place to correct erosion.  Rock rip-rap to stabilize banks and a tree drop project have been implemented to reduce erosion and increase fish habitat.  A trail for shore anglers was also constructed at the county park. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Allie Lake in 2008 to evaluate a 2006 yellow perch stocking effort and to document the status of the fish population following the 2007-2008 partial winterkill.  A total of 12 different species of fish were sampled, plus hybrid sunfish.  Based on summer net catches the partial winterkill that occurred on Allie was not severe.  Stocking efforts in 2008 were based on presence/absence results found during a spring trap netting assessment.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 44 walleye for a catch rate of 4.9/net, which was in the normal range for lakes of this classification.  The 2005 catch rate was 6.4/net.  Walleye were 6.7 to 19.6 inches long averaging 11.5 inches.  Walleye were 1 to 5 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Age 1 fish made up 55% of the gill net sample.  Approximately 53% of the gill netted walleye were less than 8.5 inches in length.  A total of 461,000 fry were stocked in 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 7 northern pike for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was also low at 0.2/net.  Catch rates from 1992 onward have all been low.  Northern pike were 16.3 to 21.3 inches long averaging 19.6 inches.  Trap nets sampled pike up to 34.5 inches in length.  Northern pike were 1 to 5 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.  A total of 108,000 fry were stocked in 2008.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 53 yellow perch for a catch rate of 5.9/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 0.9/net.  Yellow perch were 5.7 to 9.7 inches long averaging 7.4 inches.  Approximately 8% of the gill net catch was 9 inches or longer.  Yellow perch were 1 to 5 years old with 5 year-classes present.  The 2006 year-class accounted for 55% of the sample, possibly indicating that the stocking effort that year was somewhat successful.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 19 channel catfish for a catch rate of 2.1/net.  The 2005 catch rate was 1.3/net.  Channel catfish were 14.8 to 26.7 inches long averaging 20.9 inches.  Natural reproduction continued to sustain this introduced species. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 69 carp for a catch rate of 7.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 5.6/net.  Carp were 17.7 to 31.6 inches long averaging 21.4 inches.  The trap net catch rate was 3.6/net. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 3 black bullhead for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was also 0.3/net.  High numbers of black bullhead have not been trap netted since the 1994 assessment.  Black bullhead were 5.4 to 11.5 inches long averaging 9.3 inches.  Trap nets did not sample any black or yellow bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 10 black crappie for a catch rate of 1.1/net, which was below the normal range.  The 2005 catch rate was also low (1.4/net).  High numbers of black crappie have not been trap netted since the 2000 assessment.  Black crappie were 8.0 to 11.9 inches long averaging 8.9 inches.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers of black crappie.  Black crappie were not stocked  following the winterkill, since survivors were found during the spring trap netting assessment. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 34 bluegill for a catch rate of 3.8/net, which was within the normal range.   The 2005 catch rate was 1.8/net.  Bluegill have not been sampled in high numbers since the 2000 assessment.  Bluegill were 4.7 to 9.5 inches long averaging 6.7 inches.  Approximately 12% of the trap net catch was 8 inches or longer.  A total of 126 adult bluegill were stocked in the spring of 2008. <br> \n <br> \nSporadic good fishing, mainly walleye, can be had at Allie Lake and angling opportunities should improve with time.</p>",

White sucker and carp are present in numbers at and below the local median catches: 0.5 and 1.75, respectively.  Black bullheads are abundant (21.25/trapnet).  All species are known to have reproduced in Lake Allie this year.  Growth of bluegills is average while black crappies grow more slowly, averaging only 5.53 inches after four years of growth.  Winter fishing pressure is light, but open water angling can be explosive for bluegills.</p>",

Growth rates of walleye were above average.  Northern pike catch rates were 4.0 per gillnet set, which is about average for this area.  Growth rates were above average.  All northern pike sampled were age 4 or less with 42% being 2 year old fish.  Bluegill and largemouth bass were present in insignificant numbers.  The lack of large numbers of bluegills is quite different from previous investigations and surveys.  This is probably due to recent erosion problems.  Black crappie have become rather abundant at 22.5 per gillnet set and 26.5 per trapnet set.  These gillnet values exceed state medians by a factor 11 and local values by a factor of 2.  Black crappie growth rates greatly exceed state values.  Black crappie were all 4 years old or less, with a median length of 6.2\".  Yellow perch population was significantly greater than either state or local values.  Gillnet catches of yellow perch were 161.5 per net (state value = 8.0 and local value = 45.86).  Black bullhead catch rates of 380.3/trapnet set were more than 37 times local values.  Black bullheads had an average length of 8.2 inches.  Carp and white sucker were present in insignificant numbers.  Channel catfish, total length between 13 and 26 inches, were present.  Gillnet catch rate for channel catfish was 4 per set.  This catch rate is probably on the low side for lakes with populations of channel catfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nNet catch data was compared to similar lake class 40 lakes around the state to assess relative abundance.  Catch rates for most species were substantially lower than in the previous assessment competed in 1987.  Game fish species sampled included northern pike, channel catfish, bluegill, largemouth bass, white crappie, black crappie, yellow perch and walleye.  Carp and black bullhead were also sampled.  Northern pike were captured at a rate of 0.17/gillnet, which was below the normal range for the lake class and well below the median of 5.33/gillnet.  Historical data shows that northern pike catch rates have generally been in the normal range for the lake class.  No stocking has been conducted since 1989.  From 1985 to 1989 a northern pike spawning area was operated on Lake Allie.  The reasons for the low northern pike catch rates are not clear, but may be attributed to a lack of high quality spawning areas and subsequent inconsistencies in natural reproduction.  Catch rates of walleye (1.17/gillnet) were below the normal range for the lake class and were substantially lower than the 7.75/gillnet catch rate observed in 1987.  Although the catch rate in 1987 was an all-time high for Lake Allie, the current catch is lower than present management objectives.  The low catch rates observed in the current assessment are likely due to the stocking pattern over the last seven years.  Records show a three year gap in stocking from 1987 to 1989.  Since all fish in the sample were age 3 or older, all fish sampled had to come from either the 1984 or the 1986 fingerling stockings, or possibly from natural reproduction.  Although natural reproduction is possible, walleye may also have come from adjacent Preston Lake, which was stocked with walleye fry in 1986 and 1988.  Young-of-the-year walleye were sampled in shoreline seines during this assessment.  Since no fry or fingerling stocking had been done, it appears that at least some natural reproduction is occurring.  Revised management plans for Lake Allie and Lake Preston will coordinate walleye stockings to allow better evaluations of stocking success and contributions from natural reproduction.  Catch rates of panfish were generally low.  Black crappie (5.75/trapnet) were the only panfish species captured at a rate higher than the lake class median (1.82/trapnet).  Yellow perch (0.17/gillnet) and white crappie (0.75/trapnet) were well below their respective lake class medians of 15.8/gillnet and 13.2/trapnet.  Catch rates of bluegill (0.38/trapnet) were below the normal range for the lake class.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Allie can be characterized as a shallow, turbid lake with little aquatic vegetation.  The resulting lack of cover and food production may limit bass and panfish populations in Lake Allie.A fisheries survey conducted on Lake Allie in 1994 included assessment of fish populations with lake survey gillnets,trapnets, shoreline seining and night electrofishing in the fall.Fish species of particular interest captured in the survey included black bullhead, black crappie, white crappie,bluegill, channel catfish, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch.Black bullhead were abundant, with net catches above the normal range for this lake class.  Black bullhead ranged in length from 6 to 9 inches with an average length of 8 inches.  Lake Allie can provide good angling for bullhead.The black crappie gillnet catch was below the normal range for this lake class and trapnet catches were within the normal range.  Average lengths of black crappie caught in gillnets and trapnets was 8.3 and 9.1 inches, respectively.  Two year classes of fish (age three and six) dominated the catch.  Young-of-year (YOY) black crappie were sampled in shoreline seine hauls, indicating natural reproduction occurred this year.  Lake Allie occasionally produces good catches of black crappie, dependent upon year class strengths. Bluegill numbers were low.  Ten bluegill were captured in trapnets for a catch rate of 1.1 per net.  Bluegillreproduction may not be consistent, as indicated by several missing year classes.  Average length of bluegill sampled intrapnets was nearly 8 inches.Lake Allie can provide good angling opportunities for catfish. Six channel catfish were sampled in gillnets and one intrapnets.  Channel catfish sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 14 to 22 inches.  Average length was 18 inches.  Channel catfish were also sampled while night electrofishing in the fall.  Channel catfish were last stocked in Lake Allie in 1989 and it is not known to what extent stocking or natural reproduction contributes to the population.Northern pike numbers were low and may be limited by a lack of suitable spawning habitat.  Past surveys have usuallydocumented low northern pike numbers.  Only four northern pike were sampled in gillnets and two in trapnets.  Most of the northern pike sampled were age one and two.The walleye gillnet catch of 2.6 per net was below the lake class average, but within the normal range.  Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 7 to 27 inches.  Average length was 15 inches.  Several age classes of walleye were present.  Though some year classes correlate with stocking records, the extent that stocked fish contribute to the population is unknown.  Surveys have indicated that walleye natural reproduction does occur in Lake Allie.Only three yellow perch were sampled during the survey.  Past surveys have documented wide fluctuations in yellow perchabundance.Several largemouth bass YOY were collected during fall night electrofishing and while shoreline seining.  No adultlargemouth bass were sampled during the survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey (summer gill netting and trap netting) was conducted at Allie in 2015 to evaluate the lake's fish population.  Walleye were the primary management species, while northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill were listed as secondary management species in the lake management plan.  Winterkill was rare at this lake with the latest event occurring in 2008, but fish populations can fluctuate greatly when these events do occur.  In 2015, the water clarity was fair.  A fishing pier was present at the Allie Lake County Park on the west side of the lake.  Curlyleaf pondweed, an invasive aquatic plant, can be somewhat abundant at this lake, especially in May and June.      <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (146) of walleye for a catch rate of 24.3/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake, and the highest ever measured at Allie.  The 2008 catch rate was 4.9/net.  Past catch rates, from 1976 to 2015, were variable, ranging from 0.0/net to 24.3/net with an average of 6.2/net.  In 2015, gill netted walleye were 10.4 to 23.3 inches long with an average of 13.7 inches.  Approximately 89% of the gill net catch was 12 inches or longer and 30% were 14 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Gill netted walleye were 1 to 11 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Age-1 fish (18) corresponded to a year when fry were not stocked in Allie, accounting for 12% of the gill net sample and indicated that natural reproduction was occurring.  For fish that were aged, all other year-classes from both gill net aged fish (88%) and trap net aged fish (100%) matched up with years when walleye fry were stocked.  However, those year-classes could actually be from stocking, natural reproduction, or some combination of both.  The 2013 year-class was very strong, accounting for 74% of the gill net catch.  Growth was moderate for Allie Lake walleye.  The latest walleye fry stocking regime (509,000 fry two-out-of-three years) was initiated in 1994.  Gill net catch rates during this time period (2000, 2005, 2008, and 2015) ranged from 4.9 to 24.3/net with an average of 12.6/net, possibly indicating a successful stocking strategy.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of northern pike (10) for a catch rate of 1.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was 0.8/net.  Catch rates from 1976 to 2015 were mostly low, ranging from 0.2/net to 4.0/net with an average of 1.8/net.  In 2015, gill netted northern pike were 16.4 to 29.8 inches long with an average of 21.2 inches.  Northern pike were not aged in 2015, but the size distribution indicated that multiple year-classes were present.  Northern pike were last stocked in 2008, following a winterkill.  A lack of quality spawning habitat was likely a limiting factor on northern pike at Allie Lake.  Northern pike also tend to do better in lakes with clearer water and moderate amounts of submergent vegetation throughout the year.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (29) of yellow perch for a catch rate of 4.8/net, but this was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was similar at 5.9/net.  Catch rates from 1976 to 2015 were variable, ranging from 0.2/net to 161.5/net with an average of 34.2/net.  Yellow perch have not been sampled in high numbers since the 1987 assessment (161.5/net).  In 2015, gill netted yellow perch were 6.5 to 10.1 inches long with an average of 8.7 inches.  Approximately 37% of the gill net catch was 9 inches or longer, which should appeal to yellow perch anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (7) of channel catfish for a catch rate of 1.2/net.  The 2008 catch rate was 2.1/net.  Historic gill net catch rates from 1976 to 2015 ranged from 0.0/net to 4.0/net with an average of 1.4/net.  In 2015, channel catfish were 10.2 inches to 26.6 inches long with an average of 16.6 inches.  Size distributions indicated that multiple year-classes were present.  Allie was last stocked in 1989, so all of the channel catfish were likely the result of natural reproduction.      <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (7) of black crappie for a catch rate of 1.2/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 and 2008 catch rates were also low at 1.0/net and 1.1/net, respectively.  Catch rates from 1976 to 2015 were variable, ranging from 0.0/net to 95.5/net with an average of 19.2/net.  In 2015, black crappie were 6.3 to 7.2 inches long with an average of 6.8 inches.  Trap nets sampled 3 black crappies for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the normal range, and the lowest ever measured at Allie.  The 2008 (1.1/net) and 2005 (1.4/net) trap net catch rates were also low.  Historic trap net catch rates from 1976 to 2015 were variable, ranging from 0.3/net to 75.9/net with an average of 23.6/net.  Allie Lake may not be a large enough lake to support both high numbers of walleye (24.3/gill net) and black crappie, leading to the current imbalance.  Adult walleye may be preying on young black crappie, limiting their recruitment.    <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (18) of bluegill for a catch rate of 2.0/net, but this was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was also low at 3.8/net.  Catch rates from 1976 to 2015 were variable, ranging from 0.4 to 492.0/net with an average of 76.1/net.  Bluegill were 3.2 to 9.3 inches long with an average of 5.6 inches.  Approximately 28% of the trap net catch was 8 inches or longer, indicating that quality-sized fish were present.  The stocking of 14 pounds (126 fish) of bluegill in 2008, following the winterkill, failed to increase the 2015 catch rate and produce a significant fishery at Allie Lake.  Quality habitat; clear water and moderate amounts of submergent vegetation throughout the year, was likely limiting the Allie Lake bluegill population.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (6) of common carp for a catch rate of 1.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was 7.7/net.  Catch rates from 1976 to 2015 were variable, ranging from 0.0/net to 7.7/net with an average of 2.7/net.  Gill netted common carp were 4.2 to 27.8 inches long.  The 2015 trap net catch rate was high (57.1/net), which was well above the normal range and the highest ever recorded at Allie.  This likely indicated that a strong year-class was produced in 2014 or 2015.  The 2008 trap net catch rate was 3.6/net.  Catch rates from 1976 to 2015 were variable, ranging from 0.6/net to 57.1/net with an average of 8.3/net.  Trap netted carp were 2.8 inches to 27.95 inches long with an average of 6.1 inches.  Common carp have likely had negative impacts on the aquatic plant community at Allie Lake for many years.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (1) of black bullhead for a catch rate of 0.1/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The catch rate in 2008 was 0.0/net.  Historic catch rates from 1976 to 2015 were variable, ranging from 0.0/net to 380.3/net with an average of 72.4/net.  The trap netted black bullhead was 7.3 inches long.  Gill nets sampled low numbers (1) of black bullhead for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below the normal range and the lowest ever recorded at Allie Lake.  The 2008 catch rate was 0.3/net.  Catch rates from 1976 to 2015 were highly variable ranging from 0.2 to 309.6/net with an average of 108.5/net.  The gill netted black bullhead was 7.9 inches long.  Both trap net and gill net data indicate that some type of ecological shift had happened to the black bullhead population over the last 15 to 20 years.  High numbers of predators (walleye and channel catfish) may have contributed to low numbers of black bullhead in Allie Lake.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Allie Lake beginning on July 8, 2019, to monitor the lake's fish population and to evaluate the 1994 Walleye fry stocking regime.  Allie is a class 43 lake and net catches were compared to other similar lakes around the state.  The 2016 MNDNR Fisheries lake management plan (LMP) listed Walleye as the only primary management species at Allie Lake.  Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Northern Pike were listed as secondary management species.  In 2019, a total of 11 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets (GN) and trap nets (TN).  The dissolved oxygen concentration was 5.0 mg/l, just off the bottom in 12 feet of water, indicating that fish could be found throughout the entire water column this time of year.  Water clarity was fair to poor with a secchi disk reading of 4.5 feet, due to an algae bloom.  Allie has a rare history of winterkill, but a partial kill did occur in 2008.  A fishing pier is available at the Renville County RV Park on the lake's west shore.  Curlyleaf pondweed, a type a submergent vegetation, can be abundant in May and June at Allie, occasionally reaching nuisance levels in parts of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Walleye (48) for a catch rate of 5.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2016 LMP's long range goal for Walleye (4.0 to 18.0/net) was met.  Walleye were the most abundant fish sampled by GN in 2019.  The 2015 GN catch rate was higher at 24.3/net.  The latest six GN catch rates (1994 to 2019) were all within the lake class normal range (2.3 to 18.1) or above it.  Historical catch rates from 1976 to 2019 (n=12), under various Walleye stocking regimes, were variable ranging from 0.0 to 24.3/net with an average of 6.1.  In 2019, gill netted Walleye were 9.5 to 24.4 inches long, averaging 17.1 inches.  Trap nets sampled Walleye up to 25.8 inches in length.  Gill netted Walleye were estimated to be age-1 to age-7 with seven year classes present.  None of the year classes were ranked as being strong, but the 2016 and 2017 year classes were considered moderate in size.  Growth for age-3 fish was fast.  In 2019, non-stocked years accounted for 28% of the GN aged Walleye, indicating that natural reproduction was occurring.  The contribution from natural reproduction during fry stocked years remained unknown, due to the inability to differentiate between the two groups.  Gill net catch rates from 2000 to 2019 (n=5), during the 1994 stocking regime (509,000 fry stocked 2 of 3 years), ranged from 4.9 to 24.3/net with an average of 11.1, possibly indicating a successful fry stocking strategy.  Walleye anglers can usually expect decent action at Allie Lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Northern Pike (5) for a catch rate of 0.6/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2015 catch rate was also low at 1.7/net.  The 2016 LMP's long range goal (>1.1/net) was not met.  Historic catch rates from 1976 to 2019 (n=12) were all low, ranging from 0.2 to 4.0/net with an average of 1.7/GN.  Historically, recruitment would be classified as low, despite numerous stockings (1970's through the 2000's).  Northern Pike were last stocked in 2008, following a partial winterkill.  In 2019, gill netted Northern Pike were 21.8 to 25.7 inches long with an average of 23.8 inches.  Trap nets sampled Northern Pike up to 33.2 inches in length.  Low Northern Pike abundance over the last 30 years has likely allowed Walleye to flourish at Allie Lake.  Allie is included in the 2018 Northern Pike Southern Management Zone regulation area, adopted in 2018, which has a 24 inch minimum size limit in place (all pike less than 24 inches must be immediately released) and two fish bag limit designed to increase pike abundance, take advantage of fast growth, and improve the size of harvested fish.   <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (5) of Black Crappie in 2019 for a catch rate of 0.6/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  This was the second lowest TN catch rate ever measured at Allie Lake.  The 2016 LMP's long range goal (>1.2) was not met.  The 2015 Black Crappie TN catch rate was 0.3/net, the lowest ever recorded.  Historic TN catch rates from 1976 to 2019 (n=12) were highly variable, ranging from 0.3 to 75.9/net with an average of 21.7.  The four most recent TN catch rates (2005 to 2019) have all indicated low abundance for this species.  In 2019, trap netted Black Crappie were 5.2 to 12.8 inches long with an average of 8.9 inches.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers (2) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was also below the normal range for this type of lake.  This was the second lowest Black Crappie GN catch rate ever recorded at Allie.  The latest four GN catch rates (2005 to 2019) were all low, indicating unusually low abundance over the last 14 years.  Historic GN catch rates from 1976 to 2019 (n=12) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 95.5/net with an average of 17.7.  In 2019, the two gill netted Black Crappie were 5.7 and 8.7 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers of Bluegill (159) for a catch rate of 17.7/net which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Bluegill were the most abundant fish sampled in 2019 TN's.  The 2016 LMP's Bluegill long-range goal (maintain presence) was met.  The 2005, 2008, and 2015 catch rates were much lower, ranging from 1.8 to 3.8/net.  Historic TN catch rates from 1976 to 2019 (n=12) were highly variable, ranging from 0.4 to 492.0/net, with an average of 71.3.  Bluegill were last stocked in 2008, following the partial winterkill.  That stocking effort appeared to have had little effect, as the TN catch rate in 2015 was only 2.0/net.  In 2019, trap netted Bluegill were 2.8 to 9.7 inches long averaging 5.3 inches.  Approximately 22% of the catch was 6 inches longer.  The TN fish length table indicated that two or three younger year classes made up the majority of the catch, and that recruitment had become more consistent since the 2015 survey.  The exact reason for the increased recruitment was unknown.  As of 2019, Bluegill anglers could expect decent action from mostly smaller sized fish, but keeper sized fish were also present.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Channel Catfish (7) for a catch rate of 0.8/net, indicating low abundance for this species.  The 2015 GN catch rate (1.2/net) was also low.  Historic catch rates from 1976 to 2019 (n=12) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 4.0/net with an average of 1.3.  In 2019, gill netted Channel Catfish were 15.3 to 27.7 inches long averaging an impressive 24.8 inches.  Channel Catfish were last stocked in 1989.  The GN and TN fish length tables indicated that catfish recruitment was inconsistent, but the species has persisted through natural reproduction for many years. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (41) for a catch rate of 4.6/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Yellow Perch have not been sampled in high numbers at Allie since 1987 (161.5/net).  All GN catches since 1987 (n=7) were less than 6.0/net.  Historic perch GN catch rates from 1976 to 2019 (n=12) were highly variable ranging from 0.2 to 161.5/net with an average of 31.8.  In 2019, gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.4 to 8.8 inches long averaging 6.1 inches.  Yellow Perch are an important forage item for Walleye at Allie Lake, and likely at sizes too small to be picked up in gill nets and trap nets.  Occasionally, anglers get into a few 9 to 10 inch perch at Allie. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers of Common Carp (34) for a catch rate of 3.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic carp TN catch rates (n=12) from 1976 to 2019 were highly variable, ranging from 0.6 to 57.1/net with an average of 7.9.  In 2019, trap netted Common Carp were 18.7 to 31.1 inches long averaging 22.5 inches.  Gill nets sampled moderate numbers of Common Carp (22) for a catch rate of 2.4/net, which was also within the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic GN catch rates were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 7.7/net with an average of 2.7.  In 2019, gill netted Common Carp were 19.6 to 29.3 inches long with an average of 22.1.  Nothing fights like a carp, and anglers and bow fishermen should have decent luck at Allie.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets did not sample any Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.0/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake, and the lowest catch on record at Allie.  The latest five catch rates (2000 to 2019) were all less than 2.2/net, indicating that low numbers were present over the last 20 years.  Historic GN catch rates from 1976 to 2019 (n=12) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 309.6/net with an average of 99.5.  In 2019, trap nets also failed to sample any Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.0/net which was below the lake's normal range and tied for the lowest catch on record at Allie.  Trap net catches (n=5), from 2000 to 2019, showed a similar pattern to GN catches during that time period, with all the TN catch rates being less than 0.4/net, indicating very low abundance.  Data indicated that an ecological shift, favoring lower numbers of Black Bullhead, had occurred over the last 20 years, but the exact reason for the trend was unknown.  Bullhead anglers may want to try a different lake.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional fishes sampled in the standard gear included; Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, Shovelnose Sturgeon (first time sampled at Allie, likely an illegal stocking), and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

However, black crappies were not taken in such abundance as in 1976: 14.0/trapnet (1977) and 50.75/trapnet (1976).  White crappies and bluegill (age II) are abundant (white crappies 661/trapnet) and exhibit normal growth rates.  Yellow perch are numerous at 46.5/gillnet, and of a large size averaging 6.0 inches.  The only species collected in natural reproduction checks (seining) were bluegills and white crappies.  Largemouth bass were absent from 1977 net catches though fishing is reported fair for this species.  There is local fishing pressure for black bullheads a Lake Allie.  Carp population appears to be at low level.  A helixor aeration system was installed at Lake Allie during winter 1977 and will be operating annually in order to prevent oxygen depletion and subsequent winterkill of gamefish.  A cooperative northern pike rearing pond is operated at Lake Allie.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Allie to monitor the lake's physical, chemical and biological charecteristics.  The lakes watershed is dominated by row crop agriculture and a thin wooded fringe surrounds much of the lake.  A small fishing pier was recently installed at the county park.  Patches of curly-leaf pondweed were common in May and June, but submergent vegetation was otherwise rare at Allie.    Moderate numbers of walleye were gill netted, ranging from 7.5-24.1 inches in length and averaging 14.3 inches.  Walleye fry are stocked on a two-out-of-three year rotation.  Low numbers of northern pike were gill netted, which is typical for Allie Lake.  Pike up to 29.3 inches were sampled.  Fair numbers of channel catfish were gill netted, ranging in size from 12.8-22.1 inches.  Channel catfish were last stocked in 1989, indicating that natural reproduction is sustaining the population.  Low numbers of bluegill were trap netted, but sizes were nice.  Approximately 69% of the sample was 7.5 inches or longer, and fish up to 9.0 inches were present.  Spring night-time electrofishing was used to sample the largemouth bass population and low numbers of fish were captured.  Bass were 12.7-14.7 inches long.  Summer trap nets also sampled low numbers of largmouth bass, but larger fish, up to 19.3 inches, were present.  The 2005 black crappie trap net catch rate was the lowest ever observed at Allie.  Black crappie were 7.6-11.1 inches long, averaging 8.4 inches.  Moderate numbers of carp were gill netted averaging 18.3 inches.  Only 3 black bullhead were gill netted in 2005.      </p>",
