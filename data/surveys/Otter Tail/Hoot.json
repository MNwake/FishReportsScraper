                "narrative": "<p>Hoot Lake is located in southwest Otter Tail County one mile northeast of Fergus Falls, MN.  Hoot Lake is a 155-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is part of the Otter Tail River flowage.  The Otter Tail River enters the lake in the northeast corner and the outlet is at the south end of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of homes and cabins except for the northern portion of the lake, which consists of mixed hardwoods and pasture.  The maximum depth of Hoot Lake is 20 feet; however, 41% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2001 lake survey was 8.5 feet, which indicates good water clarity.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  Hoot Lake is included in Lake class 31 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.  Hoot Lake is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.     The majority of the shoreline of Hoot Lake is developed.  The 1985 resurvey identified 48 homes/cottages on the lake.  A city owned public access is located off of County Highway One along the south shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand, gravel, and rubble.   A narrow band of hardstem bulrush and wild rice infringe the entire shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling within this lake it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     Hoot Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake but is managed to include a viable walleye fishery, as well.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch, and walleye are the dominant game species in the lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat available within the lake and the river segments up and down stream.     Northern pike abundance increased since the 1996 survey and falls within the normal range for lake class 31.  Age and length data from recent lake surveys indicate that northern pike recruitment is consistent.  The mean length of northern pike sampled in the gill nets was 22.5 inches.  Pike attain a mean length of 22.0 inches at five years of age.  Growth rate estimates exceed the mean growth rates for northern pike in lake class 31 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     The bluegill test-net catch rate was lower than the two previous lake surveys but was still within the normal range for class 31 lakes.  The length frequency distributions indicate bluegill reproduction to be consistent in Hoot Lake.  Twenty-three percent of the bluegills in the trap net sample were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  The mean length of bluegills in the trap net sample was 6.1 inches.  Bluegills attain a mean length of 7.1 inches at seven years of age, which is within the normal range of growth for lake class 31.     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that Hoot Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population with consistent natural reproduction.  Bass ranged in length from 9.1 to 17.9 inches with an average length and weight of 13.6 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Largemouth bass attain a mean length of 10.4 inches at five years of age.  Growth rate estimates are about normal for largemouth bass in lake class 31 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     Twenty crappies were collected during gill net and trap net sampling.  The population level remains similar to the level of previous surveys.  Age data indicates consistent crappie natural reproduction since the last survey in 1996.  Black crappie ranged in length from 5.7 to 10.3 inches with a mean length of 8.0 inches.  Black crappie reached an average length of 7.7 inches in four years.     Walleye abundance decreased slightly since 1996 but remains within the normal range for class 31 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.3 to 26.3 inches with an average length and weight of 16.2 inches and 1.6 pounds.  The DNR stocks walleye fingerlings into Hoot Lake on a biennial basis.  Walleye reach an average length of 13.1 inches at three years, which exceeds the mean walleye growth rate for class 31 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Hoot Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Hoot Lake is a 155-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in southwest Otter Tail County and is within the city limits of Fergus Falls, MN.  Hoot Lake is part of the Otter Tail River chain of lakes.  The river enters the lake along the northeast shoreline and outlets to Wright Lake along the south shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of residential areas except for a small area north of the lake which is composed of mixed hardwoods and pasture.  The maximum depth is 20 feet; however, 41% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 11.0 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Hoot Lake is developed with homes.  A city owned public water access is located along the south shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush and wild rice are prevalent around the entire shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Hoot Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, walleye, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat within the lake and the river connected to it. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Age data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 13.0 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from the electrofishing assessment also indicate that smallmouth bass are very abundant.  Age data indicate that smallmouth bass recruitment is also consistently good. Smallmouth bass ranged in length from 8.5 to 19.4 inches with an average length and weight of 14.4 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Smallmouth bass attain an average length of 13.6 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance is the highest ever recorded for this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.2 to 25.2 inches with an average length and weight of 14.6 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegills are also abundant.  Seven percent of the bluegills sampled were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Growth rates are good; bluegills attain an average length of 7.1 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Hoot Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Hoot Lake is a 155-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in southwest Otter Tail County and is within the city limits of Fergus Falls, MN.  Hoot Lake is part of the Otter Tail River chain of lakes.  The river enters the lake along the northeast shoreline and outlets to Wright Lake along the south shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of residential areas except for a small area north of the lake which is composed of mixed hardwoods and pasture.  The maximum depth is 20 feet; however, 41% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 7.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 8.5 to 11.0 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Hoot Lake is developed with homes.  A city owned public water access is located along the south shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush and wild rice are prevalent around the entire shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Hoot Lake can be ecologically classified as a Bass-Panfish-Walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat within the lake and the river connected to it. <br> \n     Age and length data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistenty good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 19.4 to 28.8 inches with an average length and weight of 22.8 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 22.7 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Catch data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that Smallmouth Bass are very abundant.  Age data indicate that Smallmouth Bass reproduction is consistently good. Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 5.9 to 18.7 inches with an average length and weight of 13.9 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Smallmouth Bass attain an average length of 14.6 inches at four years of age.  There is a catch and release regulation for Smallmouth Bass on the Otter Tail River and its impoundments which includes Hoot Lake.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance remains moderately high.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.2 to 25.2 inches with an average length and weight of 14.6 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance remains high; however, size structure is poor.  Onlly six percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.8 inches at five years of age. <br> \n    Two Lake Sturgeon were sampled. Lake Sturgeon were initially sampled in the 2006 assessment. Lake Sturgeon enter Hoot Lake by downstream movement from Otter Tail Lake where a Lake Sturgeon re-introduction plan was implemented in 2002. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Hoot Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Hoot Lake is a 155-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in southwest Otter Tail County and is within the city limits of Fergus Falls, MN.  Hoot Lake is part of the Otter Tail River chain of lakes.  The river enters the lake along the northeast shoreline and outlets to Wright Lake along the south shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of residential areas except for a small area north of the lake which is composed of mixed hardwoods and pasture.  The maximum depth is 20 feet; however, 41% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2006 lake survey was 9.1 feet.  The MN DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Hoot Lake is included in lake class 31; other area lakes in this same classification include Devils, Annie Battle, Boedigheimer, Middle, and Murphy. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Hoot Lake is developed with homes.  A city owned public water access is located along the south shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush and wild rice are prevalent around the entire shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Hoot Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat within the lake and the river connected to it. <br> \n     The northern pike gill net catch rate fell below the expectedl range for similar lakes.  Age and length data from recent lake surveys indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistent.  Northern pike in the gill net sample ranged in length from 18.5 to 31.4 inches with a mean length and weight of 25.5 inches and 3.5 pounds. <br> \n     Muskies were sampled for the first time during the 2006 assessment.  Two adult muskies were represented in the gill net sample.  Their lengths were 35.2 and 43.9 inches.  Two age-1 muskies were also observed during the spring electrofishing assessment.      <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate increased from the past survey and is within the expected  range for similar lakes.  Age and length data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistent in Hoot Lake.  Forty percent of the bluegills sampled were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  The mean length of bluegills in the trap net sample was 6.6 inches. <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that Hoot Lake has good largemouth bass and smallmouth bass populations with consistent natural reproduction. ring.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6.9 to 18.4 inches with a mean length of 12.8 inches.  Smallmouth bass ranged in length from 9.1 to 18.5 inches with a mean length of 14.8 inches. <br> \n     Black crappies in the gill net sample ranged in length from 4.2 to 10.8 inches with a mean length of 7.3 inches.  Age and length data from recent surveys indicate that reproduction is consistently good. <br> \n     The walleye catch rate decreased for the third consecutive survey, but remains within the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.9 to 24.9 inches with an average length and weight of 15.5 inches and 1.7 pounds.  The DNR stocks walleye fingerlings into Hoot Lake on a biennial basis.  <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Hoot Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. </p>",
