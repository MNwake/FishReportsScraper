                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Little Mud Lake in 2009 to evaluate the lake's physical, chemical, biological characteristics.  Little Mud Lake is primarily managed as a put-and-take rainbow trout fishery, receiving a fall and a spring stocking of yearlings each year.  Approximately 3,000 fish are stocked in the spring and 1,500 fish are stocked in the fall, offering a unique opportunity for area anglers.  A total of 7 different species of fish were sampled during the survey, plus hybrid sunfish. Gill nets were not set due to expectations of killing too many rainbow trout.   Designation as a \"stream trout lake\" was removed in the early 2000's, to simplify regulations so anglers could more easily exploit black crappie, sunfish, largemouth bass and rainbow trout populations. <br> \n  <br> \nLittle Mud's approximate lakeshed (272 acres) was mostly row crop agriculture (42%), grassland (25%), and forest (23%).  The lakeshed to lake ratio was 7:1.  The shoreline was mostly undeveloped, with only 4 homes being present.  Aquatic vegetation was abundant, especially coontail and cattail.  Dense surface mats of coontail grew out to 20 feet on several sides of the lake and maximum vegetation depth was 22 feet.  The exotic plant, Eurasian watermilfoil, was discovered at Little Mud in the fall of 2009.  The dissolved oxygen concentration dropped below 5 mg/l at 17 feet on 7/20/09.  Water temperature did not fall below 70 degrees F until a depth of 15 foot.  This left a very small layer of water with the proper amount of oxygen and a trout's desired temperature range, making Little Mud a marginal trout lake.  The lake has suffered occasional summerkill in the past years.  Water clarity was good during netting week.  <br> \n <br> \nAlthough rainbow trout were not sampled in the summer trap nets, they were captured and released during a day of collecting fish for the Kid's Fishing Ponds program.  On 4/21/09, 15 trap nets were lifted and 24 rainbow trout were sampled.  Trout were estimated to be 12 to 16 inches long and their condition looked good.   Approximately 60 rainbow trout from 7 to 10 inches in length were observed during the spring night-time electrofishing run on May 14, 2009.  Fishing pressure can be high, especially during the winter and summer openers. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 31 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 50.1/hr of electrofisher on-time, indicating that moderate numbers were present for lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area.  The 2005 catch rate was 73.8/hr.  Catch rates (n=4) from 1998 to 2009 ranged from 38.1/hr to 154.0/hr and averaged 79.0/hr.  Largemouth bass were 2.0 to 18.1 inches long averaging 11.3 inches.  Largemouth bass were 1 to 11 years old with 10 year-classes present.  Growth was slow.  Shoreline seining sampled 14 young-of-the-year largemouth bass.      <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 1 black bullhead for a catch rate of 0.1/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 1998 catch rate was 35.6/net.  Yellow bullhead were not sampled in 2009.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 23 black crappie for a catch rate of 2.6/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 1998 catch rate was 2.0/net.  Trap netted black crappie were 6.5 to 9.5 inches long averaging 7.7 inches.  Approximately 26% of the sample was 8 inches or longer.  Black crappie were 3 to 7 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Growth was slow.  Anecdotal fishing reports indicate that a substantial fishery for this species is rare at Little Mud. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 453 bluegill for a catch rate of 50.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 1998 catch rate was 29.7/net.  The last three catch rates indicated an upward trend for bluegill numbers at Little Mud Lake  Bluegill were 3.1 to 7.6 inches long averaging 4.8 inches.  Only 9% of the sample was 6 inches or longer.  Bluegill were 2 to 8 years old with 7 year-classes present.  Growth was slow.  Panfish anglers can expect to catch high numbers of small bluegill, small pumpkinseed sunfish, and small hybrid sunfish.  Little Mud would be a good lake to take small kids fishing. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Daytime electrofishing was used to capture Largemouth Bass, which were then measured and given a fin clip for the mark/recapture population estimate.  All fish were released back into the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 3.1 hours of electrofishing occurred, sampling 114 Largemouth Bass (including recaptured fish).  The average catch rate was 36.9/hour of electrofishing.  Measured Largemouth Bass were 8.0 to 21.1 inches long averaging 15.2 inches.  Approximately 83% of the catch was 12 inches or longer, 50% was 15 inches or longer, and 24% were 18 inches and longer, indicating a high quality population.  The PE for fish of all lengths was estimated to be 627 fish or 16.8 fish/acre.  The PE for 12 inch and longer fish was estimated to be 437 fish or 11.7 fish/acre.  Bass anglers could expect some quality fishing on this little 37 acre lake.   <br> \n</p>",

Also, there were considerable numbers of other species finding their way into Little Mud, due to the high water.  The present population structure consists primarily of black bullheads, perch, bluegills, and black crappies.  The only trout contributing to the fishery were those stocked after the high water in June of 1983.  The stocking since that time consists of 50 rainbows at 6 pounds apiece (surplus hatchery broodstock), 650 rainbows at 1.5 pounds each and 130 lake trout at 6 pound each (surplus hatchery broodstock).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Mud Lake is a small lake (37 acres) in Meeker County, near the town of Watkins.  This lake is a designated stream trout lake and is stocked annually with rainbow trout.  Anglers need to purchase a trout stamp in order to fish in this lake.  Rainbow trout will be stocked annually at a rate of 4,000 fish in the spring and 2,000 fish in fall.     In 1993 fisheries personnel from the Hutchinson Area Headquarters used trapnets, gillnets and seines to assess the fish population in Little Mud Lake.  Fish species captured in gillnets and trapnets during the population assessment included rainbow trout, black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, bluegill, largemouth bass and black crappie.       Rainbow trout were captured in gillnets and trapnets at a rate of 9.3 and 1.8 per net respectively.  Previous surveys on Little Mud have shown gillnet catches of rainbow trout of 1.2 and 0.2 per net (1988 and 1984).  Average length of rainbow trout captured in gillnets and trapnets was similar (12.3 and 12.4 inches).  The rainbow trout population was comprised of age I and II fish.  Nearly 90% of the fish sampled were age I with an average length of 11.4 inches.  The age II fish had an average length of 14.6 inches.  The absence of older fish indicates a high mortality rate, most of which is probably due to angler harvest.  Oxygen depletion, during summer and winter, also limit survival of stocked rainbow trout.     The presence of fish species other than rainbow trout may hinder the current management of stream trout in Little Mud Lake.  Black crappie are very abundant, and wintertime fishing has been excellent for this species.  Black crappie gillnet and trapnet catches were 16.8 and 68.2 per net respectively.  These are both above average for lakes similar to Little Mud.  This trapnet catch is similar to the netting in 1989 (75 per trapnet).  This high net catch is in spite of extensive removal of black crappie by the Section of Fisheries in 1991 and 1992.  Black crappie growth is good, with four year old fish averaging 9.5 inches.      Future population assessments will be used to monitor the fish population in Little Mud Lake.  The results of these assessments will be used to determine whether or not it is practical to continue managing this lake for stream trout.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Mud Lake, Meeker County, is a 37-acre lake with a maximum depth of 42 feet.  A lake survey conducted on Little Mud Lake during the week of July 13, 1998, sampled 8 species of fish.  The survey utilized standard lake survey gill nets, 3/4 inch double frame trap nets, 1/4 inch mesh trap nets to assess natural reproduction, and spring night-time electrofishing to assess largemouth bass.  Little Mud Lake is a class 30 lake(Schupp's lake class), and net catch data were compared to that of other lakes in its ecological classification.  The lake management plan lists rainbow trout as the primary management species with no secondary management species.Little Mud Lake is managed as a put-and-take fishery for rainbow trout, maintained by spring stocking (4,000) and fall stocking (2,000) rainbow trout yearlings.  The lake was chemically reclaimed initially in 1970-71, then stocked with rainbow trout fingerlings.  Little Mud Lake was designated a trout lake on April 29, 1976, and was chemically reclaimed again that year.  The lake was again subjected to chemical treatment in 1978, resulting in a partial kill.  Winterkills were documented in 1978-79 and 1984.  Summerkills were documented in 1982 and 1984.  Little Mud Lake was again reclaimed with rotenone in the fall of 1987.During the 1998 survey, Hutchinson Area Fisheries personnel set four 250-foot experimental gill nets and 9 standard 3/4 inch mesh, double-frame trap nets.  The two most abundant species in gill nets were black bullhead and rainbow trout.  The four most abundant species in trap nets were black bullhead, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish and hybrid sunfish.Gill nets sampled 76 rainbow trout, for a catch rate of 19 per net.  This catch rate compared favorably with past catch rates of 9.3 in 1993, 1.2 in 1988, 0.2 in 1984, and 7.0 in 1978.  Rainbow trout ranged in length from 9.8 to 15.1 inches, with an average length of 11.7 inches.Spring night-time electrofishing sampled 77 largemouth bass, for a catch rate of 154.0 per hour of electrofishing unit on-time.  Bass ranged in length from 3 to 17 inches.Trap nets sampled 267 bluegills, for a catch rate of 29.7 per net.  Bluegills ranged in length from 3.2 to 9.1 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches.Trap nets sampled 72 pumpkinseed sunfish, for a catch rate of 8.0 per net.  Pumpkinseed sunfish ranged in length from 3.3 to 7.2 inches, with an average length of 5.8 inches.Trap nets sampled 18 black crappies, for a catch rate 2.0 per net.  Crappies ranged in length from 8.2 to 9.2 inches.Because of the continued interest in angling for panfish as well as rainbow trout, the Hutchinson DNR Fisheries Headquarters began, in 1998-99, the process of removing Little Mud from the designated trout lake list.  The purpose was to increase angling opportunities at Little Mud.  Rainbow trout would still be stocked on a regular basis.  Public response to the proposal has been favorable.</p>",
