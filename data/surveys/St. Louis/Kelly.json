No yellow perch were caught in gill nets during this assessment but one was taken in the trap nets.  Northern pike abundance has remained relatively stable over the past years but the average size has been reduced.  Black crappie have never been sampled until this year when 2 were taken in the seine.  No walleyes were recovered from the 1988 and 1989 fry stockings.</p>",

The electrofishing survey used two netters, was conducted during the daytime and cirlced the entire shoreline.     <br> \n <br> \nEight species of fish were sampled and species composition was similar to a resurvey conducted in 1993.  Yellow perch were the most commonly sampled species.  Species susceptible to winterkill such as black crappie and largemouth bass were also sampled indicating that the lake did not winterkill or only had a partial winterkill.  Species composition and abundance was sufficient and no restocking was done by DNR.  However, a private stocking permit was issued for black crappie and walleye fingerling stocking. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kelly Lake is a 17-acre lake in southern St. Louis County within the St. Louis River watershed.  Kelly Lake is located in the town of Kelly Lake, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 17 ft and 14 littoral acres.  There is a concrete ramp on the south shore, an earthen access on the north shore, and a fishing pier on the east shore.    Northern pike gill-net catch was 15.0/net, which was much higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance in past assessments has varied from 0.5 to 6.0/net.  Size structure was poor with a only two fish exceeding 24 inches.Two walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 0.7/net, which is lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Due to the lake's small size and low yellow perch abundance it is not likely that the lake will have an abundant walleye population.  Walleye were from the 1992 and 1990 year class.  Walleye varied in length from 19 to 26 inches.  Growth was very slow with fish reaching 12 inches in 6 years.  It is difficult to accurately age walleye beyond age 10, therefore it is difficult to determine if these fish resulted from the 1989 fry stocking, are from natural reproduction, or immigration from the Swan River.  Walleye were not present in Kelly Lake before 1989.Bluegill trap-net catch was 6.4/net, which was similar to the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance in past assessments varied from 0 to 6.2/trap net.  Size structure was poor with a no fish exceeding 8 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish growing to 5.9 inches by age 5Black crappie gill-net catch was 8.3/net, which was higher than the expected range.  The trap-net catch was 2.8/net, which was within the expected range.  Size structure was poor with no fish exceeding 9 inches.  Growth was slower than the statewide average for ages 1 to 5 with fish reaching 7.6 inches by age 5.   Three largemouth bass were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 1.0/net, which was within the expected range.  Largemouth bass varied in length from 9.5 to 10.5/inches.  No yellow perch were sampled in gill nets.  Catch rates in previous assessments varied from 0 to 79.0/net.  Based on past assessments, yellow perch catch rates declined when northern pike catch rates increased.  Other species sampled include white sucker, and brown bullhead.  </p>",
