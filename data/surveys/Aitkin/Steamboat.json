The trap net indices for yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and black crappie were below the lake class 36 first quartiles.  The trap net index for brb was above the lake class 36 third quartile.  Northern pike sampled (16 of 16 aged) ranged from two to six years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1986 and 1987.  Growth rates for the first through the forth increments were normal.  The growth rates for the fifth and sixth increments were slower than normal.  Yep sampled (7 of 7 aged) ranged from two to five years of age with a strong year class represented in 1988.  No fish were sampled from the 1987 year class.  Growth rates appear to be erratic from year to year with the overall growth rate being normal.  Walleye sampled (2 of 2 aged) were four and thirteen years of age.</p>",
