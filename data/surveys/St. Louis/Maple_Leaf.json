                "narrative": "<p>The fish community of Maple Leaf is typical of a small bass/panfish lake.  Northern pike abundance is similar to other area lakes.  Although the average size is 20.3 inches, occasional individuals are over 30 inches or longer.  Walleye are not abundant, exhibit above local median growth rates, and correlate strongly to years of fingerling stocking.  Lack of natural reproduction limit walleye to an expensive put, grow and take fishery.     Panfish tend to be small with an average length of 5.8 inches for bluegill, 7.4 inches for black crappie, and 5.9 inches for pumpkinseed.  Panfish are near expected abundances for lakes like Maple Leaf.  Largemouth bass are present in shoreline seining, however, the status of mature fish is unknown.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maple Leaf Lake is a 90 acre lake with 49 (54%) littoral acres and a maximum depth of 51 feet.  It is located northwest of Duluth off of CR #47.  There is no public access to the lake.  The primary management species is largemouth bass, although the lake has been privately stocked with walleye biennially since 1999.  Largemouth bass spring electrofishing abundance was 82.2 fish/hr on-time, which was above average for Duluth Area lakes.  Growth was fast with age 4 fish at 13.1 inches.  The mean length decreased from 13.6 inches (1994) to 13.0 inches.  Seventy-nine percent of the fish sampled were greater than 12 inches in length.  Ten age classes were present with age 5 (28%) being the most abundant age class.    Walleye abundance increased to 2.0 fish/gillnet from 0.8 fish/gillnet (1994) and was average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Growth was above average for Duluth Area lakes with a mean length at age 4 of 15.7 inches.  Four age classes (age 2,4,6,8) were represented in the sample.  Northern pike abundance was 6.0 fish/gillnet and was above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Growth was slow for Duluth Area lakes with a mean length at age 4 of 20.8 inches.  Mean length decreased from 21.9 inches (1993) to 18.5 inches in 2003.  Five age classes were present in the assessment.  Eighty-one percent of the fish were aged to 2 or 3.    Yellow perch abundance decreased from 7.3 fish/gillnet (1993) to 2.3 fish/gillnet which was average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Yellow perch catch rates have declined over the previous assessments (1957, 1988, 1993) from 22.3 fish/gillnet in 1957.  Growth was slow for Duluth Area lakes with a mean length at age 4 of 5.1 inches.  Historically, the majority of the yellow perch caught are < 8 inches.  The mean length was 6.1 inches, a decrease from 6.5 inches in 1993.  Sixty-seven percent of the fish were age 4.    Bluegill abundance decreased from 34.2 fish/trapnet (1993) to 14.6 fish/trapnet, but was still above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length at age 4 increased from 4.6 inches (1993) to 6.0 inches and represented fast growth for Duluth Area lakes.  The mean length decreased from 5.8 inches (1993) to 5.1 inches.  Seventy-two percent of the fish were age 2 or 3.    Black crappie trapnet abundance remained steady from 2.7 fish/trapnet (1993) to 2.9 fish/trapnet in 2003 and was average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length was 5.5 inches, a decrease from 7.2 inches in 1993.  Two age classes, age 1 and 2, were present in the 24 fish aged.  Largemouth bass catch rates and size structure are above average for Duluth Area lakes.  The population had representation from multiple age classes indicating good natural reproduction.  Private stocking of walleye has shown some success.  </p>",

Largemouth Bass and Bluegill are the primary management species for Maple Leaf Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nMaple Leaf has been stocked with Walleye fingerlings intermittently from 2003 through 2015 by the Maple Leaf Lake Association.  Walleye abundance of 2.2 per gillnet lift was average compared to other similar Minnesota Lakes.  The Walleye catch rate observed in 2016 was a historic high for Maple Leaf Lake (previous range; 0.0-2.0).  Walleye average length was 17.2 inches.  Walleye from six year-classes were present, ranging from 2005 through 2015.  All Walleye sampled corresponded to stocked year-classes.  These data suggest the Walleye stocking program has been effective.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 59 Largemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 43.7 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time which was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Average length was 14.5 inches.  Anglers should expect good catches of Largemouth Bass in 2018 and beyond with strong 2008 and 2009 year-classes.    <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was average at 5.0 per trapnet lift.  Average length was 6.3 inches.  Black Crappie abundance of 2.1 per trapnet lift was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length was 7.6 inches with fish up to 12.6 inches sampled.  Yellow Perch were scarce. <br> \n</p>",
