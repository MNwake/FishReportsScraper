                "narrative": "<p>The walleye gill net catch in 2008 was about average for this lake historically.  Reports from anglers seem to indicate the lake supports a good walleye fishery at about this level of gill net catch.  All walleye collected in 2008 had been produced naturally, since walleye were last stocked here in 1994.  It appeared that the 2007 and 2006 year classes had been strong, and fish from both year classes had exhibited faster-than-average growth. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were abundant and large in this lake in 2008, as has been the case here for several years.  Two Island Lake is covered by a maximum size limit for smallmouth bass.  All fish 12 inches in length or longer must be immediately returned to the water, except that one fish over 20 inches may be kept.  That regulation, which has been in effect since the mid 1990s, has succeeded in building and maintaining a high quality smallmouth bass fishery. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in 2008 was about average for this lake historically, and for lakes of this type.  In 2008 the lake supported a fairly high-quality population; the mean weight for fish taken in gill nets was well above the normal range for the lake class, and was higher than means observed in most past assessments of this lake.  Northern pike growth had been fairly fast, thanks to the presence of an excellent yellow perch forage base. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2008 Two Island Lake proved to be one of very few lakes in Cook County supporting a significant bluegill population.  The bluegill trap net catch was well within the normal range for the lake class, and was the highest observed to date in this lake.  Although bluegill were more abundant in Two Island Lake than in most lakes in this area, most were small.  Forty-three percent of the fish taken in trap nets were six inches in length or larger, but none exceeded eight inches.  Most of the bluegill collected were age-2 or age-3 fish, and growth of those younger fish had been good.  This lake may provide some fair bluegill fishing in 2009 and 2010 as those young fish continue to grow. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were fairly abundant, and some were large enough to be of interest to anglers.  High yellow perch numbers probably accounted for good growth rates observed for walleye and northern pike taken in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This was the second of two assessments scheduled in the 2004 lake management plan to monitor the fish community and determine whether the change in special regulations implemented in 2004 ( increased the maximum size limit from 11 to 12 inches) resulted in a decrease in the quality of the smallmouth bass population.  The first assessment was completed in 2008, and the current management plan will be reviewed and revised ion February 2014. <br> \n <br> \nTwo Island Lake is managed primarily for smallmouth bass and walleye.  Long term goals for the two species are to maintain a walleye population with a minimum gill net catch of 4.0 fish/net, with some fish over 20 inches, and maintain a smallmouth bass fishery where half the fish taken by anglers are larger than 11 inches.  Smallmouth bass in this lake are covered by a special regulation:  all fish 12 inches or larger must be released, except that one fish over 20 inches may be harvested. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were abundant and large in Two Island Lake in 2012.  The 2012 gill net catch was well above the normal range for a lake of this type, but was similar to catches observed in this lake since 1971.  The mean weight for smallmouth bass taken in gill nets was the highest seen in this lake to date.  There was no evidence to suggest the increase in the maximum size limit in 2004 had decreased the quality of the smallmouth bass population; mean weight of bass taken in gill nets had actually increased since the change.  Many year classes contributed to the 2012 catch, which included fish as old as 12 years.  Smallmouth bass growth had been somewhat faster than average; two-year-old fish reached a mean length of 5.8 inches at the end of their second year, and seven-year-old fish reached a length of 14.3 inches.  It took about five years for bass to reach a length of 12 inches, where they would be protected from harvest by the special regulation. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches in Two Island Lake have been fairly stable since 1970, and the lake is known for producing good numbers of small to medium-sized fish.  The 2012 catch was within the normal range for the lake class, and met current long range goals for the number and size of fish taken.  The walleye population was entirely self-sustained, and many year classes contributed to the catch.  Relatively strong year classes had apparently been produced in 2011 and 2009, and there were no obvious year class failures.  Walleye growth had been about average for a lake in this area; three-year-old fish reached a mean length of 11.1 inches by the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 11.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill net catches in this lake have increased since the 1970s, while mean weights for fish taken in gill nets have remained fairly stable at around 3 lb/fish.  The 2012 catch was below the lake class median, but was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1982.  No northern pike older than four years were collected in 2012, and two-year-old fish made up the majority of the catch.  Growth had apparently been fast; fish reached an average length of 17.7 inches by the end of their second year.  Good northern pike growth was no doubt due to the presence of a fairly robust yellow perch population. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 yellow perch gill net catch was within the normal range for the lake class, and was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1977.  Perch taken in 2012 were small, with a mean weight that was near the bottom of the normal range for a lake of this type.  Only a few would have been large enough to have been of interest to anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nTwo Island Lake is one of very few lakes in Cook County to support a substantial bluegill population.  The 2012 assessment yielded the highest bluegill catch seen to date in this lake.  The catch in trap nets was near the upper end of the normal range for that gear.  Although bluegill were abundant, they were also small, with a mean weight for fish taken in trap nets that was below normal for a lake of this type.  Most of the bluegill collected were one- or two-year-old fish.  Growth rates had been about average for this area; fish reached an average length of 3.2 inches by the end of their second year.  If the strong year classes seen in this assessment survive, Two Island Lake could produce some good bluegill fishing by the end of 2013, and through 2014, with some larger fish appearing by 2015. <br> \n <br> \nThe only other fish species collected in 2012 were pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.  Neither species was abundant.  Pumpkinseed sunfish taken in 2012 were too small to have been of much interest to anglers. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Stocking and natural reproduction had apparently both contributed to     the population, although a review of historic data suggested that walleye stocking since 1969 had not resulted in any increase in walleye     abundance in this lake.  Walleye growth was somewhat slower than usual for this area.  Smallmouth bass were abundant, but small and slow-     growing.  Four-year-old smallmouth bass averaged only 10.1 inches in length when they were collected in mid-August.  Northern pike were     present in good numbers, and in a wide range of sizes.  Northern pike growth was relatively fast, and fish were able to reach sizes over     30 inches by six years of age.  Yellow perch were also abundant, and some were large enough to be of interest to anglers.  Yellow perch     provided a good forage base for walleye and northern pike as well.</p>",

Most of the walleye collected had been produced naturally, and walleye growth rates were about average for the area.The smallmouth bass catch in 1997 was the lowest ever observed in this lake, but the catch of larger smallmouth was similar to catches observed in the past.  Smallmouth bass growth rates also appeared to have been about average for the area.The northern pike catch was similar to past catches in this lake, although it was low compared to other lakes in this class.  Northern pike growth rates were good, and several larger fish were collected.Yellow perch were abundant, which was no doubt the reason for good growth rates observed for northern pike and walleye.  Many large yellow perch (up to 13 inches) were collected.  A few bluegill were found, but they were all relatively small (5.5 - 7.5 inch) two-year old fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye catch in 2003 was near the low end of the normal range for the lake class, but was similar to catches observed in this lake in the past.  Virtually all the walleye sampled in 2003 had been produced naturally, with the strongest year classes produced in 2001 and 1998.  Walleye growth rates had been good; five-year old walleye averaged 17.2 inches in length at the end of their fifth year of growth.Smallmouth bass were abundant and large in 2003.  Larger smallmouth bass in Two Island Lake have been protected from harvest by an 11-in maximum size limit for several years, and average sizes for smallmouth bass in recent assessments have been the highest ever seen in this lake.  Several year classes were included in the catch, and fish as old as age 13 were collected.  Growth of larger smallmouth bass had been about average for this area.  The smallmouth bass regulation will change to a 12-in maximum size limit (except that of one fish 20 inches or larger may be taken) in March 2004.Catches of northern pike, yellow perch, and bluegill in 2003 were all low for a lake of this type.  Northern pike collected in 2003 ranged in length from 11.5 to 25.8 inches, with most between 20 and 24 inches.  Most of the yellow perch collected were under seven inches in length.  Most of the bluegill were very small - under five inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Two Island Lake is located approximately 15 miles north of the City of Grand Marais. The public access is located within the US Forest Service campground on the east end of the lake. Two Island Lake is an Ecological Class 16 lake, which is characterized by moderately irregular shorelines, high littoral coverage, and soft (unmineralized) tannin-stained water. Most of the shoreline is forested, with light private development limited to the northern shoreline. Walleye and Smallmouth Bass are the primary management species for Two Island Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 standard survey of Two Island Lake was the first of three scheduled in the 2014 lake management plan to monitor the fish community as a whole, and to determine if long-term goals for the Walleye and Smallmouth Bass populations are being met. Since 1996 a special regulation on Smallmouth Bass harvest has been in place in an attempt to improve the size structure of the population. The current regulation allows a 12-in maximum size limit, with harvest of one fish over 20 inches allowed. All other species present in Two Island Lake are subject to statewide harvest regulations. Two Island Lake has not been stocked since 1994 (Walleye); all fish sampled in this survey were naturally produced.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass were abundant and large in Two Island Lake in 2016. The gill net catch was well above the normal range for Class 16 lakes, but was similar to past catches observed in this lake. The mean weight of gill-net-sampled Smallmouth Bass in 2016 was the highest recorded to date, which continued a trend of increasing mean weight in each survey since special regulations were implemented in 1996. Trap net catches of Smallmouth Bass were similarly high, but fish sampled in that gear tended to be smaller. Many year classes contributed to the 2016 sample, including some very old fish. Reproduction appeared consistent in recent years with no missing year classes between ages 1 and 6. Growth rates of younger Smallmouth Bass sampled in 2016 were above average.  Currently, it appears that the special regulation on Smallmouth Bass has been effective at maintaining a high quality population in this lake. Grand Marais area fisheries is proposing a relaxation of this regulation to a 14-inch maximum size limit, with one fish over 20 inches allowed in possession, on this and other lakes currently under 12-inch maximum size regulation. Interested parties are encouraged to submit comments regarding the proposed regulation change, and to participate in public meetings planned for fall 2017. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches in Two Island Lake have remained fairly stable since 1970. The 2016 gill net catch fell within the normal range for Class 16 Lakes, and met the long-range catch goal identified for the Walleye population. The trap net catch of Walleye in 2016 was also similar to results from recent surveys of Two Island Lake. Walleye reproduction has been very consistent in Two Island Lake since 2009, with no apparent year class failures and multiple stronger year classes evident. Growth rates of Walleye sampled in this survey were about average; fish reached a mean length of 13.1 inches at the end of their fourth year compared to an average of 13.9 inches for similar lakes in the Grand Marais area. Larger Walleye may be sparse in Two Island Lake at this time; just a single fish over 20 inches was sampled in 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nSince 1982 Northern Pike gill net catches in Two Island Lake have typically fallen near the lower end of the normal range for this lake class. Similarly, the 2016 Northern Pike gill net catch fell slightly below this range, but was within the historical range of catch rates previously observed on this lake.  The sample was dominated by two- and three-year-old fish, while the oldest sampled was six years old. Growth rates of sampled Northern Pike were relatively fast; on average fish reached 20.0 inches at end of their third year compared to an average of 18.1 inches for similar lakes in the area. Beyond fair numbers of medium-sized Northern Pike, Two Island Lake has also proven capable of producing some fish over 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch in 2016 was low for this lake class, and in comparison to past catches from this lake. Gill net catches of this species have fluctuated in Two Island Lake; however, in most surveys catches have typically fallen within the expected range for this type of lake.  Yellow Perch are an important forage species in Two Island Lake, and an extended decline of this population may have repercussions on the predator populations. Fair numbers of Yellow Perch were sampled in 2012, so additional surveys are needed to determine the true status of this population.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo Island Lake continues to support a modest Bluegill population, which is rare for lakes in the Grand Marais fisheries area. The 2016 sample included a variety of ages and sizes indicating that reproduction and survival of Bluegill has been fairly consistent in recent years.  Similar to past surveys, a few Pumpkinseed Sunfish were also sampled in 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nThe White Sucker gill net catch in 2016 fell below the first quartile for the lake class, although catches of this species have remained fairly low in Two Island Lake for many years. No other fish species were sampled in 2016. Additional species sampled in past surveys of Two Island Lake include Blacknose Shiner, Longnose Dace, and Finescale Dace. <br> \n <br> \nAs of 2016, no aquatic invasive species had been reported or identified in Two Island Lake. Anglers and boaters are reminded to review the recommended actions for cleaning watercraft and gear before and after accessing any waterbody, and to adhere to all Minnesota aquatic invasive species laws to protect Minnesota lakes and rivers from additional infestations.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Two Island Lake is a 753 acre lake located approximately 15 miles north of Grand Marais. Public access is through a concrete landing located within the US Forest Service campground on the east end of the lake. Walleye and smallmouth bass are the primary management species for Two Island Lake. Since 1996, a special regulation was put on smallmouth bass in an attempt to improve the size structure of the population. The current regulation places a 12 inch maximum size limit, with harvest of only one fish over 20 inches allowed.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass abundance in Two Island Lake remains good, with similar catch rates going back to 2003. Catch rates are well above the 75% percentile for similar area lakes and indicate a quality population. Smallmouth bass ranged from 9.7 to 19.8 inches with a mean length of 14.6 inches. Aging results found 11 naturally reproduced year classes with the oldest individual being 16 years old. Growth rates appeared to be average, however this is quite good considering how abundant smallmouth bass are in the lake. Smallmouth bass regulations are continuing to work in Two Island Lake and support a relatively high-density smallmouth bass population with the capability of producing large individuals. This is one of the better smallmouth fisheries in the area. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was the highest recorded since 1966 and is well above the current management goal for Two Island Lake. This is also above average for similar area lakes. The trap net catch was also high with young of year (YOY) and other smaller sized walleye. Walleye ranged between 8.5 to 24.3 inches with a mean length of 14.3 inches. Aging results found 13 naturally reproduced year classes, with strong year classes in 2018 (age 5), 2019 (age 4), and 2021 (age 2). Growth appears to be good considering relatively high densities of walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches were again low in 2023 and similar to historic catches in Two Island. This is below average for similar area lakes. Northern pike ranged between 9.2 and 27.0 inches with a mean length of 19.4 inches. Northern pike might not be a targeted fish in Two Island but will provide additional action for multi species anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates were slightly higher than the 2016 survey and above average for similar area lakes. Bluegill sizes ranged from 3.7 to 9.5 inches with a mean length of 5.2 inches. Two Island continues to support a fishable bluegill population with some large sized fish, which is relatively rare for the Grand Marais area.  <br> \n <br> \nThe white sucker catch was one of the higher values recorded in recent years but remain below average for similar area lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health. Anglers should clean watercraft and fishing gear, drain all water, and dispose of unused bait in the trash to prevent accidental introductions. <br> \n</p>",

SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES WERE PRESENT, BUT THE 1984 YEAR CLASS APPEARED TO BE WEAK. SMALLMOUTH BASS GROWTH WAS ABOUT AVERAGE BY COOK COUNTY STANDARDS. YELLOW PERCH ABUNDANCE WAS LOW, BUT SOME LARGER FISH WERE PRESENT. NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE WAS ALSO FAIRLY LOW, BUT SOME LARGE INDIVIDUALS WERE SAMPLED. BLUEGILL WERE SAMPLED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS ASSESSMENT. THEY MAY HAVE ENTERED THE LAKE FROM PIT LAKE, WHICH IS MANAGED FOR BLUEGILL AND LIES IMMEDIATELY UPSTREAM IN THE WATERSHED.

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye gill net catch in this assessment was well within the normal range for the lake class, and it was one of the higher catches observed recently in this lake.  It exceeded the long range goal established in the 1995 Two Island Lake Management Plan, both in terms of numbers and size.  The catch included several good to strong natural year classes produced since walleye stocking was discontinued.  Walleye growth rates had been about average for the area. The smallmouth bass gill net catch was exceptionally high for a lake of this class.  The mean weight for fish taken in gill nets was above the median for the lake class, and it was the highest ever observed in this lake.  Eighty-five percent of the smallmouth bass collected in gill nets were 11-in or larger.  Two Island Lake is currently covered by an experimental regulation that requires anglers to immediately release all smallmouth bass caught that are 11 inches in length or larger.  This regulation has been in effect since 1996 on this lake, and may have been responsible for the larger than usual numbers of large smallmouth bass seen in 2000.The northern pike gill net catch was close to the median for the lake class, but it was the highest ever observed in this lake (by a small margin).  The catch consisted mostly of fish younger than five years of age, with three-year-old fish accounting for over half the gill net catch.  Northern pike growth had been somewhat faster than average for the area.The yellow perch gill net catch was below the first quartile for the lake class, and it was one of the lower catches in recent years in this lake.  The catch consisted mainly of small fish less than five years of age.The bluegill catch in trap nets was below normal for the lake class, but it was the highest ever observed in this lake.  The catch consisted entirely of small two and three-year-old fish.  Growth rates had been about average for the area.</p>",
