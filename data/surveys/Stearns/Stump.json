Eighty percent of the Northern Pike were age 3 and 4 and growth was good. Bluegill numbers, at 11.0/ trap net, were low compared with the local median, but average compared with the statewide median. Ages 1-8 were sampled but growth rates are erratic, especially in older fish, probably due to winterkill tendencies. Black Crappies were present in average numbers compared with state and local medians at 3.0/trap net. Ages 1-4 were sampled and growth was good. Yellow Perch abundance is about one-half the local median at 4.7/gillnet. Yellow Bullhead (6.0/trap net) and Brown Bullhead (3.5/trap net) numbers were near their respective medians while Black Bullhead numbers (0.3/trap net) were low. This was unusual for an occasional winterkill lake. It seems to indicate that most kills are only partial and probably only affect sunfishes and other sensitive species.</p>",
