                "narrative": "<p>North Union, Stony, and Lottie (Taylor) lakes form a chain of lakes between Brophy and Cowdry Lakes in Douglas County.  North Union Lake is the upper or first lake in this chain of interconnected lakes.  Brophy Lake discharges into North Union.  North Union outlets to Stony Lake.  None of these three small basins have public landings, but anglers can utilize access sites on Cowdry and Brophy Lakes and navigate small watercraft throughout the chain via flowage channels.  Access to these lakes with larger, high profile boats is constrained by bridge crossings and road culverts.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe lakes in this chain are small and relatively unique in that shoreline development has been limited and much of the natural shoreline remains intact.  Water quality and clarity are very good.  Water transparency at time of the August survey was measured at 19.0 feet.  Near-shore areas support lush vegetative growth including bulrushes and water lilies.  These habitat characteristics are ideal for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are abundant in North Union and accounted for most of the total gamefish catch.  Average size of Bluegills caught in trap nets was 6.8 inches.  The largest Bluegill captured measured 8.4 inches.  Ten percent of the total catch of Bluegills were 8.0 inches and larger. Black Crappie catches were low, but crappies are typically difficult to catch in mid-summer surveys.  Crappies are anticipated to be more abundant than reflected in survey catch statistics. The largest Black Crappie caught in the survey was 10.1 inches long.  Northern Pike are abundant in North Union Lake, though most of the fish caught in the survey were small.  Average length of pike captures was 19.6 inches long.  Navigation restrictions prevented access with an electrofishing boat to survey the Largemouth Bass population.  Only a few Largemouth Bass were caught in the survey nets.  Habitat conditions are excellent for Largemouth Bass and this popular gamefish is projected to be abundant. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and other outdoor recreationists looking for a quiet lake should check out the North Union, Stony, and Lottie lake chain.  This chain of lakes provides a remote lake setting in close proximity to the city of Alexandria.  Lake Brophy County Park is currently in development and will encompass the West side of North Union Lake.  Contact the Douglas County Park Division for more info on this county park. <br> \n <br> \nNorth Union Lake was designated as an infested water in 2011 after discovery of zebra mussels in upstream lakes. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.  Updated information on invasive species infestations can be found on the MN DNR website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Union Lake is within a chain of lakes west of Alexandria which also includes lakes Lottie, Stoney, and Brophy.  These lakes support abundant and diverse communities of submergent and emergent vegetation.  The fish communities present in these lakes are similar and best described as typical Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Northern Pike assemblages.  Northern Pike catch averaged 7.0 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range of mean catch rates (2.7 - 9.0 fish/gillnet) for lake class 33.  Unlike many other area lakes, north union lake has not experienced a drought induced decline in Northern Pike abundance.  CPUE was 5.0 fish/net in 1987.  The mean weight of fish captured was 2.0 pounds.  PSD was calculated at 42.9%.  Growth of Northern Pike in north union lake is greater than the mean growth rate of Northern Pike in other area lakes within lake class 33.  Age 3 fish averaged 21.4 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Walleye were captured in gillnets for the first time in 1992.  Catch per unit effort averaged 4.0 fish/net.  The mean weight of fish captured was 2.6 pounds.  PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 100% and 28.6%, respectively.  One fish exceeded 26.0% inches in total length.  A likely source of these fish is immigration from Lake Brophy which is stocked with fingerlings. Bluegill catch rates decreased from 99.3 fish/trapnet in 1987 to 13.5 fish/trapnet in 1992.  Similar declines in trapnet catches were observed for the other lakes within the chain.  The cause or causes for the recent decline in catch rates are unknown. Age distribution evaluations for Bluegill captured on this chain of lakes would suggest limited recruitment of 3 year old fish which represents the 1989 year class.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1992 was 0.2 pounds.  PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 61.1% and 1.9%, respectively.  This size structure is similar to the size structure of Bluegill captured during the 1987 survey.  Other lakes within the chain; Brophy, Lottie, and Stoney, all support Bluegill populations dominated by smaller individuals.  Bluegill growth in north union lake is similar to the mean growth rate of Bluegill from other area lakes within lake class 33 and similar to other lakes within the chain.  Age 4 fish average 4.8 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Catch rates for Bullhead Species averaged 9.0 fish/gillnet, 21.5 fish/gillnet, and 0.5 fish/ gillnet for Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, and Brown Bullhead, respectively. Other fish species captured included bowfin, Northern Cisco, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, and Carp.</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of North Union Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nFourteen species were collected during this survey.  Three species (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) were considered \"intolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.  No \"tolerant\" species were collected.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of North Union Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Union Lake is a small, relatively shallow basin in a chain of three lakes that connect LakeBrophy to Lake Cowdry.  North Union Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community. Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 13 feet and is common throughout the littoral zone.  Most ofthe shoreline is fringed with common cattail.  There are also several beds of hardstem bulrush and wildrice.  The fish communities in all three lakes are typical for small, densely vegetated basins.  Northern pike catches averaged 6.5 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range of mean catch ratesfrom lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (2.3 - 9.2 fish/gillnet).  Gillnetcatches averaged 7.0 fish/net in 1992, 5.0 fish/net in 1987, and 9.5 fish/net in 1966.  Mean weight offish captured in 1997 was 1.7 pounds.  Total length ranged from 14.2 to 30.1 inches.  Bluegill catchesincreased from 13.5 fish/trapnet in 1992 to 50.3 fish/trapnet in 1997.  Trapnet catches averaged 99.3fish/net in 1987 and 59.8 fish/net in 1966.  Size structure of the bluegill population is unchangedsince 1992.  Approximately 60% of the fish captured were 6 inches in length or greater, however fewexceeded 8 inches.  Contrary to increased catch rates,  bluegill experienced poor reproductive successduring the unusually cool summers of 1992 and 1993.  Age-4 and age-5 fish were not present in trapnetcatches.  The status of the largemouth bass population is unknown.  Electrofishing was not conductedbecause the Smith-Root boat is to high to navigate the culverts that provide the only access to NorthUnion Lake.  Several small largemouth bass were captured in trapnets.Five walleye ranging from 14.0 to 28.3 inches in total length were captured in gillnets.  Mean weightof fish captured was 3.8 pounds. Walleye likely move freely through this chain of lakes from LakesBrophy and Cowdry.  Tullibee, black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch were other sportfishof interest captured in survey nets.  Underutilized species captured included bowfin, white sucker,common carp, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, and brown bullhead.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Union, Stony, and Lottie (Taylor) lakes form a chain of lakes between Brohpy and Cowdry Lakes in Douglas County.  Union Lake is the first or upstream basin in the chain.  None of basins have public landings, but anglers can utilize access sites on Cowdry and Brophy Lakes and navigate small watercraft throughout the chain of lakes via flowage channels.  Large boats will be restricted by road crossings and undersized road culverts.  The lakes are small and relatively unique in that shoreline development is limited and much of the natural shoreline remains intact.    Water quality and clarity are very good.  Near-shore areas of each lake contain lush vegetative growth including bulrushes and water lilies.  Habitat attributes constitute ideal environment for northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill sunfish.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant.  Gillnet catch averaged 6.8/gillnet.  Average size of pike captured in 2007 was about 20.0 inches, but individuals approaching 30.0 inches were measured.  Pike do not grow fast in probable response to high summer water temperatures and limited yellow perch abundance.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest \"hammer-handle\" pike to thin the population and promote a balanced fish community. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill accounted for most of the total gamefish catch.   Population abundance is described as \"moderate\".  Size distribution of the population sample was fairly good.  Average size of 2008 survey catches was 6.2 inches. A few 8.0 inch and larger bluegill were recorded.   <br> \n <br> \nNavigation restrictions prevented utilization of electrofishing equipment to sample the largemouth bass population in 2008.  Habitat is excellent and prior survey statistics have described a moderately abundant population.  Growth is relatively slow, so most bass are 12.0 - 15.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow and black bullhead carry unique importance in terms of water quality.  Yellow bullheads prefer and do best in lakes with good water quality, while an abundant black bullhead population is indicative of poor water quality conditions.  Presently, the North Union/Stony/Lottie chain has a survey catch ratio of about 2:1 yellow to black bullheads.  Black bullhead abundance can be projected to increase should cumulative pressures of land use, shoreline development, and recreational boating increase.  Thoughtful, low-impact residential development practices and environmentally-sensitive surface water use will help to ensure long-term sustainability of these quality lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThose anglers without boats can still enjoy fishing Brohpy, Stony, and North Union lakes.  The Central Lakes Trail crosses portions of shorelines of these three lakes.  It's a fairly short hike or bike ride from downtown Alexandria.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Union Lake is a small, relatively shallow basin in a chain of three small lakes that connect Lake Brophy to Lake Cowdry.  The other lakes in this chain include Stoney and Lottie.  Total surface acreage of the three lakes is 253 acres.  The three lakes are treated as one in terms of fish management.  Management activities on this chain of lakes have been limited to periodic fish population surveys.  The Division of Fisheries has not stocked fish into any of these lakes because there is no legal public access.  Access to these lakes must be gained through culverts from lakes Brophy and Cowdry.  Culvert size and water level can restrict the size of boats that can access these lakes.All three lakes support abundant and diverse aquatic plant communities.  Submergent vegetation is dense in most shallow areas and the shoreline is fringed with common cattail.  These lakes also support beds of hardstem bulrush and wild rice.  Water lily is also common throughout the three lakes.  These aquatic plants provide valuable fish habitat and help maintain water quality in lakes.The fish communities present in these three lakes are quite similar and typical of small, densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and sunfish provide most of the fishing opportunities in this chain of lakes.  These species are all relatively abundant, but average size tends to be small.   Anglers tend to target these lakes when high winds force them off of the larger lakes.  Anglers also fish for black crappie on these lakes in the spring, prior to the walleye opener.  Walleye likely move throughout the chain from the other lakes and are present in low numbers.    </p>",

More than 50% of the Bluegill measured are over 6 inches long. The Northern Pike sampled were small and slow growing. The apparent low abundance of Yellow Perch may explain the slow growth of Northern Pike. Northern Cisco are relatively abundant. Although the Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie population appears to be low it is probably sampling void for those species. Yellow Bullhead are abundant with a good size frequency.</p>",
