Both bluegills and black crappies were found to be rather abundant. Each species were sampled within the normal range when compared to similar lakes. The average size of the bluegills and black crappies sampled was 5.7 inches and 7.7 inches respectively. Occasionally large crappies are caught in this lake.        Pumkinseed sunfish and green sunfish numbers were found to be above average for lakes of this type. The average length for pumpkinseed sunfish was 4.9 inches and was 4.5 inches for green sunfish.         Yellow perch, white suckers, golden shiners, and carp were all sampled within their normal ranges. Northern pike and largemouth bass were sampled in very low numbers. Only two northern pike, one 24 inches and one 26.5 inches, were captured. One largemouth bass measuring 8 inches in length was sampled in the trapnets.</p>",
