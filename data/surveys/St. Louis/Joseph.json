                "narrative": "<p>Joseph Lake is located five miles northwest of Babbit in central St. Louis County.  There is a county designated forest access road to the public access on the northeast corner of the lake.  After December 1st, only snowmobiles can use the access road.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Joseph Lake is in lake class 13.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Whisper, Buck, Madden, and Little Lakes.  Lakes in this lake class are small, shallow, and have high amounts of area less than 15 feet deep.  Joseph Lake is stocked by the DNR with walleye fry every third year. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2011, walleye abundance was typical of other lakes in the same lake class.  Upon aging walleye, it was found that 17 of 20 sampled walleye were from the 2009 year class, a stocked year.  Walleye ranged in  length from 13.7 inches to 27.9 inches with a mean length and weight of 15.8 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Growth was above average.  At age two, Joseph walleye averaged a full inch longer than walleye from other lakes in the same lake class. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike abundance dropped dramatically from the last survey in 2001.  With the exception of 2011, there had been an upward trend in abundance since 1966 assessment.  The three northern pike sampled in 2011 were 20.2, 20.7, and 28.9 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker abundance was down from 2001 findings.  The 2011 mean length of 18.4 inches was up from 2001 (11.8 inches). <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill abundance increased dramatically from 2001 and was well above what is typically found in other lakes in the same lake class.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3.6 inches to 8.9 inches with a mean length and weight of 6.9 inches and 0.3 pound.  Bluegill were age 2 to 10 with age 5 (2006) composing 41% of the catch and age six (2005), 31%.  Bluegill growth was average.  With firm substrate and adequate amounts submerged plants around most of the lake, Joseph Lake appears to have suitable habitat for spawning bluegill.   <br> \n <br> \nNine largemouth bass were captured that ranged in length from 4.8 to 15.3 inches and were composed of four different year classes.   <br> \n <br> \nJoseph Lake was selected for fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) sampling.  This index is designed to help determine the overall health of the biological fish community of the lake.  This type of sampling will typically capture the non-game species and young-of-year game species.  Ten different species were identified.  Iowa darter, golden shiner, blacknose shiner, and northern redbelly dace were non-game species sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should practice selective harvest when fishing. By keeping the medium-sized fish and releasing the larger fish, a quality size structure can be maintained and even improved. \"Releasing fish will grow on you.\"  <br> \n</p>",

White sucker numbers are below the local median. Largemouth bass, which were not found in the 1966 survey, are present, possibly remnants of stocking in the lake 1930's. Walleye age classes seem to be evenly distributed, indicating good natural reproduction. Growth rates of walleye are very fast, with only one fish over age IV caught. The average size of the walleyes taken was 18.3. Yellow perch are plentiful and are probably the forage base for these walleye. </p>",

Joseph Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it has a more irregular shoreline shape.Joseph Lake was thermally stratified on 06/08/2001 with a surface temperature of 81 F and a bottom temperature of 51 F, and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 16 ft, where the temperature was 61 F.  Joseph Lake has no inlet.  The outlet has a beaver dam which limits fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are 62% muck, 21% rubble, 9% sand, and 8% gravel.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 8 ft; waterlilies and largeleaf pondweed are the most common plants.  There is one home and two campsites on the lake.  There is an earthen access in poor condition off a logging road on State land.Fish sampling in this fish population assessment consisted of two gillnet sets and nine trapnet sets.  Three previous investigations, dating back to 1966, consisted of 1-3 gillnet sets and 4-8 trapnet sets.  Shoreline seining was done in 1966 and 1983.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets in 2001 of 7.4 fish/net (7.6 lbs/net) was similar to the median catch of 7.9 fish/net (5.9 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake. The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 2001 of 29.5 fish/net (52.9 lb/net) was in the third quartile by numbers of fish and the fourth quartile by weight of fish for this lake class, and was higher than the median catch of 28.5 fish/net (43.4 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.      Fish populations in 2001 were dominated by northern pike, walleye, and white sucker.  Other species were present in low numbers, although largemouth bass numbers may have been under represented by the net catches.Northern pike numbers in this lake have gradually increased over time, from 3.7/gillnet in 1968, to 5.0/gillnet in 1983, 10.0/gillnet in 1988, and 17.0/gillnet in 2001.  Northern pike numbers in 2001 were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Pike sizes in 2001 averaged 19.8\" (1.8 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 18.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike captured in 2001 was 25.4\".  Pike scales were somewhat difficult to read, but pike growth appeared to be slower than normal by area standards.  Most pike were ages 3-5.  White sucker were found in the stomachs of some of the northern pike captured in 2001.Walleye numbers have decreased over time, from 21.3/gillnet in 1968, to 12.0/gillnet in 1983, 5.0/gillnet in 1988, and 3.5/gillnet in 2001.  Walleye numbers in 2001 were in the second quartile for this lake class.  As walleye numbers have declined, walleye average sizes have increased, from 16.5\" in 1966 to 21.7\" in 2001.  No walleye under 16\" were captured in 2001.  Walleye scales were moderately difficult to read, but walleye growth appeared to be faster than normal by area standards.  Three of seven walleye stomachs examined in 2001 were empty, the remainder  contained darters, yellow perch, and a tadpole madtom.White sucker numbers in 2001 (7.5/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than in previous investigations where their numbers ranged from 1-3/gillnet.  Sucker sizes in 2001 averaged 11.8\" (1.2 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 14.0\" in all investigations on this lake.Bluegill numbers in 2001 (3.9/trapnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were higher than in previous investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes averaged 6.3\" (0.3 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class, and one-fourth were 8\" or larger.  Growth of young bluegill was slower than normal by area standards, while growth of older bluegill was faster than normal.Many of the fish examined in 2001 were infected with neascus (black spot).  Neascus is a parasite that is common and native to the area.  It cannot infect humans, is often removed by filleting, and is killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

Parking space is limited and anglers often use a portion of the parking lot for overnight camping. A small boat or similar watercraft is recommended for use. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye, bluegill, northern pike and white sucker were sampled during the 2018 survey of Joseph Lake. One yellow perch was tangled in the lead of a trap net and several largemouth bass were observed during the vegetation sampling. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2018 (8.3/gill net) were above the long term average (6.7/gill net) for this lake and above average (5.5/gill net) compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average walleye sampled was a respectable 19.4 inches. Walleye lengths ranged from 15.6 inches to a maximum of 27.2 inches. Walleye fry are currently stocked every third year in Joseph Lake and in 2018 ninety-six percent of the walleye aged were from years where stocking occurred. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2018 (17.9/trap net) were above the long term average (5.7/trap net) for this lake and above average (6.7/trap net) compared to other similar area lakes.
