Upper Cullen is located in the Crow Wing River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place September 2nd, 2021, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 4 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 3 stations.  Fifteen species were sampled, including six species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Pugnose Shiner.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted July 6-9, 2021, to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Cullen is at the head of the \"Cullen lakes chain\" watershed.  At 435 acres, it is the second largest of the three lakes.  An inlet, Cullen Brook, is a designated trout stream.  The outlet flows into Middle Cullen and eventually to Gull Lake.  Maximum depth is 40 ft..  About 69% of the lake area (300 acres) is shallower than 15 ft. deep.  Shallow water soils (less than 4 ft. deep) are about 50% mixed sand-gravel, 40% muck and 10% marl.  Submergent vegetation is diverse and grows to a depth of about 15 ft..  Water lilies are abundant.  Emergent vegetation is also plentiful.  Moderate to heavy stands of bulrush and wild rice are present around much of the shoreline.  They provide excellent spawning habitat for bass, sunfish and crappies.  Dense beds of emergents in shallow areas provide the majority of spawning habitat for northern pike in the \"Cullen chain\".  The lake is classified as a hardwater lake with moderate phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is about average for the area.Anglers would find northern pike, largemouth bass and sunfish to be most abundant in Upper Cullen.  Bluegills were abundant in '93 and growth was generally slow.  Other sunfish species were present in \"average\" numbers compared to lakes similar to Upper Cullen.  Crappies were caught in low numbers.  The number of bass sampled was low in '93, but previous nettings indicated that Upper Cullen has had an average to high bass population.  Northern pike were caught in \"average\" numbers in '93 and averaged about 1.9 lbs..  As has been true in previous nettings, the abundance of northern pike was higher and the average weight was lower than in the two downstream lakes in the \"chain\".  Walleyes continued to be present in \"average\" numbers, but fish tended to be older and larger individuals.  Ciscoes (tullibees) and yellow perch were present in \"average\" numbers and provided important food sources for northern pike, bass and walleyes.  Brown and yellow bullheads were present in low to average numbers.  Bowfin (dogfish) were present, also in average numbers.</p>",

Access may be gained via resort on the east side of the lake or by channel and through culvert from Middle Cullen.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was above average (13.1/gill net) for this type of lake.  Average length was 20.9\", with fish up to 34.7\" measured.  With 61% of the fish below the 22-26\" protected slot, there will be plenty of fish for people to keep. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were caught in above average numbers at 5.0/gill net.  Average length was 8.2\" and 57% of the fish were 8\" or larger.  Fish up to 14.1\" were sampled.  Bluegill numbers and size were not impressive.  The net catch was the lowest to date (6.6/trap net) and only 7% of the fish were 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes may be a bonus fish for anglers as well.  Although not stocked directly in Upper Cullen, they can make their way in via channel that connects to Middle Cullen.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in Middle Cullen every third year.  There may be some movement of Walleyes coming up from the upper part of the Gull Chain as well.  The Walleye catch rate in 2021 was 1.9/gill net.  The average size was large at 20\" and all of the fish were over 16\".  All of these walleyes, when aged, corresponded with fingerling stocking of Middle Cullen. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Cullen Lake is a 435 acre lake located in west-central Crow Wing County, just north of the City of Nisswa.  It has a maximum depth of 40 feet.  Access may be gained via resort on the east side of the lake or by channel and through culvert from Middle Cullen.  Northern pike is the primary management species while largemouth bass is the secondary management species of Upper Cullen.  Spring electrofishing for largemouth bass was conducted on May 21, 2015 while gill and trap nets were set during the week of July 6, 2015. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate for this survey was 8.6/ gill net.  The average size was 21.2\" with fish as large as 29.9\" measured.  Slightly over 13 percent were 24\" or larger.  In order to maintain and improve the northern pike size distribution, anglers are encouraged to harvest some of the smaller fish while releasing some of the larger fish, particularly those over 22\". <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass electrofishing yielded a catch rate of 28/hr, which is close to the previous catch rate of 30/hr in 2009.  The average size was 14.2\" with fish up to 17.5\" sampled.  The largemouth bass catch rate for in gill nets was 0.6/ net, which is also close to average for lakes like Upper Cullen.  The average size in gill nets was 14.9\" while 80 percent of the fish measured 15\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate of 2.2/ gill net was average for lakes similar to Upper Cullen.  Their average length was 9.2\" with the largest fish measuring 13.0\".  The growth rate for crappies was above average.  Sixty-five percent of the black crappies were 8\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are another option for anglers of Upper Cullen.  The catch rate for bluegill was 10.7/ trap net, which is below average for Upper Cullen.  The average size was 5.7\" with fish up to 8.5\" sampled.  Close to 44 percent of these bluegills were 6\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes may be a bonus fish for anglers as well.  Although not stocked directly in Upper Cullen, they can make their way in via channel that connects to Middle Cullen.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in Middle Cullen every third year.  There may be some movement of walleyes coming up from the upper part of the Gull Chain as well.  The walleye catch rate in 2015 was 1.8/ gill net, which is slightly above average for lakes similar to Upper Cullen.  The average size was 17.9\" with fish up to 28.1\" measured.  Just over 65 percent were 15\" or larger.  Most of these walleyes, when aged, corresponded with fingerling stocking of Middle Cullen. <br> \n <br> \nSome other fish species sampled during the survey include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, tullibee, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

Despite this fact, walleyes were caught in average numbers (0.8/gill net) when compared to similar lakes.  This suggests either natural reproduction or migration from connected lakes.  Average size was 21.9\" and 3.9 lbs. and all of the fish were 16\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in high numbers (12.4/gill net), although the fish were on the small side.  They averaged 20.3\" and 2.0 lbs.  Only 19% were 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were not real high (30.1/hr run-time), but size structure was good.  Average size was 13.7\" and 80% of the fish were over 12\". <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low and all of the fish were 8\" or larger.  Most of the fish were from the 2006 year class.  Bluegills were caught in average numbers (13.7/trap net).  Mean length was 5.0\" and only 6% of the fish were 7\" or larger.  Yellow perch numbers were low for the second straight survey (0.9/gill net).  Mean length was 6.7.\" <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

NORTHERN PIKE CATCHES INDICATED A HIGH POPU- LATION WHEN COMPARED TO AREA MEDIANS. NORTHERN PIKE AGED SHOWED ONLY TWO YEAR CLASSES PRESENT, TWO AND THREE YEAR OLDS. THE TWO YEAR AGE GROUP MADE UP 83% OF THE FISH SAMPLED. ALTHOUGH THE CATCH RATE OF 9.50/LIFT IS A HIGH POPULATION IT WAS DOWN FROM THE CATCH RATE OF 17.0/LIFT IN 1983. LENGTH FREQUENCY RANGED FROM 12 TO 32 INCHES WITH 70% OF THE FISH MEASURED IN THE 16 TO 19 INCH LENGTH GROUP. THE BLUEGILL POPULATION RANGED IN AGE FROM TWO TO EIGHT PLUS WITH THE FOUR YEAR GROUP BEING DOMINANT. GROWTH RATES FOR EVERY YEAR CLASS WAS NEAR OR BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE OF STATWEIDE AVERAGES, INDICATING A SLOW GROWING POPULATION. LARGEMOUTH BASS ARE PRESENT, BUT ONLY FIVE WERE SAMPLED IN THE TEST NETS. YEAR CLASSES THREE TO FIVE WERE REPRESENTED WITH THREE OF THE FIVE BEING THREE YEAR OLDS. ALL SHOWED AVERAGE GROWTH RATES. THE BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATION WAS AVERAGE, WITH THE LENGTH-FREQUENCY RANGING FROM FOUR TO ELEVEN INCHES. AGE GROUPS REPRESENTED WERE ONE, TWO FOUR AND SIX, WITH 55% BEING THE FOUR YEAR AGE GROUP. ALL AGE GROUPS SHOWED GOOD GROWTH RATES. THE WALLEYE CATCH RATE WAS 2.5/LIFT WHICH IS A LITTLE ABOVE ABOVE FOR THIS SIZE AND DEPTH OF LAKE. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY RANGED FROM 14 TO 26 INCHES WITH 80% BEING FROM 16 TO 18 INCHES. THE FISH THAT WERE SAMPLED WERE EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE FIVE, SIX AND SEVEN YEAR AGE GROUPS. ALL INDICATED AVERAGE GROWTH RATES. A HIGH CATCH RATE OF YELLOW AND BROWN BULLHEADS IN THE GILL NETS WOULD SUGGEST THERE IS A HIGHER POPULATION THAT THE TRAP NETS INDICATED. LENGTH FREQUENCY RANGED FROM 6 TO 12 INCHES WITH 68% OF THE FISH MEASURED FROM 9 TO 11 INCHES. BLACK BULLHEADS WERE TAKEN IN THE GILL NETS AND NONE WERE TAKEN IN THE TRAP NETS, SO THERE IS A FAIR POPULATION OF BLACK BULLHEADS ALTHOUGH NOT INDICATED BY THE TRAPNETS. LENGTH FREQUENCY RANGED FROM 6 TO 13 INCHES. MINETY-ONE PERCENT OF THE BLACK BULLHEADS ARE 9.5 INCHES OR LARGER. PUMPKINSEEDS, ROCK BASS AND HYBRID SUNFISH ARE ALSO PRESENT IN UPPER CULLEN LAKE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Cullen is a 435 acre headwater lake in a chain of three lakes which eventually drains into the Gull Lake chain.  The lake is located about three miles southeast of Pequot Lake, in Crow Wing County.  Development is mainly along the east shore, with 4.4 homes/cabins present per shoreline mile in 1998.  One resort was present also.  Public access is limited to the channel between Middle and Upper Cullen lakes.The lake has a maximum depth of 40 feet and about 69% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with low to moderate phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity was somewhat below average for the area in 1998.  The aquatic plant community is very diverse.  Hardstem bulrush and wild rice are quite common and provide important fish spawning habitat.  Harvestable quantities of rice are present, mostly along the lake's north side.Test netting was conducted in 1998.  Northern pike numbers were in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes and when compared to past nettings of the lake.  Pike ranged from 14-34 inches and averaged 19 inches and 2.0 lbs., similar to the catch in the 1993 netting.  Pike tend to be more abundant and smaller in this lake than in the lower lakes because Upper Cullen contains most of the suitable spawning habitat present in this chain of lakes.  Walleye numbers bordered on \"low\" when compared with similar type lakes but were typical for this lake.  Most walleyes found in the lake are probably migrants from lakes lower in the chain.  Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers.  However, bass are difficult to sample with stationary nets.  Young bass were common in shoreline seine hauls.  Bluegill numbers were lower in '98 than in previous nettings.  The general size structure of the population appears to be similar to past nettings.  For example, about 20% of measured bluegills were at least 7.0 inches long, a value very similar to those from the previous two nettings.  Black crappies were caught in \"low\" numbers in trap nets and in \"high\" numbers in gill nets.  Most crappies sampled were aged 2-4, with the age two fish being most abundant in the catch.  Growth rates for all species examined was generally good.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Cullen is a 435 acre lake located about three miles southeast of Pequot Lakes in Crow Wing County.  This is the headwater lake in a three lake chain that eventually drains into the Gull Lake Chain.  Access is available through a narrow channel from Middle Cullen.  Development is primarily concentrated on the east shore, with 19 homes/cabins along 4.3 miles of shoreline in 1998.  The maximum depth is 40' and about 69% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist of sand, gravel, rubble, and muck.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 28 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants are common along the shoreline and species such as hardstem bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  Northern pike were caught in average numbers in 2003 at 11.1/gill net, which is the second highest catch to date.  The 2000 and 2001 year classes contributed 70% of the catch with most of these fish measuring about 15\" to 23\".  Average length and weight were similar to the previous survey in 1998 at 21.1\" and 2.3lbs. The 2003 walleye catch of 1.7/gill net was average when compared to similar lakes and previous catches on this lake.  The fish tended to be old with 58% being at least 7 years old.  Average length and weight increased from 19.2\" and 2.4lbs in 1998 to 21.3\" and 3.0lbs in 2003.The largemouth bass abundance of 2.0/gill net was above average compared to similar lakes.  No largemouth bass were sampled by trap nets.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 51.5/hr with an average length of 10.0\" and 34% measuring > 12\".  Bluegill and black crappies were present in average numbers.  Growth was average for crappies, but slow for bluegills. Tullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish and were below average in numbers.  No tullibee were caught in 2003 and the yellow perch abundance of 0.7/gill net was the second lowest in the 6 nettings dating to 1974.  </p>",
