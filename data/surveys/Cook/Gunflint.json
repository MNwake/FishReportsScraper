The number of net sets, and the mix of deep and shallow sets, was similar to past surveys.  The Gunflint Lake basin is relatively simple; it is essentially a long, deep, narrow trench.  The border runs down the middle, and similar habitats can be found on both sides of the border.  Gill net sets we were unable to make on the Ontario side of the lake were replaced by sets in similar habitat on the Minnesota side, to the extent we were able to make that determination. <br> \n <br> \nThis was the third of three surveys scheduled in the 2004 lake management plan to determine whether there was a need to resume Walleye stocking in this lake, and to continue to monitor the Lake Trout population.  In addition, Gunflint Lake has served as a comparison lake in the on-going evaluation of Northern Pike regulations in nearby Loon Lake (a 30-in minimum size limit on that lake).  Conditions for a resumption of Walleye stocking were met in the first (2007) survey, and walleye stocking resumed in 2008.  Surveys done since that time (including this one) are part of the evaluation of that stocking. <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of Walleye were found in 2015, but most of the fish taken were small and young.  The Walleye catch fell short of the long range goal in the 2004 plan, but was similar to combined catches seen in this lake since 1986.  The other aspect of the 2004 goal, that at least 25% of the Walleye catch should consist of fish five or more years of age, was also not met in 2015.  Only six of the 51 Walleye taken in deep or shallow gill net sets (12%) were five or more years old.  A fairly strong 2014 year class, and a moderately strong 2011 year class, together accounted for 64% of Walleye taken in all gears in this assessment.  The strength of the 2014 and 2011 year classes (and to some extent the 2008 year class), combined with a lack of strong year classes in unstocked years (2013 possibly excepted) suggested stocking had contributed strongly to the 2015 catch.  Growth of young walleye had been somewhat faster than average; four-year-old fish reached a mean length of 15.2 inches by the end of their fourth year, compared to an area average of 14.4 inches.  With Yellow Perch scarce in this lake, it is likely that small Cisco, Rainbow Smelt, and invertebrates were important forage sources for Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout numbers were only fair in 2015, but those that were found were above average in size.  The Lake Trout catch goal from the 2004 plan was not met, but the size goal (some fish over 25 inches present) was.   Nine year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the catch.  Although no strong year classes were observed, it did appear that Lake Trout reproduction continued at adequate levels.  Growth of young Lake Trout had been about average for a lake of this type.  Fish reached a mean length of 11.8 inches by the end of their fourth year. <br> \n <br> \nAs has usually been the case in this lake, only a few Northern Pike were collected, but those that were seen were large.  Five year classes contributed to the catch, although none were strong.  Although sample sizes have been low in both lakes, survey data suggest that since the special regulation was implemented on Loon Lake, size distributions for Northern Pike have improved more in Gunflint (the unregulated comparison) than in Loon. <br> \n <br> \nThe Smallmouth Bass catch in shallow gill net sets was one of the lower catches seen in that gear in Gunflint Lake since 1994.  Few fish larger than 12 inches seemed to have been present, although too few Smallmouth Bass were taken to describe length distributions with any confidence.  <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass were apparently abundant in Gunflint Lake in 2015, and some were large enough to have been of interest to anglers, perhaps.   Rock Bass were first taken in gill nets in Gunflint Lake in 2003, and their numbers have increased in each subsequent survey.  They probably entered the lake from Loon Lake (upstream of Gunflint Lake), where they have been present for many years.  The 2015 catch was high for a lake of this type.   Rock Bass probably compete with Yellow Perch and Smallmouth Bass in nearshore areas, and may have an adverse effect on both species. <br> \n <br> \nThe Cisco gill net catch fell within the normal range for that gear in lakes of this type, and was similar to catches seen in Gunflint Lake since 1948. Cisco would have provided important forage for Walleye, Lake Trout, and Northern Pike in this lake, giving it the ability to support high-quality populations of all three species. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Smelt have been present in Gunflint Lake since at least 1977, and modest numbers were taken in small-mesh gill nets in 2015.  Catches in small-mesh gill nets have varied considerably in this lake since that gear was first used in 1994.  but have generally been under 12.0 fish/set.  The 2015 catch was similar to most of those past catches. <br> \n <br> \nGunflint Lake is infested with spiny waterflea.  Users should be sure to drain and dry all equipment used in this lake before moving it to another waterbody. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

WAE FROM A WIDE RANGE OF SIZES WERE COLLECTED, INCLUDING FISH UP TO 32 IN.  SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES WERE REPRESENTED, WITH 1990 THE STRONGEST.  WAE GROWTH WAS FAST BY COOK COUNTY STANDARDS, WITH AGE III FISH AVERAGING 15. 5 IN AT LAST ANNULUS FORMATION, COMPARED TO THE COUNTY AVERAGE OF 11.0 IN.  FRY STOCKING APPEARED TO BE CONTRIBUTING LITTLE, IF ANYTHING, TO THE WAE POPULATION.  THE STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES, 1990 AND 1988, WERE UNSTOCKED, AND THERE WERE NO PARTICULARLY STRONG STOCKED YEAR CLASSES.  LAT ABUNDANCE WAS GOOD FOR THIS LAKE, AND GOOD FOR LAKES OF THIS CLASS.  MOST OF THE LAT COLLECTED RANGED FROM 14 TO 21 IN, BUT FISH AS LARGE AS 34 IN WERE INCLUDED IN THE SAMPLE.  SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES WERE REPRESENTED, WITH 1986 AND 1985 THE STRONGEST, TOGETHER ACCOUNTING FOR 65% OF THE LAT SAMPLED.  LAT GROWTH WAS ABOUT AVERAGE FOR COOK COUNTY, WITH AGE V FISH AVERAGING 15.3 IN AT LAST ANNULUS FORMATION, COMPARED TO THE COUNTY AVERAGE OF 15.5 IN.  YEARLING STOCKING APPEARED TO BE CONTRIBUTING LITTLE OR NOTHING TO THE LAT POPULATION.  ALL LAT STOCKED SINCE 1986 HAVE BEEN FIN-CLIPPED, BUT NO FIN-CLIPPED FISH WERE TAKEN IN THIS ASSESSMENT.  IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A STRONG NATURALLY PRODUCED YEAR CLASS IN 1986, AND ANOTHER GOOD NATURAL YEAR CLASS IN 1988 ASSESSMENT ALSO CONCLUDED THAT LAT STOCKING WAS HAVING NO EFFECT. SMB AND NOP WERE PRESENT IN FAIR NUMBERS.  YEP ABUNDANCE WAS ABOUT FOR THIS LAKE, WITH FEW FISH LARGE ENOUGH FOR ANGLERS.  TLC ABUNDANCE WAS ALSO IN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THIS LAKE, WITH FISH COLLECTED RANGING FROM 7 TO 11 IN.  NO RBT SMELT WERE COLLECTED IN THIS ASSESSMENT; HOWEVER, MANY OF THE GAME FISH COLLECTED HAD BEEN FEEDING ON SMELT, AND THEY ARE STILL AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE FORAGE BASE.  SMELT IN GUNFLINT LAKE MAY BE TOO SMALL TO SAMPLE IN 1/2 IN MESH GILL NETS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gunflint Lake is part of the headwaters of the Rainy River watershed.  It is managed primarily for lake trout and walleye.  Long range goals for lake trout are to maintain a minimum gill net catch (in deep and shallow sets combined) of 1.0 fish/set, with fish up to 25 inches in length present.  Long range goals for walleye are to maintain a minimum gill net catch (in deep and shallow sets combined) of 4.0 fish/set, with at least 25% of that catch consisting of age-5 or older fish.  This was the first of three surveys scheduled in the 2017 lake management plan (LMP) to determine whether population goals for walleye in this lake could be met under the current fingerling stocking program, without implementing any special regulations.  Walleye stocking in Gunflint Lake resumed in 2008.  Surveys done since that time (including this one) are part of the evaluation of that stocking. <br> \n <br> \nThis was considered a targeted survey because we did not sample the Ontario side of the lake as we did prior to 2015.  However, results should be at least roughly comparable to results of previous standard surveys (and directly comparable to the 2015 survey).  The number of net sets, and the mix of deep and shallow sets, was similar to past surveys.  The Gunflint Lake basin is relatively simple; it is essentially a long, deep, narrow trench.  The border runs down the middle, and similar habitats can be found on both sides of the border.  Gill net sets we were unable to make on the Ontario side of the lake were replaced by sets in similar habitat on the Minnesota side, to the extent we were able to make that determination. <br> \n <br> \nLake trout are the primary management species in Gunflint Lake.  They were fairly abundant in 2019, and of good size. The 2019 gill net catch met long range catch and size goals for the species from the 2017 LMP.  The catch was typical for this lake historically, and fell well within the normal range for a Class 1 lake.   Eleven year classes, all naturally produced, and including fish as old as 16 years, contributed to the catch.  Although no strong year classes were observed, it did appear that lake trout reproduction continued at adequate levels.  Growth of young lake trout had been about average for a lake of this type.  Fish reached an average length of 12.3 inches by the end of their fourth year.  <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of walleye were present in 2019, but they tended to be small.  The combined catch of walleye in deep and shallow gill net sets (2.74 fish/set) fell short of the long range goal in the 2017 plan, but was similar to combined catches seen in this lake since 1986.  The other aspect of the 2017 goal, that at least 25% of the walleye catch should consist of fish five years of age or older, was met in 2019; 16 of the 52 walleye sampled (31%) were five years old.  However, no fish older than five were taken, so the quality of this population remained low.  Stocked year classes (2014 and 2017) accounted for 89% of the 2019 walleye catch, indicating stocking was probably essential at this point for maintaining the walleye population in this lake.  Walleye growth appeared to have been about average for the area; fish reached a mean length of 16.6 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to an area average of 16.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of older walleye have now been seen in 2011, 2015, and 2019.  That problem (low quality, and low broodstock numbers) is not likely to be  fixed by fingerling stocking alone.  Although stocking seems to have maintained modest walleye numbers (at a fairly high cost), fish have been small and their survival to older ages has been low.  As a result we have not yet been able to restore a high-quality walleye population to this lake.     <br> \n <br> \nAs has usually been the case in this lake, few northern pike were collected in 2019, but those that were seen were large.  Of the six northern pike collected, four were over 30 inches in length (up to 35.1 inches).  Five year classes (including fish up to eight years of age) contributed to the catch, although none were strong.    Because of the small sample size, no strong statements could be made regarding northern pike growth.  Growth of young fish appeared to have been about average for the area; at the end of their third year fish had reached a mean length of 21.1 inches.  With a low population density, good access to cool waters, and smelt and cisco available as forage, this lake is capable of producing some trophy northern pike.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 cisco catch in deep gill net sets fell within the normal range for that gear when used in Class 1 lakes in this area, and was similar to catches seen in Gunflint Lake since 2007.  The combined catch in deep and shallow gill net sets was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1948, including those seen prior to the introduction of rainbow smelt.  Cisco have provided important forage for walleye, lake trout, and northern pike in this lake, giving it the ability to support high-quality populations of all three species.  Past surveys indicate that the cisco community in Gunflint Lake consists of northern cisco and shortjaw cisco, with the latter perhaps the more common of the two in this lake. <br> \n  <br> \nSmallmouth bass were fairly abundant in 2019, and their average size was quite good.  The smallmouth bass catch in shallow gill net sets was one of the higher catches seen in that gear in Gunflint Lake since 1983, and was high compared to similar lakes in the area.  The mean weight for fish taken in those nets was also high, compared to similar lakes.  Seven year classes contributed to the catch, with none standing out as exceptionally strong.  Smallmouth bass growth had been average for the area; fish reached a mean length of 13.7 inches at the end of their seventh year. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers have greatly increased in Gunflint Lake since 2003, and the catch in 2019 remained high.  The increase in rock bass numbers has been accompanied by a decline in yellow perch gill net catches, with 2019 being the first year in which no yellow perch were taken in gill net sets.  Rock Bass probably compete with yellow perch and smallmouth bass in nearshore areas, and may have an adverse effect on both species.  Their ability to provide forage for walleye and northern pike is unknown in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow smelt were first seen in Gunflint Lake in the 1970s.  Catches in small-mesh gill nets designed to sample smelt have varied considerably in this lake.  Catches since 1994 have ranged from 2.0 to 62.3 fish/set, but have generally been under 12.0 fish/set.  The 2019 catch was the lowest seen since 1994, and was well below  the normal range (10.8 - 62.3 fish/set) for small-mesh gill net sets in lakes supporting smelt in this area.  Although smelt are an excellent source of forage, they have also been associated with reproductive failures among cisco, walleye, and lake trout. <br> \n <br> \nGunflint Lake is infested with spiny waterflea.  Anglers and other users should be diligent about cleaning and drying any equipment used in this lake before moving to another. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gunflint is a 4009 acre lake located 48 miles northwest of Grand Marais. A public boat landing can be found in the southwestern corner of the lake. Gunflint is primarily managed for lake trout and walleye. The 2023 survey of Gunflint Lake was the second of three surveys scheduled to evaluate the lake trout and walleye populations.  <br> \n <br> \nLake trout abundance was similar to historical catches and met the current management goal and is above average for similar area lakes. Lake trout ranged from 7.8 to 27.2 inches with a mean length of 18.5 inches. Aging results found 12 different naturally reproduced year classes with the oldest fish being 26 years old. Naturally reproducing lake trout populations are unique in Minnesota lakes, anglers targeting lake trout should consider catch and release practices with safe handling procedures.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches were similar to recent surveys but fell slightly below average and did not meet the current management goal. Walleye ranged from 8.9 to 27.9 inches with a mean length of 16.1 inches. Aging results showed individuals from 9 different year classes present in the population. The largest year class (3-year-old fish) coincides with the walleye fingerling stocking of 2020. The oldest fish collected was 17 years old. Back calculated growth rates appear to be relatively fast compared to other area lakes, with walleyes reaching 17.2 inches at age 5. Some large sized walleye exist in Gunflint Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches were somewhat low but similar to surveys conducted since 2011. Northern pike were relatively large and ranged from 18.2 to 43.9 inches with a mean length of 25.1 inches. Gunflint Lake has the potential to produce trophy northern pike.  <br> \n <br> \nThe smallmouth bass catch is above average for similar area lakes, and in the normal range for Gunflint Lake. Smallmouth bass collected ranged from 8.8 to 17.8 inches with a mean length of 14.2 inches. Overall, good numbers of smallmouth bass with many large sized fish should be of interest to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers are relatively good in Gunflint Lake but have been slowly declining since their peak in 2011. Yellow perch catch rates were similar to historic levels. Rainbow smelt were first seen in Gunflint Lake in the 1970s. Catches in small-mesh gill nets designed to sample smelt have varied considerably in this lake but were considered low in 2023. Although smelt are an excellent source of forage, their naturalization has also been associated with reproductive failures among cisco, walleye, and lake trout. Catch rates of cisco were slightly above average for Gunflint Lake but comparable to surveys since 2003. <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions and Gunflint does have spiny water flea prevalent within the lake. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health. Anglers should clean watercraft and fishing gear, drain all water, and dispose of unused bait in the trash to prevent accidental introductions.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spiny waterflea were found in Gunflint Lake in 2007, and the lake is now considered an infested water for that species.  Anglers leaving the lake should take care to drain all bilges, livewells, bait buckets, and outboard cooling systems before leaving the access area, and should check and clean downrigger cables and anchor lines before moving to another lake.  Magnetic Lake must also be considered to be infested.  Anglers should take particular care not to transport any water from Gunflint Lake through the chain of lakes to North Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake trout catch in 2007 was relatively low, both for this lake historically, and in comparison to similar lakes in the area.  In contrast, the average size of lake trout taken was unusually high.  All lake trout taken in 2007 had been produced naturally, and growth rates had been about average for the area. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch in 2007 was low, continuing a long decline in walleye catch in this lake dating back to the 1980s.  Although numbers were low, the catch included some larger fish.  The population was supported entirely by natural reproduction, but few, if any, strong year classes had been produced recently.  The catch in 2007 met criteria for a resumption of walleye stocking, established for this lake in 2004. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low, but the average size for the fish that were taken was high.  Northern pike growth rates had been fast.  Smallmouth bass were present in average numbers, and were above-average in size.   <br> \n <br> \nForage for lake trout, walleye, and northern pike was provided by average-or-better numbers of cisco (also called tullibee or herring), rainbow smelt, and yellow perch.  Rainbow smelt were taken only in small-mesh gill nets.  Smelt catches have varied considerably in this lake; the smelt catch in 2007 was nearly double that of the 2003 assessment, less than one-fifth that of the 2000 assessment, and over five times that of the 1994 assessment.  A few of the yellow perch present in 2007 would have been large enough to have been of interest to anglers. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

All were capable of producing some trophy-sized fish, and were were present in average or above-average numbers and size, for a lake of this type.  The lake trout population in Gunflint Lake has been self-sustained since 1992, while walleye have not been stocked since 1991.  Forage for game fish was provided by relatively large numbers of rainbow smelt, a fairly high yellow perch population, and by a few northern cisco. Growth rates for walleye, northern pike, and smallmouth bass had been fast, while lake trout growth had been average for the area. Gunflint Lake is not known to support any panfish, and the yellow perch collected in 2000 would have been too small to have been of much interest to anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye catch in 2003, while within the normal range for a lake of this type, was still well below levels observed in this lake in the early 1980's.  A strong 2001 year class accounted for over 70% of the 2003 walleye catch, with few fish four years of age or older taken.  Walleye growth rates had been fast, due to the presence of an excellent forage base consisting of rainbow smelt, cisco, and yellow perch.  Two-year-old fish averaged 14.4 inches in length when collected in late July.  All walleye taken in 2003 had been produced naturally.The 2003 lake trout catch was also within the normal range for the lake class, and most of the fish taken were over 20 inches in length.  Several year classes, all naturally produced, were included in the catch.  Lake trout growth had also been fast; four-year-old fish averaged 15.2 inches when taken in late July.Catches of smallmouth bass and northern pike were low in 2003.  Low water and poor spawning success in recent years may have contributed to the low northern pike catch, since no young fish were taken.  The smallmouth bass catch included several year classes, but none were strong.  Smallmouth bass growth had been fast for this area.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This was the second of three surveys included in the 2004 lake management plan.  Initially, the surveys were to be used to determine whether walleye stocking was needed.  That determination was made following the 2007 assessment, and walleye fingerling stocking began in 2008.  Surveys will now be used to evaluate that stocking. <br> \n <br> \nThe long range goal for walleye in this lake is to achieve a minimum gill net catch of 4.0 fish/set, with at least 25% of that catch consisting of fish five or more years old.  The catch goal was nearly met in 2011; the 2011 assessment yielded a gill net catch of 3.25 fish/set.  The age goal for the catch was not met, since 80% of walleye taken in gill nets were three-year-old fish from the 2008 year class.  Although the strength of that year class could well have been due to fingerling stocking done in that year, it should be noted that equally dominating year classes have been produced naturally in this lake in the past.  No other strong year classes were evident in 2011.  Growth of three-year-old walleye had been close to average; they reached an average length of 11.4 inches by the end of their third year.  Those fish should have been showing up in angler's catches in 2011, and should drive some good fishing in 2012.  Anglers should consider releasing some of those fish to extend the benefits of that strong year class, and help improve the quality of the fishery in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe long range goal for lake trout in this lake is to maintain a population yielding a minimum gill net catch of 1.0 fish/set.  That goal was met by the catch in the 2011 assessment, as was the goal of providing some fish up to 25 inches in length.  Several year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the 2011 lake trout catch, although none stood out as having been exceptionally strong.  Lake trout growth had been somewhat faster than average; seven-year-old fish reached an average length of 20.2 inches by the end of their seventh year, compared to an average of 18.1 inches for other lakes in this area.  Lake trout as old as 18 years were collected, and many of the fish taken were over 10 years old. <br> \n <br> \nGunflint Lake serves as a control for the evaluation of a special regulation (a 30-in minimum size limit) on northern pike in Loon Lake.  Both lakes support high-quality, and fairly low-density, northern pike populations.  The northern pike gill net catch in Gunflint Lake in 2011 barely reached the normal range for a lake of this type, but was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1948.  The mean weight for northern pike taken in gill nets (5.28 lb/fish) was at the upper end of the normal range, but was not unusually high for this lake.  Northern pike recruitment was apparently low; although several year classes contributed to the catch, no fish younger than four years were taken.  Northern pike growth had been somewhat slow; fish reached an average length of 20.7 inches by the end of their fourth year. <br> \n <br> \nThe smallmouth bass gill net catch and the mean weight for smallmouth bass collected in gill nets in 2011 were within normal ranges for a lake of this type, and were similar to catches and mean weights observed in this lake since 1976.  Although several year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the catch, it appeared that recent recruitment had been low.  Most of the catch consisted of fish four years of age or older.  Growth of older fish had perhaps been slightly faster than average; fish reached an average length of 11.3 inches by the end of their fifth year. <br> \n <br> \nForage for lake trout in this lake has been provided by cisco and rainbow smelt.  The catch of cisco in gill nets in 2011, and their mean weight, were similar to those observed in this lake in the past.  Rainbow smelt were still present, but no small-mesh gill nets were used in this assessment, so their abundance cannot be determined.  The yellow perch gill net catch in 2011 was low for a lake of this class, but was not unusually low for this lake historically.  Given the low yellow perch abundance typically seen in this lake, it is likely that walleye and northern pike depend mostly on cisco and smelt for forage. <br> \n <br> \nNo new undesirable, exotic, or invasive species were found in Gunflint Lake in 2011.  The lake remains infested with spiny waterflea.   Anglers leaving the lake should take extra care to drain all live wells, bait buckets, and bilges, and thoroughly dry their boat and all ropes, lines, and other equipment before using them in another lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
