Trapnet catches of bluegill were also very high, about 15X established medians.  Age class structure of northern pike was made up of ages II-VI.  These fish demonstrated average growth.  Largemouth bass were seen as age III and V fish with slightly less than average growth.  PSD of bluegill was 66.3; of largemouth bass it was 100.  Reproduction checks showed adequate presence of young largemouth bass and bluegills.</p>",

It contains a typical largemouth bass-bluegill-northern pike fish community of above average abundance and generally below average size. During the 2008 assessment, northern pike (NOP) were sampled in the highest abundance ever recorded for this lake in gill nets. The average size of NOP captured was approximately 21.0 inches and 2.0 pounds. Approximately 4% of the NOP captured measured 26.0 inches or larger. Bluegill (BLG) were sampled in the highest abundance since 1993, but they averaged only 5.6 inches in length and 0.14 pounds. Approximately 15 percent of the BLG captured measured 7.0 inches or larger. Some quality largemouth bass are present in this lake, but only two individuals averaging 13.6 inches and 1.3 pounds were sampled in the gill net catch. Black Crappie (BLC) were sampled above median levels in gill nets, but below median levels in trap nets. The average size of BLC captured was 6.83 inches in length and 0.17 pounds, with approximately one third of the individuals sampled measuring 8.0 inches or larger. Despite recent stocking efforts, only 2 walleye were captured during this assessment. Yellow perch continue to persist in the lakes fish population, but in very low numbers. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Located 2 miles southeast of Saint Francis, MN, George Lake is a 488-acre lake with a maximum depth of 32 feet. A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by IBI Program Staff on George Lake on 15 - 16 July 2015 to assess populations of non-game species and small sport fish. Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine.  <br> \n <br> \nNearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including many species intolerant of disturbance such as Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter. Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Silverside, Green Sunfish, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Spotfin Shiner, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. Nearshore catches were used  with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a survey on 16 - 19 June 2014, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of George Lake. The fish IBI score for George Lake was just below the impairment threshold developed for similar lakes, but given other recent nearshore surveys that scored at or just above the threshold, insufficient information is available to determine impairment status.   <br> \n <br> \nA preliminary review of stressors found watershed (33% disturbed land cover) and riparian (2013 Score the Shore Survey score: 50/100; approximately 18 docks per kilometer of shoreline) characteristics near or surpassing levels thought to impact the fish community. Based on this information we also recommend that George Lake be recognized as \"Vulnerable\" to future impairment with additional watershed and/or shoreline disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. George Lake is located in the Rum River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

There are 535 acres which are listed as being in the meandered (surveyed) area of the lake.A maximum depth of 32 feet is attained in the lake and the median depth is 5 feet.  Approximately 80 percent of the lake or 393 acres is less than 15 feet deep.  During the survey the water was quite clear and a good growth of submerged aquatic plants was present most everywhere.  Emergent plant life, mostly bulrush, covered 5 to 10 percent of the lake surface.  Soil of the more shallow area is 100 percent sand.  The lake has four inlets and 1 outlet.  One of the inlets was dry.  Four lowland areas or marshes are scattered along the north lake shore and a fifth marshy area extends along the outlet.At the time of the lake survey 2 resorts (12 cabins), 138 private homes or cottages, and 156 boats were counted.  There is no designated public access.  However, the public does gain access from roads closely paralleling the lake and from an extension of a county road on the east side of the lake.The results of test netting indicated that numbers of white sucker, yellow perch, black bullhead, brown bullhead, green sunfish, black crappie, white crappie, and largemouth bass are below respective state-wide medians (numbers per net set).  Numbers of northern pike, dogfish, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and hybrid sunfish were above determined state-wide medians.  In this latter group of fish all but dogfish may be said to have quite dense populations.</p>",

The lake is relatively clear and supports a diverse aquatic plant community which provides ample habitat for the resident fish population. Above average water quality makes this a popular recreation lake.  Basin characteristics place Lake George in lake class 29. Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass are the primary management species in the lake. The DNR has attempted to establish a Walleye population in the past with no success and currently no stocking is conducted. The survey utilized gill net and traps nets deployed in June primarily to inform an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey done in conjunction with this effort.  <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled by gill nets at a rate of 18.6 fish per net. While this rate greatly exceeds the 75th percentile for the lake class, it is typical relative to historical surveys. Fish size was smaller than average for the lake class but typical for the lake with a mean length of 19.5 inches and a range of 13.3 to 28.2 inches.  <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled by trap nets at a rate of 0.8 fish per net. This is well below average for the lake class but typical relative to historical surveys. Fish size exceeded the 75th percentile for the lake class with a mean length of 9.7 inches and a range of 8 to 10.9 inches. Even larger fish were sampled by gill nets with the majority of fish over 10 inches long, the longest of which measured 14.6 inches.  <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 5.7 fish per trap net. This is quite low relative to both the lake and the lake class. Size was typical with fish ranging from 2.2 to 7.9 inches and averaging 5.7 inches in length.  <br> \nOther species sample included: Black Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

Nearly 50% of the bluegills sampled exceeded 6 inches in length, but only 11% exceeded 7 inches. Northern pike are also abundant. The catch is above average for this type of lake. The average length sampled was 19.3 inches. A moderate amount of largemouth bass were sampled. Individuals up to 16.8 inches were sampled. Yellow and black bullheads were each sampled within the normal ranges for this lake. Average lengths from each species exceeded 10 inches. While black crappie numbers are higher than previously sampled, the catch is still below average. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake George is a round and shallow basin (79% littoral) that lies in the Anoka sand plain. The lake is relatively clear and supports a diverse aquatic plant community which provides ample habitat for the resident fish population.  It contains a typical Largemouth Bass-Bluegill-Northern Pike fish community. Above average water quality makes this a popular recreation lake.  Basin characteristics place Lake George in lake class 29. Recent fish management efforts have attempted to establish a Walleye population through stocking but this assessment indicates poor recruitment of stocked fingerlings, likely due to the high Northern Pike population. During the 2014 assessment, Northern Pike were sampled at a lower rate than the previous survey. The average size of pike captured was approximately 21 inches and 2 pounds. About 13% of them measured 26 inches or larger. Only three Walleyes were captured during this assessment and averaged 23.7 inches. Bluegill abundance was cut in half from the previous survey, however they were still found in high abundance for this type of lake. Bluegill averaged 6.1 inches and 12% of them were 7 inches in length or larger. Black Crappies were captured in high abundance and averaged between 6.6 and 6.9 inches in total length. Approximately one quarter of the crappie captured in the trap nets were 8 inches or larger.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of near shore fish species was conducted on June 29, 2015 by Lake IBI program staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 8 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 1 station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 1 site.  Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including several species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Least Darter).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in 2014 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (IBI) that describes the overall health of the fish community.  The Fish IBI score for George Lake based on this survey is near the threshold for similar lakes and indicates the fish community may be vulnerable to impairment with additional human disturbance. <br> \n</p>",
