                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in Shamineau Lake has changed dramatically throughoutits history.  In the 1950's the lake was characterized by high numbers ofwalleye and yellow perch with a low population of northern pike.  With the onsetof winter rescue northern pike stocking in the 1960's, yellow perch declinedprecipitously, causing instability in predator populations in the 1970's throughthe present.     The number of walleye is about average for lakes similar to Shamineau butsignificantly below historical population sizes and current management goals. Natural reproduction sustained high walleye populations in the 1950's in theabsence of stocking when perch numbers were high and northern pike numbers low. Despite intensive walleye stocking from the 1970's through the present,populations during the last two assessments have been below management goals. Fishing for walleye typically is difficult on Shamineau.  Due to its clearwaters, anglers do best on overcast days or at night.  The 1994 assessmentsuggested good numbers of fish over 15 inches in length are available to theangler.  Trophy individuals over 10 pounds are present in the lake.     Northern pike numbers were down significantly from that observed during the1990 population assessment and are within management goals.  Hopefully, withfewer northerns in the lake, individual growth will improve so that more qualityindividuals will be available to the angler.  Another desired result would be anincrease in the yellow perch prey base back to levels observed in the 1950's. Lower pike numbers could also decrease competition with and predation on walleyefingerlings resulting in a higher population of this highly prized gamefish. Anglers report high catch rates of small northern pike in Shamineau.  We wouldencourage anglers to keep small northerns under 21 inches and release all largerfish.  This should help maintain a balanced fish community in the lake.     Yellow perch numbers were low for this lake class and this has had dramaticimpacts on the remainder of the fish community.  Perch are the principal preyspecies for walleye and northern pike.  Studies have also shown a directassociation between a healthy perch population and a well balanced bluegillpopulation with fast growing, quality size individuals.     Muskellunge management began in 1988.  Legal size (> 40\") muskies should bepresent in 1995.  At least four year classes have been stocked since 1988.     Shamineau Lake has a reputation for producing largemouth bass in excess of6 pounds.  Individuals in the 12 to 15 inch range were common in the 1994assessments.  The decline in northern pike abundance should enhance younglargemouth survival.     Panfish have always been highly sought on Shamineau.  Bluegills, althoughslow growing, often survive long enough to reach \"keeper\" size (> 7\").  Apopular \"late ice\" fishery exists.  Black crappies of quality size are presentin good numbers.  A high percentage of crappies caught in the 1994 assessmentwere 10 inches and greater.  Trophies over 14 inches are also present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Shamineau Lake is located in northwest Morrison County and supports a diverse fish community that attracts anglers to the lake.  The lake has excellent water clarity with a secchi disk reading of 19 feet at the end of July.  Two public accesses and two resorts can be found on the lake.  The lake is heavily developed along its west, south, and east shores with more development occurring recently on the bluffs along the north shore.  Camp Shamineau, a privately owned bible camp, owns about one mile of shoreline on the north shore which is mostly undeveloped.  Dense vegetation beds, of which Canada waterweed, northern watermilfoil, and water (wild) celery are the most commons species, grow out to a depth of 17 feet.  Sand is the most abundant shallow water substrate.  The lake has a regulation requiring the immediate release of northern pike between 24 and 36 inches with one over 36 inches allowed in possession.   The objective of the regulation is to improve the northern pike population size structure.  The primary fishery management focus is on walleye and northern pike with secondary management on muskellunge, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill. <br> \n      With the excellent water clarity, walleye anglers are more likely to have better luck at night or on overcast days.  A wide range of sizes are available to fishermen with fish between 10 and 28 inches observed in the survey.  Regular stocking of walleye fry and fingerlings supplement any natural reproduction and maintains the population while meeting fishing pressure demands.   Northern pike numbers showed a significant increase in abundance since the last survey.   Average size of the pike in the summer survey was 18 inches or 1.5 pounds.  A spring assessment in 2009 showed a different picture of the pike population.  Northern pike up to 35 inches were measured and the average size was 23 inches or about three pounds.   Muskellunge fishing has become popular on Shamineau Lake with fish over 45 inches common and 50 plus inch fish are regularly reported by anglers. <br> \n       Shamineau Lake has a healthy population of largemouth bass.  Most of the bass measured in the survey were less than 12 inches, however, fish up to 17 inches were documented.  Black crappie fishing success seems to vary from year to year.   Although all of the crappie caught in the summer survey were less than nine inches in length, anglers reported catching 13 to 14 inch fish in the spring and spring assessments have also documented the larger crappie.  Bluegill numbers were within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  Most of the larger bluegill, over seven inches in length, were caught in deeper water during the summer survey while the trap net catch was dominated by smaller fish under five inches in length.  There are also pumpkinseed sunfish and rock bass in the lake which can provide additional panfish angling.  Some eight-inch pumpkinseed and ten-inch rock bass were measured in the survey. <br> \n       While most the yellow perch were too small to be of interest to anglers, they were a good prey size for gamefish such as walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge.   A more abundant perch population would be desirable as they help maintain good growth rates in the gamefish populations and they have also been found to help maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  Tullibee or cisco were stocked in 2002 and 2003 to hopefully establish a population that could provide an additional prey species for the larger gamefish.  So far no tullibee have been seen in our sampling indicating questionable survival. <br> \n       The roughfish community in Shamineau Lake consists of black bullhead, yellow bullhead, and white sucker.  The yellow bullhead was the more abundant of the two bullhead species.  Although the average size for the yellow bullhead was nine inches, there were some fish up to eleven inches measured.  <br> \n       Protecting the water quality in Shamineau Lake has been and should be a high priority of the lake association and landowners around the lake.  Preservation of the emergent vegetation beds can improve water quality, reduce shoreline erosion, and provide valuable fish habitat.  Fishermen and recreational boaters are reminded that they need to be diligent about cleaning both their boats and trailers when going between lakes to prevent the spread of exotic species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      A special assessment was conducted at ice-out on Shamineau Lake to evaluate the Muskellunge population.   The Spring of 2013 was abnormally cool and ice was late in leaving the lake.  More nets were added each day as the ice receded until there were a total of ten large-frame trap nets.  Strong winds during the netting period also caused problems with collapsing nets and moving ice onto nets.  Most of the Walleye and Northern Pike had finished spawning.   Some historical net locations  produced relatively few Muskellunge in this assessment.   All gamefish species were measured as well as a subsample of Black Crappie, Bluegill, and White Sucker.  Scales were collected from Northern Pike during the assessment to evaluate age and growth rates as well as evaluate the 24 - 36 inch Northern Pike slot.  Other fish species were identified and counted. <br> \n      Weights as well as lengths were taken from Muskellunge during the first week of the assessment.   Muskellunge in Shamineau Lake do not appear to be as heavy for their length as other central Minnesota lakes.  All Muskellunge were measured and given a fin-clip to detect recaptures.  Recaptured Muskellunge were sexed and re-measured but not included in the length frequency distribution.   Twenty-five males and fourteen female Muskellunge were recaptured during the netting period.  Two unclipped fingerling Muskellunge were also netted, suggesting natural reproduction, as all stocked fingerlings are fin-clipped.  Daytime electrofishing was conducted to provide a larger sample size.  Shamineau Lake has an estimated adult population of 204 fish using the Schnabel Method.  (+95 CL : 151 - 282 fish).    Population estimates were 447 adults in 2009 and 403 adults in the 2003 Muskellunge assessments.  <br> \n       A total of 102 Muskellunge were netted during the 2013 Muskellunge assessment for a catch rate of 1.2/LTN.  The fish ranged from 35.5 to 52.6 inches in length with a mean length of 43.2 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 40 - 41 inches.  Muskellunge exceeding forty inches in length comprised 93% (n=95) of the catch with 22% (n=22) more than forty-five inches.   Sex ratio of the Muskellunge sample was 2.2 males per female which has been typical.  Sixty-two percent (n=20) of the thirty-two females exceeded forty-five inches which surpassed the lake management goal of at least 30% of the spring catch of females exceed forty-five inches in length.   The 2013 spring catch also caught five female Muskellunge which were more than fifty inches in length which has been the highest catch so far for that size fish.   (Refer to Table (1) for Muskellunge catches since 1995.)       <br> \n      The 2013 Muskellunge assessment also targeted Northern Pike.  Shamineau Lake had a reputation as a \"hammerhandle\"pike lake.   A regulation was implemented in 2003 which required the immediate release of Northern Pike between 24 and 36 inches with one fish over 36 inches allowed in possession.   (Refer to Table (1) for Northern Pike catches since 1995.) <br> \n    With the lower pike catch in the 2003 Muskellunge assessment a more desirable size structure was displayed.  However, the low sample size in 2003 may not have been sufficient for accurate representation of population structure.  There was an improved mean length as well as a great portion of the sample exceeding 24 and 30 inches.  The most desirable population size structure was observed in the 2006 Muskellunge assessment.  Quality appeared to decline by the 2009 assessment and by 2013, the mean length was similar to those recorded in the pre-reg assessments.   The portion of the 2013 sample exceeding twenty-four inches was only slightly better than that observed in 2000 and earlier assessments.  While the portion of pike exceeding 30 inches in 2013 declined from the 2009 assessment, it was an improvement over the three earliest assessments. <br> \n     Ages 2 through 12 were represented in the female portion of the 2013 Northern Pike catch and ages 2 through 8 in the male portion suggesting consistent recruitment.  Ages 3 and 4 females showed slow growth as did all the male age groups while the remaining female age groups showed normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  Female pike grew from 0.1 to 7.9 inches longer than males of the same age.  The 2008 year class accounted for 31% of the combined Northern Pike catch. <br> \n      Most of the Muskellunge assessments have been effective at sampling Walleye with the exception of 2003 when only 27 fish were caught.   Walleye catches have ranged from 149 fish in 1995 to 282 fish in 2000.  The 2013 assessment netted 186 Walleye between 8.5 and 28.7 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 17.4 inches with 33% (n=62) exceeding 20 inches in length.  Smaller fish were more prevalent in the 2013 assessment, as the assessment produced the shortest mean length as well as the smallest portion of the sample more than twenty inches of any of the Muskellunge assessments.  Significant numbers of small Walleye between eight and twelve inches indicates recent recruitment success.  Previously, 20.2 inches (1995) had been shortest mean length and 56% (1995) the lowest portion exceeding twenty inches.  With the smaller sample in 2003, larger fish dominated the catch.  Mean length was 24.2 inches and 89% (n=24) of the Walleye were more than twenty inches in length.   <br> \n     Muskellunge assessments have also sampled high numbers of Black Crappie.  The 2013 catch of 654 Black Crappie was the third highest for the seven Muskellunge assessment conducted on Shamineau Lake.  Eight hundred sixty-five crappie were caught in 2000 and 1,168 crappie in 1997.  The lowest crappie catch was ninety-two in 2006 with catches of 130 fish in 2009 and 359 in 2003.  The 2013 Muskellunge assessment was the first spring assessment to net a Black Crappie that exceeded fourteen inches in length.  The previous record was 13.9 inches in 2000.  Black Crappie exceeding ten inches have comprised significant portions of the catches, 45% (n=296) in 2013, 78% (n=71) in 2009, 63% (n=58) in 2006, and 82% (n=296) in 2003.  The measured subsamples in the three earliest Muskellunge assessments were likely not large enough to properly  represent the population size structures. <br> \n     High numbers of Bluegill have also been caught during the spring Muskellunge assessments.  Catches have ranged from 1,707 Bluegill in 2006 to 3,180 Bluegill in 2000.  The 2013 assessment netted 1,783 Bluegill.  Few Bluegill caught in any ice-out have exceeded eight inches in length.  Three spring assessments caught a single fish that measured from 8.3 to 8.7 inches in length while the 1995 spring assessment was the only one to catch a nine-inch Bluegill. <br> \n     Largemouth Bass catches have varied in the spring assessments.  The lowest bass catch was fifteen fish in 1995 and the highest catch, 111 bass in 2013.  Shamineau Lake has been shown to produce some trophy size fish as four of the seven spring assessments netted Largemouth Bass which exceeded twenty inches in length.  The longest bass caught was 21.1 inches in 1995.  While the longest average size was 16.1 inches in 1995, in the majority of the assessments, the average length has been closer to 13.5 inches. <br> \n     Four White Sucker were measured from a sample of 123 fish to obtain a length range of what could be available to the larger predator fish.  White Sucker is likely an important prey species of both the Muskellunge and Northern Pike.  Most of the sucker caught in the 2013 Muskellunge assessment were between 15.8 and 21.3 inches in length.  Spring White Sucker catches have been steadily increasing since the record low catch of fifteen in 2003, however, the catches are still far below the 566 and 786 fish catches of the 1995 and 1997 assessments, respectively.  Higher numbers of White Sucker could help promote better growth rates in the larger esocids.   <br> \n     Yellow Perch numbers have also varied greatly in the spring Muskellunge assessments, but catch rates could be influenced more by timing of net removal than actual perch abundance.  The 2013 spring assessment produced the lowest perch catch (n=210) while the highest was 2,972 perch in 2009.  The other spring catch rates have ranged from 276 (1995) to 801 fish in 2006. <br> \n     Other fish species caught in the 2013 spring Muskellunge assessment included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Creek Chub, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Bullhead.  </p>",

The current stocking plan calls for annual Walleye fry stocking.  Due to state shutdown of Walleye egg taking operations in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, no stocking of Walleye fry or fingerlings occurred in 2020.  Shamineau Lake is being used as a control lake in a research project aimed at determining zebra mussel impacts on Walleye recruitment, so electrofishing effort was doubled to two hours of sampling on-time in 2020.  Fourteen Walleye were captured in six 20 minute sampling stations.  Four of the fish sampled were determined to be YOY for a total catch rate of 2.0/hour.  YOY Walleye ranged from 6.42 to 7.01 inches and averaged 6.64 inches in total length.  YOY Walleye captured were evidence that some natural reproduction occurs on the lake.  Further examination of the extent of natural reproduction is warranted in non-stocked or fingerling stocked years in the future.  Natural reproduction observed in this assessment raises questions regarding the origin of YWAE captured in other recent assessments.  Other Walleye captured in this survey ranged from 11.14 to 25.55 inches and averaged 14.45 inches in total length. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass have been sampled in increased frequency in recent assessments.  Only one Smallmouth was captured during the 2020 survey measuring 13.9 inches.  No juvenile Smallmouth Bass were noted.  Low numbers of adult Yellow Perch and White Sucker were observed.  Small Northern Pike were commonly observed during sampling.  Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Rock Bass were the most abundant species seen.  Very few shiners or minnows were sampled and a small Muskellunge, approximately 20\" may have been seen. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>        A special assessment was conducted at ice-out on Shamineau Lake to evaluate the muskellunge population and estimate the number of adults exceeding 30 inches.  Ice was late in leaving the lake and the water slow to warm up.  Water temperature in the west bay remained around 49 - 50 degrees during most of the 13 day netting period while the lake water temperature stayed around 45 degrees.   Ten large-frame trapnets were set and lifted for a total of 114 set-days.  Other gamefish and a subsample of black crappie and bluegill were also measured.  All other fish species were identified and counted.  The lengths from the recaptured muskies (n=24) in the trapnets were not included in the length frequency distribution.  Night electrofishing conducted six days after the trapnet assessment ended was used as the recapture method to obtain a population estimate.  Two electrofishing boats with two netters in each sampled much of the shoreline. <br> \n        Fin rays and scales were collected on only the smaller muskellunge due to the difficulty in aging older fish.  Fish believed to be aged accurately were given \"official ages\" in the lake survey module while the more difficult to age fish found to be 10 years or older were not given \"official ages\".  The older fish appeared to be from 10 to 15+ years of age.  Twenty-five males between 36.2 and 40.3 inches were given ages along with one 41.5-inch female.  There was little evidence of natural reproduction as there were no fish in the 4 -6 year old gap.  There may have been some muskellunge in the 9 to 10 year old gap but difficulties in obtaining completely accurate ages precluded assigning official ages of 9 or 10.  Some older fish also did not have an obvious stocking clip.  The fish that were aged appeared to be from the 2001 and 2002 year classes.  <br> \n        The nets caught 138 muskellunge ( 1.2/trapnet), ranging from 12 to 52 inches in length with a mean length of 40.7 inches.  Modal length was 40 - 41 inches.  Sixty-two percent (n=85) of the muskies exceeded 40 inches with 16% (n=22) more than 45 inches in length.  Sex ratio for the muskies in the trapnets was 4.1 males to 1 female.  Seventy-seven percent (n=20) of the 26 females in the sample exceeded 45 inches in length which surpassed the lake management goal of at least 30% of the spring catch of females exceeding 45 inches in length.  The night electrofishing effort captured 22 muskellunge between 33 and 50 inches with a mean length of 40.8 inches.  Six of the muskellunge caught were marked from the trapnetting effort.  A population estimate of 447 adult muskellunge was produced using the Adjusted Peterson Single Census Population Estimate.  The estimate was within the management goal of 400 to 500 adult fish over 30 inches in length.   The population estimate from the 2003 muskellunge assessment was 403 adult muskellunge.  <br> \n        The muskellunge assessment in 2006 also targeted northern pike and walleye so standard lake survey trapnets were used along with the large-frame trapnets.  There were 72 sets with the smaller nets and 68 set days with the larger nets.    Muskie catch rates were 0.6/trapnet and 2.2/large-frame trapnet, (catch rates do not include recaptures, 6 in the small nets and 26 in the larger nets) .  A total of 190 different muskies were netted in the two gear types ranging from 21.8 to 51.2 inches in length.  Mean length for the total sample was 41.6 inches with a modal length of 40 - 41 inches.  Muskellunge exceeding 40 inches in length accounted for 68% (n=128) of the catch with 19% (n=37) of the fish more than 45 inches in length.  Sixty-six percent of the females in the assessment were more than 45 inches in length which also surpassed the lake management goal.  A muskellunge population estimate was not one of the goals of the assessment.   A muskellunge assessment in 2003 had 62 set days with the large-frame trapnets and a catch rate of 2.4/set.  A total of 150 muskellunge were captured which measured from 10.8 to 49.6 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 40.9 inches with a modal length of 39 - 40 inches.  The proportion of fish exceeding 40 inches was slightly lower at 60% (n=90), however, 17% (n=25) of the fish were over 45 inches which was comparable to the other two assessments.  Additional muskellunge assessments were conducted in 2000, 1997, and 1995. The sex ratio of males to females in the 2006 assessment was 2.5:1 with 2:1 in 2003, 2.2:1 in 2000, and 12:1 in 1997.  The muskellunge population in Shamineau Lake has matured and mean size, modal length, percent over 40 inches and  the total population seem to have leveled off since 2003.  Only the maximum size appears to be increasing. <br> \n        The 2009 muskellunge assessment sampled 274 walleye (2.4/set) between 12 and 29.1 inches in length.  Mean length was 21.2 inches with two modal lengths, 16 - 17 inches and 25 - 26 inches.  Walleye exceeding 20 inches in length accounted for 57% (n=155) of the sample.  A total of 212 walleye were netted in the 2006 assessment, 1.2/trapnet and 1.8/large-frame trapnet.  Fish measured from 9 to 30 inches in length with a mean length of about 21.9 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 17 - 18 inches with 60% (n=127) of the walleye exceeding 20 inches in length.  The 2003 assessment only captured 27 walleye which ranged from 14 to 29.4 inches in length.  Larger walleye dominated the sample as the mean length was 24.2 inches with a modal length of 24 - 25 inches and 89% (n=24) of the fish more than 20 inches in length.  The assessments in 2000 and 1997 had good catches of walleye, 282 and 198 fish, respectively.   The spring muskellunge assessments seem to be an effective method of sampling spawning age walleye. <br> \n       The large-frame trapnets in 2009 netted 112 northern pike (1/set) that measured from 12 to 35 inches in length.  Mean length was 22.7 inches with a modal length of 28 - 29 inches.  Pike exceeding 24 inches accounted for 41% (n=46) of the catch with 8% (n=9) more than 30 inches in length.  The 2006 assessment netted 152 northern pike in the two gear types and showed some desirable population size structure characteristics.  The catch rate for the smaller nets was 0.8/set with a 1.4/set catch rate in the larger nets.  Pike ranged from 9 to 32.7 inches in length with a modal length of 22 - 23 inches.  Although the modal length was shorter compared to 2009, larger fish made up a greater portion of the catch with 46% (n=71) of the fish exceeding 24 inches in length and 10% (n=16) of the pike exceeding 30 inches.  In 2003, only 60 northern pike were captured.  The lengths ranged from 12 to 33.9 inches with a mean length of 22.2 inches and modal length of 20 - 21 inches.  Smaller fish dominated the sample as only 32% (n=29) of the pike were more than 24 inches in length and 12% (n=7) exceeding 30 inches. <br> \n       The 2009 muskellunge assessments produced one of the higher largemouth bass catches (n=87) for Shamineau Lake after the 90 bass caught in 2000.  The bass in the 2009 catch measured from 10 to 17.9 inches in length with a mean length of 13.5 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 13 - 14 inches with 55% (n=48) exceeding 12 inches in length and 18% (n=16) more than 15 inches.  In 2006, the 46 largemouth bass caught were between 9 and 17 inches in length with a modal length of 13 - 14 inches.   Fish over 12 inches in length accounted for 83% (n=38) of the sample with 15% (n=15) more than 15 inches.  Forty-six bass were also caught in the 2003 muskellunge assessment.  The fish ranged from 5.8 - 20 inches in length with a mean length of 13.2 inches and modal length of 13 - 14 inches.  Larger fish also accounted for a majority of the sample with 68% (n=31) of the bass more than 12 inches and 26% (n=12) exceeding 15 inches in length. <br> \n       The black crappie catch in 2009 (n=130) was more than the 92 caught in 2006, but much less than the 2003 sample of 359 fish.  Crappie in 2009 ranged from 4 to 13.3 inches in length with a mean length of 9.6 inches.  Modal length was 10.5 - 11 inches with 73% (n=95) exceeding 9 inches, 32% (n=41) more than 11 inches, and 8% (n=10) over 12 inches.  The size structures of the previous two black crappie catches were even more desirable.  In 2006 the crappie measured from 7 to 13.5 inches with a mean length of 10.4 inches and modal length of 10.5 - 11 inches.  Fish over 9 inches accounted for 84% (n=76) of the sample with 34% (n=31) exceeding 11 inches and 16% (n=15) more than 12 inches.   Larger crappie were also common in the 2003 muskellunge assessment (n=359).  Although the length distribution (5 to 13.7 inches) was comparable to that observed in both the 2006 and 2009 assessments, larger crappie accounted for a greater proportion of the catch in 2003.  Crappie exceeding 9 inches accounted for 94% (n=324) of the catch with 61% (n=211) more than 11 inches and 16% (n=57) over 12 inches in length.  The mean length for the sample was 11 inches with a modal length of 11 - 11.5 inches.  <br> \n       Bluegill catches have been high in the last three muskellunge assessments but the sample size structures have been somewhat poor.   The 2009 bluegill catch was 2,772 fish, while 1,707 were caught in 2006, and 2,346 in 2003.  All assessments had a comparable length distribution of about 3.3 to 7.7 inches.  The mean length for all assessments was near 6.1 inches and modal length was the same in all three ( 6.5 - 7 inches).  When comparing the portion of bluegill that exceeded  7 inches in length, the size of the subsample must also be considered.  In 2009, it appeared that about 12% of the bluegill catch was more than 7 inches, with 18% of the total catch being measured.  In 2006, 32% of the catch was measured, and 6% of the catch appeared to exceed 7 inches in length.  In 2003, 8% of the catch was measured and 13% of the fish appeared to exceed 7 inches in length. <br> \n       Yellow perch was the most abundant fish species (n=2,972) caught in the 2009 muskellunge assessment.  The 2009 perch catch was the highest spring catch for the lake and more than three times the previous high (801) caught in 2006.  Other abundant species in 2009 were pumpkinseed sunfish (n=852) and rock bass (n=362).  These two species were also abundant in the 2006 assessment, n=448 and n=508, respectively.   Additional fish species captured included bowfin, brown bullhead, common shiner, hybrid sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  The white sucker catch of 98 fish was more than twice the 2006 catch of 45 fish but still well below the record catches of 786 in 1997 and 566 in 1995. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Shamineau Lake is located in northwest Morrison County and supports a diverse fish community that attracts anglers to the lake.  The lake has good water clarity with a secchi disk reading of 12 feet at the end of July.  Two public accesses as well as several resorts are located on the lake.  An island, steep drop-offs, sand flats, and vegetation beds all provide ample fishing structures.  The lake has a regulation requiring the immediate release of Northern Pike between 24 and 36 inches with one over 36 inches allowed in possession.   The objective of the regulation is to improve the Northern Pike population size structure.  The primary fishery management focus is Walleye and Northern Pike with secondary management on Muskellunge, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill. <br> \n      With the water clarity, Walleye anglers are more likely to have better luck at night or on overcast days.  A wide range of sizes are available to fishermen with fish between nine and 27 inches observed in the survey.  Regular stocking of Walleye fry supplements a low level of natural reproduction and maintains the population while meeting fishing pressure demands.   Northern Pike numbers showed a significant increase in abundance since the last survey.   Average size of the pike in the summer survey was 18 inches or 1.5 pounds.  A spring assessment in 2013 documented pike up to 38 inches in length indicating that the lake has the potential to produce trophy size Northern Pike.   Muskellunge fishing has become popular on Shamineau Lake with fish over 45 inches common and 50 plus inch fish are regularly reported by anglers.  The statewide minimum length was raised to 54 inches beginning in 2015.  <br> \n       Shamineau Lake has a healthy population of Largemouth Bass.  The spring electrofishing effort in June produced one of the highest bass catch rates for the Little Falls Area.  Most of the bass measured in the survey were less than 12 inches; however, fish up to 18 inches were documented.  Black Crappie fishing success seems to vary from year to year.   Although many of the crappie caught in the summer survey were less than nine inches in length, anglers reported catching larger fish up to 14 inches, and spring assessments have also documented the larger crappie.  While most of the Bluegill caught in the summer survey were less than seven inches in length, there were fish up to eight inches observed.   There are also Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Rock Bass in the lake which can provide additional panfish angling.  Some eight-inch Pumpkinseed and 11-inch Rock Bass were measured in the survey. <br> \n       While most the Yellow Perch were too small to be of interest to anglers, they were a good prey size for gamefish such as Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge.   A more abundant perch population would be desirable as they help maintain good growth rates in gamefish populations and they have also been found to help maintain a well-balanced Bluegill population with fast growing, quality sized  individuals.  Tullibee or Cisco were stocked in 2002 and 2003 in an attempt to establish a population that could provide an additional food source for the larger gamefish.  So far no Tullibee have sampled in any assessments, indicating questionable survival. <br> \n       The roughfish community in Shamineau Lake consists of Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, and White Sucker.  The Yellow Bullhead was the more abundant of the two bullhead species.  Although the average size for the Yellow Bullhead was nine inches, there were some fish up to 11 inches measured.  <br> \n       Protecting the water quality in Shamineau Lake has been and should be a high priority of the lake association and landowners around the lake.  Preservation of the emergent vegetation beds can improve water quality, reduce shoreline erosion, and provide valuable fish habitat.  Fishermen and recreational boaters are reminded that they need to be diligent about cleaning both their boats and trailers when going between lakes to prevent the spread of exotic species as Eurasian Water Milfoil has been documented in the lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted on Shamineau Lake in September of 2019 which consisted of two sampling efforts:  1) night electrofishing for juvenile Walleye,  2) gill netting to provide an index of Walleye abundance.   Night electrofishing is performed annually to assess Walleye fry stocking success as the lake is stocked each year with fry.  The fall gill net survey was the initial effort of this type.  Eight gill net stations were selected based on past performance during standard summer surveys with the nets having the highest historical catches of Walleye utilized.  The purposes of this fall gill net sampling were to determine if an adequate index of Walleye could be attained using a smaller number of selected sets and to assess whether fall sampling resulted in higher catch rates and sample sizes for the effort expended.   <br> \n <br> \nOnly three young-of-year Walleye were captured during night electrofishing suggesting a relatively weak year class was generated in 2019.  Low catches of young-of-year Walleye were typical on the lake up until 2017 when 18/hour were sampled and 2018 when 61/hour were observed.  The strength of the 2018 year class was apparent in the 2019 electrofishing effort as 27 yearling Walleye were caught.   Smallmouth Bass have just recently appeared in Shamineau Lake being initially observed in 2017.  Five Smallmouth Bass were captured during the 2019 electrofishing sampling including one young-of-year.  The Smallmouth Bass population is likely in the process of expansion.  Two Muskellunge were also caught with the larger fish measuring 34.5 inches.  The smaller fish (16.3 inches) appeared to be naturally reproduced. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets were set on September 23 and 24 with surface water temperatures in the upper 60sF.  The Walleye catch rate was 7.5/lift compared to 4.4/lift from the same nets in the summer of 2017.  The average catch of the eight selected nets from the past four surveys dating back to 2006 was 6/lift.  The fall gill nets appeared to be successful in capturing good numbers of Walleye although the catch rate of 7.5/lift was within the range of values from previous summer efforts.  Walleyes measured in 2019 ranged from 8.3 to 26.3 inches with a mean length of 16.3 inches.  A fairly uniform distribution of fish from 11.5 to 22.9 inches was characteristic of the length frequency data.  Nine yearling Walleye in the 8-10 inch range were observed corroborating the presence of this stronger year class in the night electrofishing.  The most strongly represented year classes were produced during fry stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nTwo Muskellunge were caught in 2019 fall gill nets measuring 32.3 inches and 33.7 inches.  The Northern Pike catch rate of 2.25/lift was somewhat lower than typical summer catches.  Pike ranged in length from 15.7 to 29.7 inches with a mean length of 22.1 inches.  The Yellow Perch catch rate of 15/lift was similar to recent summer surveys (18.7/ lift in 2017 and 13.3/lift in 2014).  Catch rates of other species including Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, White sucker, and Yellow Bullhead were low when compared to summer catches. <br> \n <br> \nFall index gill netting proved successful in sampling Walleye but did not show a substantially increased rate of capture compared to summer efforts.  Catch rates of Yellow perch were also acceptable but catches of many species including Northern Pike appeared to be reduced compared to summer sampling.  The application of targeted fall gill netting seems most appropriate if additional information is desired regarding the Walleye population and/or questions arise from the results of standard surveys. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Shamineau Lake was conducted on July 8, 9 and 12, 2021 by Little Falls Area Fisheries Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing and seining was completed at all 18 sampling stations.  A 15-foot seine was used at all sites and lengthened or double hauls were incorporated when possible to increase the area sampled.  Nearshore sampling captured 21 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Rock Bass) and no fish species tolerant of disturbance.  Two additional intolerant species that are known to be present in the lake are Smallmouth Bass and Muskellunge. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from the July 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Shamineau Lake is healthy as indicated by a high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community during the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

THE GILLNET CATCHES DURING THIS SURVEY WERE 66% HIGHER THAN IN 1985.  THIS REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NOP NUMBERS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.  GROWTH OF THE PIKE IS NORMAL AT ALL SIZES.  THE SMALL AVERAGE SIZE OF PIKE IS DUE TO THE LOW NUMBERS OF PIKE OLDER THAN FOUR YEARS IN OUR SAMPLES.  THIS SURVEY, AS WELL AS PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS.  INDICATES GOOD REPRO- DUCTION AND RECRUITMENT TO THE 20 INCH SIZE BUT FEW NUMBERS OF POPULATIO IS AVERAGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS BY ALL INDICATIONS:  CATCH, SIZE AND GROWTH.  THROUGH WAE NUMBERS ARE AVERAGE THEY ARE DOWN BY 40% OF THE 1985 CATCH AND 55% FROM 1980.  THIS INDICATES SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN NUMBERS OF WAE.  WAE STOCKED DURING EACH OF THE PREVIOUS 5 YEARS WERE REPRESENTED IN GILLNET CATCHES WITH NO EXTREMELY STRONG OR WEAK YEAR CLASSES OBSERVED.  THERE WAS ALSO A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE SIZE FROM 2.33 LBS. TO 1.77 LBS.  (24%) BETWEEN 1980 AND 1990.  LMB CATCHES IN TRAPS WERE HIGH FOR THIS LAKE CLASS. THE AVERAGE SIZE OF THE BASS CAPTURED WAS SMALL BUT WITH NORMAL GROWTH.  LMB YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR WERE WELL REPRESENTED DURING SHORELINE SEINING. FALL ELECTROFISHING SHOULD BE CONDUCTED, HOWEVER, BEFORE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS CONCERNING THE LMB POPULATION IN SHAMINEAU LAKE ARE MADE.  BLC CONTINUE TO BE POORLY REPRESENTED IN TRAPS AND GILLNETS.  ONLY 3 CRAPPIE WERE CAUGHT IN TRAPS DURING SUMMER NETTING AND 1 DURING THE SHORELINE SEINING.  ANGLERS, HOWEVER, REPORT FAIR CATCHES OF LARGE CRAPPIE DURING THE WINTER.  THE BLG POPULATION CONTINUES TO BE HIGH FOR THIS LAKE CLASS AND DOMINATED BY SMALL SLOW GROWING FISH. MUSKIES HAVE NOT BEEN CAPTURED DURING NETTING OPERATIONS SINCE 1971.  ONE MUSKIE WAS SIGHTED DURING FALL SHORELINE SEINING.  THE SIZE OF THIS MUSKIE SUGGESTS THAT IT WAS FROM THE 1988 STOCKING.  OCCASIONAL SIGHTINGS HAVE ALSO BEEN REPORTED BY ANGLERS.  YEP GILLNET CATCHES ARE LOW FOR THIS LAKE CLASS AND HAVE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (DOWN 41%) FROM THE 1985 ASSESSMENT. THE SIZE OF THE PERCH WAS AVERAGE BUT THE CATCH WAS COMPOSED OF ONLY THREE YEAR CLASSES:  AGE 3-5. LARGE NUMBERS OF YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR AND YEARLING PERCH, HOWEVER, WERE CAPTURED DURING THE SHORELINE SEINING.  YEP WAS THE MOST FREQUENT CONTENT OF NOP STOMACHS.  THE CATCH OF BULLHEADS WAS DOMINATED BY YEBS, BUT BLB AND BRBS WERE ALSO PRESENT.  THE CATCH RATE WAS TWENTY TIMES THE MEDIAN FOR THIS LAKE CLASS.  THREE TIMES AS MANY YEBS WERE CAPTURED IN TRAPS THIS SURVEY THAN IN 1985.  FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED (5,100) POUNDS OF BULLHEADS WERE REMOVED BY B PERMIT DURING SEPTEMBER OF 1990. WTS CONTINUE TO BE REPRESENTED BY LARGE INDIVIDUALS.  NO SUCKERS LESS THAN 12 INCHES WERE CAPTURED DURING THIS SURVEY.  NO WTS WERE COLLECTED WITH 50 OR 400 FT.  N.R.C. SEINES THIS YEAR OR IN 1987.  TWO THOUSAND (2,000) POUNDS IN 1985 AND FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED (4,100) POUNDS IN 1987 WERE REMOVED IN AN ATTEMPT TO ENCOURAGE A SPAWNING RESPONSE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shamineau Lake is one the three major recreational/fishing lakes in northwest Morrison County.  The lake has good water clarity with a secchi disk reading of 14.5 feet at the end of July and fish attracters such as weed beds, sunken islands, and sand bars.  Sand was the most common shallow water substrate found around the lake.  Two resorts are located on the lake along with heavy development along the west, south, and east shores.   The lake has high recreational use during the summer especially on weekends.  Having no inlets or outlets, the lake has seen some extreme water flucuations over the years.  Currently water levels are high from an unusually wet summer which has lead to soggy conditions for some homeowners.     The lake supports a diverse fish community and offers many angling opportunities.  Fishermen regularly seek walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappies, and bluegills with an increasing interest in muskellunge now that some of the fish are reaching trophy size.  Walleye numbers were normal when compared to similar type lakes and available in a wide range of sizes from 9 to 29 inches.  Two size groups, 12 - 14 inches and 21 - 24 inches, were the most common in the survey.  Regular stocking of walleye fingerlings, or more recently fry, supplements any natural reproduction and maintains the fishery at the desired level.      Small northern pike continue to dominate the population as the majority of the fish seen in the survey were less than 24 inches in length.  A northern pike special regulation protecting fish between 24 and 36 inches will be implemented opening day of fishing season in May, 2003.  The intent of the regulation is to produce more pike in the population over 24 inches as well as some trophy size fish over 36 inches.  Muskellunge were introduced into Shamineau in 1988.  The fish have found their niche in the lake and are thriving.  Muskies over 46 inches have been documented in surveys and anglers have reported catching fish over 47 inches.      Largemouth bass are present in good numbers in Shamineau.  Most of the bass sampled in 2002 were less than 12 inches in length, however, fish up to 17 inches were measured.  Anglers reported that black crappies were hard to find in the summer.  Average size of the crappies seen in the survey was 11 inches, which was much bigger than those typically caught by anglers.  Summer surveys usually are poor indicators of crappie populations as the fish typically suspend in deeper water than the nets are set.   Bluegills are plentiful but mostly small, however, a fair number of fish over 6 inches were caught in the survey with some over 7 inches seen.      Yellow perch abundance has increased and was at the highest level its been for awhile.  Most of the perch were at a length too small for fisherman but good prey size for gamefish such as walleye, northern pike, and muskie.  An abundant perch population is desirable to maintain good growth in the gamefish populations and they have been found to be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.      Other species sampled during the survey included hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullheads.  The sucker catch was the lowest its ever been while the bullhead catch was the lowest since 1957.  Suckers can be an additional food species for the northern pike and muskies, especially if perch numbers are low.  A fair number of the yellow bullheads were over 10 inches in length for those who like to fish the species with some measuring over 12 inches.  The pumpkinseeds and rock bass were mostly small.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Shamineau Lake is a clear water lake in northwest Morrison County which supports a diverse fish community and offers many angling opportunites.  The lake has excellent water clarity with a secchi disk reading of 21 feet at the end of July.  The lake has two public accesses and also supports two resorts. The lake has heavy residential development along the west, south, and east shores with more development occuring recently in the bluffs along the north shore.   Camp Shamineau owns about one mile of shoreline on the north shore which is mostly undeveloped.  Dense vegetation beds, of which canada waterweed, northern milfoil, and water (wild) celery are the most common species, grow out to a depth of 17 feet.  Sand is the most common shallow water substrtate.  The lake does have a regulation which requires the release of northern pike between 24 and 36 inches in length with one over 36 inches allowed in possesion.  The fishery management focus is on walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, muskellunge, black crappie, and bluegill. <br> \n     With the clear water in the lake, walleye fishermen are more likely to have better luck at night or on overcast days.  A wide variety of sizes are available to anglers with fish between 9 and 29 inches being seen in the survey.  Regular stocking of walleye fry and fingerlings supplements any natural reproduction and maintains the fishery at the desired level.  Northern pike numbers showed a significant drop in abundance since the last survey as well as an improvement in size.  The average size caught in the survey was 20 inches or about 2 pounds compared to 18.5 inches or 1.5 pounds in 2002.  While northern pike over 36 inches continue to be scarce, several of the pike were over 30 inches in length.  Muskie fishing has become more popular on Shamineau Lake with fish over 45 inches being common and some having reached the 50 inch plus mark.  Muskies were introduced into the lake in 1988 and have thrived. <br> \n      Shamineau Lake has a healthy population of largemouth bass.  Most of the bass measured in the survey were under 13 inches, however, fish up to 17 inches have been documented.  Anglers seem to have good black crappie fishing one year and can't find them the next.  Crappie abundance does seem to be down but some nice size fish up to 13 inches were measured.  Bluegill abundance, however, is high and the population dominated by small fish.  Average size seen in the survey was just over 5 inches, but there are bluegills up to 8 inches in the lake.  There are also pumpkinseeds and rock bass in the lake which can provide additional panfish angling.  The pumpkinseeds also averaged just over 5 inches and the rock bass averaged about 8 inches. <br> \n     Yellow perch showed a significant drop in numbers from the last survery after being at their highest level seen in quite awhile.  Most of the perch were at a length too small for most anglers but a good prey size for gamefish such as walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge.  An abundant perch population is desirable as they help maintain good growth rates in the gamefish populations and they have also been found to help maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  Tullibee or ciscos were stocked in 2002 and 2003 to hopefully establish a population that could provide an additional prey species for the larger gamefish.  So far no tullibee have been seen indicating questionable survival. <br> \n     The white sucker population continues to be low while yellow bullhead numbers were within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes. <br> \nThe bullheads averaged about 9 inches in length but some fish up to 11 inches were measured.   <br> \n     Protecting the water quality in Shamineau Lake has been and should be a high priority of the lake association and landowners around the lake.  Preservation of the emergent vegetation beds can improve water quality, reduce shoreline erosion, and protect valuable fish habitat.  Maintaining adequate septics, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and the common sense use of lawn fertilizers will also help reduce nutrient loading, thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.

                "narrative": "<p>     A special assessment was conducted at ice-out to evaluate the northern pike, walleye, and muskellunge populations in Shamineau Lake.  Standard lake survey trapnets (72 lifts) and the large frame 5'x6' trapnets (68 set days) were used to catch the different species.  Although the small nets were set to target northern pike and walleye, the nets also caught some muskies.  The nets were set immediately after ice-out, though some of the northern pike had nearly completed spawning.  All gamefish were measured and scales taken from the muskie and spines were also collected from the walleye.  Since a lake survey was being done later in the summer, no northern pike scales were taken in the ice-out assessment.  Lengths were also taken for most of the black crappies and a subsample of bluegills.  All other species were identified and counted.  Although scales were taken from the muskies, it was sometimes difficult to discern if fish were recaptured during the assessment so a better marking method may be desired in future assessments.  Recaptured muskies and walleye are not included in the length frequency distributions.  A muskie population estimate was not one of the objectives of this assessment so night electrofishing was not conducted as a recapture method.   <br> \n     The small nets captured 41 muskellunge with 6 recaptures (0.6/set) while the large nets sampled 149 muskellunge with 26 recaptures (2.2/set) (catch rates do not count recaptures).  Fish in the small nets measured from 22.2 to 49.3 inches in length with a modal length of 42 - 43 inches and mean length of 41.5 inches.  Muskies exceeding 40 inches in length accounted for 68% (n=28) of the catch while 17% (n=7) of the fish exceeded 45 inches.  The muskies in the large nets ranged from 21.8 to 51.2 inches in length with a modal length of 40 - 41 inches and mean length of 41.7 inches.  The fish more than 40 inches in length comprised 67% (n=100) of the catch and 20% (n=30) were more than 45 inches in length.  Sixty-six percent (66%) of the fish in the total female sample exceeded 45 inches in length which surpassed the lake management goal of having at least 30% of the females in spring assessments exceed 45 inches.  A muskellunge assessment was conducted in 2003 which had 62 large trapnet set days and sampled 150 muskies (2.4/set), of which 11 were recaptures.  Fish in that sample measured from 10.8 to 49.6 inches in length with a modal length of 39 - 40 inches and mean length of 40.9 inches.  Muskies exceeding 40 inches accounted for 60% (n=90) of the sample while 17% (n=25) of the fish were over 45 inches in length.  A population estimate of 403 adult muskies was produced in the 2003 assessment using the Adjusted Peterson Single Census Population Estimate.   Other muskie assessments on Shamineau Lake produced catch rates of 0.8/set in 2000, 0.7/set in 1997, and 0.3/set in 1995.  Mean lengths have gradually improved in each of the earlier assessments as the fish got older.  A mean length of 37 inches was displayed in the 2000 assessment, 33 inches in the 1997 assessment, while it was 31 inches in the 1995 assessment.  The sex ratio of males to females in the 2006 assessment was 2.5:1 while it was 2:1 in 2003, 2.2:1 in 2000, and 12:1 in 1997.  Ages 8-11, 13, and 14 were represented in the female sample with two age classes, 11 and 14, accounting for 46% and 32% of the sample, respectively.  Ages 6, 8, 9, and 11 - 14 were represented in the male sample. The same two strong year classes in the female sample dominated this sample with Age 11 comprising 28% of the sample while Age 14 accounted for 38%.  There was also a strong showing from the 1997 year class which accounted for 20% of the male sample.  The female muskies grew from 2.8 to 7 inches faster than the males of the same age. <br> \n     Eighty-seven walleye plus 9 recaptures were sampled in the small nets while the large nets caught 125 walleye plus 23 recaptures.  A similar length frequency range (9 to 30 inches) was observed in both gear types while the modal length of 18 - 19 inches in the small nets was slightly better than the 17 - 18 inch modal length seen in the large nets.  Mean length and percent of fish exceeding 20 inches was very similar in the small nets over the large nets.  Mean length was 22.1 inches with 61% (n=53) over 20 inches in the small nets compared to a mean length of 21.6 inches and 59% (n=74) exceeding 20 inches in the large nets.  The 2003 muskie assessment, which was not targetting walleye, only captured 27 walleye which ranged from 14 - 29.4 inches in length with a modal length of 24 - 25 inches, mean length of 24.2 inches, and 89% (n=24) exceeding 20 inches.  Walleye catches of 282 and 198 were recorded in the 2000 and 1997 muskie assessments, respectivley, when the nets went in early after ice-out.  Ages 4 - 15+ were represented in the 2006 spring assessment with the 2000 year class acccounting for 38% of the combined male and female walleye catch.  Fish over 10 years of age accounted for 44% of the female catch while they comprised only 11% of the male sample. <br> \n      The small nets in the 2006 ice-out assessment caught 56 northern pike while the large nets caught 96 pike.  Overall the large nets caught more of the larger northern pike.  The pike length frequency range was 9.3 - 32.7 inches in the small nets and 13 - 32.2 inches in the large nets.  While the modal length of the pike sample was larger in the small nets, 23 - 24 inches compared to 22 - 23 inches in the large net sample, mean length was smaller, 22.6 inches compared to 24.2 inches.  Up to 52% (n=50) of the pike in the large nets were over 24 inches with 14% (n=13) exceeding 30 inches while in the small nets 38% (n=21) of the pike were more than 24 inches in length with only 5% (n=3) exceeding 30 inches.  Smaller northern pike were more common in the 2003 muskie assessment as only 32% (n=19) of the 60 pike were more than 24 inches and 12% (n=7) exceeded 30 inches in length.  The fish in the 2003 catch ranged from 12 - 33.9 inches in length with a modal length of 20 - 21 inches and mean length of 22.2 inches. The management goal for Shamineau Lake is to have a spring pike catch where at least 35% of the fish exceeds 24 inches in length with 2% exceeding 36 inches.  The first goal was met but the second goal may take longer as fish need to mature.  It may be too early for big fish to show up.  In the three earlier spring assessments three fish from 35.5 to 36.1 inches were captured.  When looking at the 2006 summer gillnet catch, it did appear that pike abundance declined significantly from 2002 and there was an improvement in the population size structure.  The 2006 gillnet catch of 3.1/set remained within the normal range for lake class 27 but was a significant decrease from the 2002 catch of 6.6/gillnet (interquartile range = 2.8 - 9).  The 2006 catch rate was also the lowest recorded since the 1.4/gillnet catch in the 1957 survey.  A similar length frequency range  was displayed in both the 2006 and 2002 surveys, 10 - 33 inches.  The modal length, 18 - 19 inches, in the 2006 survey was smaller than the 2002 modal length of 21 - 22 inches, however, the mean length was greater in 2006, 20.4 inches, compared to 18.5 inches in 2002.  Another indicator of an improved size structure was the number of fish exceeding 24 and 30 inches in length in the two surveys.  In the 2006 survey pike exceeding 24 inches accounted for 30% of the catch while in 2002 it was only 5%.  Pike over 30 inches in length accounted for 4% of the sample in 2006 and only 1% in 2002.  <br> \n     Fewer black crappies were caught in the 2006 ice-out assessment than the 2002 assessment.  The 2006 small nets  sampled 31 crappies and the large nets 61 crappies compared to 359 crappies in the large nets in 2002.   All of the crappies were between 7 and 13.5 inches in 2006 which was similar to that seen in 2002.  While good size crappies were common in the 2006 assessment, it was the proportion of big crappies in the 2002 assessment that was impressive despite the large sample size.  About 84% (n=76) of the combined samples in 2006 exceeding 9 inches with 34% (n=31) exceeding 11 inches and 16% (n=15) exceeding 12 inches.  In 2002, 94% (n=324) of the crappies were over 9 inches in length, 61% (n=211) exceeding 11 inches, and 16% (n=57) exceeding 12 inches.  The 2000 muskie assessment also caught a large sample of crappies (n=865) but there were 206 set days.  Although the 2006 crappie gillnet catch, 1.1/set, was down from the 1.8/gillnet catch of 2002, the catches were comparable and both fell within the normal range for the lake class (interquartile range = 0.4 - 2.7).    <br> \n     The trapnets used in the 2006 ice-out assessment also collected a large number of bluegills with 334 being sampled in the small nets and 1398 in the large nets.  The large frame trapnets were more efficient at catching the larger size bluegills than the smaller trapnets.  Bluegills in the larger trapnets ranged from 3.6 - 7.7 inches in length with a modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches compared to 4 - 7.2 inches in the small nets with a modal length of 6 - 6.5 inches.  Mean length was similar, 6.2 inches in the large nets and 6.1 inches in the small nets.  Bluegills exceeding 7 inches comprised 6% (n=83) of the large net sample and 4% (n=13) of the small net catch.  An even larger bluegill  sample  (n=2346) was captured in the 2003 muskie assessment.  Those fish measured from 3.8 to 7.5 inches in length with a modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches and mean length of 6.0 inches.  Despite the large sample size, 13% (n=125) of the measured fish (n=952) were more than 7 inches in length.   <br> \n     A total of 10 largemouth bass were captured in the small nets while the large trapnets caught 36 bass in 2006.  There was a wider range of sizes seen with the larger catch in the large trapnets.  The bass measured from 9.2 - 17 inches compared to 11.8 - 15.4 inches in the small trapnets.  Mean length was slightly bigger in the large trapnets also, 13.7 inches compared to 13.2 inches in the small trapnet sample.  The large trapnets in 2003 caught a total of 46 bass that ranged from 5.8 to 20.1 inches in length with a mean length of 13.2 inches.   <br> \n      About twice as many pumpkinseeds (n=448) were caught in the 2006 ice-out assessment than in 2003 (n=242).  The rock bass catch also displayed a large increase (n=508) when compared to the 31 rock bass seen in the 2003 netting.  While the 2006 white sucker catch of 45 was better than the 15 noted in 2003, it was far below the record catches of 786 in 1997 and 566 in 1995.  The 2006 yellow perch catch of 801 was highest spring catch for the lake and a definite improvement over the 329 perch caught in 2003.  The 2006 lake survey gillnet catch of 9.7/set was a significant decrease from the 23.9/gillnet displayed in 2002 but remained within the normal range for the lake class (interquartile range = 7 - 46.3).  The record high gillnet catch was shown in 1971 (44.5/set) while the record low was 2.3/gillnet in 1990.  Other fish species observed in the 2006 ice-out assessment were bowfin (dogfish), hybrid sunfish, brown bullhead, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n     Small lake survey nets have been hard on large muskellunge and will likely not be used again.  There is probably some mortality of some large muskie and walleye due to crowding.</p>",

A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the west Shore. Also a township owned gravel boat ramp is located on the east shore. Shamineau Lake has 10.34 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 52 feet.  Shamineau Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are generally very large, deep, have very hard water, and are regular shaped. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016 a survey targeted at Largemouth Bass was completed. Largemouth Bass abundance was down compared to previous years, but still met management goals. Size structure of the population was good with fish up to 18.5 inches captured.  Anglers can expect to find good numbers and size structure. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Eurasian Milfoil and Curly Leaf Pondweed have been identified in Shamineau Lake. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shamineau Lake is a lake in northwest Morrison County which supports a diverse fish community and offers many angling opportunities.  The lake has excellent water clarity with a secchi disk reading of 18.5 feet at the end of July.  Two resorts can be found on the lake with heavy residential development along the west, south, and east shores.  Sand was the most abundant shallow water substrate found around the lake.  Dense vegetation beds, of which northern water milfoil was the most abundant species, were common extending from shore to depths of 18 feet.  Purple loosestrife has been present in Shamineau Lake for a period of time, mostly on the west end near the access.  Control efforts have shown limited success with the loosestrife.     Several fish populations have shown significant changes from the last survey in 1994 and present more angling opportunities.  Walleye, northern pike, and black crappie numbers went up while bluegill and yellow bullhead abundance went down.  Fishing in 1998 was reported as good for walleye, northern pike, bluegills, and black crappies.  The 1998 survey suggested good numbers of walleye over 15 inches are available to the angler, with trophy size fish over 10 pounds also present.  Walleye stocking does occur on an every other year schedule and evidence of natural reproduction has been found.      Along with the overall increase in northern pike numbers was the increase in small pike.  Average size in the summer survey was about 18 inches, however, fish up to 35 inches were measured.  Harvest of the smaller pike is encouraged to maintain a healthy pike population of fast growing individuals by reducing competition for food.  A lower pike population is desired to reduce predation of young walleye and muskellunge and encourage an increase in yellow perch.      Another esocid found in Shamineau Lake are muskellunge.  Net catches suggest normal abundance of muskellunge when compared to similar type lakes.  Muskies were first stocked in Shamineau in 1988.  The fish have since established themselves, with some nearing trophy size.      Largemouth bass are present in good numbers.  Most of the bass sampled in 1998 were less than 14 inches in length, however, larger bass to 18 inches were also seen.  Releasing the majority of the medium to large size bass should ensure quality angling in the future.      More yellow perch were caught in 1998 than 1994, but continue to be below the desired level.  Perch are a principal prey species for walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge.  High \tabundance is desirable to maintain good growth in the gamefish populations and provide an opportunity for quality gamefish to the anglers.  Perch have also been found to be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.      Bluegill abundance was normal for Shamineau when compared to similar type lakes.  Bluegills over six inches were common in the summer survey, however, most anglers would catch the more plentiful smaller fish.  Another sunfish species which was common in the lake are pumpkinseeds.  Six inch pumpkinseeds were also common, although the majority were smaller.  A creel conducted in the summer of 1998 showed the average size caught by anglers was about 5 inches for bluegills and 6 inches for pumpkinseeds.     Black crappies have shown a dramatic increase since the 1994 survey and were providing good fishing during the summer.  Crappies up to fourteen inches are present if they can be located.  The creel showed the average size of crappies caught by anglers was about 8 inches.      Roughfish species sampled during the survey included yellow, brown, and black bullheads, white suckers, and bowfin or dogfish.  Bullhead abundances have decreased and are at levels more desirable for the lake.  While some bullheads up to 13 inches were measured, the average size was 10 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shamineau Lake (DOW# 49-0127-00; Lake Class 27) is a 1434 acre lake located near Motley, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the west shore. Shamineau Lake has 10.34 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 52 feet. Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are generally very large, deep, have very hard water, and are regular shaped. <br> \n <br> \nShamineau Lake is one of the top multi-species lakes in the Little Falls Area. Traditionally Walleye have been the main draw for Shamineau. Walleye numbers were similar to past surveys with a wide range of sizes. Similarly Northern Pike numbers were similar to past surveys with fish up to 37 inches seen. The Muskellunge population is lower compared to the past 15 years, however large fish over 50 inches were still present in the population. Excellent panfish populations were observed in the 2017 survey with Bluegill up to 9 inches, Black Crappie, up to 13 inches, and Yellow Perch up to 10 inches. Largemouth Bass are plentiful in Shamineau, however most fish are small than the size most anglers prefer. Smallmouth Bass were sampled in Shamineau for the first time in 2017. Anglers should be on the lookout for Smallmouth in the future. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Fish harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS) can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed and Eurasian Milfoil have been identified in Shamineau Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Fall nighttime electrofishing was conducted in late September to assess survival of walleye fry originating from spring stocking and evaluate the walleye stocking strategy for Shamineau Lake.  Walleye fry have been stocked in odd-numbered year and fingerlings in even-numbered years since 2006.  Three electrofishing runs were conducted at various locations around the lake.  Sand substrate with limited vegetation appeared to produce the highest walleye catches.  Scales were collected from walleye under ten inches in length to verify year class and if the fish originated from fry or fingerling stocking.   <br> \n     A total of 30 walleye were netted in the electrofishing runs, two of which were young of year for a catch rate of 1.5/hour for the young of year.   The young of year catch rate was comparable to past electrofishing efforts (n=3) for juvenile walleye which have been between 0 and 3 per hour.  The majority of walleye in the 2011 fall electrofishing effort appeared to come from the 2009 year class (86%) which was a fry stocked year.  Three yearlings were also captured from the 2010 year class, a fingerling stocked year.  Past aging of gill net catches has shown that limited walleye natural reproduction also occurs. <br> \n     Although electrofishing has not proven to be an effective method for assessing young of year walleye, there was some encouraging catch of yearling and 2+ fish.  Most summer gill net catches and muskellunge assessments have provided a wide range of year classes.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shamineau Lake (DOW# 49-0127-00; Lake Class 27) is a 1,434 acre lake located near Motley, Minnesota.  A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the west shore and a township owned gravel boat ramp is located on the east shore.  Shamineau Lake has 10.34 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 52 feet.  The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Muskellunge, Black Crappie, and Bluegill.  The lake was initially surveyed in 1957 and 35 fish sampling surveys or investigations have occurred since then with the most recent prior sampling in 2021 (Standard Survey). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked in Shamineau Lake since at least 1947.  Fry, fingerlings, yearlings and adults have been stocked in the past based on availability.  The lake management plan called for fingerling stocking on an annual or biennial basis through 2016.  In addition, Walleye fry have been stocked in thirteen years since 2000 to evaluate whether Walleye population goals could be met utilizing fry as a cheaper alternative to fingerling stocking.  The current stocking plan calls for annual fry stocking with the potential for future fingerling stocking if fry stocking shows consistently poor results. Fry stocking is favored, as fingerlings have become increasingly difficult to raise due to lack of winterkill in Walleye production ponds. Some Walleye natural reproduction has been documented in non-stocked years but it has been assumed to be inadequate to maintain the population within management goals. Including 2022, eight Fall young of the year Walleye electrofishing assessments have been conducted in years when fry stocking has occurred. In addition, three fall young of the year Walleye electrofishing assessments were completed in 1996, 2011 and 2020 when no stocking occurred. No stocking occurred in 2020 due to the Covid 19 pandemic shutdown of fisheries Walleye egg take and hatchery operations. Typically, fall Walleye assessments utilized one hour of electrofishing on time effort to document juvenile Walleye abundance. In 2020, efforts were made to increase sampling time to two hours, as Shamineau Lake is included as a control lake in a research project aimed at determining Zebra Mussel impacts on Walleye recruitment. Currently, Zebra Mussels have not been detected in Shamineau Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThis 2022 fall electrofishing assessment was conducted on 19 September to evaluate young of the year Walleye abundance from spring fry stocking.  A total of 120 young of the year Walleye were sampled in 1:43:20 of on time during the 2022 survey for a catch rate of 69.7/hour. This was the highest catch rate observed in either stocked or non-stocked years on Shamineau Lake. Catch rates from previous fry stocking evaluations ranged from 2.0/hour (2004) to 61.0/hour (2018). Individuals captured in 2022 averaged 6.2 inches, which was equal to the mean from all previous assessments, and ranged from 5.5 to 6.9 inches in total length. Catch rates from non-stocked years have typically been low ranging from 0.0/hour (1996) to 2.0/hour (2020). Fall electrofishing catches have been an inconsistent predictor of year class strength in future gillnet surveys. Past catch rates of 18 or higher young of the year Walleye/hour have produced future gillnet catches near or above the third quartile (1.89/net). However, some cohorts with low fall Walleye catch rates have also been represented near the third quartile in future gillnet surveys. The catch in 2022 will likely result in a very good year class in the future, which should provide good Walleye fishing opportunities for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nFurther examination of the extent of natural reproduction is warranted in non-stocked or fingerling stocked years in the future.  Natural reproduction observed in some assessments raises questions regarding the origin of juvenile Walleye captured in other recent assessments including fry stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass have been sampled in increasing frequency in recent assessments.  Yellow Perch and White Sucker were common at most stations.  A few young of the year Northern Pike were encountered during sampling.  Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Rock Bass were the most abundant species seen.  Shiner sp. were common in most EF stations as well. An occasional BOF was observed. Three Muskellunge ranging from 10.0 to 44.0 inches were sampled. Two larger fish were found to be PIT tagged. The smaller individual was assumed to be a young of the year, natural fish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This report summarizes data collected during a standard survey where 15 gill nets and 15 trap nets were deployed during the week of July 26, 2021. It also includes data summaries from special research projects completed throughout the open-water season. Species targeted in the standard survey using gill nets include Walleye, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch. Species targeted by trap nets include Bluegill and Black Crappie. All netting locations are replicates from the 2015 survey as well as all previous surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in Lake Shamineau is average and about what we'd expect to see in lakes similar in size and character. The fishery is well balanced which means there is good representation of Walleyes from 10-25 inches in length. Compared to previous surveys, the proportion of smaller Walleyes (10-15 inches) is higher now than in the past which is good news for future angling prospects. The current management strategy is to stock Walleye fry on an annual basis and evaluate their survival and growth. Fry stocked in spring of 2017 and 2018 appear to have survived particularly well. We found good numbers of fish especially in the fall of 2018 (about 6-inches long) and in 2021 during this survey (13-15 inches). The 2022 open-water season could see nice angler catches of fish in the 15-inch range. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike continue to be found in lower numbers than other lakes similar in size and character. This is good news since over-abundant pike populations can cause several problems in the fish community. As a direct competitor to Muskellunge and Walleye, fewer pike usually means other predatory species will benefit. Proportionally, about 20% of pike measured during this survey were over 28 inches. An ideal population in Lake Shamineau might look like what already exists now, with a few more larger fish (over 30 inches) than are currently present.  Large pike are rare in central Minnesota lakes and removal of just a few from a lake like Shamineau can set back its potential for producing a quality pike fishery. Anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike and release the large ones as outlined in the 2022 fishing regulations for central Minnesota.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population is currently in stable condition. Since 2002, perch abundance has been sustained at healthy levels despite fluctuations in predator abundance from year to year. In fact, since 2006, there appears to be a steady upward trend in perch abundance. While good numbers of 5 to 8-inch perch can be usable prey for predatory fish, they're not of much interest to anglers. We very rarely see perch over 10 inches in Lake Shamineau, or most other lakes in central Minnesota for that matter. The DNR's research unit is currently involved in work that may shed more light on why large perch are so rare.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie were species we targeted with trap nets during the same week in July. Trap nets are set around the lake's perimeter in shallow water which is typical panfish habitat. Nets are set for 24 hours in the same locations as the previous survey. Usually, Bluegill and crappies swim into trap nets overnight and are counted and measured the next day. Both species are found in numbers typical to other lakes in the area. Most catchable size Bluegills are in the 5-7-inch range, while crappies may reach up to 12 inches but are less abundant.   <br> \n <br> \nSeveral research investigations were conducted on Lake Shamineau from April-October, 2021. They included more intensified sampling such as mark-and-recapture techniques to quantify the actual numbers of Muskellunge, Walleye, Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. All four species were sampled using large-frame trap nets (LTNs) and electrofishing boats. Muskellunge were sampled from April 7 through May 7, 2021. The muskie population was estimated to be approximately 135 adult (>30 inches) fish. While the population is considered low-density, data show the presence of trophy-sized fish. Individual lengths from 38 to 51 inches and weights of 15 to 33 pounds were measured. A total of 820 Walleyes (most in spawning condition) were caught and ranged from 12 to 29 inches. The Walleye population was estimated at approximately 1,541 fish. A total of 520 Northern Pike ranging from 8 to 36 inches were caught. The majority were 17 to 23 inches and are the recommended size to harvest. The estimated pike population was 3,641 fish. The Largemouth Bass population was estimated at 4,790 fish, the majority of which were between 12 and 16 inches but bass over 20 inches were sampled. Large samples of Bluegill and Black Crappie were also captured in LTNs. Bluegill grow fairly slow in Shamineau Lake and therefore harvest pressure can have a major impact on the abundance of quality fish. Bluegill over 7 inches made up nearly 40% of the catch but only 10% of the 1,864 caught were 8 inches or larger. Black Crappie size structure looked very good with fish ranging from 4.5 to nearly 14.0 inches.  Over 55% (530 out of 957) of the fish were over 9.0 inches in length.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Lake Shamineau was conducted on June 16, 22, and 23, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at eighteen sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eleven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured nineteen species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Muskellunge, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was also conducted by Area Fisheries staff on July 25-28, 2022, as part of this survey. Fifteen nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured twelve species of fish, including two that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass and Smallmouth Bass). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number and biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, a Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Lake Shamineau is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shamineau Lake (DOW# 49-0127-00; Lake Class 27) is a 1,434 acre lake located near Motley, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the west shore and a township owned gravel boat ramp is located on the east shore. Shamineau Lake has 10.34 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 52 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Muskellunge, Black Crappie, and Bluegill. The lake was initially surveyed in 1957 and 44 fish sampling surveys or investigations have occurred since then with the most recent prior sampling in 2022 (Fall Targeted Sampling for young or the year Walleye). <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked in Shamineau Lake since at least 1947. Fry, fingerlings, yearlings, and adults have been stocked in the past and the lake management plan called for fingerling stocking on an annual or biennial basis through 2016. Walleye fry have been stocked in fourteen years since 2000 to determine whether Walleye population goals could be met utilizing fry as a cheaper alternative to fingerling stocking. The current stocking plan calls for annual fry stocking with the potential for future fingerling stocking if fry stocking shows consistently poor results. Fry stocking is favored, as fingerlings have become increasingly difficult to raise due to lack of winterkill in Walleye production ponds. Some Walleye natural reproduction has been documented in non-stocked years, but it has been assumed to be inadequate to maintain the population within management goals. Including 2023, nine fall young of the year Walleye electrofishing assessments have been conducted in years when fry stocking has occurred. In addition, three fall young of the year Walleye electrofishing assessments were completed in 1996, 2011 and 2020 when no stocking occurred to evaluate natural reproduction. No stocking occurred in 2020 due to the shutdown of fisheries Walleye egg take and hatchery operations due to the Covid 19 pandemic. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nInitially fall Walleye assessments utilized one hour of electrofishing on-time effort in three stations to document abundance. Beginning in 2020, sampling time increased to two hours and six stations, as Shamineau Lake was included as a control lake in a research project aimed at determining Zebra Mussel impacts on Walleye recruitment. Currently, Zebra Mussels have not been detected in Shamineau Lake.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThis 2023 fall electrofishing assessment was conducted on September 27 to evaluate young of the year Walleye abundance from spring fry stocking. Due to low catches of young of the year Walleye, only 3 of 6 stations were sampled. A total of three young of the year Walleye were captured in one hour of on time during the 2023 survey for a catch rate of 3.0/hour. This catch rate was equal to the median (3.0/hour) established from previous fall electrofishing surveys on Shamineau Lake. Catch rates from previous fry stocking evaluations ranged from 2.0/hour (2004) to 69.7/hour (2022). Individuals captured in 2023 averaged 7.0 inches, which was larger than the mean from all previous assessments and ranged from 6.0 to 7.8 inches in total length. Catch rates from non-stocked years have typically been low ranging from 0.0/hour (1996) to 2.0/hour (2020). Fall electrofishing catches have been an inconsistent predictor of year class strength in future gill net surveys. Past catch rates of 18 or higher young of the year Walleye per hour have produced future gill net catches up to 1.9/net. However, some year classes with low fall juvenile Walleye catch rates have also been well represented in future gill net surveys. It is difficult to predict the 2023-year class's future contribution to future gill net or angler catches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nFurther examination of the extent of natural reproduction is warranted in non-stocked or fingerling stocked years in the future. Natural reproduction observed in some assessments raises questions regarding the origin of YWAE captured in other recent assessments including fry stocked years. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass have been sampled in increasing frequency in recent assessments and are particularly common along the north shoreline.  Most Smallmouth encountered were juvenile size although one 12-inch fish was observed. Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch were observed frequently at most stations. Shiner species and White Suckers were also present. A few Northern Pike were encountered during sampling. Habitat conditions appeared to be good with barren substrates preferred by juvenile Walleye prevalent in all three stations sampled. <br> \n</p>",
