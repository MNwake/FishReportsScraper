                "narrative": "<p>     Wright Lake is a 63-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located within the city limits of Fergus Falls, MN.  Wright Lake is connected to Hoot Lake via a navigable inlet along the north shoreline that is a portion of the Otter Tail River.  The city water plant is located at the outlet along the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of residential areas and agricultural land.  The maximum depth of Wright Lake is 32 feet; however, 52% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2011 lake survey was 8.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.5 to 9.6 feet. <br> \n     The north and east shorelines of Wright Lake have been extensively developed with year-round homes.  Wright Lake can be accessed from Hoot Lake where a city owned public water access exists on the south shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Wild rice is prevalent around the entire shoreline of the lake.  Small stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along various shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling and water quality that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Wright Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.     <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that Wright Lake has good largemouth bass and smallmouth bass populations.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 14.8 to 16.4 inches with a mean length and weight of 15.5 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Smallmouth bass ranged in length from 8.9 to 18.2 inches with a mean length and weight of 13.8 inches and 1.6 pounds.   <br> \n     Age and length data from recent surveys indicates that bluegill reproduction is inconsistent and as a result, bluegill abundance and size structure fluctuates.  In this survey, only five percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length compared to 26% in the previous survey.  Bluegill growth rates are good with an average length of 6.7 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    <br> \n</p>",

The average weight of northern pike was 1.8 pounds, which is similar to 1985.  Northern pike reproduction appears to be limited as only two year classes (ages II+ and III+) were represented in the sample.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance declined from 28.3 per trap net lift in 1985 to 14.0 per net.  The size distribution of bluegills appears to have improved as 7% measured 7.0 inches or greater in length compared to 2% in 1985.  Bluegill growth rates are good with an average back-calculated length of 6.7 inches at age-V.   <br> \n     Black crappie abundance appears to have increased and reproduction is good as six crappies were sampled representing age-classes I+ to III+.   <br> \n     The yellow perch gill net catch rate was 24.5 per net, an increase from 3.3 per net in 1985.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance remains low.  One walleye (age V+) was sampled.  No walleyes from the 1988 fingerling stocking were sampled. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wright Lake is a 63-acre mesotrophic lake located within the city limits of Fergus Falls, MN.  Wright Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Wright Lake is connected to Hoot Lake via an inlet along the north shoreline that is a portion of the Otter Tail River.  The city water plant is located at the outlet along the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of residential areas and agricultural land.  The maximum depth of Wright Lake is 32 feet; however, 52% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2001 lake survey was 9.5 feet, which indicates good water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.5 to 9.6 feet.  Periodic plankton and algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  Wright Lake is included in lake class 33 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme and is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.       The north and east shorelines of Wright Lake have been extensively developed.  Year-round homes compose the majority of the development.  The 1985 lake survey referenced 39 homes and cottages.  Wright Lake can be accessed from Hoot Lake where a city owned public water access exists on the south shoreline.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Wild Rice is prevalent around the entire shoreline of the lake.  Small stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along various shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as wild rice and bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.       Wright Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Wright Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.           The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 33 lakes.  Northern pike ranged in length from 16.9 to 37.7 inches with an average length and weight of 23.1 inches and 3.0 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 20.5 inches at four years of age.  Growth rate estimates are slower than average growth rates for class 33 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that Wright Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population.  Bass ranged in length from 7.0 to 18.2 inches with an average length and weight of 12.4 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass exhibit excellent growth rates with an average length of 13.4 inches at four years of age.     The bluegill test-net catch rate has remained stable over the recent series of lake surveys and is within the normal range for class 33 lakes.  Five percent of the bluegill sample was at least seven inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.6 inches at five years of age which is at the lower limit of the normal range of growth for class 33 lakes.      The walleye test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 33 lakes.  Historically, walleye abundance has been low in Wright Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 12.6 to 16.8 inches with an average length and weight of 15.3 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.0 inches at four years of age.  The DNR stocks walleye fingerlings into Wright Lake on a biennial basis.     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Wright Lake is a 63-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located within the city limits of Fergus Falls, MN.  Wright Lake is connected to Hoot Lake via a navigable inlet along the north shoreline that is a portion of the Otter Tail River.  The city water plant is located at the outlet along the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of residential areas and agricultural land.  The maximum depth of Wright Lake is 32 feet; however, 52% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2006 lake survey was 9.9 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.5 to 9.6 feet.  The MN DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Wright Lake is included in lake class 33; other area lakes in the same classification include Anderson, Heilberger, Long, Bear, and Jim.   \n     The north and east shorelines of Wright Lake have been extensively developed with year-round homes.  Wright Lake can be accessed from Hoot Lake where a city owned public water access exists on the south shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Wild rice is prevalent around the entire shoreline of the lake.  Small stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along various shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling and water quality that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.\n     Wright Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth and smallmouth bass, and bluegill are the dominanat gamefish species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.  \n     The northern pike gill net catch rate of 2.5 is below the expected range for similar lakes.  Northern pike ranged in length from 16.1 to 28.9 inches with a mean length and weight of 21.0 inches and 1.9 pounds.\n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that Wright Lake has good largemouth bass and smallmouth bass populations.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 3.2 to 17.4 inches with a mean length of 14.2 inches, while smallmouth bass ranged in length from 5.9 to 19.8 inches with a mean length of 13.5 inches.  The previous electrofishing assessment in 2001 did not sample smallmouth bass.\n     The bluegill trap net catch rate went from a historic low in 2001 (11.4 per net) to a historic high in 2006 (51.3 per net) and exceeds the expected range for similar lakes.  Twenty-six percent of the bluegills sampled were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Age and length data from recent survey indicates that bluegill recruitment is inconsistent and as a result, bluegill size structure fluctuates. \n     The walleye gill net catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Historically, walleye abundance has been low in Wright Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 15.4 to 19.7 inches with a mean length of 17.5 inches.  The DNR stocks walleye fingerlings into Wright Lake on a biennial basis to supplement limited natural reproduction.\n      Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Wright Lake is a 63-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located within the city limits of Fergus Falls, MN.  Wright Lake is connected to Hoot Lake via a navigable inlet along the north shoreline that is a portion of the Otter Tail River.  The city water plant is located at the outlet along the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of residential areas and agricultural land.  The maximum depth of Wright Lake is 32 feet; however, 52% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 7.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.5 to 9.6 feet. <br> \n     The north and east shorelines of Wright Lake have been extensively developed with year-round homes.  Wright Lake can be accessed from Hoot Lake via a navigable channel between the lakes.  A city owned public water access is located on the south shoreline of Hoot Lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Wild rice is prevalent around the entire shoreline of the lake.  Small stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along various shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling and water quality that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Wright Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.     <br> \n     Northern Pike ranged in length from 20.0 to 24.3 inches with an average length and weight of 22.6 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 23.7 inches at age-IV. <br> \n     Thirty-five percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill growth rates are good with an average length of 7.2 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass were not sampled in this survey.  Data from past electrofishing assessments indicate that these species are abundant and have good size structures.  There is a catch and release regulation for Smallmouth Bass on the Otter Tail River and its impoundments which includes Wright Lake.   <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 13.4 to 18.6 inches with a mean length and weight of 15.9 inches and 1.3 pounds. <br> \n     Three Lake Sturgeon were sampled.  This is the first survey in which Lake Sturgeon have been sampled in Wright Lake. Lake Sturgeon enter Wright Lake by downstream movement from Otter Tail Lake where a Lake Sturgeon re-introduction plan was implemented in 2002. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    <br> \n</p>",
