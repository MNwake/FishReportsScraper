All other species were found in low numbers.  The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine whether the abundances of northern pike, yellow perch and walleye were the same as in 1987.  Test results are appended to the end of this report.  The change in northern pike catch between 1987 (7.5/gillnet) and 1992 (2.17/gillnet) represents an actual decline in abundance (0.05 significance level) into the low category for the lake class.  Age classes 2-5 were sampled and growth bordered on fast.  Average size was 3.4 lb., large for the lake class.  In 1987 ages 1-5 were sampled, growth was good and average size was 1.9 lbs the catch of largemouth bass dropped from 0.92/trapnet in 1987 (average) to 0.08/ trapnet in 1992 (low).  The walleye catch (13.33/gillnet) rose from 3.92/gillnet in 1987.  The change represents an actual increase in abundance since 1987.  Ages 2-8 were sampled and the 1985 and 1986 year classes comprised 50.8 of the catch. Growth was slow for ages 2-5 and good for ages 6-8.  In 1987, ages 1-8 were sampled and all age classes had good growth. Walleyes averaged 1.35 lbs in 1992 (to 1.04 lbs in 1987 (14.67/trapnet) dropped from 26.75/trapnet in 1987 but remained average for the lake class.  Ages 2-8 were sampled and 47% were from the 1987 year class.  Fifty percent of measured bluegills were at least 7.0 growth was slow for ages 2-4 and good for older fish, a pattern also seen in 1987.  Pumpkinseed (1.42/ trapnet) had low abundance in 1992.  The yellow perch population experienced a decline in abundance between 1982 and 1987 (from 29.0/ gillnet to 6.42/gillnet) and experienced an increase in abundance between 1987 and 1992 (to 13.67/gillnet).  Ages 3-5 were sampled and had good growth.  In 1987 ages 4-6 were sampled and growth was good, as well.  Perch averaged 0.14 lbs in 1992 compared to 0.18 lbs in 1987, both average for the lake class.  Tullibee (cisco) (0.5/gillnet) continued to be present in low numbers, as was white sucker (0.17/gillnet).  Bowfin (0.58/trapnet) was taken in average numbers.  Yellow bullhead (2.5/trapnet) was also present in average numbers while brown bullhead (0.25/ trapnet) had low abundance.  Bullhead as large as 14 inches were sampled and size averaged 0.98 lbs for yellows and 1.17 lbs for browns, both large for the lake class.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Edward Lake is a 2,032 acre lake located one mile north of Merrifield in Crow Wing County.  Edward reaches depths of 75' with 59% of the lake 15' deep or less.  Water clarity was good with a secchi disk reading of 13.0'.  A 2004 plant survey found 33 species of aquatic vegetation.  Extensive bulrush beds surround much of the lake.   Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life.  Edward is heavily developed with a 2008 survey finding 189 homes/cabins and three resorts.  A public access is located on the west shore.   <br> \n <br> \nTwo million walleye fry are stocked annually into Edward Lake.  The walleye gillnet catch was average compared to similar lakes at 4.4/net, up from 3.1/net in 2008.  Average size was 17.1\" and 2.0 lbs.  Walleyes up to 30.6\" were captured.    <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was also average at 5.8/gillnet, down from a high of 15.5/net in 2008.  The average size was 20.8\" and 2.0lbs, with only 3% measuring 24\" or larger.  Four year classes were present, with 60% being from the 2011 year class. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 200.7/hr.   This is high compared to the previous two survey rates of 40.7/hr. (2008) and 73.5/hr. (2002).   Part of the reason for such a high catch rate is the amount of largemouth bass under 8\".  In this survey 73% of the catch was less than 8\", compared to 3% (2008) and 10% (2002).  For largemouth bass 8\" or greater, 56% were at least 12\" in length.  Largemouth bass were captured in average numbers in gillnets at 0.7/net.  Average length of those fish was 12.7\". <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were captured in average numbers at 18.6/trapnet.  Average length was 6.1\", with 24% of the catch measuring at least 7\" in length.  Yellow perch were caught in low numbers at 1.2/gillnet.  Average length was 6.4\".  Yellow perch are an important prey species, especially for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered thus far in Edward Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

The Walleye catch in 2020 was average compared to similar lakes at 5.4/gill net, up from 4.4/gill net in 2014.  Average length was 14.8\", with 67% of the fish measuring 12\" or larger.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was also average at 5.5/gill net.  Fish ranged in size from 10.1\" to 34.8\", with an average length of 20.6\".  Fish above the 22\"-26\" protected slot made up 9% of the catch. Lakes in this part of the state have a new Northern Pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nDue to Covid-19 protocols, electrofishing to sample Largemouth Bass was not able to be completed during the spring of 2020.  Above average numbers were captured in both gill nets (2.3/net) and trap nets (2.4/net).  Mean length was only 8.2\" in gill nets and 6.4\" in trap nets, with fish ranging from 4.8\" to 16.0\".   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were captured in average numbers at 26.5/trap net.  Average length was 5.5\", with only 6% of the catch measuring at least 7\" in length.  Fish up to 9\" were captured in our nets.  New regulations went into effect on March 1st, 2021, reducing the daily bag limit to 5 on both Sunfish and Black Crappie.  No Black Crappie were captured during the survey. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were caught in the highest numbers since 1982 at 23.6/gill net.  Average length was 6.5\".  With the largest perch sampled measuring only 8.6\", there is likely not much for a sport fishery.  However, Yellow Perch are an important prey species, especially for Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n</p>",

Edward is located in the Crow Wing River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Twenty four 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on August 25th and September 2nd, 2020, with all 24 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 12 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 5 stations.  Nineteen species were sampled, including six species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on July 13-17, 2020 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Edward Lake is a 2,032 acre lake located just north of Merrifield in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the west side of the lake.  The lake is heavily developed, with 189 homes/cabins and three resorts having a total of 37 cabins and 28 RV campsites, along 9.4 miles of shoreline.  The lake's maximum depth is 75' and about 59% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrate is predominately sand.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse.  Emergent plants are common along the shoreline and species such as hardstem bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality and providing essential  spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are stocked annually, as fry, at 2 million/year.  The 2008 catch dropped into the \"low\" category for the first time since 1987.  Eleven year classes were sampled and growth remained \"average.\"  Size averaged 19.2\" and 2.87 lbs, a slight increase from 2002 <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was at an all tine high in 2008.  The dominant year classes were at ages 2 and 3.  Only 9% of measured pike were at least 24\" long.  Pike averaged only 17.6\" and 1.35 pounds in 2008.  The high abundance of young pike combined with a low perch abundance is probably responsible for the low walleye catch in 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance was \"high\" in gill nets and \"average\" in trap nets.  The catch in spring electrofishing dropped from the 2002 rate of 73.5/hr to 40.7/hr in 2008. However, the average size increased somewhat in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in average numbers in 2008.  Forty percent of crappies were at least 8 inches long and 13% exceeded 12 inches long.  Bluegills dropped in abundance compared to 2002 but remained in the \"average\" abundance category for the lake class.  The bluegill size profile increased since 2002 and 58% were at least 7\" long and 12% exceeded 8\" long. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bowfin and northern pike net catches indicate above average populations since net catches for these species are above the third quartile of the area median for lakes larger than 1,074 acres. Yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, bluegill, largemouth bass and walleye exhibited average populations since net catches were between the first and third quartile of the area median for lakes larger than 1074 acres. Northern cisco, rock bass, pumpkinseed, black crappie and yellow perch net catches indicate below average populations for each species. In June, 1955 and August, 1969, 14 gillnets were set in Lake Edward. In 1971, 1982 and 1987, 12 gillnets were set. The 1987 northern pike net catches of 7.5/gillnet is comparable to the 1971 and 1982 netting, however, significantly higher than the 1955 and the 1969 netting. Year classes represented in the 1987 net catches were 1-6. All year classes exhibited good growth rates when compared to the statewide averages. Annuli 1 fish averaged 8.94 inches and annuli 6 were 29.0 inches long. The length-frequency distribution was from 10.5 inches to 34.0 inches. The median size was 19.0 inches long weight was 1.68 lbs and belonged to the 1984 year class. Comparing 1987 to past years, the northern pike length-frequency distribution has varied little over the past 22 years. Yellow and brown bullhead respectively averaged 0.65 lbs and 0.8 lbs. Yellow bullhead net catches were all-time highs in both the gill and trapnets. Bluegill net catches were significantly higher than any past trapnetting or gillnetting on Lake Edward. Growth rate was slow for bluegills in the 3 and 4 year class while other year classes exhibited an average growth rate in comparison to statewide averages. The median size of the bluegills was 0.19 lbs and 6.2 inches long. The largemouth bass population is in good shape with abundance levels comparable to the last two surveys but below the 1955 and 1969 netting. Year classes present in the nets were 1 thru 5 with year class 1 predominating. The yellow perch population has taken an extremely sharp drop in abundance when compared to the average of 42.1/gillnet in the previous four surveys. The perch population has been declining since the 1969 survey. The higher northern pike population, along with usually higher walleye populations since 1969, may indicate an overabundance of primary predators. The walleye population has exhibited a significant decline in abundance since 1982 and is also significantly below the average of 8.9/gillnet that was obtained in the previous four surveys. The average walleye size has not changed since the 1982 survey, however, is significantly smaller than 1955, 1969 and 1971 surveys. The median size of walleyes in 1987 was 0.7 lbs and 13 inches long. Seven year classes were represented with annuli 2 being the dominant year class. Year classes 1 thru 5 represent 89% of the walleyes netted. Annuli 1 walleye exhibited a fast growth rate (the reason may be that the slower growing annuli 1 fish were not vulnerable to the gillnets) and annuli 2 thru 7 exhibited average growth rates in comparison to statewide averages.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Edward Lake is a 2,032 acre lake located just north of Merrifield in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the west side of the lake.  The lake is heavily developed with 133 homes/cabins and 6 resorts with 40 cabins (as of 1992) along 9.4 miles of shoreline.  The maximum depth is 75' and about 59% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrate is predominately sand.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 32 species present.  Emergent plants are common along the shoreline and species such as hardstem bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.Walleyes are currently stocked annually as fry at a rate of 1,000 per littoral acre.  The 2002 walleye catch of 6.7/gill net was average when compared to similar lakes and near the average for previous catches on this lake.  The 1999 year class represented 44% of the catch and is approximately 14\" to 15.5\" in length.  Compared to 2000 (16.7\" and 1.9lbs), average length and weight of walleyes sampled by gill nets remained similar at 17.2\" and 1.9lbs.Northern pike were caught in above average numbers in 2002 at 9.6/gill net, which is the second highest catch to date.  The 1998 and 1999 year classes contributed 55% of the catch with most of these fish measuring about 16\" to 20\".  Compared to 2000, average length and weight decreased from 18.8\" and 1.6lbs to 18.0\" and 1.2lbs.The largemouth bass abundance of 0.7/trap net was average compared to similar lakes while abundance measured by gill nets was above average at 1.7/gill net.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 73.5/hr with an average length of 10.7\" and 24% measuring at least 12\".  The bluegill catch of 17.6/trap net was average and 2.7% of trap netted bluegills measured 7\" or larger, compared to 8.4% in 1997.  The 1998, 1999, and 2000 year classes represented 84% of the catch.Tullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish and were below average in numbers.  No tullibee were caught in 2002 and while small yellow perch were relatively abundant in shoreline seining, adult yellow perch abundance of 3.3/gill net was below average and the lowest in the 11 nettings to date.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Edward is a 2,032 acre lake located just north of Merrifield, in Crow Wing County.  A complete lake survey was last done in 1982.  At that time there were 123 homes/cabins and six resorts located along the lake's 9.4 miles of shoreline.  There was a county-owned public access located on the west side of the lake.  Maximum depth is 75 feet and about 51% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  Soils in water less than four feet deep are basically sandy.  The lake is classified as having hard water and low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity was at or above average in 1997.The aquatic plant community had fair diversity in 1982 and emergent species were generally most abundant.  The emergent species help control nutrients and provide some protection from wave-caused shore erosion.  Species like bulrush enhance the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Wild rice can help provide spawning substrate for northern pike.  Cattails can provide effective shoreline protection from erosion.  Submergent and floating leafed species provide cover and food resources for a wide variety of aquatic species.A population assessment netting was done in 1997.  Black, brown and yellow bullheads, as well as tullibees and white suckers were caught in \"low\" numbers in comparison to similar type lakes.  The northern pike catch was in the \"high\" category when compared to similar type lakes.Northern pike abundance was \"average\" in 1987, dropped into the \"low\" category by 1992, then increased into the \"high\" category by 1997.  In 1997, seven age classes were sampled and growth was \"good,\" but slower than in '92.  Size averaged 19 inches and 1,8 lbs., similar to the values from 1987.  Strongest year classes were from 1993 and '94.Walleyes have been stocked regularly since the mid 1940's.  Annual fry stocking has been done since 1976.  Walleye net catches have generally been in the \"average\" category since the 1955 netting.  Abundance rose into the \"high\" category in 1992, when northern pike numbers were \"low.\"  By '97, walleye abundance had returned to the \"average\" category.The largemouth bass catch bordered on \"low\" in '97, but several age classes were sampled.  Bass are often poorly sampled in stationary nets used in summer netting.  The bluegill catch has always been in the \"average\" category, as it was in '97.  In '97, three stronger year classes were sampled and about 8% of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or more in length.  Black crappies were not sampled in '97, but previous catches of crappies were generally in the \"low\" category.Yellow perch are an important food resource for walleys and northern pike.  Their abundance dropped into the \"low\" category in 1987, then rebounded into the \"average\" category in '92 and '97.  Changing perch abundance may help explain some of the changes seen in growth and abundance of northern pike and walleye populations over the past ten years.  Tullibee and white sucker catch rates were also \"low\" in '97 but were both similar to previous catches for the respective species.Other species sampled in 1997 included: bowfin (dogfish), pumpkinseed and rock bass.  Their abundances were in the \"average\" category.  Common shiner and hybrid sunfish were also  present in the catch.</p>",
