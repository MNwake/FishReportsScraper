                "narrative": "<p>The gillnet catch of northern pike declined from 4.00/set in 1986 to 2.00/set in the current survey.  It is now below the first quartile for this lake class (Schupp's #27).  Although no northern pike taken in test nets were over four years old, it's possible that older and larger fish are foraging on tullibees, making them less susceptible to gillnets.  The northern pike from test nets exhibit an above average growth rate and the length frequency median length group is 21.0-21.9 inches.  A very high yellow perch population in this lake would seem to provide ideal conditions for northern pike and it's somewhat surprising that they're not more abundant.  A primary northern pike spawning area is located adjacent to the outlet and it's possible that a substantial portion of YOY northern pike are leaving the lake with the outlet current, keeping northern pike numbers low.Bluegills have never been very abundant (below the first quartile) but they exhibit above average growth and a good size structure, median length group is 7.5-7.9 inches.  No black crappies were found in the current survey but anglers occasionally report catching \"nice size\" crappies.  The largemouth bass trapnet catch increased to 2.87/set from zero per trapnet in the 1981 and 1986 surveys.  All largemouth bass were less than four years old (87% were one-year-olds) and exhibit a fast growth rate.Yellow perch have historically been extremely abundant, and, despite a decline to nearly half the gillnet catch of the previous survey, from 194.2/set to 110.3/set, they are still at double the third quartile value for this lake class.  The median length group for yellow perch is 8.0-8.4 inches.A small decline in the walleye gillnet catch, from 11.17/set in 1986 to 9.00/set in 1991, does not represent a significant change in the population.  Nine walleyes per gillnet is very near the third quartile value for this lake class.  Walleye ages coincide well with fingerling stocking years and natural reproduction appears to contribute little to the population.  Walleye growth rates are slightly above average.</p>",

Tulaby Lake possesses a littoral area of 281 acres and a developed shoreline surrounded by primarily forested area. Tulaby Lake supports a robust fishery with angling opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie. A standard fisheries survey was completed on Tulaby Lake in July 2021. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has increased steadily since 2001 and reached a record high in 2021. Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 7.4 to 24.8 inches, averaging 13.9 inches long. Walleye belonging to the 2019 year class dominated catch, accounting for 60% of sampled Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was similar to past years with pike averaging almost 24 inches long. Of the sampled pike, 41% were 24 inches or longer.  Northern Pike up to 33 inches long were found. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance remains high in Tulaby Lake.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3.4 to 8.5 inches, averaging 5.9 inches long. Few Bluegill over eight inches were sampled. Growth rates of Bluegill in Tulaby Lake is slow, requiring seven years for fish to reach seven inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance in 2021 was average, with fish measured ranging from five to 13 inches long. Largemouth Bass were low in catch ranging in length from to 7.3 to 17.1 inches long. One Smallmouth Bass was caught in the 2021 survey measuring 20.7 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are abundant in Tulaby Lake.  Perch ranged in length from 3.6 to 11.4 inches, averaging 6.8 inches long. Additional species sampled included Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Cisco, Rock Bass, and White Sucker. Bullheads were sampled in very low numbers. White Sucker, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass were abundant in catch. Cisco have been caught in low numbers in Tulaby Lake since initial surveying in 1959.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and recreationalists can protect Tulaby Lake's fishery by doing their best to stop the spread of aquatic invasive species by adhering to the clean, drain, dry process after leaving a lake. Shoreline owners can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat in Tulaby Lake by maintaining shoreline buffer zones and leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tulaby Lake is regarded as a good all-around fishing lake with relatively fast growth rates for most fish species.  Walleyes, bluegills, and perch are generally nice-sized.  Although the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency classifies Tulaby as eutrophic, water quality is good enough to sustain a modest tullibee population, as well. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage fish for the major predators in a lake and yellow perch have always been very abundant in Tulaby Lake.  Northern pike and walleye both have good growth rates as a result of the abundant food supply.  The gill net catch rates in 2011 for northern pike and walleye were 5.1 and 21.6 per set, respectively.  The walleye gill net catch was above what is typically expected for a lake of this type and higher than those reported in all but one previous Tulaby Lake survey (1959).  The average size of sampled northern pike was 22.6 inches while the young walleye population averaged 14.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill sunfish are other species frequently sought by anglers on Tulaby Lake.  Previous netting data indicate that Tulaby Lake can produce big bluegills if given time.  Bluegill growth rates were good and the numbers of young bluegills should provide good angling in the near future.  Black crappies do not appear to be as abundant as bluegills and only a few were sampled but some were large.  Largemouth bass were also present in numbers similar to the lake's historic catch rates. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled in Tulaby Lake included brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee, yellow bullhead, and white sucker.  The presence of tullibee is usually an indicator of good water quality and catches of tulibee were at historic high levels in this lake in 2011.  They are a cold-water fish that are related to trout.  Every effort should be made by lakeshore residents to protect water quality and minimize nutrient input to the lake by using good lakeshore management practices.  These include:  (1)leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, (2)leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail beds, (3)not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4)ensuring compliance of septic systems, (5)stabilizing eroding banks, and (6)utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.  Removal of emergent aquatic vegetation, particularly bulrushes, should be avoided at all costs.  Bulrushes are an extremely important feature of the lake ecosystem, both from a water quality and fish habitat standpoint.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tulaby Lake is a 773-acre lake on the Mahnomen and Becker county line.  The lake lies in a scenic setting with surrounding landscape that is predominantly forested.  Water quality is generally good.  As is the case with most area lakes, development pressure is increasing and the lake now has 221 homes and cabins.  Tulaby Lake is generally known as a good fishing lake for northern pike, bass, and panfish that occasionally \"turns on\" and experiences brief periods of exceptionally good walleye fishing.Yellow perch are an important forage fish for the major predators in a lake and yellow perch have always been very abundant in Tulaby Lake.  Northern pike and walleye both have fast growth rates as a result of the abundant food supply.  The gill net catch rates in 2001 for northern pike and walleye were 6.3 and 11.1 per set, respectively.  The walleye gill net catch was above what is typically expected for a lake of this type.  The average size of sampled northern pike was 24.5 inches while walleyes averaged 19.2 inches; both quite impressive.  One problem with well-fed fish is that they are not very eager to bite, making them difficult to catch.  Anglers have reported that sometimes this seems to be the case on Tulaby Lake.Largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill sunfish are other species frequently sought by anglers on Tulaby Lake.  Previous netting data indicate that Tulaby Lake can produce big bluegills if given time.  Bluegill growth rates were above average, but only a small percentage of bluegills sampled in 2001 were over 7 inches in length.  It is believed that as soon as bluegills reach an acceptable size they are cropped off by anglers.  Black crappies do not appear to be as abundant as bluegills but the average length of crappies sampled was an impressive 11.0 inches.  Nearly all the crappies were one age.  Trap net catches of largemouth bass increased significantly from the previous survey due to large numbers of 6-10 inch, one and two-year-old bass.Other fish sampled in Tulaby Lake included black bullhead, black crappie, brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee, and white sucker.  The presence of tullibee is an indicator of good water quality.  They are a cold-water fish that are related to trout.  Every effort should be made by lakeshore residents to protect water quality and minimize nutrient input to the lake by using good lakeshore management practices.  These include:  (1)leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, (2)leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail beds, (3)not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4)ensuring compliance of septic systems, (5)stabilizing eroding banks, and (6)utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.  Removal of emergent aquatic vegetation, particularly bulrushes, should be avoided at all costs.  Bulrushes are an extremely important feature of the lake ecosystem, both from a water quality and fish habitat standpoint.</p>",

Data collected during this nearshore survey were combined with trap net and gill net data to calculate a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score for the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe FIBI Tool-2 was used for scoring and resulted in a FIBI score of 69.  The previous score for Tulaby Lake was  45 in July 2015.  The impairment threshold score is 45,  suggesting that the fish population in Tulaby Lake meets expectations for lakes of similar characteristics, and the lake is likely not biologically impaired.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Wild Rice River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Tulaby Lake, which lies within the boundaries of the White Earth Reservation, was conducted on July 18, 20, 24, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample twelve stations and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and three species that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program Staff. Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 27 lakes and the average length was 5.9 inches, with 21% over 7 inches. Conversely, the number of Black Crappie sampled per net was below the 25% quartile for Lake Class 25 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tulaby Lake is regarded as a good all-around fishing lake with relatively fast growth rates for most fish species.  Walleyes, bluegills, and perch are generally nice-sized.  Although the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency classifies Tulaby as eutrophic, water quality is good enough to sustain a modest tullibee population, as well. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage fish for the major predators in a lake and yellow perch have always been very abundant in Tulaby Lake.  Northern pike and walleye both have good growth rates as a result of the abundant food supply.  The gill net catch rates in 2006 for northern pike and walleye were 6.5 and 20.0 per set, respectively.  The walleye gill net catch was above what is typically expected for a lake of this type and higher than those reported in all but one previous Tulaby Lake survey (1959).  The average size of sampled northern pike was 21.3 inches while walleyes averaged 16.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill sunfish are other species frequently sought by anglers on Tulaby Lake.  Previous netting data indicate that Tulaby Lake can produce big bluegills if given time.  Bluegill growth rates were good and, although bluegill catch rates were down from the previous report, the average size was up to 7.2 inches.  Black crappies do not appear to be as abundant as bluegills and only a few were sampled but they were large with all but one over 12 inches in length.  Largemouth bass were also present in numbers similar to the lake's historic catch rates. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled in Tulaby Lake included black bullhead, black crappie, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee, yellow bullhead, and white sucker.  The presence of tullibee is usually an indicator of good water quality.  They are a cold-water fish that are related to trout.  Every effort should be made by lakeshore residents to protect water quality and minimize nutrient input to the lake by using good lakeshore management practices.  These include:  (1)leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, (2)leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail beds, (3)not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4)ensuring compliance of septic systems, (5)stabilizing eroding banks, and (6)utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.  Removal of emergent aquatic vegetation, particularly bulrushes, should be avoided at all costs.  Bulrushes are an extremely important feature of the lake ecosystem, both from a water quality and fish habitat standpoint.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tulaby Lake is known as a good walleye, northern pike, bass, and panfish angling lake.  It has produced some large walleye, northern pike, and bluegill.  Lakes with good oxygen in the deeper cooler water have the best potential to produce large pike.  Tulaby Lake, as evidenced by its tullibee population, is such a lake.  Even though conditions are excellent for large northern pike in Tulaby Lake and growth rates are fast, pike larger than 30 inches (about eight pounds) are rare.  It is likely that anglers remove most of the lake's pike before they attain a large size.  No creel surveys have been done on the lake, but, it is believed that fishing pressure is relatively heavy.Test net catches of northern pike are currently higher than they have ever been due to strong natural reproduction in 1992 and 1993.  However, pike abundance remains in the \"normal\" range compared to similar lakes.  Even though northern pike have not been stocked for twenty years, the population has remained relatively stable.  A typical Tulaby Lake northern pike weighs just under three pounds and is approximately 23 inches long.Historically, yellow perch have remained very abundant in Tulaby Lake as they are at present.  Yellow perch are the primary forage for northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye as well as a competitor or predator of young bluegill.  Consequently, they are important to the fish community and will be monitored along with other gamefish and panfish.  Drastic reductions in yellow perch in Tulaby Lake may signal problems for gamefish.The good news is that there are still some large fish remaining in Tulaby Lake.  Also, the walleye population is relatively stable and at the top end of the normal range in abundance for similar lakes.  The average sampled walleye weighed 2.2 pounds and was 17.4 inches long.  Although there is limited natural reproduction of walleye in Tulaby Lake, the population appears to be maintained by biennial fingerling stocking.  Anglers can help to sustain fish populations by releasing medium to large fish.Other ways that anglers and lakeshore owners can help to maintain fish populations, water quality, and property values is by conserving and protecting natural fish habitat.  Bulrushes and cattails are particularly valuable for fish spawning, feeding, and rearing as well as for erosion protection and nutrient uptake.  Shoreline buffer zones of unmowed, unfertilized natural vegetation help to slow erosion and sedimentation.  Tulaby Lake's fish populations are sustainable with care and stewardship from its watershed inhabitants and lake users.  Participation in the Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake Monitoring Program is valuable for monitoring trends in water quality.  Lake association members are urged to continue that participation.</p>",

Northern pike catches have been good at times in the past.The lake was open to whitefish and tullibee netting from 1944 to 1947 and 1957 to 1959.  The lake was closed to darkhouse spearing in the 1944-1945 and 1945-1946 seasons.Results of test netting indicate a large population of walleyes with many year-classes represented.  Tullibee, perch, suckers, and bullheads are also very abundant.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tulaby Lake is a 832-acre, class-27 lake on the Mahnomen County - Becker County line.  The lake lies in a scenic setting with a surrounding landscape that is predominantly forested and is within the boundaries of the White Earth Indian Reservation.  The lake's littoral area is 281 acres and the maximum depth is 43 feet.  This lake is categorized as early eutrophic with a mean Carlson's trophic state index in the lower fifties.  Tulaby Lake is generally known as a good fishing lake for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish that occasionally has brief periods of exceptionally good Walleye fishing. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch rate has been stable over the past 20 years, but indicating a slight decline in recent surveys.  In 2016, this catch rate was 4.1 fish per gill net.  This rate is just slightly below the historical mean of 4.6 fish per set.  Thirty-three Northern Pike were sampled in 2016 with ages ranging from two to five years old.  Most (91%) of the Northern Pike were age 2 or 3. The overall mean length was 23.4 inches and fish were capatured from from 23.4 to 29.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe historical gill net catch for Walleye in Tulaby Lake has seen peaks in catch rates when fisheries surveys first began and again in the most recent surveys.  The 2016 gill net catch of 25.1 fish per net was higher than those reported on all but the first (1959) survey, and above the long-term mean of 15.3 Walleyes per net.  Captured Walleyes ranged from one to 12 years of age.  Similar to the 2009 survey, age-3 Walleyes dominated the age frequency of sampled Walleye in 2016.  These age-3 Walleyes correspond to a year when fingerling Walleye were stocked and averaged 14.8 inches in length at the time of capture in early August.  The mean length of all sampled Walleyes was 15.4 inches and they ranged from 7.4 to 24.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch rates in Tulaby Lake have always been far above the typical range expected for a lake of this ecological type.  A historical low point of 62.7 fish per net in 1996 was still higher than expected for a lake of this type.  The 2016 gill net catch rate was very near the lakes historical average, which is an incredible 150.8 fish per net.  The mean length of Yellow Perch was 7.2 inches and they ranged in length from 3.4 to 10.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe historic Bluegill trap net catch rate for Tulaby Lake is quite low at 14.2 per net.  The highest catch rate during this survey at 77.4 fish per net.  Prior to the survey in 2016, the historic mean catch rate was 7.2 fish per net.  Ages of the sampled Bluegills ranged from two to ten years, but 75% of them were ages 2 and 3.  The overall mean Bluegill length was 4.8 inches, but bluegills up to 9.6 inches were captured. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in Tulaby Lake included Black Crappie, Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Cisco, Yellow Bullhead, and White Sucker.  Other than Cisco and White Sucker, which were relatively abundant, catch rates were modest for most of these species.  The trap net catch rate for Largemouth Bass in 2016 was 5.6 fish per net, but 93% of the sampled fish were less than 7.5 inches in length.  Bullhead trap net catches in recent surveys (including this one) have been well below what they were in the 1980's and before. <br> \n</p>",
