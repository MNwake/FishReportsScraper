                "narrative": "<p>Moose Lake is a 357 acre lake located six miles southeast of Northome.  The lake has one public access located on the south shore.  The lake management plan indicates walleye as the primary species of management with largemouth bass and northern pike as secondary species.  The walleye catch rate of 6.2 fish/net exceeded the management goal of 6.0 fish/net in 2000.  The catch was the second highest on record.  The 2000 catch was also higher then 75% of other lakes similar to Moose.  Walleye catch rates have ranged from 3.0 to 10.7 fish/net since 1960.  Fish ranged from 9.9 to 23.9 inches and averaged 17.3 inches.  Based on age analysis, 12 year classes were identified from one to 15 years old.  Thirty-nine percent of the sample were three year old fish that corresponded to a year of stocking.  Although natural reproduction was evident in several year, no large year classes were observed in this assessment.  Walleye growth was similar to statewide averages with four year old fish averaging nearly 16.0 inches.  The Moose Lake largemouth bass population has never been sampled with spring electrofishing which is the most effective method for this species.  The goal in the 1993 management plan was to maintain a catch of 0.6 fish/net.  In the 2000 assessment, the gill-net catch was nearly 0.8 fish/net.  The sample included fish from 6.3 to 11.5 inches that averaged 8.0 inches.  Four year classes were represented but most fish (64%) were one year old.  Largemouth bass growth was similar to statewide averages for most ages. The northern pike catch exceeded the management goal of 5.5 fish/net with a catch of 9.8 fish/net.  Net catches have varied from 1.9 to 10.0 fish/net since 1960.  Fish ranged from 15.1 to 30.3 inches and averaged 19.8 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected for northern pike in this assessment.Black crappie gill-net (1.8 fish/net) and trap-net (0.4 fish/net) catch rates were similar to previous assessments.  Black crappie from the gill nets ranged from 4.3 to 9.8 inches with an average length of 5.6 inches.  Black crappie were not aged in this assessment.Yellow perch numbers have remained good with a catch of 29.4 in 2000.   Historical net catch rates have ranged from a low of 28.3 in 1960 to a high of 102.6 in 1992.  The sample included fish from 5.1 to 11.7 inches with an average length of 6.8 inches.  Despite age structures not being collected in this assessment, it appears the population has fairly consistent and good reproduction.  The yellow perch population is probably more important to the fish community as a prey source than to anglers for fishing.Other species observed during the population assessment included black bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker. To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural, forestry or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these can be areas of concern, lakeshore property owners may also contribute to water quality problems.  Some examples include putting in sand beaches, removing shoreline trees and vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Proper land use practices by everyone will help insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moose Lake is a small lake located six miles southeast of Northome, MN in northern Itasca County.  The lake lies within the Chippewa National Forest and the Big Fork River watershed.  Much of the shoreline is undeveloped forest land managed by the US Forest Service.  There is a concrete ramp public access at the south end of the lake with limited parking.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan (LMP) was last revised in 2009.  Walleye were considered primary management species because of alternate-year fry stocking.  Northern Pike and Black Crappie were considered secondary management species.  A standard survey was conducted in 2018 to assess the status of the fish community and the effectiveness of Walleye fry stocking. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill-net catch was typical for Moose Lake and slightly above average for lakes with comparable habitat.  Walleye size structure was good; fish from gill nets averaged 15.8 inches and 18% of the sample exceeded 20 inches.  Most fish corresponded to stocked year classes but a moderate natural year class (2016) was represented by numbers of age 2 fish.  Growth was considered good with Walleye averaging 15.2 inches at age 4.  Moose Lake appears to provide good fishing opportunities for Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill-net catch was about average for Moose Lake and slightly above average for lakes with similar habitat.  Size structure was moderate; pike ranged from 17.9 to 28.6 inches with an average length of 22.9 inches.  Ages 2-7 were represented with age 3 fish the most frequently sampled.  Pike averaged 21.9 inches at age 4.  The north central pike zone regulation implemented in 2018 requires anglers to release pike from 22-26 inches, while allowing for more harvest of small pike.  It is hoped that this regulation will improve size quality on Moose Lake. <br> \n <br> \nMoose Lake has generally produced a modest crappie fishery.  The 2018 trap-net catch was higher than previous surveys but within the typical range for lakes with comparable habitat.  Crappie from trap nets ranged from 4.8 to 10.2 inches with an average length of 8.2 inches.  Ages 1-4 were represented with ages 2 and 3 making up a majority of the sample.  Growth was good with crappie averaging 8.0 inches at age 3. <br> \n <br> \nGill-net catches for Yellow Perch have typically been quite high compared to similar lakes.  The 2018 catch was the highest ever recorded.  Not surprisingly, size structure was fairly poor; perch from gill nets averaged 6.8 inches and very few fish exceeded 8 inches.  Yellow Perch are more important as a prey source for predators than as a target for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Brown Bullhead and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is 357 acres and has a maximum depth of 52 feet.  A survey targeting nearshore fish species was conducted by Area staff on 18 July, 2018.  Ten sampling sites (100 feet long) were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-ft or 15-ft 1/8th inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining was conducted at nine sites; using only the 15-ft seine.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured a total of 13 different species; nine species by seining and 11 species by backpack electrofishing.  The species can be found in the gear-specific catch tables in this report. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used with the gill net and trap net data from the standard survey conducted on 6 August, 2018, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of lake health.  The surveys will assist the watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

The northern pike population was stable from 1960 to 1976 but has now substantially increased.  Perch abundance increased from 1960 to 1976 but has now begun to decline, probably from increasing northern pike predation. The walleye population has remained stable and there appears to be adequate natural reproduction to maintain the population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moose Lake is a moderately sized, mesotrophic, class 25 lake in northern Itasca County near the town of Northome.  The lake is moderately fertile and has good water clarity.  Most of the shoreline is in a natural state consisting primarily of forest and secondarily of bog.  Moose Lake is situated in the Big Fork River/ Moose Brook minor watershed and has four inlets of wetland origin.  There is a connection to Big Calf Lake via the outlet, Moose Brook. <br> \n <br> \nA diverse aquatic plant community is a major attribute of Moose Lake, providing valuable habitat for a variety of fish species.  Submergent plants were widespread, growing to a depth of 13 feet.  Sago pondweed, coontail, and flatstem pondweed were the most widespread submergent plants.  Floating leaf and emergent vegetation were also widespread.  Yellow and white waterlilies were the most common floating leaf species.  The emergent plant community was diverse.  Hardstem bulrush and arrowhead (Sagittaria spp) were the most widespread emergent species and occurred around much of the lake.  Thirteen terrestrial species were found on the shoreline with sedges being the most widespread. <br> \n <br> \nMoose Lake supports a relatively diverse fish community, providing angling opportunities for several species.  Yellow perch were the most common fish captured in gill nets.  The yellow perch catch was high when compared to similar lakes.  Yellow perch have historically been abundant in Moose Lake. The size structure was generally poor, however, as only 11% of individuals exceeded 8 inches in length.  Given the size structure and relative abundance, yellow perch appear to be a very important prey species in Moose Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in relatively high numbers in 2008.  The catch rate of 9.4/gill net was the second highest recorded for Moose Lake and was high compared to similar lakes.  Prior to 1996, Moose Lake produced walleye catches that were average for the type of lake.  Since 1996, catch rates have been relatively high.  In 2008, size structure was favorable for anglers as 44% exceeded 15 inches.  The largest fish sampled exceeded 24 inches.  Growth was near the statewide average and individuals exceeded 15 inches by age 5.  Few individuals (15%) exceeded age 5, suggesting high mortality of older, larger individuals.  Skewed age distributions are often the result of relatively high angler harvest of larger, older fish.  Given the abundance and size distribution, quality angling opportunities exist for this species. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in relatively high numbers as well.  Prior to 1981, Moose Lake produced pike with relatively low catches when compared to similar lakes.  Since 1981, the catches have been relatively high suggesting a trend of increased abundance.  In 2008, size structure was poor as few individuals reached quality size.  When pike occur at high densities, size is often poor, limiting angler interest.  Age analysis identified eight year-classes.  Growth was near the statewide average with individuals typically exceeding 21 inches by age 5.  Few individuals exceeded age-5, contributing to the poor size distribution.  Given the poor size and age structures, the popularity of the northern pike fishery may be limited.  Anglers are encouraged to release pike over 22 inches to improve the size and age distributions.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catches from Moose Lake have been relatively low in most assessments.  The current assessment resulted in a catch rate of 0.2/trap net and 0.6/gill net, indicating relatively low abundance compared to similar lakes.  Most individuals were large as length ranged from 8 to 12 inches.  Age analysis identified five year-classes and growth was near the statewide average with individuals exceeding 8 inches by age 4.   <br> \n <br> \nTest net sampling often inadequately samples largemouth bass.  Largemouth bass were sampled using night boat electrofishing in June.  Largemouth bass were captured in low numbers (2.3/hour on-time).  Natural reproduction appears to be good, however, as special electrofishing resulted in a 41.5 YOY largemouth bass per hour.  More data is needed to thoroughly evaluate the bass population of Moose Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNatural shoreline characteristics and good water quality are major attributes of Moose Lake. The protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches results in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. A complete description of shoreline best management practices can be found in \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" at the Grand Rapids Area Fisheries Office or online at www.mndnr.gov. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
