                "narrative": "<p>Bray Lake is located about 8 miles northwest of Nashwauk, MN and within the Mississippi River Watershed.  The 196 acre lake has 75 littoral acres, a maximum depth of 44 feet, and about 3.0 miles of shoreline.  There are two inlets, one unnamed and Bray Creek, and one outlet, Bray Creek, to Trestle Lake.  There is no public boat ramp on the lake.  Access can be gained through a carry-in access on the south end of the lake, located in shallow, densely vegetated bay.  The entire shoreline is privately owned and moderately developed.  Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Black Crappie are the primary management species, while Walleye are also present in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled a rate of 2.8/gill net, below the lake class first quartile (3.5/net) and similar to the last assessment (3.0/net).  A total of 11 pike were sampled in gill nets, while trap nets caught 14 at a rate of 1.6/net.  Size structure was moderately poor, with 27% (n=3) of the pike exceeding 24 inches.  Lengths ranged from 17.9 to 28.4 inches with a mean length of 22.2 inches.  Lengths in the trap net sample ranged from 13.8 to 22.1 inches with a mean length of 18.6 inches.  Scale and bone analysis identified ages 2 to 6 with growth similar to the statewide average.  Age 3 was the most numerous, comprising 45% of the sample, yet there was relatively consistent recruitment.  Northern Pike averaged 26.0 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 3.8/trap net, above the lake class third quartile (3.4/net) and the previous assessment at 2.6/trap net.  Catches have ranged from a low of 0.5/trap net in 1983 to the high observed in 2014.  Black Crappie catches in gill nets have been low, ranging from 1 to 7 fish.  A quality size structure exists with fish exceeding 12 inches (PSD-8=48, RSD-10=24, RSD-12=3).  Lengths ranged from 4.0 to 12.3 inches with a mean length of 7.7 inches.  Scale analysis identified eight age classes with ages 1-4 and 6-9 present in the sample.  Age 4 was the dominant age class, comprising 45% of the sample.  However, a wide range of ages indicates relative consistent recruitment.  Growth was slow early, but similar to the statewide average by age 5.  Black Crappie averaged 10.2 inches by age 7. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled Bluegill at a rate of 4.9/net, below the lake class first quartile and the previous assessment (7.9/net).  Catches are typically low, similar or less than the lake class first quartile.  Quality size structure is usually an attribute of low density populations.  Size structure was favorable (PSD-6=61, RSD-8=25, RSD-10=0) and similar to previous assessments.  Lengths ranged from 3.2 to 8.7 inches with a mean length of 6.5 inches.  Scale analysis identified ages 2 to 10 present in the sample with relatively consistent recruitment.  Back-calculated length-at-age determined growth was similar to Ecological Lake Class 31 average up to age 8.  Bluegill averaged eight inches by age-8. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye sampled at a rate of 0.3/net, below the lake class first quartile (1.3/net).  Past assessments indicate natural reproduction maintains the Walleye population.  Tullibee were sampled at a rate of 4.8/gill net, similar to the lake class third quartile (4.8/net) and up slightly from the previous assessment (3.5/net).  Bowfin were sampled at a rate of 1.7/trap net, exceeding the lake class third quartile.  Anecdotal reports from lakeshore owners suggest an abundant population. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

Considerable yearly variation in walleye reproductive success is apparent from the age distribution of this species in the test net catch.  This variation is probably reflected in the angler's catch of this species as a series of good and bad fishing years.Growth of all species checked is generally satisfactory.  Walleye and crappie sizes are small, but can be expected to increase as the dominant young age groups of these species increase in age and size.  Northern pike and bluegill sizes are satisfactory.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bray Lake is a 196 acre lake located nine miles northwest of Nashwauk, MN.  Small lakes are much more vulnerable to over-harvest than larger lakes and it can lead to poor quality fisheries.  There is no public access on the lake and no current lake management plan.The black crappie trap-net catch rate was the highest on record at 2.6 fish/net and was between the median than 3rd quartile for class 31 lakes.  Black crappie from the trap nets ranged from 4.3 to 11.4 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  Five year classes from age 2 to age 6 were represented in the sample.   Growth was a little slower than statewide growth rates.  It took a fish approximately five years to attain 10 inches in Bray Lake.  Despite the difficulty in sampling black crappie during the summer with our standard gears, it appears the population is in decent shape.  Bluegill trap-net catch rates (7.9 fish/net) were also the highest on record in this survey.  However, the trap-net catches have always been low for this lake type.  Bluegill ranged from 3.4 to 9.1 inches with an average length of 7.2 inches.  Nine year classes were observed from age 2 to age 10.  The 1995 year class represented 46% of the sample.  When compared to similar lakes, growth was average for the first four years and improved for the older ages.The northern pike net catch was the second highest ever recorded at 3.0 fish/net; however, catch rates have always been low when compared to other lakes similar to Bray.  Lakes with low northern populations generally have better size distributions, growth rates, and less of an affect on other species in the lake.  Fish ranged from 16.0 to 39.4 inches and averaged 23.1 inches.  Six year classes were identified by age analysis ranging from age 2 to age 9.  The population appears to be characterized by low but consistent reproduction.  After four years of growth northern pike averaged 24.5 inches which is above the statewide average of 20.5.  Good growth is likely due to the low abundance of predators and a quality prey base that includes tullibee.Other species observed during the lake survey included bowfin, black bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch.  These species were sampled in relatively low numbers and similar to historical catch rates.  The tullibee population has continued to be healthy for the last three assessments.  The species is likely a critical prey for the predators in the fish community.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural, forestry or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these can be areas of concern, lakeshore property owners may also contribute to water quality problems.  Some examples include putting in sand beaches, removing shoreline trees and vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Proper land use practices by everyone will help insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations. </p>",
