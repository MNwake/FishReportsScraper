                "narrative": "<p>West Rush Lake is the deeper (maximum depth = 42 feet) one of twodistinctly different basins that make up Rush Lake.  Management of the fishery is primarily for walleye and muskellunge and secondly for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill and northern pike.During the winter of 1995/1996 and the summer of 1996, an angler survey (creel survey) was conducted on West Rush Lake (MN DNR 1998).  A creel survey is a type of survey that counts the number of anglers along with their catch and time spent fishing to estimate the fishing pressure on a lake and the total harvest of fish.  Total fishing pressure during the 1995/1996 winter (December 1 - March 31) creel survey was 41,969 angler hours (28.7 angler hours/acre).  Total pounds of all fish species harvested was calculated at 26,102 pounds (17.8 lbs./acre).  The 1996 open water season (May 1 - September 30) had a total of 75,814 angler hours (51.8 angler hours/acre), while the total pounds harvested of all species combined was determined to be 15,913 pounds (10.9 lbs./acre).  Walleye followed by sunfish and crappie were the most frequently sought after species during the open water season survey of 1996.     Fish stocking dates back to the early 1900's, which consisted of sporadic stocking of such species as northern pike, largemouth bass, crappie, sunfish, walleye, and muskellunge.  Annual walleye fingerling stocking began in 1978 and extended to 1993 with the exception of 1976, 1985, and 1988.  In 1993, the lake management plan was amended to include alternate year walleye fingerling stocking, since allowing gaps in stocking frequency is necessary to evaluate natural reproduction success.  Muskellunge fingerling or yearling stocking began in 1968 with the Shoepac strain and continued through 1982.  From 1983-1985, the Wisconsin strain were stocked and all subsequent stocking (1989 to present) consisted of the Leech Lake strain.  A few gaps occurred during the above years, but annual stocking is now in place.A population assessment was conducted on West Rush Lake during the week of August 18, 1997 to assess the fish population status.  Standard sampling gear utilized during the survey included twelve gillnets, nine trapnets, night electrofishing (May 28, 1997) and shoreline seining (September 17, 1997).Walleye numbers have slightly decreased since 1992, but were considered to be within the normal range for this type of lake.  The average size, at 3.2 pounds, was found to exceed the normal range.  Lengths ranged from 9.3 to 27.0 inches with an average length 19.4 inches.  Of the 25 walleye measured, 68% were fifteen inches or greater in length.  West Rush Lake walleye showed above average growth when compared to statewide averages.  Age determination from scale samples indicate that fish ages ranged from 1-3 and 5-8 years old.  During the 1997 survey, walleye (3 fish) from non-stocked years were present.  Previous surveys also reported the presence of walleye during non-stocked years.  Hence, the walleye population in West Rush Lake is composed of both stocked and natural fish, which remains consistent with earlier evaluations of the fishery.  Further information will be necessary to assess the contribution of natural fish to the population.Historically northern pike have been below average in abundance and above average in size.  This again was the case in 1997 although their catch was the second highest recorded since 1957 (average weight 4.4 lbs).  Total lengths ranged from 20.0 to 31.2 inches with an average length of 26.7 inches.  Of the 29 fish measured 72% were 25 inches or greater in length.  Northern pike in West Rush Lake showed above average growth for ages 1-4, while normal growth prevailed thereafter.Largemouth bass numbers appear to be moderately low.  The average weight was 1.7 pounds, while lengths ranged between 8.2 and 20.8 inches with an average length of 13.3 inches.Bluegill numbers were below normal for this type of lake, however, the abundance has increased since 1992.  Lengths ranged from 3.1 to 7.4 inches and the average length was determined to be 5.3 inches.The black crappie abundance exceeded the normal level when compared to lakes similar in type, while the average weight (0.3 lbs.) during the 1997 survey was within the normal range.  Sizes ranged from 4.0 to 9.5 inches in length and an average length of 7.7 inches was calculated.Yellow perch numbers were above average, while the average weight (0.2 lbs.) was within the normal range.  The yellow perch collected ranged from 2.6 to 9.2 inches in length with an average length of 6.9 inches.In addition to the above species, twelve other species were also collected during the 1997 assessment (common carp, freshwater drum, golden shiner, white sucker, pumpkinseed, hybrid, and green sunfish, black, brown, and yellow bullhead, Johnny darter and tadpole madtom).  Of these species, the common carp, freshwater drum, golden shiner and pumpkinseed sunfish catch were within the normal abundance range, while white sucker, black, brown and yellow bullhead abundance were below normal for this lake type.  Freshwater drum abundance has been decreasing since 1988 and continues to decline.Shoreline seining for young-of-the-year fish showed that natural reproduction for bluegill was very successful in 1997 and some success was found for largemouth bass.Prepared by Audrey Posterick, Fisheries Specialist                         REFERENCESMinnesota Department of Natural Resources. 1998. 1837 Ceded Territory Lake Investigations: Creel surveys of lakes during winter season 1995-96 and summer 1996.

                "narrative": "<p>West Rush Lake is managed primarily for walleye, muskellunge, and northern pike, with black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass as the secondary species. West Rush is in lake class 25, which includes typically deep, fertile lakes. In order to assess population goals and the current stocking protocol, a population assessment was conducted in March and April 2012 for muskellunge using large trap nets and in August with gill nets for other species. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 1.6 per lift with and average weight of 4.5 pounds as compared to 1.3 per lift with an average weight of 3.7 pounds in 2007.  The 2012 catch was identical to the long term average (1.6 fish per net) for West Rush Lake  A 24-36 inch protected slot regulation is in place for northern pike on West Rush Lake. Data from the spring trap net assessment showed an increase in abundance of northern pike sampled within the protected slot with pike in the upper half of the protected slot showing the greatest increase in abundance.  That suggests that the regulation has been successfully protecting pike within the slot. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch was 0.3 per gillnet, which is lower than the long term average (1.9 fish per net) for West Rush Lake, and below the normal range for lake class 25.  The mean length of walleye was 15.1 inches with a mean weight of 1.4 pounds.  The very low catch of walleye during the summer gillnet sampling does not match up with the spring assessment trap net sampling where 167 walleye were caught and most of them were sexually mature fish caught during spawning activity.  Over the past 10 years anglers report having fair success fishing walleye in both summer and winter months; the low walleye gillnet catches observed in that period have not matched up with angling success.  The Rush Lakes have a long history of various walleye stocking strategies and experiments.  Walleye fry, frylings and fingerlings have all been stocked over the years with variable success.  Walleye fingerling stocking was done on an alternate year basis at 1 lb per littoral area for many years (statewide recommendation at that time) and then increased to 2 lbs per littoral acre on a biannual basis in 2006 (new statewide recommendation up to 1 lb per year).   In 2010 the stocking plan was changed to annual fingerling stocking at 1 lb per littoral acre to increase the chances of matching a stocked year with an abundant perch young of year.  Planned gaps in stocking (alternate year stocking) have documented that the walleye population is maintained by stocking with little to no contribution by natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, primary forage for both northern pike and walleye, have historically been high in abundance. The 2012 catch was no exception; it was the second highest catch ever at 90.8 per net as compared to 55.8 per net in 2007. Most of the perch were between 7.0 and 7.9 inches, with a range up to 9.9 inches.  The high number of perch should provide ample forage for game fish, while there are enough larger sized perch to provide some angler harvest. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 black crappie catch was the highest ever with a total of 47.9 per gillnet as compared to 28.0 per gillnet in 2007. The catch greatly exceeded the normal range for lake class 25.  Sampled black crappie ranged in size from 4.4 to 8.9 inches with most fish from 5.0 to 5.9 inches in length.  In addition to the fish caught in gill nets, a subsample of 69 black crappies was measured from trap nets in the spring. The average size of these fish was 7.7 inches with a length range of 5.3 to 9.3 inches. Twenty percent of these fish were 9.0 inches and longer.   <br> \n <br> \nThere were a total of 52 bluegill caught in gillnets.  Size range was 4.3 to 7.4 inches, with an average of 5.7 inches. A subsample of bluegill was measured from the spring trap nets.  Sizes for those bluegill ranged from 3.6 to 8.9 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches.  A creel survey conducted in the summer of 2012 showed that anglers caught and harvested good numbers of bluegill; the average size harvested was 7.4 inches. <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing in late spring. The total catch was 45 fish for a catch rate of 20.5 per hour.  Mean length was 10.9 inches with a length range of 4.0 to 19.1 inches and an average weight of one pound.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were targeted with trap nets from March 26 to April 27 2012.  A total of 59 fish were caught including eight recaptures.  There were 28 males, 21 females, and two of unknown sex caught. Total average length was 42.1 inches, with a length range from 12.9 to 52.4 inches. The proportion of adult muskies over 40 inches has been increasing, and more legal size fish (48 inches and above) were seen as well compared with previous assessments. There were muskies from year classes 1998 through 2007, 2009, and 2011 in the sample. Most of these year classes correspond to years that fish were stocked. <br> \n <br> \nOther species caught included bigmouth buffalo, bowfin, common carp, freshwater drum, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the fishing on West Rush Lake for many species should be quite good.  There are good numbers of yellow perch, black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike. Currently the muskellunge and walleye populations appear relatively low but anglers report fair seasonal success for them.  A large percentage of the muskellunge population is over 40 inches and fish over 50 inches are regularly seen in assessment netting so the possibility of a trophy is there.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Rush Lake is a 1,464-acre lake located in Chisago County. The lake is managed primarily for Walleye, Muskellunge, and Northern Pike, with Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass as secondary management species. In order to assess the current status of the fish community, a population assessment was conducted in August of 2021 with gill nets and trap nets. Night electrofishing was conducted on June 1 for Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch was 2.1 per net as compared to 0.4 per net in the previous survey in 2016. The 2021 catch was also above the long-term average of 1.53 pike per gill net. The catch was tied for the highest gill net catch by number to 1997 with 25 caught. Sampled Northern Pike (gill net and trap net combined) ranged from 17.5 to 37.9 inches in 2021. The mean length for the combined sample was 28.9 inches. The current Northern Pike special regulation (26 to 40 inch protected slot, 3 fish bag limit, only one can be over 40 inches) appears to have increased the number of fish over 30 inches in the lake (41% of the fish in the 2021 sample were 30 inches or larger), although fish over 40 inches are likely rare, as none have been captured in sampling gear to this point.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill net catch was 1.0 per net, double the 2016 catch rate of 0.5 per net, but below the long-term average of 1.7 per net. Sampled Walleye (gill net and trap net combined) ranged from 13.6 to 26.4 inches, with a mean length of 20.5 inches. Currently the Walleye population is below long-term averages based on gill net catches, but the average size of fish is larger. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, primary forage for both Northern Pike and Walleye, have historically been high in abundance and the 2021 catch was no exception. It was the fifth highest gill net catch ever with a total catch of 73.8 per net as compared to 74.8 per net in 2016. Most of the fish were between 7.0 and 7.5 inches. The average length for Yellow Perch was 7.4 inches with a range from 5.3 to 10.9 inches. The high number of perch should provide ample forage for game fish, and 22% of the Yellow Perch were 8 inches and larger, so there are also some that anglers can target as well.  <br> \n <br> \nGill net catch of Black Crappie in 2021 indicated high abundance. The 2021 catch was the fifth highest catch historically, both in rate and number, at 285 fish for a catch rate of 23.8 fish per set. This was above the long-term average of 18.2 per set. Sampled Black Crappie (from both trap nets and gill nets) ranged in size from 4.1 to 10.8 inches with most fish from 5.0 to 5.9 inches in length. Gill net mean length was 6.5 inches and trap net mean length was 8.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 Bluegill catch rate was 11.3 fish per trap net, slightly below the long-term average catch rate for Bluegill. Bluegill were also caught in gill nets. Size range for trap nets was 2.8 to 8.7 inches, with an average of 5.6 inches. 34 percent of the catch were 7 inches or greater in length. Size range for gill nets was 4.1 to 8.4 inches, with an average of 7.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch rate of 38.1 per hour was the highest since electrofishing first began in 1997. Mean length was 11.5 inches with a length range of 3.9 to 17.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the fishing on West Rush Lake for many species should be quite good. There are good numbers of Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike based on 2021 sampling with gill nets, trap nets, and electrofishing. Currently the Walleye population appears to be lower than the long term average but above the previous survey in 2016. A large percentage of the Northern Pike population is currently a nice size (30 inches and over). Muskellunge are sampled independently and on a 5- to 6- year frequency. <br> \n</p>",

Eighteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by electrofishing, and/or seining.  Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish; Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Green Sunfish, Fathead Minnow, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Banded Killifish, Bowfin, Central Mudminnow, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from the August 2016 lake survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for West Rush Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. West Rush Lake is located in the Lower St. Croix River Watershed.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  Rush Lake is characterized by two distinct basins which comprise approximately 2,832 surface acres.  In August 1988 a population assessment was conducted on West Rush Lake (1,464 acres).  Twelve gillnets and eight trapnets were set along with shoreline seining efforts.\n  Based on respective local medians the present fish population is as follows:  The northern pike (2.00/set) net catch has shown a real increase from the net catch of the previous survey in 1985 (0.83/set).  Although there was an increase, the net catch was still below the local median catch (3.88/set).  As recorded in previous surveys, the net catch has never been above the local median catch in West Rush Lake.  In 1988 the length frequency distribution ranged from 21.0 to 37.9 inches with a median length group of 25.0 - 25.9 inches.  This is up from the 1985 survey, where the median length group was 23.0 - 23.9 inches and 24.0 - 24.9 inches in 1982.  The mean weight was 3.94 pounds as compared to 3.38 pounds in 1985 and 3.26 pounds in 1982.  It appears through back-calculated lengths, that the younger year-classes (I-III) were expressing fast growth and then after ages IV+, the fish grew at rates similar to normal.  Of the twenty-three northern pike aged, 70% were of ages III-IV.\n  The walleye (3.83/set) net catch has also shown a real increase from the previous survey catch (1.92/set).  This was the first net catch above the local median net catch (3.52/set) since the 1957 survey (7.89/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 9.0 to 24.9 inches with a median length group of 14.0 - 14.9 inches.  Of the forty-eight walleyes aged, 54% were of age II and 35% were of ages III-V.  This high percentage of younger fish captured explains why the median length group appears to be relatively small.  Two walleyes were aged at XIII and XIV.  In past survey to survey test nettings, the walleye median length group has fluctuated.  When net catches were fewer, the median lengths were around 21 inches and when net catches showed increases, the median lengths were around 15 inches.  Mean weight changes correspond with the median length fluctuations.  Mean weight was 1.52 pounds in 1988, 2.82 pounds in 1985, 1.02 pounds in 1982, 2.82 pounds in 1977, and 2.90 pounds in 1972.  All in all, the population reflects the stocking record with a minimal contribution of natural reproduction.\n  Yellow perch (42.00/set) net catches showed a real increase from 1985 (24.17/set) and were above the local median catch (24.27/set).  Four of the last five surveys, including 1988, the median length group was 6.0 - 6.4 inches.  In these five surveys, population numbers have shown real increases and decreases but have always retained net catches higher than, or similar to, the local median catch.\n  Two muskellunges were captured by test nets, one in the gillnets (0.08/set) and one in the trapnets (0.12/set).  They were both of the 1983 (Wisconsin-strain) year-class with a median length group of 30.0 - 30.9 inches and a mean weight of 6.40 pounds.\n  The largemouth bass had test net catches below the local medians but shoreline seining efforts indicated successful natural reproduction of various year-classes.\n  Bluegill sunfish (15.88/set) net catches were up from the previous survey (1.83/set) but have historically been below the local median catch (25.67/set).  The median length group was 6.0 - 6.4 inches with a length frequency distribution of 3.0 to 8.9 inches.\n  The white crappie (4.00/set) trapnet catch was similar to the local median (4.08/set) and up from the previous survey (0.17/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 6.0 to 10.9 inches for the 32 fish captured.  The gillnet catch of 360 fish (30.00/set) ranged from 4.5 to 8.4 inches.\n  The black crappie (11.12/set) trapnet catch was up from the previous survey (0.50/set) but was below the local median catch (18.45/set).  Trapnet catches for all of the previous surveys were below the local median catch.  The length frequency distribution for the 89 black crappies captured in trapnets was 5.0 to 9.4 inches and 4.0 to 7.9 inches for the 365 black crappies caught by gillnets.  The gillnet catch (30.42/set) was above the local median catch (11.49/set) with the majority of the fish measuring 6.5 - 7.4 inches.\n  In 1975 a dam/dike washout occurred on a section of Rush Creek in the town of Rush City.  After that period, the introduction of freshwater drum \"unofficially\" was reported in Rush Lake.  The first occurrence in test nets, for West Rush Lake, was in the 1982 survey.  An upward trend in abundance appears to have taken place since that time.  Gillnet catches (30.08/set) in 1988 were above the local median (6.16/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 7.0 to 15.9 inches with a median length group of 12.0 - 12.9 inches.  When comparing historical net catch summaries, the abundance of this competitor does not appear to have an impact on other species at this time.\n  Carp (2.25/set) gillnet catches have increased since the previous survey (0.83/set) and were above the local median catch (0.35/set).  The median length group was 12.0 - 12.9 inches.  Trapnet catches (1.25/set) were up from the previous survey (1.17/set) but below the local median catch (1.74/set).  The median length group was 25.0 - 25.9 inches.\n  Seven other species taken by test nets (bowfin, golden shiner, common shiner, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, and pumpkinseed sunfish) were not significantly above or below the previous survey or local median catches.  The bullhead species caught were of a respectable 12 to 14 inches.  Green sunfish were present in the shoreline seine hauls.\n  In general, a comparison of 1988 to 1985 net catch rates (using net selective gear) show this: of the seventeen fish species caught in 1988, thirteen experienced an increase, two a decrease, and two were not comparable.  The overall abundance of fish, in terms of net catch, was up.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Rush is a 1,464 acre lake managed for walleyes, northern pike, and muskellunge.  West Rush is assigned to lake class 25.  Lakes in class 25 are typically deep, fertile lakes.  Muskie and walleye populations are maintained through stocking, although walleye natural reproduction is common.  Biannual fall fingerling stocking is conducted for both species but in alternate years.  Additionally, walleye fry will be stocked annually through the spring of 2005.  The long range population goals for walleyes and northerns, as indexed by test netting, are 5 and 2 per gillnet lift respectively with a 4 pound mean weight for northerns.  Muskellunge are indexed in seperate spring trapnetting assessments.  In order to assess population goals and current stocking protocal, West Rush Lake was surveyed in August of 2002. The northern pike gillnet catch was 2.0 per lift with an average weight of 4.2 pounds.  The 2002 catch was very similar to the management goal and nearly identical to the 1997 catch in both numbers and size.  Sampled northerns ranged from 16.9 to 33.7 inches with a mean length of 26.4 inches.  The pike population was mature with seventy four percent of the sample between 6 and 8 years old.   Walleye were sampled at rate of 2.8 per gillnet which is near the 50th percentile when compared to other lakes in class 25.  Although the walleye catch didn't meet the management goal, they were quality sized averaging 2.5 pounds and 18.6 inches.  The 1997 catch consisted of larger fish but the catch rate was only 2 per net.  The walleye catch rate has not exceeded 4.0 since the 1957 netting.  The 1997 year class was dominant although it was not a stocking year.  Night electrofishing in September sampled walleye hatched in 2002.  These fish could have been attributed to either fry stocking or natural reproduction.Yellow perch are a primary forage for both northerns and walleyes.  Their abundance in West Rush has historically been high.  The 2002 sample was no exception, with a catch rate of 31.4 per gillnet.  Perch abundance was higher than in most class 25 lakes.  The mean size was also above normal for the lake class averaging 7.5 inches.  A nearly even distribution of perch between the 5 and 9.5 inch groups should provide both angling opportunity and a forage base for various sized gamefish.  Most sampled perch were between 2 and 4 years old.Black crappie numbers were high based on the gillnet catch (25.7/net) but the trapnet catch (2.5/net) was normal.  Mean crappie size was low for the lake class in both gear types.  However, 20 % of the combined catch was greater than 8 inches, an acceptable size to some anglers.  Two thirds of the crappie sample were yearlings from the the 2001 year class.  While these young fish exhibited good growth, their high abundance attributed to the small average size of sampled crappies.Bluegill were normal in both numbers (11.5/trapnet) and average size (1/4 pound) relative to the lake class.  In the 1997 netting bluegill were less abundant and smaller.  Sampled bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 9.0 inches with 38% of the catch greater than 7 inches.  Strong 1998 and 1999 year classes were evident.Largemouth bass abundance was first indexed in 1997 using night electrofishing.  Bass abundance was moderate with a catch rate of 33.5 per hour of sampling, an increase from 18.1 per hour in 1997.  Bass size was respectable with averages of 12.3 inches and a pound and a half.  A quality fishery was present with individuals approaching 20 inches.  Bass ages were evenly distributed between 3 and 6 years. Shoreline seining sampled young of the year black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.  Other species sampled during the survey included bigmouth buffalo, common carp, emerald shiner, freshwater drum, golden shiner, green sunfish, muskellunge, Johnny darter, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead.   </p>",

WEST RUSH LAKE (1,464 ACRES), IS ECOLOGICALLY CLASSIFIED AS A CEN-WAE LAKE AND MANAGED (BY DNR) AS A WAE-CEN LAKE.  MOST RECENT FISH STOCKING PLANS INVOLVED WAE AND MUE (LLB) FINGERLING STOCKING EVERY YEAR.  ON AUGUST 17, 1992, A LAKE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED ON WEST RUSH LAKE.  TWELVE GILLNET AND SIX TRAPNET SETS ALONG WITH THREE SHORELINE SEINE HAULS WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE STATUS OF THE PRESENT FISH POPULATION.  THE FISH CAPTURED BY THESE METHODS WERE COMPARED AGAINST NET CATCHES IN PREVIOUS LAKE SURVEYS ON WEST RUSH, AND TO EXPECTED NET CATCHES TO LAKES OF THE SAME CLASSIFICATION STATEWIDE (LAKE CLASS 32).  THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE CATCH COMPARISONS AND OTHER DATA RELATING TO INDIVIDUAL FISH SPECIES.  THE NOP NET CATCH (1.67/SET) WAS LOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS SURVEY CATCH (2.00/SET) IN 1988 AND FELL BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE (1.75/ SET).  THE 1992 CATCH (20 FISH) RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 22.0 TO 36.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 26.0-26.9 INCHES.  THE MEAN WEIGHT OF THESE FISH WAS 4.34 POUNDS WHICH INDICATED FISH TO BE HEAVIER THAN AVERAGE WEIGHTS OF NOP IN THIS LAKE CLASS (3RD QUARTILE=3.29 POUNDS).  IN PAST SURVEYS, SAMPLED NOP WERE ALSO ON THE LARGER SIDE OF NORMAL.  AGE DETERMINATION FOUND THESE FISH TO BE 1, 3-7, AND 9 YEARS OLD.  AGE 4 MADE UP 57% OF THE SAMPLE.  BACK-CALCULATED LENGTH ANALYSIS INDICATED THESE NOP TO HAVE GROWTH RATES (LENGTH) TYPICAL OF STATEWIDE AVERAGE GROWTH RATES.  THE WAE NET CATCH (2.33/SET) SHOWED A REAL DECREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY CATCH (3.83/SET) BUT FALLS WITHIN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTILE RANGE (1.00/SET TO 4.00/SET), INDICATING THAT THE WAE POPULATION IS STATISTICALLY NORMAL.  THE LENGTHS RANGED FROM 7.5 TO 27.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 10.5-10.9 INCHES.  THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 2.21 POUNDS.  SEVERAL LARGER FISH IN THE CATCH HELPED INCREASE THE MEAN WEIGHT.  BACK- CALCULATED AGE DATA FROM SCALES, SPINES, AND OPERCULA DETERMINED THAT AGES 1 THROUGH 9 WERE REPRESENTED (EXCEPT AGES 4 AND 8).  THESE FISH EXPRESSED GROWTH RATES SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN TYPICAL GROWTH RATES FOR WAE IN THIS LAKE CLASS. AGE 2 FISH MADE UP 34% OF THE SAMPLE WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP WAS SMALL. RECENT NON-STOCKING YEARS WERE 1985 AND 1988, AGE 7 AND AGE 4, RESPECTIVELY.  AGE 7 FISH MADE UP 14% OF ALL WAE SAMPLED WHILE AGE 4 WERE NOT REPRESENTED AT ALL.  THE PRESENT WAE POPULATION IN WEST RUSH LAKE IS COMPOSED OF STOCKED AND NATURAL FISH.  RECENT AND PAST SURVEY DATA DEFINITELY SHOWS THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION WITHIN THE LAKE AND SOME INLETS HAS MADE NOTABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WAE POPULATION.  IN FACT, THE 1957 SURVEY (HIGHEST WAE CATCH IN 7 SURVEYS) FOUND 65% OF THE WAE CAPTURED TO BE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. THIS HAPPENED AT A TIME WHEN THE LAKE WAS VERY MUCH LIKE IT IS TODAY (CHEMICALLY AND BILOGICALLY) WATER CHEMISTRY DATA FROM THE 1948 AND 1957 SURVEYS INDICATED THAT WEST RUSH LAKE WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE 1992 DATA.  SECCHI DISC READINGS WERE 4.25' THEN AND 5.5' IN 1992.  CHRONIC ALGAE BLOOMS HAVE BEEN OCCURRING IN THE LAKE FOR DECADES.   HISTORICALLY, THE OVERALL FISH POPULATION WAS MUCH LIKE TODAYS POPULATION, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FRD (NOW PRESENT).  IN ALL OF THE 7 SURVEYS ON WEST RUSH LAKE, AGING DETECTED SEVERAL WAE FROM NON-STOCKING YEARS, I.E. SUCCESSFUL WAE NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  PUTTING ALL THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE, WEST RUSH LAKE OBVIOUSLY HAS A VIABLE NATURAL WAE POPULATION ON ITS OWN. JUST THAT THE NUMBERS TEND TO BE ON THE LOW SIDE OF THE MEDIAN FOR THIS LAKE CLASS.  THE ADDITIONAL STOCKING THROUGH THE YEARS (ESPECIALLY THE INTENSITY SINCE 1972) HAS NOT MADE THE WAE ABUNDANCE CLIMB TO HIGH LEVELS.  MOST LITERATURE FINDS THAT STOCKING ON TOP OF A NATURAL POPULATION OFTEN SHOWS A NEGATIVE RESPONSE BY THE STOCKED FISH.  GENETIC INTEGRITY, COMPETITION, AND NATURAL MORTALITY PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES TO WHO WILL SURVIVE.  IN MOST CASES THE NATURAL POPULATION WILL PREVAIL.  ALTHOUGH WEST RUSH LAKE SEEMS TO BE A LARGE LAKE.  IT IS RELATIVELY SMALL WHEN COMPARED TO THE LARGE NATURAL WAE LAKES LIKE MILLE LACS, LEECH, ETC.  ONE THING SMALL NATURAL WAE LAKES HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF WAE CAN VARY GREATLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR. AS A RESULT, SOME YEAR CLASSES MAY CARRY POOR REPRESENTATION.  THIS IS WHY SUPPLEMENTAL STOCKING CAN SOMETIMES PROVIDE MORE WAE ON A GIVEN YEAR WHEN THE NATURAL HATCH WAS POOR.  HOWEVER, DETERMINING WHETHER A LAKE HAD A GOOD HATCH OR NOT CAN AT TIMES BE DIFFICULT AND TIMELY.  THE ANNUALLY STOCKING THAT WEST RUSH LAKE RECEIVES TODAY NEEDS A CLOSER LOOK.  THE COST:  BENEFIT RATIO IS ONE ITEM OF CONCERN SINCE IT APPEARS THAT THE ANNUAL STOCKING PROGRAM DID NOT GREATLY IMPROVE THE RELATIVE WAE ABUNDANCE.  THEREFORE, SUPPLEMENTAL STOCKING ON AN ALTERNATE YEAR BASIS OR WHEN POOR YEAR CLASSES EXIST WOULD BE MORE PRACTICAL AND WOULD HELP MAINTAIN THE NORMAL POPULATION LEVEL.  AN ADDITIONAL POINT TO CONSIDER IS THAT WEST RUSH LAKE IS A HYPEREUTROPHIC LAKE MADE UP OF MANY OTHER SPECIES WHICH COMPETE WITH THE WAE POPULATION.  SINCE IT IS ECOLOGICALLY CLASSIFIED AS A CEN-WAE LAKE, IT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD THAT STOCKED OR NOT, THE WAE WILL USUALLY CARRY POPULATION LEVELS TO THAT WHICH IS NORMAL FOR THIS LAKE OR SLIGHTLY BELOW.  WAE ARE PROBABLY THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER FISH IN THIS LAKE. HOWEVER, THE GENERAL ANGLER ATTITUDE TAKES A MORE FLEXIBLE APPROACH WHEN CONSIDERING THAT THE CONSISTENCY OF CRAPPIE FISHING OFFERED IN THIS LAKE USUALLY PRODUCES MORE FISH IN THE CREEL. THE MUE GILLNET CATCH (0.25/SET) WAS UP FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY CATCH (0.08/SET) BUT BELOW THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN CATCH (0.42/SET).  THE 3 FISH CAPTURED WERE 22.4, 24.7, AND 31.7 INCHES.  THE TWO SMALLER FISH WERE 3 YEAR OLDS AND IDENTIFIED AS LEECH LAKE STRAIN MUSKIES STOCKED IN 1989. THE OTHER MUSKIE WAS A 7 YEAR OLD WISCONSIN STRAIN FISH STOCKED IN 1985.  THE BLG TRAPNET CATCH (0.83/SET) WAS BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE (6.37/SET) IN SOME OF THE SURVEYS DATING BACK TO 1957, BLG TRAPNET CATCHES WERE LOW.  ONE ISSUE THAT STANDS TO REASON IS THAT WEST RUSH LAKE IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO FAVORABLE TRAPNETTING.  SHOAL WATER CONDITIONS ARE SUCH THAT NET LEADS ARE USUALLY SET SEVERAL FEET OUT FROM SHORE.  LACK OF VEGETATION NEAR SOME TRAPNET SITES ALSO LOWERS CATCH RATES. BECAUSE THIS HAS HINDERED SUMMER TRAPNETTING IN SOME OF THE SURVEYS, BLG ABUNDANCE MOST DEFINITELY WAS UNDERESTIMATED.  CONTRARY TO LOW TRAPNET CATCH, THE GILLNET CATCH (4.58/SET) WAS THE HIGHEST ON RECORD.  THIS CATCH FELL WITHIN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTILE RANGE (2.71-12.68/SET). THE BLG SAMPLED IN 1992 RANGED FROM 4.0 TO 7.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 6.5-6.9 INCHES.  AGES 2 TO 6 WERE PRESENT IN THE SAMPLE AND THEY EXPRESSES GROWTH RATES TYPICAL OF STATEWIDE AVERAGES.  SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS RECORDED ONLY 106 YOY. FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT TRAPNET CATCHES WERE LOW, THE CRAPPIE POPULATION WAS ASSESSED MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH THE GILLNET CATCHES.  THE BLC GILLNET CATCH (9.58/SET) WAS ABOVE THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN CATCH (5.14/SET) AND WAS THE HIGHEST CATCH RECORDED IN THE 7 SURVEYS DATING BACK TO 1957.  THE FISH CAPTURED RANGED FROM 5.0 TO 9.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 8.0-8.4 INCHES.  THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.31 POUNDS.  AGE DETERMINATION FOUND FISH TO BE FROM 1 TO 6 YEARS OLD IN THE SAMPLE WITH BACK- CALCULATED LENGTHS INDICATING GROWTH RATES TYPICAL OF STATEWIDE AVERAGE GROWTH RATES. SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS RECORDED 21 YOY.  THE WHC GILLNET CATC (10.17/SET) WAS DOWN FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY CATCH (30.00/SET) BUT REMAINS ABOVE THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN CATCH (6.34/SET). THE FISH CAPTURED RANGED FROM 4.5 TO 10.4 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 8.5-8.9 INCHES. THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.29 POUNDS.  AGE DETERMINATION FOUND FISH TO BE FROM 1 TO 6 YEARS OLD IN THE SAMPLE WITH BACK-CALCULATED LENGTHS INDICATING GROWTH RATES TYPICAL OF STATEWIDE AVERAGE GROWTH RATES.  SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS DID NOT RECORD ANY YOY.  SIMILAR TO THE LOW BLG NETTING, THE LMB WERE NOT SAMPLED VERY WELL.  THIS FACTOR ALONG WITH THE PHENOMENON OF BASS BEING  STATUS OF THE POPULATION.  THE 3 FISH THAT WERE CAUGHT WERE 1 YEAR OLDS MEASURING IN THE 4.5-5.4 INCH GROUP.  SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS RECORDED 12 YOY.  IN FUTURE SURVEYS, NIGHT ELECTROFISHING WILL BE NEEDED TO EVALUATE THE LMB POPULATION. THE YEP CATCH (61.61/SET) SHOWED A REAL INCREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY CATCH (42.00/SET) AND WAS ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE (31.75/SET) INDICATING A HIGH POPULATION.  PERCH HAVE HISTORICALLY CARRIED NORMAL TO HIGH POPULATIONS IN WEST RUSH LAKE.  THE FISH CAPTURED RANGED FROM 5.0 TO 9.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 7.0-7.4 INCHES.  THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.20 POUNDS. AGE CLASSES SAMPLED WERE 1 TO 7 YEARS OLD. SHORELINE SEINING RECORDED ONLY 6 YOY.  THE CARP GILLNET CATCH (0.90/SET) WENT DOWN FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY (2.25/SET).  ONE REASON FOR THE HIGHER CATCH LAST SURVEY WAS BECAUSE THE 12.0 INCH AVERAGE CARP (95% OF THE CATCH) WERE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE 2 INCH BAR MESH OF THE STANDARD GILLNETS.  THIS SURVEY AND ALL OTHER PAST SURVEYS DID NOT EXPERIENCE SUCH A SELECTIVE CATCH AS IN 1988.  THE 1992 GILLNET CATCH SAMPLED CARP FROM 21.0 TO 30.9 INCHES.  THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 10.18 POUNDS.  CARP TAKEN IN THE GILLNETS REPRESENTED 10% OF THE TOTAL FISH BIOMASS (BY WEIGHT) RECORDED BY GILLNETS FOR WEST RUSH LAKE.  THE FRD CATCH (11.75/SET) WENT DOWN FROM THE 1988 HIGH CATCH OF 30.08/SET AND FALLS JUST BELOW THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN CATCH (14.92/SET).  THE LENGTHS RANGED FROM 6.5 TO 14.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 12.0-12.9 INCHES.  THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.85 POUNDS.  SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS RECORDED 2 YOY. DURING A MARCH 1993 WINTER ROUGH FISH REMOVAL OPERATION, FIFTEEN (15) DRUM WERE COLLECTED FOR LENGTH AT AGE DETERMINATIONS.  THE SAMPLE RANGED FROM 13.1 TO 20.1 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 14.0-14.9 INCHES.  THE AGE RANGE WAS 6 TO 13 YEARS OLD WITH AGE 10 BEING THE MOST COMMON.  SEE THE ATTACHED GRAPHIC FIGURE FOR LENGTH AT AGE COMPARISON (OTOLITHS).  THIS SPECIES FIRST ENTERED THE LAKE IN 1975 FOLLOWING THE EVENT WHICH WASHED OUT THE DAM/DIKE BARRIER ON RUSH CREEK, IN RUSH CITY.  SINCE THEIR ARRIVAL, THE OBVIOUS FACTOR WHICH THE DRUM HAVE HAD ON RUSH LAKE IS THE AMOUNT OF SPACE OR BIOMASS THEY UTILIZE IN THE LAKE SYSTEM.  (20%) OF THE TOTAL FISH BIOMASS (BY WEIGHT) IN 1992 GILLNET CATCH WAS COMPOSED OF FRD.  USING GILLNET INDICES, DRUM AND CARP MADE UP ABOUT 30% OF THE TOTAL FISH BIOMASS IN WEST RUSH LAKE.  THIS WAS LOWER THAN THE CATCH IN EAST RUSH LAKE WHERE THERE THE COMBINED DRUM/CARP CATCH WAS 50% OF THE FISH BIOMASS. READ THE AFFECTING FISH AND FISHING THIS SURVEY, REGARDING THE ROUGH FISH POPULATION. FOUR OTHER SPECIES WERE SAMPLED BY TEST NETS (GOS, WTS, HSF, AND PMK).  THE GOS GILLNET CATCH (10.08/ SET) WAS ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE (3.00/SET) AND HIGHEST IN ALL SURVEYS.  THE WTS CATCH (0.75/SET) WAS TAKEN AT ITS USUAL LOW BUT DOES FALL WITHIN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTILE RANGE (0.67-3.40/SET) THE HSF AND PMK CATCHES WERE BELOW THEIR RESPECTIVE FIRST QUARTILES INDICATING LOW ABUNDANCE.  THE 1992 SURVEY DID NOT SAMPLE ANY BLHS IN THE GILLNET OR TRAPNET SETS BUT 2 ADULT YEB WERE SAMPLED IN THE SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Rush is a 1,464-acre lake managed for walleyes, northern pike, and muskellunge.  West Rush is assigned to lake class 25.  Lakes in class 25 are typically deep, fertile lakes.  Muskie and walleye populations are maintained through stocking, although walleye natural reproduction is common.  Biennial fall fingerling stocking is conducted for both species but in alternate years.  Additionally, walleye fry were stocked annually from the spring of 2000 through the spring of 2004.  The long-range population goals for walleyes and northerns, as indexed by test netting, are 5 and 2 per gillnet lift respectively with a 4 pound mean weight for northerns.  Muskellunge are indexed in a separate spring trapnetting assessments.  In order to assess population goals and current stocking protocol, a population assessment was conducted on West Rush Lake in August of 2007.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 1.3 per lift with an average weight of 3.7 pounds.  Although down only slightly from 2002, the catch fell below both the lake class norm and the management goal.  Sampled northerns ranged from 19.5 to 35.0 inches with a mean length of 25.2 inches.  During the spring muskellunge assessment, pike were sampled at a rate of 1.5 per large frame trapnet with a modal length similar to the gill net data.   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate, 0.7 per gillnet, fell below the norm for lake class 25 and below 1 for the first time.   Although the walleye catch didn't meet the management goal, they were quality sized averaging 2.8 pounds and 18.8 inches.  The 2002 catch consisted of similar sized fish but the rate was 2.8 per net.  The walleye gillnet catch rate has not exceeded 4.0 since the 1957 netting.  In 2007, trapnets captured more walleyes than the gillnets with catch rate (1.4/trapnet) that exceeded the 75th percentile.  Night electrofishing in October sampled one walleye hatched in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, a primary forage for both northern pike and walleyes, have historically been abundant in West Rush.  The 2007 sample was no exception, with a catch rate of 55.8 per gillnet, perch abundance was higher than in most class 25 lakes.  The mean size was also above normal for the lake class averaging 7.6 inches.  A nearly even distribution of perch between the 6 and 8-inch groups should provide both angling opportunity and a forage base for various sized gamefish.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were high based on both the gillnet (28.0/net) and the trapnet (4.3/net) catch.  Mean crappie size was near the 50th percentile for the lake class in both gear types.  Thirty five percent of the combined catch was greater than 8 inches, an acceptable size to some anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were normal in both numbers (7.4/trapnet) and average size (1/5 pound) relative to the lake class.  In the 2002 netting bluegill were slightly larger and more abundant.  Sampled bluegill ranged from 3.5 to 8.1 inches with 29% of the catch greater than 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance was first indexed in 1997 using night electrofishing.  In 2007, bass abundance was moderate with a catch rate of 34.2 per hour of sampling, very similar to the 2002 rate.  Bass size decreased compared to the 2002 data with an average of 10.3 inches and 0.8 pounds.  One hundred twenty eight largemouth were captured during the spring muskellunge trapnetting.  These bass had a modal length of 15.7 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Rush Lake is a 1,464 acre lake assigned to lake class 25. West Rush's fertility results in low water clarity with a Secchi depth reading of 2.9 feet. The primary management species in the lake are Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge. The Walleye and Muskellunge populations are currently maintained through annual stockings. The previous survey was conducted in 2012. Muskellunge are assessed in a separate survey during the spring. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate was 0.4 fish per gillnet. Pike catch rates have historically been low in West Rush, but this rate was significantly lower than the historic mean. With only five fish in the total sample, it is difficult to draw any definite conclusions. All pike sampled were larger fish averaging 30.3 inches long. They also appear to exhibit good growth. There is a slot limit in place on the Rush Lakes protecting Northern Pike between 26 and 40 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were also low at 0.5 fish per net, similar to the previous two surveys and well below the normal range for similar lakes. Prior to the 2007 survey, catch rates were consistently much closer to lake class norms. Similar to pike, it is difficult to develop any conclusions from analysis of a six fish sample. Walleye ranged in size from 9.8 to 25.8 inches in length, averaging 15.8 inches. Age analysis suggests that Walleye growth is relatively unremarkable. Anecdotal reports from anglers have indicated some success fishing for Walleye, which is not reflected by our netting.  <br> \n <br> \nA catch rate of 74.8 fish per gill net for Yellow Perch was high, well above the normal range for similar lakes. Catch rates have historically exceeded the normal range and this year's catch was at the upper end of the historic range. West Rush's Yellow Perch also have a better size structure than many similar lakes, averaging 0.2 lbs. Perch ranged from 4.8 to 10.7 inches in length and averaged 7.3. Numbers of fish drop dramatically after 8.5 inches, a size where the fish tend to become susceptible to angler harvest.  <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch rate for Black Crappies of 5.6 fish per net was the highest it has been in the last couple of decades, following an increasing trend and well above the normal range for similar lakes. The gill net catch was also very high at 11.8 fish per net, but not as high as the previous several surveys. Trap nets sampled a range of sizes from 4.7 to 10.2 inches long and averaged 7.9. Twenty-two percent of crappies were longer than 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catch of Bluegill was the highest in history with 24.9 fish per net. Bluegill catch has varied widely in historical sampling and this year's catch rate is within the normal range for similar lakes. Bluegills were well-distributed between 2.8 and 8.3 inches in length and averaged 6.2. Similar to the other panfish species in the lake, numbers of Bluegill dropped after reaching a size where they become desirable to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing sampled 11.3 Largemouth Bass per hour which was the lowest rate since electrofishing efforts began in 1997. Bass ranged from 6.6 to 16.2 inches in length and averaged 11.3. This low catch rate is not reflected in anecdotal reports from anglers. This is an observation that took place on other nearby lakes as well. A number of variables could be negatively affecting electrofishing catch rates such as aquatic vegetation density and variability in seasonal changes.    <br> \n <br> \nWhile Muskellunge are assessed during in independent spring survey, one 46.1 inch fish was sampled during summer trap netting. Other species sampled included Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Pumpkinseed, and Green Sunfish. <br> \n</p>",
