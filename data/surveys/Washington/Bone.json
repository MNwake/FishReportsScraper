                "narrative": "<p>Bone Lake is primarily managed for Walleye (WAE). Annual fingerling stocking at the rate of 1.0 pounds/littoral-acre (124.0 lbs) has occurred in all but one year since 1982.  The WAE population has been above median levels for abundance in the gill net sample since 1992. In 2006, the WAE gill net catch was the highest ever recorded for this lake and was 2.5 times the catch rate recorded for 2001. The average size of WAE sampled in 2006 was 14.45 inches and 1.35 pounds. Approximately 10 percent of all WAE captured measured 20.0 inches or longer. Northern Pike (NOP) were sampled below median levels for abundance and exhibited a significant decrease in gill net catch rate from 2001. The average size NOP captured was approximately 22.4 inches and 3.3 pounds. Some quality size NOP measuring over 30.0 inches in length are present, but made up a relatively low percentage of the overall catch for this species. Yellow Perch abundance was up significantly since the 2001 assessment. The average size of YEP sampled was 6.7 inches in length. Only 12.7 percent of all YEP sampled measured over 8.0 inches in length. Bluegill were sampled above median levels for abundance and mean weight. The average size of sampled BLG was 6.76 inches in length and 0.31 pounds. One-fourth of all BLG captured measured 8.0 inches in length or larger. Black Crappie exhibited a significant decrease in abundance in the sample from levels recorded in 2001. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bone Lake is a fertile, eutrophic basin located in a rural area of the city of Scandia, Minnesota.  It covers an area of 221 acres, of which 124 are littoral, with a maximum depth of 30 ft. The lake is listed as impaired for excess nutrients and unacceptable levels of biological indicators. The Comfort Lake-Forest Lake Watershed District installed fish barriers on the outlet and on the inlet from Moody Lake in the fall of 2012.  These structures, in conjunction with subsidized commercial fishing, are hoped to reduce the rough fish population to negligible levels. There is a public boat access at the northwest corner of the lake which is owned by Washington County but operated by DNR Parks and Trails.  There is undeveloped shoreline along the north shore owned by the City of Scandia which is popular with shore anglers. Walleye is the primary management species and fingerlings had been stocked in the lake at one pound/littoral acre since 1982. Walleye stocking success was assessed starting in 2017, and management plans have been adjusted. In 2017, the stocking rate was changed to 0.65lb/littoral acre annually. Subsequent surveys will monitor for any resulting change in the walleye population. The lake was surveyed using gill nets in June 2021. The previous survey was conducted in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 3.8 fish per net. This is the highest rate sampled since 2006. Fish size was slightly smaller than average with a mean length of 14.4 inches and a range of 9 to 27 inches. The majority of those fish were less than 20 inches long and the age distribution was dominated by 2 year old fish. This is not surprising, as the 2020 stocking was done with yearling fish that effectively doubled the relative number of fish in the 2019 \"year class.\" The oldest individual was aged at 12 years old indicating some persistence of year classes in the lake. The long range management goal of maintaining a catch rate in excess of 3 fish per net is being met.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at the highest rate in the lake's history at 5.8 fish per gill net. Despite this high catch rate, fish sizes were of sizes desirable to anglers, with a mean length of 27 inches. Fish ranged from 17.1 to 37.8 inches in length. Fish were well distributed through this range with 34% of fish over 30 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nOnly one Yellow Perch was sampled in the survey. This is the lowest catch rate in the history of the lake at 0.17 fish per net. The next lowest catch rate was observed in 1981 with 7 fish per net. The previous survey was the highest catch rate since 1975 with 76 fish per net and surveys back to 2006 all had catch rates exceeding 35 fish per net. The one fish sampled was 7.5 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey was primarily targeting Walleye and Northern Pike and only gill net were used to sample them. While a number of other game fish were sampled, gill nets do not offer reliable data to infer anything about their abundances. Other fish species sampled were: Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

The gill net catch rate for walleye is above the median level for abundance in this lake. The average walleye sampled was 18.5\" and 2.8 pounds. Although six different year classes were sampled, over 57% of all walleye captured during this assessment were 20.0\" or larger. Northern pike were sampled in gill nets at the highest level of abundance ever observed for this lake. The average northern pike captured was 25.8\" and 3.5 pounds. Of all northern pike captured, 15% were 30.0\" or larger. Yellow perch were sampled within normal levels of abundance. However catch rates were down significantly from that observed in 1996. Bluegill were sampled above lake class medians for abundance and had the highest trap net catch rate ever observed for this lake. Over 63% of all bluegill captured were 6.0\" or larger, with the average fish being 6.1\" in length and approximately one-fifth of a pound. Black crappie were sampled at the highest level for abundance since 1981. Only 4% of the fish sampled were over 8.0 inches. The average size of black crappie sampled was 7.1\" and approximately 0.20 pounds. Growth rates for bluegill and black crappie were average.</p>",

The catch of walleye was greatly reduced in 2012 from the previous investigation, and only 1 fish of \"keeper\" size was sampled.  The catch rate of northern pike was similar to earlier investigations, but the size of the pike sampled was much larger (6.6 pounds average size) than earlier studies.  The largest pike sampled exceeded 40\" and weighed more than 14 pounds.  Largemouth bass numbers sampled by electrofihing gear was more than twice the catch of the investigation conducted in 2006, with a good size distribution of fish sampled. The average size bass sampled was about 10\", while 1/3 of the bass sampled were larger than 12\".   The largest bas sampled exceeded 18\" and weighed just under 4 pounds. Yellow perch numbers increased in this investigation, but the size of perch sampled was small.  The catch of black crappie increased, while the bluegill catch decreased.  The size of both panfish species sampled was average for the area.  Bullhead were sampled at historic low levels.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Bone Lake was conducted on July 24th, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darters) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Common Carp). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from the week of June 19th, 2018 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish, Iowa Darters, Smallmouth Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead and Common Carp).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Bone Lake is in poor health as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Lower St. Croix River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bone Lake is a fertile, eutrophic lake Class 24 waterbody located in a rural area of the city of Scandia, Minnesota. The water quality in the lake is not always suitable for swimming and wading due to low clarity or excessive algae. The Comfort Lake-Forest Lake Watershed District installed fish barriers on the outlet and on the inlet from Moody Lake in the fall of 2012.  These structures, in conjunction with subsidized commercial fishing, are hoped to reduce the rough fish population to negligible levels and improve water quality. There is a public boat access at the northwest corner of the lake which is owned by Washington County but operated by DNR Parks and Trails. Eurasian watermilfoil, confirmed in 2006, and curly-leaf pondweed are present in the lake. Submersed and floating leaf vegetation in shallower areas of the lake are abundant in many years. Fish stocking has been the most common fish management practice used on this lake. Bone Lake is primarily managed for Walleye, where annual Walleye fingerling stocking occurs at the rate of 0.65 pounds/littoral-acre (81 lbs.).  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Walleye was normal for lakes similar to Bone and a slight improvement from the previous investigation.  The catch rate of Northern Pike was similar to earlier investigations but somewhat below average for lakes like Bone.  Largemouth Bass were sampled within the historical range for Bone Lake. Yellow Perch numbers are high and above average for lakes of this type, but size was small however.  Although Black Crappie abundance increased from the previous survey size is average for lake class 24. Bluegill abundance decreased from 2012 and would be considered below average when compared to lakes similar to Bone. Black, Yellow and Brown Bullheads were sampled at historic low levels but the fish that are present are of quality size.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
