                "narrative": "<p>Black Bear is a 220 acre lake located about two miles west of Trommald, in Crow Wing County.  There is a public access located on the north shore.  Development in 1998 included about 7.9 homes/cabins per shoreline mile.The lake has a maximum depth of 48 feet and about 25% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  Black Bear has moderately hard water and low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is somewhat above average for the area.  Soils in water less than four feet deep are mostly sand and marl, with areas of gravel and muck also present.The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Plants grew to a depth of eighteen feet in 1998.  Healthy aquatic plant communities are important.  Emergent plants, like bulrush, cattail and wild rice help regulate nutrient levels and often provide quality spawning habitat for northern pike, bass and panfish.  Submergent species provide food and cover for a wide variety of aquatic species.Black Bear was test netted in the summer of 1998.  The lake is currently a reference lake for an experimental regulation study.  As such, the bass population is frequently monitored in spring, but no special regulations are in place.Northern pike were the most abundant gamefish in 1998.  The catch rate of 8.5/gill net was typical when compared to past nettings of the lake, and is in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  Seven year classes of pike were sampled and growth was good.  The 1996 and 1995 year classes were most common in the catch.The walleye catch was in the \"low\" category, when compared to similar type lakes but was similar to past catches in Black Bear.  Two walleyes were caught.  Migration from the Mississippi River is a likely source for walleyes found in the lake.Largemouth bass are poorly sampled in stationary nets and the summer catch was low.  Spring electrofishing samples collected in 1996, '97 and '98 show that a good bass population is present.  Bass as large as 19 inches were present in spring samples.Bluegill abundance appears to be fairly stable.  The '98 catch rate was similar to past catches and was in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  Eight year classes were sampled and growth was good.  About 17% of bluegills were at least 7.0 inches long.Black crappies were caught most readily in gill nets in '98.  A large majority of crappies were in the six-inch length group and from the 1994 year class.  Crappie growth was slow.Important forage species in Black Bear include yellow perch and tullibee.  Perch have had low catch rates in past nettings.  The '98 catch was the highest to date and the first to be \"average\" compared to similar type lakes.  Tullibees have been and continue to be present in \"high\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.Other species sampled in 1998 included: bowfin (dogfish), black bullhead, yellow bullhead, rock bass, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish and common shiner.  Abundances were generally in the \"low\" or \"average\" categories when compared to similar type lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Black Bear Lake is a fair distance from any major roads and the long access road in probably discourages many non-local anglers from fishing this lake.  Development on the lake is restricted to the north and south ends of the lake, while State and County land preserves much of the lake as undeveloped.  The aquatic plant community, which grew to a depth of 18 feet in 1998, is fairly diverse.  These plants are extremely important to maintaining a healthy aquatic environment.  Emergent plants, like bulrush, cattail and wild rice, which are quite numerous, are important for shoreline protection, regulating nutrient levels, and they provide essential spawning habitat for northern pike, bass and panfish.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species. <br> \n <br> \nThe two most abundant species in 2010 were largemouth bass, which were sampled by electrofishing, and tullibee (cisco).  Both were caught in high numbers.  Average size of the bass was 11.5\" and 43% were 12\" or larger.  Tullibees are an important forage fish for the northern pike in the lake.  Average size of the tullibee was 12.4\".  Even with abundant tullibee, the northern pike population was just average and size was on the small side, with an average length of only 18.6\".  Black crappies, which were seen in decent numbers while electrofishing for bass in the spring, weren't sampled well in nets. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included bluegill, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Various minnow species were also sampled while backpack electrofishing and seining, including a pugnose shiner, which is a species of concern. <br> \n</p>",

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place August 4th and 10th, 2023, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 7 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 2 stations.  Sixteen species were sampled, including five species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Banded Killifish. This nearshore survey was used along with the gill net and trap net survey collected the same week to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Black Bear Lake is a fair distance from any major roads and the long access road in probably discourages many non-local anglers from fishing this lake.  Development on the lake is restricted to the north and south ends of the lake, while State and County land preserves much of the lake as undeveloped.  Emergent plants are quite numerous and are important for shoreline protection, regulating nutrient levels, and they provide essential spawning habitat for Northern Pike, bass and panfish.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species. <br> \n <br> \nThe most abundant species captured in 2023 was Tullibee (Cisco).  Average size of the Tullibee (Cisco) was 11.6\".  Even with abundant Tullibee, the Northern Pike population was below average at 3.2/gill net.  Average size was 21.7\" with 21% above the 22-26\" protected slot. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish results were mixed.  Size was decent with Black Crappie, as 83% were 8\" or larger, but numbers appear to be low as only 6 fish were captured during the survey.  Bluegill numbers were a little better at 12.9/trap net, but size was small.  Average length was 5.1\" and 22% were 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing in the spring at the rate of 87.4/hour.  Average length was 11.7\" and 52% were 12\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",
