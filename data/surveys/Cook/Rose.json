THE SAMPLE SIZE IS TOO SMALL TO SAY MUCH ABOUT YEAR-CLASS STRENGTH, BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE 1984 STOCKING OF LAKE TROUT MAY HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL. SMALLMOUTH BASS ARE ABUNDANT, AND GOOD NUMBERS OF LARGER FISH ARE PRESENT. GROWTH IS SLOW BY STATE STANDARDS. NO OTHER GAMEFISH ARE PRESENT IN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS. BLUEGILL HAVE APPEARED IN FAIR NUMBERS, BUT GROWTH IS SLOW AND SIZE IS SMALL. SINCE 1978, RAINBOW SMELT HAVE APPEARED AND BECOME ABUNDANT. NORTHERN CISCO ARE ALSO AVAILABLE AS FORAGE FOR LAKE TROUT. A HEALTHY YELLOW PERCH POPULATION IS PRESENT, PRO- VIDING A FEW FISH OF A SIZE ACCEPTABLE TO ANGLERS AND FORAGE FOR SMALLMOUTH BASS AND REMNANT WALLEYE.</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 17 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 90.4 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 4.8?C (40.6?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 8.8?C for Lake Trout, 17.2?C for Lake Whitefish, or 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for these species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for these species was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Lake Trout, Lake Whitefish, or Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",
