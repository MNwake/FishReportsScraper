                "narrative": "<p>Waboose, a small, shallow, moderately fertile hardwater lake, is located in north-central Becker County within the upper reaches of the Otter Tail River watershed.  Waboose Lake and its immediate watershed are contained entirely within the Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge, which maintains its natural character.  Water leaving Waboose flows west to Lower Egg Lake, then south via the Egg River to Flat Lake, eastward to the Ottertail River, southwest to the Red River and eventually north to Hudson Bay.Waboose is one of fifteen area lakes fitting ecological class #39.  Lakes within this class are charteristically small, shallow bodies of water of moderately high fertility.  The shallow nature of lakes within class 39 make these waters more susceptible to periodic winterkill, subjecting fish communities to boom and bust population cycles.  These conditions often favor those fish species best adapted to survive periods of low dissolved oxygen.  Northern pike, black and brown bullhead, white sucker and black crappie are often the naturally dominant species in periodic winterkill lakes.  As walleye waters, lakes within lake class 39 rely on stocking to establish and maintain walleye populations.  Walleye stocking in these waters can be very successful, often taking advantage of the boom and bust cycles created by periodic winterkill.  Other area lakes similarly fitting lake class 39 include: Buck, Sand (Clay Co.), North Twin, Badger and Muskrat.Fish stocking and removal records date back to 1938.  Waboose has received various aged walleye, largemouth bass, northern pike, and black crappie.  Since 1970 all stocking other than walleye has been discontinued.  The current walleye stocking plan calls for a biennial stocking of walleye fingerlings at a rate of 1.0 lbs./littoral acre (231 lbs.).Waboose Lake has a history of seven fish population assessments dating back to 1953.  Historically, Waboose has maintained relatively stable yellow perch populations, often at levels well above normal for its lake class.  The current gill net catch rate of 105.8/set is well above normal for lakes within lake class 39 and is the highest recorded for this lake.  Average weights of gill net sampled yellow perch have doubled from 0.1 lbs. in 1992 to 0.2 lbs. in 1997.  Correspondingly, average lengths too have increased, from 5.6 inches in 1992 to 7.4 inches in 1997.  Growth rates of yellow perch appear to be near or slightly above state wide averages.  A visual inspection of sampled yellow perch revealed a relatively heavy infestation of the external parasite, neascus.  Though some anglers find the small black spots in and under the fish's skin unsightly, the parasite poses no human health risk and doesn't affect the flavor of the fish.Pumpkinseed and black crappie are the only panfish species to establish long term populations in these waters.  Though largemouth bass were introduced in the past, a sustainable population failed to develop.  Current gillnet data indicates an abundance of quality size (8.1 in. average length) pumpkinseed.  The pumpkinseed population is heavily influenced by one or two strong year classes.Black crappie has long been a species targeted by anglers fishing Waboose Lake.  Since an introductory stocking in the early 1940s, black crappie abundance has varied greatly.  Crappie gill net catch rates peaked in the late 1980s at levels far above the normal range.  The current gill net catch rate of 15.8/set, though lower than those reported in 1987 and 1992, is far above average for lake class 39.  Both average weights (0.9 lbs.) and lengths (11.3 in.) have increased dramatically due to the abundant 1990 and 1991 year classes.  Growth rates of crappie appear to be near or slightly above statewide averages.Northern pike continue to be the most abundant predator species. The current gill net catch rate of 15.5/set is well above average and is the second highest recorded for this lake.  Conversely, the average weight (1.9 lbs.) is the second lowest recorded.  All previous assessments describe a similar inverse relationship between relative abundance and average weight.  Strong representation of the 1994 and 1995 year classes reflect an improvement in spawning conditions aided by high water levels experienced during those years.  Growth rates for northern pike were nearly 20% higher than statewide averages with females growing predictably faster than males.Waboose has very little walleye spawning habitat, relying heavily on maintenance stocking.  Because of poor survival of stocked fry, all walleye stocking since 1977 has been fingerlings and yearlings.  The switch from fry to fingerling stocking coincided with a marked improvement in walleye abundance.  The current gill net catch rate of 8.0/set is the highest on record and is well above the normal range for this lake class.  Six year classes were identified from a sample of 35 walleye.  Age II walleye (1995 year class) accounted for nearly fifty percent of the sample and displayed an average length of 12.4 inches.  The average length of the sample was 16.0 inches.  Walleye within these waters display slightly better than normal growth.The three bullhead species present in Waboose demonstrate the dynamic nature of fish populations.  Black bullheads were the dominant species during the mid to late 1970s, occurring at levels near the top of their normal range.  A 1992 assessment reported yellow bullhead as dominant with the black bullhead population falling well below their normal range.  Currently  brown bullhead is the most common with yellow and black bullhead at or near their lowest levels.  The average length of gill net sampled brown bullhead (13.4 in.) suggests a quality fishery is available to anglers.  However densities would not warrant commercial harvest.Waboose Lake provides anglers more than just an opportunity to catch fish.  The lake's natural state, free from development, offers anglers an unique wilderness like experience.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Test netting data from the late 1970's indicated a fish community comprised predominately of northern pike and black bullheads.  Recent test netting reveals (1)significantly reduced northern pike and black bullhead populations, (2)explosive increases in black crappie and yellow perch populations, (3)significant increases in pumpkinseeds and walleyes.  With the exception of walleyes (walleyes have been stocked), an explanation for the shift in fish community structure is not clear.  Waboose Lake does have the potential to winterkill, and changes in the fish community from the late 1970's to the present look suspiciously like a lake rebounding from partial winterkill, although none has been documented.The current northern pike gillnet catch rate of 7.00/GN is between the first and third quartile for this lake class (#39).  Ages three to six comprise the bulk of the population and exhibit good growth.  A current PSD=87 and RSD(30)=10 represents an excellent angling opportunity.The exploding black crappie population has not manifested itself in trapnet catches (currently between the first and third quartile for this lake class), but rather in a gillnet catch rate that is now 95.25/GN, well over ten times the third quartile value.  The majority of the population consists of three and four year old fish that exhibit slightly below-average growth.  PSD=39 for the population and RSD(10)=1.  Several years of additional growth may provide an abundance of fish desirable to anglers.The gillnet catch rate for yellow perch is currently 67.00/GN, nearly double the third quartile value for this lake class.  As with black crappies, yellow perch abundance has exploded in recent years from very low levels in the late 1970's.  The current population provides a plentiful forage base for northern pike and walleyes.Walleyes have increased significantly since the previous survey.  A current gillnet catch rate of 5.00/GN is at the third quartile value for this lake class.  Although minor natural reproduction has occurred in the past, the major year classes now present appear to be the direct result of fingerling and yearling stocking.  An excellent angling opportunity now exists with PSD=86 and RSD(20)=17.  However, with only a few year classes supporting the population, heavy fishing pressure has the potential to rapidly deplete that population.Largemouth bass were stocked in Waboose Lake in the 1960's but have never been taken in test nets, lending some corroboration to the suspicion that partial winterkill has occurred in the past.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Waboose is a small, shallow, moderately fertile hardwater lake located in north central Becker County within the upper reaches of the Otter Tail River watershed.  Waboose Lake and its immediate watershed are contained entirely within the Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge, which maintains its relatively undisturbed character.  Water leaving Waboose flows west to Lower Egg Lake, then south via the Egg River to Flat Lake, eastward to the Otter Tail River, southwest to the Red River and eventually north to Hudson Bay. <br> \n <br> \nWaboose is one of 15 area lakes in ecological class 39.  The shallow nature of class 39 lakes makes them susceptible to periodic, partial winterkill, often leading to \"boom or bust\" fish population cycles.  However, Waboose has not experienced severe winterkill for at least 27 years.  The lack of winterkill has resulted in continued low catch rates of bullhead and increased catches of several species of gamefish and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nWaboose has little, if any, walleye spawning habitat, although forage and other conditions are favorable to sustaining a walleye population.  Consequently, stocking has been used to maintain a walleye fishery in this lake.  With the abundant forage base and lack of successful, walleye natural reproduction, Waboose was selected as a lake that could benefit from increased stocking rates.  In 1998, fingerling stocking rates were doubled to two pounds of walleyes per littoral acre (464 pounds) biennially.  The lake management plan calls for an aggressive goal of at least 7.0 walleyes per test net (the lake's historical average is 4.4).  Despite increased walleye stocking, the most recent study showed a decline in catch rates from 8.8 walleyes per set in 2007 to 1.3 per set in 2012.  However, it should be noted that northern pike, black crappie and bluegill catch rates increased over the same time period and at least one of those species may be having a detrimental effect on walleye numbers (likely pike). <br> \n <br> \nDuring the late 1980's and early 1990's, Waboose was noted for its prolific crappie fishery.  Test net catches of this fish species dropped quite low during the past two assessments but have begun to rebound in 2012 with three moderate to strong year classes sampled.  Crappie sizes ranged from 2.6 to 10.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nIn general, the fish community in Waboose Lake is typical of a lake that is subject to infrequent, partial winterkill.  Northern pike, black crappie, and yellow perch have survived without stocking.  Bluegills and largemouth bass have recently increased in number (possibly due to mild winters) and stocked walleyes help provide a fishery between rare winterkills.  Waboose also has an abundance of pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish, yellow perch, and white suckers.  Bluegills and largemouth bass were stocked in the past but did not establish strong populations until just recently.  Good numbers of 7-8 inch bluegills, 8-10 inch crappies, and 15-23 inch northern pike were all found in 2012.</p>",

Waboose Lake and its immediate watershed are contained entirely within the Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge, which maintains its relatively undisturbed character.  Water leaving Waboose flows west to Lower Egg Lake, then south via the Egg River to Flat Lake, eastward to the Otter Tail River, southwest to the Red River and eventually north to Hudson Bay.  A moderate winterkill was observied in Waboose Lake in 2013-2014.  This was the first standard survey since that event and it was conducted on 06/4/2017 using standard gill nets and trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nAt the time of the 2017 assessment, the fish population in Waboose Lake was dominated by Northern Pike.  Catch rates were at a historical high, with mean length of 21.0 inches.  Walleye catch rates were slightly higher than those observed in 2012, yet below the historical average for Waboose Lake.  Walleyes sampled ranged from 10.9 to 24.8 inches, with a mean length of 14.8 inches.  Walleyes are stocked in Waboose Lake, and no natural reproduction is believed to occur.  Surprisingly, Black Crappie abundance was similar to the survey in 2012, with fish  ranging from 5.8 to 8.0 inches, with a mean length of 6.9 inches.  The Bluegill population appears lower than that in 2012, yet the catch rate was above Waboose Lake's historical average. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in Waboose Lake include Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \nDissolved oxygen levels in Waboose Lake were critically low in late winter 2017-2018, and it is likely that Waboose Lake will experience some level of winterkill.  Detroit Lakes Area Fisheries will assess the severity of winterkill in spring, 2018 and work to reestablish a fishery if the winterkill was severe.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Waboose, a small, shallow, moderately fertile hardwater lake, is located in north central Becker County within the upper reaches of the Otter Tail River watershed.  Waboose Lake and its immediate watershed are contained entirely within the Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge, which maintains its natural character.  Water leaving Waboose flows west to Lower Egg Lake, then south via the Egg River to Flat Lake, eastward to the Otter Tail River, southwest to the Red River and eventually north to Hudson Bay.Waboose is one of fifteen area lakes categorized as ecological class 39.  The shallow nature of class 39 lakes makes them susceptible to periodic, partial winterkill, often leading to \"boom or bust\" fish population cycles.  However, Waboose has not experienced severe winterkill for at least twenty years.Waboose does not have much walleye spawning habitat, although forage and other conditions are favorable to sustaining a walleye population.  Consequently, stocking has been used to sustain a walleye fishery in this lake.  With the abundant forage base and lack of walleye natural reproduction, Waboose has been selected as a lake that may benefit from increased stocking rates.  In 1998, it was added to the accelerated walleye stocking program and fingerling stocking rates were doubled to two pounds of walleyes per littoral acre (464 pounds) biennially.  The lake management plan calls for an aggressive goal of at least 9.0 walleyes per test net (the lake's historical average is 4.1).  The next study in 2007 should indicate if the increased stocking regimen is helping to attain this goal.Waboose also has an abundance of pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow perch, bullheads, white suckers, and small, northern pike.  Bluegills are rare but good sized.  Largemouth bass were stocked in the past but did not establish a population.During the late 1980's and early 1990's, Waboose was noted for its prolific crappie fishery.  Since then, test net catches of this fish species have dropped quite low and are currently near pre-1980's levels.  Though they are currently not abundant in the fish community, average sizes of black crappies are good (10-11 inches).In general, the fish community in Waboose Lake is typical of a lake that is subject to occasional, partial winterkill.  Northern pike, black crappie, and yellow perch have survived without stocking.  Stocked walleyes provide a fishery between rare winterkills.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Waboose Lake is a 232-acre lake located in north central Becker County within the upper reaches of the Otter Tail River watershed.  It lies entirely within the boundaries of both the Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge and the White Earth Indian Reservation.  The lake's shallow, eutrophic nature makes it susceptible to infrequent, partial winterkill.  The last winterkill was documented in 2013-2014.  Oxygen levels were documented to be low in 2017-2018, but a significant winterkill did not occur.  Dead fish were reported in the spring of 2023, prompting a targeted fisheries survey to be conducted in May 2023 to assess the severity of the winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nDead fish of all species were observed while surveying.  Trap nets captured Northern Pike, White Sucker, Yellow Perch, Golden Shiner, and two species of bullhead.  These are all species which are more tolerant to low oxygen conditions.  White Sucker were abundant.  Northern Pike were caught in good numbers with an average length of 19 inches.  Waboose Lake appears to have experienced a significant winterkill for Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass during the 2022-2023 winter.  Walleye and Bluegill were reintroduced during 2023.  Angling opportunities for Northern Pike are still available, but it will take a few years to have quality fishing for other species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Waboose, a small, shallow, moderately fertile hardwater lake, is located in north central Becker County within the upper reaches of the Otter Tail River watershed.  Waboose Lake and its immediate watershed are contained entirely within the Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge, which maintains its natural character.  Water leaving Waboose flows west to Lower Egg Lake, then south via the Egg River to Flat Lake, eastward to the Otter Tail River, southwest to the Red River and eventually north to Hudson Bay. <br> \n <br> \nWaboose is one of fifteen area lakes in ecological class 39.  The shallow nature of class 39 lakes makes them susceptible to periodic, partial winterkill, often leading to \"boom or bust\" fish population cycles.  However, Waboose has not experienced severe winterkill for at least 25 years. <br> \n <br> \nWaboose does not have much walleye spawning habitat, although forage and other conditions are favorable to sustaining a walleye population.  Consequently, stocking has been used to sustain a walleye fishery in this lake.  With the abundant forage base and lack of walleye natural reproduction, Waboose has been selected as a lake that may benefit from increased stocking rates.  In 1998, fingerling stocking rates were doubled to two pounds of walleyes per littoral acre (464 pounds) biennially.  The lake management plan calls for an aggressive goal of at least 7.0 walleyes per test net (the lake's historical average is 4.9).  The 2007 study indicates the increased stocking regimen may be helping to attain this goal since there was an increase in catch rates from 5.7 walleyes per set in 2002 to 8.8 per set in 2007.  However, it must be noted that catch rates were nearly as high in 1997 (8.0 walleyes per set) when stocking rates were about half the current rate. <br> \n <br> \nWaboose also has an abundance of pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow perch, bullheads, white suckers, and small, northern pike.  Bluegills are increasing in number and good-sized.  Largemouth bass were stocked in the past but did not establish a population until just recently.  A few were sampled during the assessment in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the late 1980's and early 1990's, Waboose was noted for its prolific crappie fishery.  Since then, test net catches of this fish species have dropped quite low and are currently near pre-1980's levels.  Though they are currently not abundant in the fish community, a nice range of sizes of black crappies is present with fish up to 12 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nIn general, the fish community in Waboose Lake is typical of a lake that is subject to occasional, partial winterkill.  Northern pike, black crappie, and yellow perch have survived without stocking.  Bluegills and largemouth bass have recently increased in number (possibly due to mild winters) and stocked walleyes provide a fishery between rare winterkills. <br> \n</p>",

Waboose Lake and its immediate watershed are contained entirely within the Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge, which maintains its relatively undisturbed character.  Water leaving Waboose flows west to Lower Egg Lake, then south via the Egg River to Flat Lake, eastward to the Otter Tail River, southwest to the Red River and eventually north to Hudson Bay.  A moderate winterkill was observed in Waboose Lake in 2013-2014.  Oxygen levels were also documented to be low in 2017-2018, but adequate fish survival occurred as documented by this survey conducted in summer 2022. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was higher than the 2017 survey, with fish averaging almost 20 inches long.  Although Northern Pike abundance has declined since the record high observed in 2017, pike numbers are still high.  Pike had an average length of 21 inches.  Black Crappie abundance increased compared to the 2017 survey, with fish primarily being just shy of 10 inches long.  Similar to Black Crappie, Bluegill numbers also increased compared to 2017.  Bluegill were found to be primarily 5 to 7 inches long.  Additional fish species observed were Yellow Perch, Largemouth Bass, White Sucker, bullheads, and Pumpkinseed.    <br> \n <br> \nThe survey completed in 2022 suggests that Waboose Lake continues to recover from the winterkill observed in 2013-2014.  While Northern Pike and Walleye populations are beginning to stabilize, the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations are still maturing.  If no winterkill is observed in the future, the lake should provide quality fishing opportunities. <br> \n</p>",
