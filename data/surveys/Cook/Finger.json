Walleye were sampled in average numbers compared to other lakes of this type.  The walleye averaged between 14 inches and 15 inches (1.3 pounds) with fish up to 23.2 inches sampled.       Northern pike numbers are below average compared to similar type lakes.  Northern pike sampled in nets in 1999 ranged from 14.4 inches to 26.7 inches (4.5 pounds) but most were less than 2.5 pounds and averaged 1.7 pounds.     Yellow perch numbers are below average and their size is small with very few fish collected that were over 8 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of Black Crappie was completed in spring of 2023 using trap nets to monitor the current status of the population. The species was first sampled in Finger Lake by DNR Fisheries in 2011. Spring trap netting captured a small number of crappie from six unique year classes that ranged from 5.6 to 13.5 inches long. The late ice-out followed by a warm spring that caused water temperatures to rise quickly may have contributed to the low catch. Still, the spring survey did confirm that natural reproduction has occurred in recent years suggesting the lake supports a naturalized population.  <br> \n <br> \nA fair number of Northern Pike and Walleye were sampled during spring netting. The size structure of both species was similar to the standard survey result, which is typically used to assess these populations. For more information about the fish community of Finger Lake see the standard survey dated July 24, 2023. </p>",

There is a public access with earthen boat ramp on the Cross River just downstream from the lake. The access is on a private driveway that has an easement that provides public access to the water. This access is located at the end of a Forest Service spur that extends to the west from Forest Service Road 347. Space for parking and turning vehicles is limited and users must not block the driveway to ensure access for the landowner and the public. There is one campsite and a portage trail to Elbow Lake maintained by the Forest Service as part of the Timber-Frear Canoe Route. Walleye are the primary management species and regular fry stocking has occurred for several decades to supplement the population, although natural reproduction does occur. Black Crappie were first sampled in 2011 and have since established a fishable population.   <br> \n <br> \nA standard fisheries survey was completed in July of 2023 to monitor the fish community and evaluate stocking. The Walleye catch rate was within the normal range for similar lakes in gill nets and slightly above the normal range in trap nets. The combined catch included Walleye from about 7 to 23\" long with an average size of 15.3\" and 1.45 pounds. Walleye ranged from age-1 to age-16 with few missing year classes. Stocked year classes accounted for just 35.5% of the catch suggesting stocking may not be needed to maintain the population.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch was the highest to date from standard summer surveys. Size ranged from 5.5 to 13\" long and fish ranged from age-2 to age-5. These results indicate some recruitment has occurred in recent years suggesting a self-sustaining population has been established. Targeted spring trap netting was also completed in June 2023 and more information about the Black Crappie population can be found in that report.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike provide additional angling opportunities and have historically been sampled in low numbers in standard fisheries surveys. The 2023 catch was similar to previous surveys of the lake and within the normal range for this type of lake. Size of pike is generally small, although individual fish will occasionally grow larger. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Finger Lake has a surface area of 204 acres and a maximum depth of 14 feet.  The lake is located in far western Cook County and is part of the Timber-Frear Canoe Route.  This area is a USFS designated canoe route with maintained campsites and portages, but with less strict regulations than the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.  Finger Lake has a single campsite located on the eastern shore.  There are two routes that can be used to access Finger Lake.  There is a 30 rod portage from Elbow Lake to the western shore of Finger Lake that can be used by those coming up from Whitefish Lake through Elbow Lake.  There is also a back-in access on the Cross River 0.4 miles south of Finger Lake.  Depending on the water levels in the Cross River, anglers may be able to carefully motor a boat up river into Finger Lake or may have to drag their boat up the river if water levels are low.  This access is on private property, but there is a perpetual easement allowing angler access and there are signs instructing anglers not to park within 100 feet of the river to allow the landowners to access their property.  The road into this access (USFS Rd 1221) is a spur off of USFS Rd 347; a high clearance vehicle is recommended as it is very rough and brushy.   <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of the summer 2018 survey was to provide an update to the status of the fish community and to assess the effectiveness of Walleye stocking.  The current plan calls for 200,000 Walleye fry to be stocked in two consecutive years followed by two years without stocking.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch in Finger Lake was near average when compared to other similar lakes.  The average weight was almost 1 1/2 pounds with the heaviest Walleye tipping the scales at roughly 7 pounds.  Average length was approximately 16 inches with the longest fish measuring 27 inches.  Twelve different ages of Walleye were identified in the sample ranging from one to 16 years old.  Age-11 fish were the most common in the sample.  Growth of Walleye in Finger Lake was average when compared to similar lakes in the area.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Northern Pike in Finger Lake was below average when compared to similar lakes.  The average weight was 1 3/4 pounds and the heaviest fish weighed just under three pounds.  Average length was 21 inches with the largest fish measuring 25 inches.  Northern Pike ranged in age from two to seven with age three and four fish making up the largest portion of the catch.  Age-3 fish averaged 18 inches and age four fish averaged 20 inches at the time of sampling.  Northern Pike growth was average relative to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were poorly sampled during the standard summer survey.  A targeted survey using trap nets was conducted during the spring of 2018 with the specific goal of sampling Black Crappie.  The spring targeted survey sampled Black Crappie in larger numbers, over a wider range of sizes and ages. <br> \n <br> \nCatch of adult Yellow Perch was well below average compared to similar lakes with only six sampled in gill nets and standard trap nets.  These six fish ranged in length from 5 3/4 to 8 inches.  However, large numbers of Yellow Perch were sampled in small mesh trap nets, these fish averaged only 3 inches long.  Other species sampled were White Sucker, Johnny Darter, Blacknose Shiner, Golden Shiner, and Tadpole Madtom.   <br> \n <br> \nFinger Lake offers good opportunities to catch eater size Walleyes.  The targeted survey carried out in the spring suggests that there are also some good opportunities to catch Black Crappie.  Anglers may pick up Northern Pike and Yellow Perch, but the populations are small and size structure poor.  The lake also provides opportunities for camping and canoeing as part of the Timber-Frear Canoe Route.    </p>",

Spring trap netting captured 29 crappie that ranged from 5.7 to 13.4\" and had an average size of 9.9\" and 0.7 pounds. Analysis of scale samples identified seven unique year classes. Growth was good with fish reaching 10.8\" at age-4. This indicates Finger Lake currently supports a population of Black Crappie similar to other lakes in the Finland Area. These fisheries tend to have low density populations with good growth rates and sporadic reproduction that can produce good angling when strong year classes mature.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile not specifically targeted during this survey a fair number of Northern Pike were sampled with spring trap nets. Average size was 20.9\" and 2.1 pounds with 24% greater than 24 inches. The lake may not be a destination for trophy Northern Pike but anglers can encounter decent opportunities for this top predator. <br> \n <br> \nSeveral adult Walleye were also captured during this assessment. Size distribution was similar to summer sampling which is typically used to describe Walleye populations in local lakes. More information can be found from the standard survey completed the week of August 6, 2018.</p>",

This lake in the early 1970's produced limits of fish averaging three to five pounds but the present average is closer to two pounds.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Finger Lake is 204 acres, with a maximum depth of 14 feet and is located approximately 13 miles north-northwest of Schroeder, MN.  There is a sand back-in access to the Cross River that has an angler easement through private property; the property owner requests no parking within 100 feet of the river along the road.  The 0.7 mile access road to the river is very rough and brushy, there is very little room at the river to turn a boat trailer around when attached to the vehicle and the rough road makes towing even a small trailer questionable.  Once in the river it is 0.4 mile upstream to Finger Lake, at low water levels it can be difficult to motor the shallow/boulder stretches of river to the lake.  There is one remote campsite on the eastern shore of Finger Lake, maintained by the U. S. Forest Service (USFS).  Finger Lake is one of the entry points to the \"Timber-Frear canoe route\" that is managed by the USFS as a Semi-Primitive Motorized Area, providing a wilderness experience outside of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA).  The portage trail to Elbow Lake is 30 rods (approximately 500 feet). <br> \n <br> \nFinger Lake is a very soft-water lake with a sand/muck substrate near shore over most of the lake, with rubble/boulder on the upper east shore.  A fringe of emergent vegetation exists over most of the sand shoreline with some submerged vegetation to a depth of 5 feet.  The secchi disk reading was 4 feet in brownish/yellow water tinted with an algae bloom.  The Cross River flows through Finger Lake as an inlet from Elbow Lake and an outlet to South Wigwam Lake. <br> \n <br> \nFish sampled in 2011 were black crappie, northern pike, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch in standard gear and four minnow species in small mesh trap nets.  The walleye numbers were well above average in mid-lake sampling, near-shore sampling caught few walleye.  The average size of walleye sampled was slightly below average for the lake class at 1.0 pound (14.2 inches); the largest walleye was 20.3 inches.  Forty-five percent of the walleye sampled were greater than 15 inches.  Walleye fry are presently stocked on a two (consecutive) of four years schedule.  Walleye reproduction in Finger Lake adds significantly to the population, based on strong representation in un-stocked year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike sample in 2011 was below average for the lake class, but similar to low catches seen in previous investigations on Finger Lake.  The average weight of northern pike in the 2011 sample was 1.6 pounds (19.1 inches), and weight was 2.2 pounds (21.2 inches).   Fifty-two percent of the northern pike catch in 2011 was greater than 18 inches the largest northern pike sampled was 28.9 inches (5.6 pounds), one of only two larger than 21 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in below average numbers for the lake class in 2011 as historically has been the case in Finger Lake.  The mean weight in 2011 of 0.3 pound (8.6 inches) was influenced by the small sample size.  Few young perch were collected in standard sampling gear, although small mesh trap nets indicated fair numbers of young-of-the-year yellow perch.  The largest yellow perch sampled in any gear in 2011 was 10.4 inches; seventy-three percent of the total catch was greater than eight inches in length.  Yellow perch natural reproduction appears to be sufficient to provide a forage base for the predator populations in Finger Lake; however, yellow perch do not provide a quality fishery. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were first sampled in Finger Lake in 2011. Five fish were collected in standard sampling gear and ranged from 5-6 inches in length.  The sample of small crappies taken in this re-survey indicates that black crappies are present in Finger Lake and a population may be building.  Other lakes in the Cross River chain (Cross River Lake and South Wigwam Lake) have established black crappie populations.  While spawning habitat appears to be excellent in Finger Lake for black crappie, the cool climate in this portion of northeastern Minnesota has been a factor in limiting successful reproduction in other area lakes with black crappie populations.  Lakes with established black crappie populations, in the Finland Management Area, are characterized by small populations of fast growing fish associated with occasional strong year-classes.  Black crappie fisheries in these lakes are sporadic with some quality (12 inch plus) fish present, associated with the few strong year-classes. Finger Lake has the potential to produce quality black crappie fishing in the future. <br> \n</p>",
