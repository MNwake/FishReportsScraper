                "narrative": "<p>Ed Shave Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 12, which consists of 90 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, have very soft (unmineralized) water, and have irregular shoreline shapes.  Ed Shave Lake is smaller, has clearer water, and is more bowl-shaped than most of the lakes in this lake class.  Ed Shave Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.Ed Shave Lake was slightly thermally stratified on 7/19/2004 with a surface temperature of 75 F and a bottom temperature of 68 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to within a foot of the bottom.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Ed Shave Lake are mostly boulder and muck, with very little sand or gravel.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 8 ft; the most common plants are leatherleaf, watershield, water horehound, stonewort, blue flag, and lobelia.  Ed Shave Lake has no inlets; the outlet to Second Creek flows through cattail, spruce, and tamarack swamps that limit fish movement.Fish sampling in the 2004 fish population assessment consisted of one gillnet set and nine trapnet sets.  Previously, two fisheries lake surveys (1975, 1995) and five fish population assessments used 1-3 gillnet sets.  The two lake surveys also used 4-9 trapnet sets.  Shoreline seines were used only during the 1995 lake survey.Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in Ed Shave Lake periodically since 1976, and have been stocked once every three years since 1996.  Fish populations, once consisting only of northern pike and yellow perch, were dominated by walleye and yellow perch in 2004.  No northern pike were captured in 2004.  Notable by their absence in this lake are white sucker; a few were caught in the 1990 assessment only.Walleye numbers in 2004 (21.4/gillnet, 10.4/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Walleye sizes averaged 12.9\" (0.8 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class.  The largest walleye was 25.4\".  Forty-three percent of the walleye were from 2002, when walleye fingerlings were last stocked.  Good numbers of walleye were also present from non-stocked year classes.  Growth of walleye captured in 2004 was normal (in the second or third quartiles) by area standards.Yellow perch numbers in 2004 (11.0/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class.  Perch sizes in 2004 averaged 11.1\" (0.7 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  The largest perch was 12.9\".  Perch recruitment appeared to be somewhat erratic.  Growth of perch captured in 2004 was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.Neascus was present on a few of the perch and walleye examined in 2004.  Neascus is a common parasite that is native to the area.  It cannot infect humans, is often removed when filleting fish, and is killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ed Shave Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 12, which is comprised of 90 northeast Minnesota lakes that are small, shallow, and chemically unproductive.  Ed Shave Lake is smaller then most of these lakes, has clearer water, and is less productive chemically.  It is classified as mesotrophic.  Shallow water soils in Ed Shave Lake are dominated by boulder and muck, with very little sand or gravel.  Aquatic plants are found everywhere at water depths of less than 8'.  There is partial thermal stratification of the water column in midsummer, with bottom temperatures about 5 F lower than surface temperatures.  Good oxygen (2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 14' over a maximum depth of 16'.  There are no inlets; the small outlet (Second Creek) flows through a cattail, spruce, and tamarack swamp that limits fish movement.The total catch of fish in 1995 (all species combined) was higher than normal for this lake class and higher than in past surveys and assessments.  Fish populations in 1995 were dominated by walleye and yellow perch.Walleye were introduced into this lake in 1976 and have been stocked periodically since.  Walleye numbers in 1995 were much higher than normal for this lake class.  Walleye sizes averaged 16\"; the largest walleye was 27\" (6.7 lb).  Walleye growth (14\" at age four) was average for the area.  Walleye were present from many years, but most were from years that had been stocked.Yellow perch numbers in 1995 were higher than normal for this lake class.  Perch sizes averaged 8\"; the largest perch was 13\".  Perch growth (10\" at age four) was faster than average for the area.  Northern pike numbers declined after 1981, perhaps associated with the introduction of walleye to this lake.  Pike numbers in 1995 were lower than normal for this lake class.  Pike sizes averaged 18\"; the largest pike was 31\" (8.4 lb).  Pike growth (20\" at age four) was average for the area.One bluegill sunfish was caught in 1995 - the first observation of this species in this lake.  A few white sucker were caught in 1990, and low numbers of golden shiner were caught in 1975 and 1978. </p>",

This lake has a maximum depth of 17 feet and clear water. <br> \n <br> \nOn June 22, 2021 the lake was completely mixed with a surface temperature of 69 F and a bottom temperature of 67 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish throughout the water column.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly ledge rock, rubble, and gravel, with muck in the bays.   <br> \n <br> \nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 22.7 fish/net which was right at the average of past surveys on the lake.  Yield was 18.5 lbs/net which was just below the average of past surveys.  Fish species sampled were walleye, yellow perch, smallmouth bass, and white sucker.  Trap nets caught fish at an overall rate of 13.6 fish/net which was better than average when compared to past surveys on the lake.  Yield was 15.4 lbs/net which was the second highest on record for the lake.  A bluegill was the only additional fish species sampled in the trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nFifty-six walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 18.7 fish/net, which was very good compared to other similar lakes and the second highest on record for Ed Shave.  This catch rate also ranked 5th out of 198 surveys of walleye populations in the Tower area.  Walleye lengths ranged from 7 to 22 inches with an average of 13 inches.  Walleye growth was good with the average fish taking four years to reach 15 inches long.  Ages ranged from 1 to 14 years with no overly strong year classes represented.       <br> \n <br> \nA total of 11 smallmouth bass were captured between the gill nets and trap nets.  The trapnet catch rate of 1.0 fish/net was above average when compared to other similar lakes and right at the average when compared to past surveys on Ed Shave.  Lengths from fish caught in trap nets ranged from just over 6 to nearly 18 inches with an average of just over 12 inches.  Ages ranged from 1 to 7.   <br> \n <br> \nNine yellow perch were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 3.0 fish/net which was below average compared to other similar lakes and below average compared to past catches on Ed Shave Lake.  Sizes were similar to past surveys with a range of 7 to 12.5 inches and an average of 10.5 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

Ed Shave Lake was weakly stratified on 7/19/2010, the first day of the survey, with a surface temperature of 75*F and a bottom temperature of 72*F. Water clarity is above average compared to other lakes in this class. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a public access with a concrete boat ramp located on the west central shoreline. This access can be found off St. Louis Co. Rd. #116 (Echo Trail). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2010 (13.0/gill net) were identical to the long term average for all assessments on this lake. Walleye sizes  averaged 15.3\" and the growth rate was faster than average compared to other lakes in this class. The largest walleye was 19.6\". <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were sampled for the first time in 2010. Smallmouth sizes  averaged 12.3\" and the growth rate was faster than average for other area lakes. The largest smallmouth was 15.1\". <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch  numbers in 2010 (4.5/gill net) were lower than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. Perch sizes  averaged 6.8\" and the growth rate was faster than average compared to other lakes in this class. The largest perch was 14.3\". <br> \n <br> \nThe only other fish species sampled was white sucker. Northern pike were last sampled in 1995. <br> \n</p>",
