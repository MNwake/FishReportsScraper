There had been some survival of brook trout fingerlings stocked in 2009 and 2008.  Growth of two-year-old brook trout had been relatively fast; those fish averaged 10.9 inches in length at the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 9.4 inches.  Good growth observed in 2010 met one of the long range goals for the lake - that brook trout growth not be too far below the area average (slow growth had been a problem in this lake).  Two-year-old fish accounted for over half of the spring catch in 2010.  That probably met the age-distribution goal from the 2006 lake management plan (at least a third of the catch should consist of fish at least two years of age).  No fish older than two years were taken, but that was not unusual for this lake, which has been known mainly for producing relatively high numbers of small brook trout.  <br> \n</p>",
