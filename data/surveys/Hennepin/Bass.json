Both trap net and gill net samples of black bullhead, brown bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and black crappie were all higher than median values.  Bluegills were the most-frequently caught fish, were quite abundant, and had an average weight of 3.9 fish per pound.  Sixty-nine percent of bluegill were 6 inches or larger.  Black bullheads were sampled in second-highest frequency, and averaged approximately 8 inches in length.  Black crappies averaged 2.7 fish per pound; gill-netted fish were slightly larger than trap-netted fish.  Golden shiners were also sampled frequently, with most 7.5-7.9 inches.  The northern pike gill net catch was higher than the median value and northern pike trap net catch number was near the median value.  Forty-one percent of northern pike were 21 inches or larger.  Number of carp per net was below the median value, but carp size was above average because one very large fish was captured.  White suckers, white crappies, and hybrid sunfish were present at below-median abundances.  Largemouth bass were sampled in all gear types.  Number of trap-netted largemouth bass was above the median level.  Shoreline seining sampled several young-of-the-year largemouth bass, indicating natural reproduction of this species.  Natural reproduction is re-establishing the lake's largemouth bass population, as there are year-classes of fish in addition to those from the 1979 and 1989 private-permit stockings.  Northern pike are also likely to re-establish via natural reproduction, as there is potential spawning habitat in the lake's western marshy areas.  Growth rate of largemouth bass is slightly below average.  Northern pike growth rate appears to be above average through the first five years and average thereafter.  Since November 1979, a wintertime aeration system has been permitted to decrease likelihood of fish-killing oxygen depletion.</p>",
