                "narrative": "<p>Steer Lake is a 4.4 acre designated trout lake managed for Brook Trout in the Superior National Forest.  The maximum depth is 24 feet and it has light green stained water.  The lake is located 15 miles north-northeast of Finland.  The main access is a marked 0.6 mile hiking trail from Lake County Road #7 to the north shore of the lake.  A second access is available as part of a trail system from Hogback Lake Campground, a 1.3 mile hike to the north end of the lake.  Shoreline angling is available along the bog and upland near the camp/picnic area.  Consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for rules applicable to designated trout lakes.  Brook Trout fingerlings are stocked annually in Steer Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCold water temperatures and good dissolved oxygen levels are essential for trout growth and survival.  To assess these important criteria, four automatic temperature loggers were deployed at the deepest location in the lake, they were suspended at depths of 4, 8, 12, and 16 feet from May 22 to October 4, 2018.  Dissolved oxygen checks were conducted throughout the summer at the same location.   <br> \n <br> \nThe results of the investigation indicate that during the summer of 2018, Steer Lake maintained sufficient oxygen and thermal habitat for the survival of stream trout.  These parameters will continue to be carefully monitored in future investigations to check the suitability of Steer Lake for trout stocking. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steer Lake is a designated stream trout lake located approximately 11 straight line miles east of Isabella. The primary access is a half mile carry-in trail from Lake County Road 7 where a wide spot in the road allows for parking of one or two vehicles. Anglers can also access the lake from the Hogback Lake Hiking Trail System, which requires a 1.25-mile hike over hilly terrain. Steer Lake is managed for Brook Trout with 500 fingerlings stocked each fall; no fingerlings were stocked in fall of 2022 due to a hatchery shortage. A remote creel survey was completed in 2023 and documented light fishing pressure in the summer trout season and moderate fishing pressure during the winter trout season relative to similar lakes throughout the state.  <br> \n <br> \nA fisheries survey was completed in early October to monitor the status of the Brook Trout population in Steer Lake. The Brook Trout sampled ranged from 9 to 16 inches long with an average length of 11 inches. Multiple year classes of Brook Trout were present in Steer Lake indicating that the conditions in the lake have been suitable for trout survival in recent years. Anglers may notice a few less fish during the summer of 2024 due to the missed stocking in 2022. However, based on the data collected in this survey there should still be Brook Trout present for anglers to target. The average size of those fish should be a little larger than what is normally available in Steer Lake. By 2025, we expect the numbers available to anglers to be back closer to what has historically available in the lake.  <br> \n</p>",

There is a well maintained 0.5 mile carry-in access trail off Lake County Road 7. Temperature and oxygen monitoring conducted on the lake to date indicate adequate summer and winter habitat for trout survival. The 2018 survey sampled 13 total Brook Trout in both gears combined and age analysis determined fish from each of the previous three years of stocking were present. Size of trout was favorable and averaged 11.3 inches with one fish over 16 inches long captured. Other species found in the lake include Blacknose Shiner, Finescale Dace, Northern Pearl Dace, and White Sucker. While these species may compete with trout for resources they are considered compatible with stream trout management. Anglers that make the trip to this small remote lake will be rewarded with the opportunity to catch a quality sized Brook Trout.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steer Lake is a Designated Trout Lake, which prohibits the possesssion and use of live minnows.  It is normally stocked each fall with brook trout by airplane.  Access is by a 0.5 mile hiking trail.     Test nets in 1997 found brook trout abundance to be about average compared to other small brook trout lakes in the Finland Management Area.  Brook trout averaged 9.4 inches, however 66% were less than 8.0 inches in length.  One 17.2 inch fish was observed however this size is uncommon for Steer Lake.  Past assessments have sampled more fish greater than 8.0 inches, however a shortage of brook trout fingerlings for stocking a few years earlier contributed to fewer large fish being sampled in this survey.</p>",
