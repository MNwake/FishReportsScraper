This shallow lake is surrounded by private land and no public access is present. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 survey of Heikkilla Lake represents the first time this lake has been sampled by DNR Fisheries. Black bullheads dominated the gill net (81%) and trap net (59%) catches. Young-of-the-year yellow perch were the most common species observed in the small mesh trap nets. Several minnow species were also sampled. Other species of interest included northern pike and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2019 at 11.0/gill net were very high compared to other similar area lakes. Pike average length was 19.1 inches. Pike sizes ranged from 15.2 inches to a maximum of 25.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2019 of 7.0/gill net were similar to other area lakes comparable to Heikkilla. Perch sizes averaged 8.5 inches. Perch lengths ranged from 5.9 to 11.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers in 2019 of 102.0/gill net were extremely high when compared to other similar area lakes.
