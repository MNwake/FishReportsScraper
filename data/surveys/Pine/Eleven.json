                "narrative": "<p>Lake Eleven is a 109 acre basin of moderately soft water assigned to lake class 29.  The maximum depth is 49 feet with a mean depth of 19 feet.  Sixty three percent of the lake is littoral.  Substrates are predominately sand with an adequate abundance of aquatic vegetation.  Shoreline development on Lake Eleven has increased to eleven homes.  There is no public access on Lake Eleven and all of the surrounding property is privately held.        A fisheries population assessment was conducted which included trapnetting and gillnetting on June 28th and June 29th and shoreline seining on September 7th, 2000.  Previous assessments were conducted in 1967 and 1984.      Northern pike were abundant with all netted fish falling between 2 and 5 pounds.  Northern lengths ranged from 20 to 26.6 inches with a 22.7 inch average.  Northerns were between 3 and 5 years old with 63% of the catch represented by the 1996 year class.      Black crappie were not overly abundant but the catch was within the normal ranged for the lake type and higher than the previous catch.  Sampled crappie were all  between 7 and 8 inches with a average weight of 0.24 pounds.  All aged crappie were either 2 or 3 years old.  Black crappie fingerlings were sampled in the shoreline seining.      Bluegill were sampled in high abundance with some acceptable size fish present.  One fourth of the  bluegill were 7 inches or greater.  Mean weight for the catch was 0.23 pounds.  Bluegill ranged in age from 1 to 7 years with the strongest year class occurring in 1998.  Young bluegill were taken in the shoreline seining.       Yellow perch and largemouth bass were sampled within the normal range for the lake class.  All yellow perch were between 5.5 and 6.5 inches.  Bass ranged from 5.4 to 20.2 inches.  Fingerlings of both species were present in the seine haul.      Other species present during the assessment were;  golden shiner, emerald shiner, blacknose shiner, tadpole madtom, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, johnny darter, and painted turtle.         Lake Eleven is a fairly remote lake with no public access.  Fishing pressure is light.  Past reports indicate that much of the angling is directed at largemouth bass and black crappies.</p>",
