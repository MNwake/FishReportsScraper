                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Andrew Lake was conducted in July of 2005. Andrew is a moderately sized (814 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Sibley State Park is located along the north and northwest shoreline areas. Shores of St. Andrew's Bible Camp is located along the east shore. Residential development has occurred throughout the entire shoreline area with the exception of the northwest portion of the lake. DNR public access sites are located along the south side and northwest side (Sibley State Park) of the lake. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) is abundant along the northwest bay and north shore areas in Andrew. Submergent vegetation densities within the lake are also abundant within the littoral zone areas. Andrew is connected to several periodic winterkill (Henchien, Swan, Middle) and non-winterkill lakes (Norway, Games, Florida) via the Shakopee Creek and various small inlets. Water clarity (secchi=7.83 feet) was moderate in 2005. Andrew is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill. Walleye stockings (primarily fingerlings) are scheduled for every other year in Andrew. Black crappie numbers were low in 2005 (0.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie gillnet historical average catch rate was 2.63 fish/gillnet for Andrew. The 2005 black crappie average size was moderate (0.67 pounds and 10.3 inches) from gillnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.33 pounds from gillnets. Northern pike numbers were abundant in 2005 (8.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 4.75 fish/gillnet for Andrew. The 2005 northern pike average size was small to moderate (2.19 pounds and 21.6 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.15 pounds from gillnets. The 2005 catch rate of quality size (21.0 inches and larger) northern pike was high (4.17 fish/gillnet) in Andrew. Northern pike growth rates in Andrew were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges. The largest northern pike captured was 33.7 inches. Yellow perch numbers were low to moderate in 2005 (11.83 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 24.02 fish/gillnet for Andrew. The 2005 yellow perch average size was small (0.10 pounds and 5.9 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from gillnets.Walleye numbers were abundant in 2005 (9.17 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 6.02 fish/gillnet for Andrew. The 2005 walleye average size was moderate (1.78 pounds and 16.2 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.72 pounds from gillnets. The 2005 catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches and larger) walleye (3.83 fish/gillnet) was moderate and similar to the Andrew historical average (3.53 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were generally within the Spicer Area normal ranges. The walleye population in Andrew is due primarily to stocking. Limited walleye natural reproduction has been documented by past fall electrofishing surveys. Andrew was recently stocked with walleye in the 2005 fall (8,268 fingerlings, 536 pounds; 820 yearlings, 349 pounds; 6 adults, 6 pounds). The 2002 walleye year class (stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 32% of the walleye catch in the 2005 assessment. The largest walleye captured was 28.5 inches from the 2005 assessment. Bluegill numbers were low to moderate in 2005 (11.75 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 31.69 fish/trapnet in Andrew. The 2005 bluegill average size was moderate (0.16 pounds and 5.6 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.18 pounds from trapnets. The 2005 catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches and larger) bluegill was low (5.50 fish/trapnet) in Andrew. Largemouth bass numbers were moderate in 2005 (0.50 fish/trapnet) trapnets compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2005 largemouth bass average size was small (5.1 inches) from trapnets. A spring electrofishing survey was not conducted for largemouth bass in 2005 due to time constraints. The last spring electrofishing survey for largemouth bass in Andrew was done in 2001. Abundant numbers of largemouth bass were captured in the Andrew 2001 spring electrofishing survey (114.00 fish/hour, 11.6 inches average length). The Andrew spring electrofishing largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 74.91 fish/hour.Freshwater drum numbers were moderate in 2005 (4.83 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but above the historical average catch rate (2.97 fish/gillnet) for Andrew. The 2005 freshwater drum average size was small (0.96 pounds and 12.8 inches) from gillnets. The freshwater drum historical average weight is 2.43 pounds from gillnets.Current fish management activities on Andrew include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Andrew fishery will be surveyed in the 2010 spring for largemouth bass and 2010 summer for all fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of Lake Andrew was conducted for Largemouth Bass during June 7-8, 2016. Night time spring electrofishing was used to sample the Largemouth Bass population in Andrew. Ice out occurred earlier than normal (mid-March) for area lakes in 2016. The 2016 electrofishing survey occurred during post spawn conditions with a surface water temperature of 68 F. Six electrofishing stations of equal length and time were chosen by a new representative sampling methodology. The new methodology targets all sizes and year classes of Largemouth Bass. It generally results in lower overall catch rates and average sizes sampled, but will better predict the actual Largemouth Bass size distribution compared to previous historical surveys conducted during the spawning season and corresponding habitats. <br> \n <br> \nAndrew is a moderately sized (736 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Sibley State Park is located along the north and northwest shoreline areas. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) is abundant along the northwest bay and north shore areas in Andrew. Various submergent vegetation species (i.e. bladderwort, coontail, flat-stemmed pondweed, muskgrass, clasping-leaf pondweed and northern milfoil) are frequently occurring within the littoral zone areas. Eurasian watermilfoil is present in lakes both upstream and downstream, but presently is not in Andrew. Shoalwater substrates are primarily sand, rubble, gravel and boulder.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass catch rate appeared moderate (17.59 fish/hour) in the 2016 spring electrofishing survey. Fish were in post spawn condition during the 2016 spring electrofishing survey. Largemouth Bass average weight and length were 1.20 pounds and 12.26 inches in 2016. The Largemouth Bass catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches and larger) was 4.14 fish/hour in 2016. Largemouth bass catches appeared to be positively associated with dock and boat lift structures at sampling stations lacking emergent vegetation cover in 2016. Largemouth Bass growth rates were generally within the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2012 and 2009 Largemouth Bass year classes comprised 24% and 18% respectively of the 2016 spring night time electrofishing catch. A greater variety of Largemouth Bass sizes and ages were captured in 2016 compared to previous years. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Andrew include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Andrew fishery will be surveyed in the 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of the fish population was conducted on Lake Andrew in July of 2001. Andrew is a moderately sized lake located in Kandiyohi County. Sibley State Park (134 campsites) is located along the north shore of Andrew. Also, St. Andrew's Bible Camp and 100 lake homes/cabins exist along the lakeshore. Andrew receives high recreational and angling use in the summer from local residents, visitors to the state park and bible camp, and lakeshore homeowners. Water quality and clarity is good in Andrew. Aquatic vegetation is varied and abundant within the lake. The Upper Shakopee Creek Watershed includes Andrew and several upstream (Henchien, Middle, Games, Norway) and downstream (Florida) connected lakes. The watershed is varied with hardwoods, wetlands, agricultural row crops, feedlots, grasslands, and residential homes. An intensive watershed study of water flow and nutrient runoff was conducted on Andrew, Games, and Norway Lakes in addition to associated inlets from 1996-1998. Presently, a group of private landowners and public conservation agency personnel are involved in the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Watershed Project which encourages landowners to implement best management practices through grant funding, utilizing existing government programs, education, and technical assistance. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Andrew for a variety of fish species that include walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch.Black crappie numbers were low in 2001 (1.2 fish/gillnet) compared to the last two previous surveys (7.5 fish/gillnet in 1998, 7.8 fish/gillnet in 1996). The 2001 black crappie average size was small (0.39 lbs, 7.2 inches). Black crappie growth rates in Andrew were generally above average compared to Spicer Area lakes. Local anglers reported good success for catching black crappie during the winters and springs of recent years. The largest black crappie captured in the 2001 survey was 12.3 inches.Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2001 (24.9 fish/trapnet), but below the historical average catch rate (33.7 fish/trapnet). The 2001 bluegill size was small (0.13 lbs. and 5.2). However, there were good numbers (8.8 fish/trapnet) of large bluegill (>6 inches) present in 2001 compared to previous surveys. Bluegill growth rates in Andrew were below average for fish 4 years old and younger, but above average for 5 to 7 year old fish compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest bluegill captured in the 2001 survey was 8.2 inches.Largemouth bass numbers were high in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey (114.0 fish/hour). The 2001 largemouth bass catch rate was highest historical recorded estimate for Andrew. The 2001 largemouth bass average size from spring electrofishing (0.84 lbs. and 11.6 inches) was moderate compared to Spicer Area lakes. Largemouth bass growth rates in Andrew were below average compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest largemouth bass captured from the 2001 spring electrofishing survey was 16.7 inches.Northern pike numbers were abundant in 2001 (7.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (4.4 fish/gillnet). The 2001 northern pike average size (1.73 lbs. and 20.0 inches) was small. Approximately 47% of the northern pike captured were young fish that hatched in 1998. Northern pike growth rates in Andrew were below average compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest northern pike captured in the 2001 survey was 32.36 inches. A northern pike spawning area \"Sibley NPSA\" along the northeast side of Andrew is operated each spring for the production of northern pike fingerlings.Walleye numbers were abundant in 2001 (11.8 fish/gillnet) and the highest recorded catch rate for Andrew. The walleye historical average catch rate is 5.7 fish/gillnet. The 2001 walleye average size (1.12 lbs. and 14.5 inches) was moderate. Walleye growth rates in Andrew were below average for fish 4 years and younger, but above average for fish ages 5 to 8 years old compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest walleye captured in the 2001 survey was 26.3 inches. Walleye natural reproduction is generally insignificant during most years in Andrew, thus the population is maintained primarily by fingerling stockings.Yellow perch numbers were low in 2001 (3.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (25.2 fish/gillnet). The 2001 yellow perch average size (0.25 lbs. and 7.7 inches) was moderate. The largest yellow perch captured in the 2001 survey was 9.7 inches.Other notable fish species captured in the Andrew 2001 summer survey included low to moderate numbers of freshwater drum (2.7 fish/gillnet), moderate numbers of black bullhead (7.3 fish/gillnet), and abundant numbers of yellow bullhead (6.7 fish/gillnet). The historical averages were 2.8 fish/gillnet for freshwater drum, 14.3 fish/gillnet for black bullhead, and 4.4 fish/gillnet for yellow bullhead in Andrew.Current fish management activities on Andrew include protecting the important aquatic vegetation habitat through the permit process, participating in the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Watershed Project, operating the Sibley NPSA, and stocking walleye fingerlings every other year. The Andrew fishery will be surveyed again in the spring and summer of 2005.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Lake Andrew was conducted in late June/early July of 2019. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Targeted surveys conducted in 2019 included Score The Shore, IBI and Fall Electrofishing for young of year \"YOY\" fingerling sized Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nAndrew is a moderately sized (736 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Sibley State Park is located along the north and northwest shoreline areas. A bible camp is located along the east shore. Residential development (132 homes, 2010 survey) has occurred throughout the entire shoreline area with the exception of the northwest portion of the lake. DNR public access sites are located along the south and northwest sides (Sibley State Park) of the lake. A shore fishing pier is located along the north shore in Sibley State Park. The immediate watershed is a mixture of large hardwood stands, wetlands, agricultural row crops, and residential development. There are 14 inlets and an outlet (Shakopee Creek). Water levels were above normal during 2019. The largest inlet usually flows continuously from upstream lakes (Norway, Games, Swan, and Henchien) into the northwest side of Andrew. Lake Andrew is connected to several periodic winterkill (Henchien, Swan, and Middle) and non-winterkill lakes (Norway, Games, Florida) via Shakopee Creek and various small inlets. Nutrient levels were low during June of 2010. Dissolved oxygen levels were above 5.0 ppm at depths down to 22 feet during the survey. Water clarity (secchi=10.00 feet) was excellent on June 27, 2019. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) is abundant along the northwest bay and north shore areas in Andrew. Various submergent vegetation species (i.e. bladderwort, coontail, sago pondweed, Canada waterweed, bushy pondweed, flat-stemmed pondweed, muskgrass, clasping-leaf pondweed, northern milfoil) are frequently occurring within the littoral zone areas. Prior to 2018, Eurasian watermilfoil \"EWM\" and Zebra Mussels \"ZM\" were present in lakes both upstream and downstream of Andrew. Both were found in Andrew during 2019 (EWM) and 2018 (ZM). Shoalwater substrates are primarily sand, rubble, gravel and boulder. Andrew is known as a good multi-species fishery (i.e. Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Walleye). <br> \n <br> \nAndrew lies within the larger Chippewa River Watershed District and sub watershed of Upper Shakopee Creek. The Chippewa River Watershed District was the lead agency for coordinating: nutrient reduction measures, protection from invasive species, information/education, storm water management and the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project prior to 2019. The local Soil Water Conservation District is currently the lead agency. <br> \n <br> \nA comprehensive set of in-lake and watershed projects since the mid-1990's have been conducted/proposed as part of the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project (e.g., lakeshore re-vegetation demonstration sites, buffer strips and grassed  waterways, wetland restorations, septic system upgrades, livestock exclusion projects and other various agricultural and shoreland best management practice implementations) to reduce nutrient, bacteria and sediment inputs. The Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project was composed of individuals representing several lake associations (Florida, Norway & Games and Andrew), private landowners and various government agency personnel in order more efficiently enact beneficial watershed projects. Thus far, DNR Fisheries has provided assistance with lakeshore re-vegetation and water quality monitoring projects within the watershed. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in Andrew during 2019 (0.33 fish/trapnet), but the average size was large (0.83 pounds and 11.33 inches). Black Crappie growth rates were moderate. Black Crappie populations are often boom and bust with strong year classes dominating the anglers' catch for several years usually followed by poor catches until other strong year classes are produced. Black Crappie historical survey catches have been generally poor during the last decade in Andrew. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were moderate in 2019 (5.33 fish/gillnet) and similar to the historical average (5.35 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike average size was small (2.63 pounds and 22.55 inches) from 2019 gillnets. There were few Northern Pike caught over 25.00 inches with the largest being 32.09 inches. Northern Pike growth rates were slow in Andrew. Winter spearing is popular near the shallow northwest portion \"Como Beach\" of the lake. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Andrew in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2019 (0.67 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 20.31 fish/gillnet for Andrew. The 2019 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.13 pounds and 6.50 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were high in 2019 (8.33 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average catch rate (6.56 fish/gillnet). The 2019 Walleye average size was small (0.87 pounds and 12.97 inches) because the majority of fish (34%) came from the 2017 year class. Walleye growth rates were moderate in Andrew. The Walleye population in Andrew is due primarily to stocking. Limited Walleye natural reproduction has been documented by past surveys. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant from fry stocked years of 2017 (52.00 YOY/hour, 6.61 inches) and 2019 (72.00 YOY/hour, 5.61 inches) as documented by fall electrofishing surveys. Andrew was recently stocked with Walleye in 2011 (29,250 fingerlings; 1,054 pounds), 2013 (29,278 fingerlings; 890 pounds), 2015 (9,925 Spicer Strain fingerlings, yearlings and adults; 1,203 pounds), 2017 (300,538 Spicer Strain fry) and 2019 (294,698 Spicer Strain fry). Walleye angling success reports have been sporadic in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2019 (6.67 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (27.49 fish/trapnet) for Andrew. The 2019 Bluegill average size was moderate (0.17 pounds and 5.95 inches) from trapnets, but there were no fish caught over 8.00 inches. Bluegill growth rates were moderate in Andrew. The 2015 year class comprised 65% of the 2019 Bluegill survey catch. Bluegill angling is popular throughout the year in Andrew. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass spring electrofishing was not conducted in Andrew during 2019. Previously, a Largemouth Bass electrofishing survey was conducted during (post spawn conditions) early June of 2016 at six sites. The 2016 Largemouth Bass catch rate was moderate (17.59 fish/hour). The 2016 Largemouth Bass average size was moderate (1.20 pounds and 12.26 inches). Spring night time electrofishing surveys prior to 2016 were done with a different sampling methodology for timing (pre-spawn) and sample station selection.  <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum numbers were low in 2019 (1.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (2.89 fish/gillnet) for Andrew. The 2019 Freshwater Drum average size was large (2.83 pounds and 17.93 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Andrew include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Andrew fishery will be surveyed in the 2024 spring for Largemouth Bass and 2022 summer for all fish species. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Andrew is a moderate sized (814 acres) lake with a maximum depth of 26 feet. Andrew is a moderately productive lake. Andrew is one of the better local lakes in terms of water quality. Submergent vegetation (muskgrass, northern water milfoil) is especially abundant in the northwest bay and north shore areas. Large stands of emergent vegetation (primarily hardstem bulrush) are located in the northwest bay and smaller stands along the north shore. There are four major inlets and one outlet (Shakopee Creek). Andrew is connected to three upstream periodic winterkill lakes (Swan, Henchien and Middle Lakes) which fish (northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill) often move into from Andrew. Norway and Games Lakes are connected to Andrew via the outlet at Games through Swan and Henchien. In 1993, there were 128 residential homes/cabins along the lake in addition to St.Andrew Church Camp on the northeast shore and Sibley State Park along the north shore. One public access is located on the south shore and another on the north shore in Sibley State Park. A public fishing pier is also located in Sibley State Park. The surrounding watershed is composed of about 70% mixed hardwoods, 25% agricultural row crops, and 5% marshlands. Primary species management has been directed towards walleye, northern pike, and black crappie with secondary species management towards bluegill and largemouth bass. Andrew has been stocked every even year with walleye at 3 lbs/littoral acre since 1986. In 1991, an estimated 14,484 northern pike fingerlings were produced from the Sibley Northern Pike Spawning Area. In addition to walleye and northern pike, there were some small amounts of largemouth bass, bluegill and black crappie stocked during the 1970's and early 1980's. Commercial fishermen have removed 76,475 lbs of bullhead, 1,035 lbs of carp, 275 lbs of bowfin, and 505 lbs of sucker since 1980. Andrew has been noted as an excellent panfish (black crappie, bluegill), largemouth bass, and northern pike lake in addition to good periodic walleye fishing.      Winter and summer creel surveys were conducted during 1983-84 and 1991-92 (MN DNR F-29-R(P)-12, Study 4, Job 273, 3-28-94). Angling success was considered fair to poor during the winter and summer of 1992 compared to previous reports from locals. In the winter of 1991-92, angling pressure was 7,523 hours of which 1,005 hours were from spearing. Anglers harvested an estimated 1,033 black crappie, 716 sunfish spp., 278 yellow perch, 224 northern pike (115 from spearing), and 130 walleye during the 1991-92 winter. In the summer of 1992, angling pressure was 17,248 hours. Anglers harvested an estimated 3,000 sunfish spp., 227 largemouth bass, 159 black crappie, 61 northern pike, and 29 walleye during the 1992 summer.     Walleye abundance in 1993 (6.5 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (1.3 - 5.7 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (4.9 fish/gillnet). The highest abundance was recorded in 1954 (8.8 fish/gillnet). The 1993 average size (2.3 lbs) was also above the historical average (1.5 lbs). Growth rates appear average compared to local lakes. It appears that some natural reproduction does occur in Andrew according to scale analysis, however, future fall electrofishing will provide a better quantitative measure of the contribution of stocking and natural reproduction.     Northern pike catch rate in 1993 (2.2 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (3.5 - 10.8 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (4.2 fish/gillnet). The highest recorded density occurred in 1990 (8.2 fish/gillnet). The 1993 average size (2.8 lbs) was above the historical average (2.2 lbs). The largest fish captured was 30.2 inches. Growth rates appear slightly above average compared to other local lakes.      Largemouth bass 1993 electrofishing catch rate (69.1 fish/hour) appears to be moderate to above average compared to other local lakes, but lower than the 1992 catch rate which was 107 fish/hour. The largemouth bass population size above 5 inches long was estimated to be 4,890 largemouth bass of which 80% were between 5 - 10 inches in length. The average size in 1993 (8.7 inches) declined compared to 1992 (10.9 inches). The average size of largemouth bass harvested (13.2 inches) by anglers during the 1992 summer which was within the most common length group caught during the 1992 spring survey. Growth rates appear slightly below average for fish older than 5 years compared to local lakes.     Black crappie abundance in 1993 (0.8 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (0.6 - 2.5 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (3.0 fish/trapnet). The highest recorded abundance was 7.6 fish/trapnet in 1954. The 1993 average size was the same as the historical average (0.4 lbs). Growth rates appear slightly below average compared to local lakes.     Bluegill catch rate in 1993 (70.4 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (6.0 - 49.6 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (38.7 fish/trapnet). The average size was 5.9 inches in 1993. The average weight in 1993 (0.1 lbs) was slightly below the historical average (0.2 lbs). Growth rates appear below average compared to local lakes.     Yellow perch abundance in 1993 (29.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.7 - 39.0 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and similar to the historical average (31.5 fish/gillnet). The average size was 6.6 inches in 1993. Growth rates appear average compared to other area lakes.     Freshwater drum \"Sheepshead\" abundance in 1993 (1.8 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (2.9 fish/gillnet). The 1993 average size was the same as the historical average (2.5 lbs). There was no reported harvest of freshwater drum from anglers in the summer creel of 1992. About 4,000 lbs of freshwater drum were removed during the 1960's, but none have been removed by commercial fishermen since.     Black bullhead abundance in 1993 (16.1 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (0.3 - 2.6 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (5.4 fish/trapnet). The 1993 catch rate was also the highest recorded. The 1993 average size was the same as the historical average (0.3 lbs). After completion of the 1993 survey, a commercial fishermen removed 5,200 lbs of bullhead in the fall of 1993. Unlike Andrew, black bullhead abundance in other area lakes have substantially declined during the last several years.     Maintaining of a diverse fishery in Andrew is the best management approach for the various recreational users from Sibley State Park, private church camp, and local residents. Priority management should concentrate on protecting (northwest bay area, north shore) and expanding existing hardstem bulrush stands through planting (north shore). Further evaluations (fall electrofishing) are needed to determine the contributions of natural reproduction and what frequency and rate of walleye stocking may also be needed when densities are low. Continued operation of the Sibley Northern Pike Spawning Area is a high priority to provide stronger year classes of northern pike to supplement angler demand. Largemouth bass are an important secondary species sought by anglers, however intensified harvest can occur for preferred size fish (>12.0 inches) when fishing success for other species (northern pike, walleye) is poor. A catch and release ethic for largemouth bass should be promoted to local anglers and especially to guests at Sibley State Park and St.Andrew Church Camp. Black crappie management hinges on the continued protection of habitat (hardstem bulrush), but other factors such as angler harvest, potential competition with walleye, and potential emigration to winterkill lakes (Swan, Henchien, Middle) may also be important influences on population density and size structure. In future Andrew lake surveys (1995), summer trapnet and spring electrofishing surveys should be also conducted in Swan, Henchien, and Middle Lakes to determine the extent of potential fish movement, population size density and size structure within these lakes. If significant populations of above average size gamefish occurs, then existing access to Swan, Henchien, and Middle Lakes should be improved to allow anglers to better utilize these gamefish which may be susceptible to periodic winterkill. The positive benefits of increased growth of black crappie and bluegill in these productive lakes (Swan, Henchien, Middle) may outweigh the negative effects of periodic winterkill if anglers can better access these fish. A proposal for black crappie experimental regulations will also be pursued for Norway-Games-Andrew Lakes chain. Bluegill management also hinges upon continued protection of hardstem bulrush stands, emigration of fish into winterkill lakes (Swan, Henchien, and Middle Lakes), predator density, and directed angler harvest. Commercial fishermen should be encouraged to remove bullhead, carp, and freshwater drum.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Lake Andrew was conducted from July 30-31, 2018 by the Spicer Area Fisheries Office staff. Andrew is a moderate (759 acres), moderately clear and deep (26 feet maximum) lake with moderate submergent and emergent vegetation located in Kandiyohi County. Zebra mussels are present both upstream (Norway and Games) and downstream (Florida) of Andrew, but have not been found presently in the lake. Andrew is located in the Chippewa River Watershed. Seine hauls were conducted at 11 of 14 Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity \"FIBI\" stations with a bag seine of 50 foot width and 1/8 inch bar mesh in depths of 3.5 feet or less. Seine hauls were also conducted at 2 stations with a bag seine of 15 foot width and 1/8 inch bar mesh in depths of 3.5 feet or less. Near shore electrofishing was conducted at all 13 of 14 FIBI Stations with a back-pack unit in water depths generally less than 2 feet deep. The 14 FIBI Stations were spaced equally apart around the entire shoreline of the lake in a variety of near shore habitats. Each station was approximately 100 feet long. Two back-pack electrofishing runs were conducted with the initial run of 100 feet near the shore-water interface in depths of < 1 foot and the second run of 100 feet long about 10-20 feet from shore in depths up to 2 feet. Two stations were not sampled (S582 and EFB3) due to abundant emergent vegetation, soft bottom sediments or other debris prohibiting the gear. <br> \n <br> \nApproximately 18 different fish species (10 species from back-pack electrofishing, and 16 species from seining) were captured from electrofishing and seining combined. Fish species captured included gamefish (i.e. Walleye and Largemouth Bass), panfish (Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, and Hybrid Sunfish), potentially large sized non-gamefish (Yellow Bullhead and White Sucker) and small sized non-gamefish (Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Banded Killifish, Fathead Minnow, Bluntnose Minnow, Tadpole Madtom, Logperch, Spottail Shiner and Golden Shiner). Intolerant habitat disturbance species included Iowa Darter, Logperch and Banded Killifish captured in Andrew. High tolerant habitat disturbance species included Green Sunfish and Fathead Minnow. <br> \n <br> \nData from this 2018 targeted nearshore survey was combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in July of 2015 to calculate a Tool-2 FIBI score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score of 37 for Andrew based on this survey is below the impairment threshold of 45 for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Chippewa River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Andrew Lake was conducted on June 18-19, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Fourteen sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each station was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15 or 50-foot seine.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample eleven stations and a 15-foot seine was used to sample three stations with steep-sided shorelines.  Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Logperch) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Common Carp and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data are combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from the 2019 FIBI survey provides supporting evidence that the fish community in Andrew Lake is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community in Andrew Lake to the Chippewa River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Andrew is a moderately deep and sized lake located in Kandiyohi County. Sibley StatePark borders the north shore of Andrew. The water quality and clarity are usually goodthroughout the summer months. Nutrient productivity is moderate in Andrew. There are abundantstands of hardstem bulrush along the northwest bay and north shore. Submergent vegetationdensities are moderate to high during the summer months. Andrew is a popular angling lake forlargemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, and northern pike. Walleye fishing is fair forlarger fish. The Sibley Northern Pike Spawning Area \"NPSA\" is operated along the northeastshore each spring for the production of northern pike fingerlings. Sibley NPSA produced23,926 northern pike fingerlings in 1998, 16,017 fingerlings in 1997, and 5,093 fingerlingsin 1996. DNR Spicer Fisheries personnel stocks walleye fingerlings into Andrew every otheryear. Andrew was last stocked with 17,713 walleye fingerlings and 235 yearlings in 1997.Walleye natural reproduction does occasionally occur in Andrew, however it often results inminimal success for producing large year classes. We documented low young of year \"YOY\"walleye numbers in the 1995 fall night electrofishing survey and no YOY walleye in 1997. LakeAndrew is part of the Shakopee Creek Watershed. Presently, a water quality and flow study\"Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project\" is being conducted on various inlets and outlets ofNorway, Games, and Andrew Lakes. The goals of the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Watershed Projectare to identify high nutrient runoff sources and provide incentives for private landownersto implement best management practices within the watershed.     Largemouth bass were moderately abundant in the 1998 spring electrofishing survey (43.71fish/hour), but below the historical average (65.17 fish/hour). The 1998 springelectrofishing largemouth bass average length (11.8 inches) was above the historical average(10.9 inches). The largest bass captured during the 1998 spring electrofishing survey was20.5 inches. The 1995 year class comprised a majority of the 1998 spring bass catch.     Black crappie were abundant in 1998 (7.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the historicalaverage (3.05 fish/gillnet). The 1998 black crappie average size (0.33 lbs, gillnets.) wasgood and slightly above the historical average (0.28 lbs.). The 1996 black crappie year classaccounted for the majority (87%) of the 1998 survey catch.     Bluegill numbers were low in 1998 (13.42 fish/trapnet) compared to the historicalaverage (34.66 fish/trapnet). The 1998 bluegill average length was moderate (5.6 inches,gillnets and trapnets combined) and the same as the historical average. The largest bluegillcaptured was 8.2 inches. The 1994 year class comprised the majority of bluegill captured inthe 1998 survey nets.     Northern pike numbers were moderate in 1998 (5.00 fish/gillnet), but slightly above thehistorical average (4.08 fish/gillnet). The 1998 northern pike average size was small (2.11lbs.), but similar to the historical average (2.20 lbs.). The largest northern pike capturedin the 1998 survey was 35.2 inches. The 1997 northern pike year class comprised 49% of the1998 survey catch.     Walleye numbers were abundant for Andrew in 1998 (8.17 fish/gillnet) compared to thehistorical average (5.03 fish/gillnet). The 1998 walleye average weight (1.80 lbs.) waslarge, but the same as the historical average. The largest walleye captured in the 1998survey was 29.6 inches. The 1996 walleye year class comprised 37% of the 1998 walleye surveycatch. The 1996 walleye year class is probably due to both natural reproduction and stocking(235 yearlings in 1997).     Yellow perch numbers were low in 1998 (14.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historicalaverage (27.71 fish/gillnet). The 1998 yellow perch average length (6.3 inches, gillnets andtrapnets combined) was small.     Freshwater drum numbers were moderate in 1998 (3.50 fish/gillnet) compared to thehistorical average (3.15 fish/gillnet). The 1998 freshwater drum average size (2.46 lbs.) wassimilar to the historical average (2.62 lbs.).     Andrew provides a diverse fishery for local residents and visitors. Andrew has been aconsistent black crappie fishery unlike many other local lakes. Presently, crappie fishingin Andrew and other lakes in the watershed was excellent during the 1998-99 winter. Althoughlargemouth bass numbers are down slightly, the average size has increased. In addition thereare some big bass (>18.0 inches) present in Andrew. Other species such as northern pike andwalleye are present in sufficient numbers which should provide anglers with good fishingopportunities during the next few years. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office will continue toparticipate with other agencies and private individuals in the Shakopee Creek HeadwatersProject. In addition, DNR Spicer Fisheries personnel will monitor adult fish populationnumbers every four years by summer test netting and spring electrofishing, and monitorwalleye natural reproduction every two years by fall night electrofishing in order toevaluate current management practices on Andrew.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Andrew was conducted during September 13, 2017. Andrew is a moderate sized (736 acres), shallow to moderate depth (26 feet maximum), moderate water clarity (5-10 feet secchi), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Submergent and emergent aquatic vegetation species are abundant within Andrew. There are abundant numbers of Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike during most years in Andrew.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Andrew was due primarily to fingerling stockings based on previous summer surveys, historical data review and limited Walleye natural reproduction documented by past fall electrofishing surveys. Although past Walleye fingerlings stockings have been successful, a less expensive Walleye fry stocking was attempted in 2017. Additional fry stockings will occur in the near future (2019 and 2021), in order to evaluate a change in Walleye stocking strategies for Andrew and several other area lakes (Games, Florida, Monson and Eagle). Walleye fingerling/yearling stockings are contingent the same year if the fry stocking is unsuccessful as documented by fall electrofishing. Andrew was recently stocked with Walleye in 2009 (27,462 fingerlings, 878 pounds; 12 yearlings, 2 pounds), 2011 (29,250 fingerlings, 1,054 pounds), 2013 (29,278 fingerlings, 890 pounds), 2015 (728 fingerlings, 20 pounds; 818 yearlings, 468 pounds; 232 adults, 179 pounds) and 2017 (300,538 Spicer strain fry).  <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers (52.00 YOY/hour, 6.61 inches average length) were caught (fry stocked year) in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. One yearling Walleye (2.00 fish/hour, 10.39 inches average length) was also caught in 2017. Walleye fry were stocked loose from a truck fish tank with a stocking tube at the Lake Florida public access site, unlike successful (>50 YOY/hour) fry stocked lakes such as Games and Andrew. These successful lakes were stocked by boat with 5-6 jugs (each 5 gallon size jug containing oxygen, water and fry) in the deeper portion near the middle of the lake during 2017. Predation upon fry by other fish (i.e. Bluegill or other species) may be greater in the near shore areas of moderate to excellent clarity lakes like Andrew, Games and Florida. Both fry stocking methods have been successful in shallow and turbid lakes during the past. Two prior fall electrofishing surveys were conducted in Andrew during the early 1990's, but YOY Walleye catch rates were low (0.00-18.18 YOY/hour) due to natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Andrew include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Andrew fishery will be surveyed in the 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

Submergent vegetation densities are moderate within the littoral zone areas. Invasive species such as Eurasian watermilfoil (2019) and Zebra Mussels (2018) are recently present in Andrew. Shoalwater substrates are primarily sand, rubble, gravel and boulder.  <br> \n  <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers (61.33 YOY/hour, 6.07 inches) were documented in the 2021 fall electrofishing survey (fry stocked year). YOY Walleye numbers during previous fry stocked years were also abundant in 2019 (72.00 YOY/hour, 5.61 inches) and 2017 (52.00 YOY/hour, 6.61 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. Initially, Walleye fry stockings appear successful in Andrew. Further standard summer sampling of the adult Walleye population will confirm if strong year classes are recruited into the fishery from fry stockings.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (8.33 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range for similar lakes in the most recent 2019 standard summer survey. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 6.56 fish/gillnet for Andrew. The 2019 Walleye average size was small (0.87 pounds and 12.97 inches) from gillnets. The 2017 year class comprised 34% of the 2019 Walleye summer survey catch. The Walleye population in Andrew historically has been maintained due primarily to stocking. Walleye fingerling stocking was the primary mechanism for maintaining the Walleye fishery in Andrew prior to 2017. Walleye fry stocking at 1,000 per littoral acre (293,000 fry) is the current Walleye management strategy for Andrew. Recent Walleye stockings occurred in 2013 (29,278 fingerlings; 890 pounds), 2015 (9,925 Spicer Strain fingerlings, yearlings and adults; 1,203 pounds), 2017 (300,538 Spicer Strain fry), 2019 (294,698 Spicer Strain fry) and 2021 (277,262 Spicer Strain fry). Local residents have reported good fishing opportunities for Walleye in Andrew during recent years. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Andrew include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Andrew fishery will be surveyed in in the 2022 fall by electrofishing for YOY Walleye, the 2024 spring by electrofishing for Largemouth Bass and 2024 summer by standard survey gears for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A re-survey of Andrew was conducted in July of 2010. Andrew is a moderately sized (814 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Sibley State Park is located along the north and northwest shoreline areas. A bible camp is located along the east shore. Residential development (132 homes) has occurred throughout the entire shoreline area with the exception of the northwest portion of the lake. DNR public access sites are located along the south and northwest sides (Sibley State Park) of the lake. A shore fishing pier is located along the north shore in Sibley State Park. The immediate watershed is a mixture of large hardwood stands, wetlands, agricultural row crops, and residential development. There are 14 inlets and an outlet (Shakopee Creek). The major inlet (IN1) usually flows continuously from upstream lakes (Norway, Games, Swan, Henchien) into the northwest side of Andrew. Andrew is connected to several periodic winterkill (Henchien, Swan, and Middle) and non-winterkill lakes (Norway, Games, Florida) via Shakopee Creek and various small inlets. Nutrient levels (total phosphorus=0.010 ppm, Chlorophyll-a=3.7 ppb) were low during June of 2010. Dissolved oxygen levels were above 5.0 ppm at depths down to 20 feet. Water levels were high during the spring, but near normal by late summer and fall of 2010. Water clarity (secchi=10.00 feet) was good to excellent in July of 2010. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) is abundant along the northwest bay and north shore areas in Andrew. Submergent vegetation densities (i.e. bladderwort, narrow-leaf pondweed, muskgrass, clasping-leaf pondweed, northern milfoil) are also abundant within the littoral zone (, 15 feet deep) areas. Shoal water substrates are primarily sand, rubble, and gravel. Andrew is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill. Walleye stockings (primarily fingerlings) are scheduled for every other year in Andrew.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low in 2010 (0.60 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Andrew and similar lakes. The black crappie gillnet historical average catch rate was 2.46 fish/gillnet for Andrew. The 2010 black crappie average size was moderate (0.31 pounds and 7.82 inches) from gillnets.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Lake Andrew during September 28, 2022. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Fall electrofishing was conducted at five stations for a total of 45 minutes. The water temperature was 60 F. during the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. Submergent vegetation densities were generally light to moderate at the different stations in 2022. Water clarity was good (3.0 feet plus). We observed abundant numbers of Bluegill and shiner species with moderate numbers of Yellow Perch in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nAndrew is a moderately sized (736 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Sibley State Park is located along the north and northwest shoreline areas. A bible camp is located along the east shore. Residential development (132 homes, 2010 survey) has occurred throughout the entire shoreline area with the exception of the northwest portion of the lake. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) is abundant along the northwest bay and north shore areas in Andrew. Various submergent vegetation species (i.e. bladderwort, coontail, sago pondweed, Canada waterweed, bushy pondweed, flat-stemmed pondweed, muskgrass, clasping-leaf pondweed, northern milfoil) are frequently occurring within the littoral zone areas. Prior to 2018, Eurasian watermilfoil \"EWM\" and Zebra Mussels \"ZM\" were present in lakes both upstream and downstream of Andrew. Both were found in Andrew during 2019 (EWM) and 2018 (ZM). Shoalwater substrates are primarily sand, rubble, gravel and boulder. Spawning Walleye have been occasionally observed near the mouth of Henchien Lake Inlet during the spring. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, the Walleye population in Andrew was maintained primarily by stocking. Limited Walleye natural reproduction had been documented by past surveys. Walleye fingerling stocking was the primary mechanism for maintaining the Walleye fishery in Andrew prior to 2017. Walleye fry stocking at 1,000 per littoral acre (293,000 fry) is the current Walleye management stocking strategy for Andrew. Recent Walleye stockings occurred in 2013 (29,278 fingerlings; 890 pounds), 2015 (9,925 Spicer Strain fingerlings, yearlings and adults; 1,203 pounds), 2017 (300,538 Spicer Strain fry), 2019 (294,698 Spicer Strain fry), 2021 (277,262 Spicer Strain fry) and 2022 (219,750 Spicer Strain fry). Local residents have reported good fishing opportunities for Walleye in Andrew during recent years. <br> \n  <br> \nModerate YOY Walleye numbers (30.67 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches) were documented in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey (fry stocked year). YOY Walleye numbers during previous fry stocked years were abundant in 2021 (61.33 YOY/hour, 6.1 inches), 2019 (72.00 YOY/hour, 5.6 inches) and 2017 (52.00 YOY/hour, 6.6 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. The Andrew YOY Walleye average catch rate and length are 39.03 YOY/hour and 6.3 inches respectively. Adult Walleye (age 2) were present in moderate numbers (6.67 fish/hour), but were small (10.4 inches) during the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. Initially, fry stockings appear successful in Andrew. Further standard summer sampling of the adult Walleye population will confirm if strong year classes are recruited into the fishery due to Walleye fry stockings.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (8.33 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range for similar lakes in the most recent 2019 standard summer survey. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 6.56 fish/gillnet for Andrew. The 2019 Walleye average size was small (0.87 pounds and 13.0 inches) from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were fair. The 2017 year class comprised 34% of the 2019 Walleye summer survey catch.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Andrew include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. Walleye fry are currently scheduled for stocking in 2024. The Andrew fishery will be surveyed in the 2024 fall for YOY Walleye by electrofishing, 2024 spring for Largemouth Bass by electrofishing and 2024 summer by standard survey gears for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Andrew is a moderate sized (814 acres) lake with a maximum depth of 26 feet. Thelittoral area comprises 36% of the total surface area. Andrew is a moderately productive lake(Total Phosphorus=0.015 ppm on 6-15-93, 0.032 ppm on 7-10-90). The secchi disk reading was8.4 feet on 7-7-93 and 5.6 feet on 7-24-96. Andrew is one of the better local lakes in termsof water quality. Submergent vegetation is common along most of the 10-15 feet contour line.Submergent vegetation is especially abundant in the northwest bay and north shore areas. Themost frequently occurring submergent species include muskgrass, northern water milfoil,claspingleaf pondweed, flatstem pondweed, water moss, and coontail. Large stands of emergentvegetation (primarily hardstem bulrush) are located in the northwest bay and smaller standsalong the north shore. Sand and gravel are the most frequently occurring substrates inaddition to moderate occurrences of boulder and rubble. There are one major inlet (Henchien),several smaller inlets/tile/culverts and one outlet (Shakopee Creek). Andrew is connected tothree upstream periodic winterkill lakes (Swan, Henchien and Middle Lakes) which fish(northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill) often move into from Andrew. Norwayand Games Lakes are connected to Andrew via the outlet at Games through Swan and HenchienLakes. In 1993, there were 128 residential homes/cabins along the lake in addition toSt.Andrew Church Camp on the northeast shore and Sibley State Park along the north shore. Onepublic access is located on the south shore and another on the north shore in Sibley StatePark. A public fishing pier is also located in Sibley State Park. The surrounding watershedis composed of about 70% mixed hardwoods, 25% agricultural row crops, and 5% marshlands.Primary species management has been directed towards walleye, northern pike, and blackcrappie with secondary species management towards bluegill and largemouth bass. In 1995Andrew was stocked with 21,337 walleye fingerlings (1,161 lbs). Andrew had been stocked withwalleye fingerlings generally at 3 lbs/littoral acre (about 879 lbs) every even year priorto 1995. In 1984, almost 10 lbs/littoral acre was stocked. Walleye will be stocked every oddyear beginning in 1995 unless fall electrofishing indicates that natural reproduction isadequate. The Sibley Northern Pike Spawning Area \"NPSA\" has been operated annually. In 1996,an estimated 5,093 northern pike fingerlings were produced in Sibley NPSA (Figure 1.). Inaddition to walleye and northern pike, there were some small amounts of largemouth bass,bluegill and black crappie stocked during the 1970's and early 1980's. Commercial fishermenhave removed 76,475 lbs of bullhead, 3,735 lbs of carp, 42,400 lbs of buffalo fish, 8,000 lbsof freshwater drum, 275 lbs of bowfin, and 505 lbs of sucker since 1980. Andrew has beennoted as an excellent panfish (black crappie, bluegill), largemouth bass, and northern pikelake in addition to good periodic walleye fishing.      Winter and summer creel surveys were conducted during 1983-84 and 1991-92 (MN DNR F-29-R(P)-12, Study 4, Job 273, 3-28-94). In the winter of 1991-92, angling pressure was 7,523hours of which 1,005 hours were from spearing. Anglers harvested an estimated 1,033 blackcrappie, 716 sunfish species., 278 yellow perch, 224 northern pike (115 from spearing), and130 walleye during the 1991-92 winter. In the summer of 1992, angling pressure was 17,248hours. Anglers harvested an estimated 3,000 sunfish species., 227 largemouth bass, 159 blackcrappie, 61 northern pike, and 29 walleye during the 1992 summer. Fishing success wasconsidered poor for Lake Andrew during the 1991-92 creel survey period.     Walleye abundance in 1996 (2.5 fish/gillnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (3.3 - 8.8 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, and below the historicalaverage (4.6 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (3.3 lbs) was above the historical average(1.8 lbs). The largest walleye captured in the 1996 survey was 28.3 inches. The 1996 PSD andRSD-P was 86.7 and 73.3 respectively. Growth rates appear average compared to other locallakes. There were no dominant walleye year classes surveyed in the 1996 survey. There islimited natural reproduction of walleye occurring within Andrew, however, supplementalfingerling stocking is probably needed to maintain adequate numbers. The young of year \"YOY\"walleye relative abundance in the 1995 fall electrofishing survey was 18.2 YOY/hour (6.4inches average size). A fall electrofishing survey is scheduled for 1997 to evaluate walleyenatural reproduction in order to determine if stocking is necessary in 1997. Angler successfor walleye was generally poor in 1996. Anglers usually have the greatest success catchingwalleye at night on Andrew.     Northern pike abundance in 1996 (2.5 fish/gillnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (2.8 - 9.0 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, and below the historicalaverage (4.0 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (21.9 inches from gillnets and trapnets)was slightly above the historical average (21.1 inches). The largest northern pike capturedin the 1996 survey was 26.4 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 66.7 and 0 respectively.Growth rates appear below average for ages IV-VII compared to other lakes. The 1994 yearclass composed 39% of the total survey catch. Northern pike fingerling production within theSibley NPSA was 5,093 fish in 1996, however, production may have been higher due fish leavingthe pond during high water over dam boards prior to draining the pond. Potential naturalnorthern pike spawning areas include the Middle Lake inlet area, and Henchien Lake. Northernpike angling was generally poor during the 1996 summer according to local reports.     Black crappie abundance in 1996 (10.0 fish/trapnet) was above the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.4 - 2.3 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 27, and above the historicalaverage (3.5 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (6.9 inches from gillnets and trapnets) wasbelow the historical average (8.4 inches). The largest black crappie captured in the 1996survey was 11.4 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 6.4 and 0 respectively. Growth ratesappear slightly below average for age III compared to other local lakes. The 1994 year classcomposed 69% of the total survey catch. There were reports of angler success for blackcrappie during the 1996-97 winter.     Bluegill abundance in 1996 (28.4 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile (4.4 - 49.0 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 27, but below the historical average(37.3 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (5.1 inches from trapnets and gillnets) was belowthe historical average (5.6 inches). The largest bluegill captured in the 1996 survey was 7.6inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 31.6 and 0 respectively. Growth rates appear averagecompared to other area lakes. The 1994 year class composed 39% of the total survey catch.Anglers had good success for bluegill, but the fish were small during the summer of 1996.     Yellow perch abundance in 1996 (15.0 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (7.0 - 46.3 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, but below the historicalaverage (29.4 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (6.2 inches from gillnets and trapnets)was slightly below the historical average (6.6 inches). The largest fish captured in 1996 was8.3 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 2.2 and 0 respectively. Growth rates appear averagecompared to local lakes. About 67% of the fish captured belonged to the 1994 year class.     Freshwater drum abundance in 1996 (1.2 fish/gillnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (2.0 - 9.4 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, and slightly below thehistorical average (2.7 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (19.5 inches from gillnets andtrapnets) was above the historical average (18.1 inches). Commercial fishermen removed about8,000 lbs (fish > 1 lb each) of freshwater drum during March of 1996.     Carp abundance in 1996 (0.4 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.2 - 1.0 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 27, and the same as thehistorical average. The 1996 average size (17.5 inches from gillnets and trapnets) was belowthe historical average (24.2 inches). Commercial fishermen removed a total of 2,700 lbs(mostly 4 lbs or greater per fish) during the spring of 1996 and January of 1997.     Black bullhead abundance in 1996 (0.4 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.3 - 2.6 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 27, but below the historicalaverage (4.1 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (10.6 inches) was similar to the historicalaverage (10.5 inches).     There was no spring electrofishing survey conducted on Andrew in 1996 because of timeand work load constraints in the 1996 spring. The last spring electrofishing survey forlargemouth bass was conducted in 1993. The largemouth bass 1993 electrofishing catch rate(69.1 fish/hour) was above average compared to other local lakes, but lower than the 1992catch rate which was 107 fish/hour. The Hutchinson Fisheries Research staff conducted aPetersen mark and recapture study on Andrew in 1993. They estimated a population size of4,890 (95% C.I. 2,317 - 11,285) largemouth bass of which 80% were between 5 - 10 inches inlength. The average size in 1993 (8.7 inches) declined compared to 1992 (10.9 inches).Likewise, the 1993 PSD and RSD-P (25 and 9 respectively) declined compared to 1992 (87 and18 respectively). The average size of largemouth bass harvested by anglers during the 1992summer was 13.2 inches. There were abundant numbers of largemouth bass in this length group(12-14 inches) that were captured during the 1992 spring survey. Growth rates appearedaverage for ages I-V, but slightly below average for ages V+ compared to local lakes duringthe 1993 spring survey.      A watershed study is currently in progress to determine the quantity and quality ofwater inflow into Andrew, Norway and Games Lakes. This study will provide valuableinformation in order to more effectively target limited dollars and effort to promote andenhance best management practices (planting buffer strips, conservation tillage, wetlandrestoration, updating dysfunctional septic systems, reducing lawn fertilizer, etc.) with thecooperation of private landowners within the watershed. Priority fisheries management shouldconcentrate on protecting (northwest bay area, north shore) and expanding existing hardstembulrush stands through planting (north shore). Further evaluations (fall electrofishing) areneeded to determine the contributions of natural reproduction and the amount (frequency andrate) of walleye stocking may also be needed when densities are low. The continued operationof the Sibley Northern Pike Spawning Area (when northern pike abundance < 5.0 fish/gillnetor yellow perch > 30.0 fish/gillnet) is a high priority to provide stronger year classes ofnorthern pike to supplement angler demand. Largemouth bass are an important secondary speciessought by anglers, however intensified harvest can occur for fish greater than 12.0 incheswhen fishing success for other species (northern pike, walleye) is poor. A catch and releaseethic for largemouth bass should be promoted to local anglers and especially to guests atSibley State Park and St.Andrew Church Camp. Black crappie management hinges on the continuedprotection of habitat (hardstem bulrush), but other factors such as angler harvest, potentialcompetition with walleye, and potential emigration to winterkill lakes (Henchien, Middle) mayalso be important influences on population density and size structure. Summer trapnet andspring electrofishing surveys should be conducted in Swan, Henchien, and Middle Lakes(concurrently with Lake Andrew surveys) in order to determine the extent of potential fishmovement, population size density, and size structure within these lakes. Existing access toSwan, Henchien, and Middle Lakes should be improved to allow anglers to better utilize thesegamefish which may be susceptible to periodic winterkill. The positive benefits of fastgrowth of black crappie and bluegill in these productive lakes (Swan, Henchien, Middle) mayoutweigh the negative effects of periodic winterkill (once every 5-10 years) if anglers canbetter access these fish. A proposal for black crappie experimental regulations will also bepursued for Norway and Games. If the regulation is successful then it would also beconsidered for Lake Andrew. Bluegill management also hinges upon continued protection ofhardstem bulrush stands, maintaining adequate predator densities, and promotion of catch andrelease of larger (> 7 inches) bluegill.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Lake Andrew was conducted in July of 2015. Andrew is a moderately sized (736 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Sibley State Park is a popular recreational area located along the north and northwest shoreline areas. A bible camp is located along the east shore. Residential development has occurred throughout the entire shoreline area with the exception of the northwest portion of the lake. DNR public access sites are located along the south and northwest sides (Sibley State Park) of the lake. A shore fishing pier is located along the north shore in Sibley State Park. Water levels were below normal during the spring and fall, but normal during the summer of 2015. Water clarity (secchi reading=11.00 feet) was excellent in July of 2015. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush) is abundant along the northwest bay and north shore areas of Andrew. Various submergent vegetation species (i.e. bladderwort, coontail, flat-stemmed pondweed, muskgrass, clasping-leaf pondweed, northern milfoil) are frequently occurring within the shallow areas (< 15 feet deep). Eurasian watermilfoil is present in lakes both upstream and downstream, but presently is not in Andrew. Shoalwater substrates are primarily sand, rubble, gravel and boulder with silt more common in the northwest corner of Andrew.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low (0.17 fish/trapnet) in 2015 as compared to the Andrew historical average (2.80 fish/trapnet). Black Crappie populations often cycle resulting in periods of boom or bust years. Black Crappie year classes have been weak in Andrew and other connected lakes during recent years. Yellow Perch numbers were also low in 2015 (4.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (21.82 fish/gillnet) and the normal range. Historically, Bluegill catch rates have been high and average sizes moderate in Andrew. However, Bluegill abundance was low in 2015 (13.67 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (29.09 fish/trapnet). The 2015 Bluegill average size was also small (0.15 pounds and 5.6 inches) from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were high in 2015 (8.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and Andrew historical average (5.35 fish/gillnet). However, the 2015 Northern Pike average size improved (2.77 pounds and 23.0 inches) compared to the historical average (2.16 pounds) from gillnets. In addition, several Northern Pike over 30 inches were captured in the 2015 survey.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate in 2015 (5.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range, but slightly below the Andrew historical average (6.42 fish/gillnet). The 2015 Walleye average size was large (3.25 pounds and 20.7 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye population in Andrew is due primarily to stocking. Limited Walleye natural reproduction has been documented by past surveys. Andrew was recently stocked with Walleye in 2009 (27,462 fingerlings, 878 pounds; 12 yearlings, 2 pounds), 2011 (29,250 fingerlings, 1,054 pounds), 2013 (29,278 fingerlings; 890 pounds) and 2015 (9,925 fingerlings, yearlings and adults combined; 1,203 pounds). The 2011 year class comprised 41% of the 2015 Walleye survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers have been historically abundant in Andrew. Spring electrofishing surveys Largemouth Bass more effectively than other gears such as gillnets and trapnets. Spring electrofishing was not conducted in 2015 due to time constraints with other management activities. The last Andrew spring electrofishing survey was conducted in 2010. Abundance was low in 2010 (26.25 fish/hour) compared to the Andrew historical average (66.80 fish/hour). The 2010 Largemouth Bass average size was moderate (0.85 pounds and 11.1 inches) and similar to Andrew spring electrofishing historical average.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of interest sampled in 2015 included low numbers of Black Bullhead (1.50 fish/gillnet), high numbers of Freshwater Drum (5.50 fish/gillnet) and no Common Carp. The Freshwater Drum historical average catch rate is 3.01 fish/gillnet for Andrew. The 2015 Freshwater Drum average size was moderate (2.53 pounds and 17.6 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Andrew include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Andrew fishery will be surveyed in the 2019 spring for Largemouth Bass and 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",
