The 1999 northern pike catch was within the normal range for lakes of this class, but their average size was small.  This was due to the domination of the catch by two-year-old fish from the 1997 year class.  Northern pike growth rates had been fairly fast, by area standards.  Two-year-old fish averaged 17.3 inches in length when collected in late June 1999.</p>",
