                "narrative": "<p>Black crappie trap-net abundance was 9.50 fish/set, which was well above most class 16 lakes.  However, black crappie abundance has often times been higher, especially in the mid-1980's.  In 2007, seven year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-10 years.  The 2003 year-class represented 64% of the sample.  Total length (TL) in trap nets ranged from 4.6-12.3 inches and the mean was 8.2.  Growth was slightly was below the area average.  The mean weight of black crappies captured in trap nets was 0.32 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net abundance was 1.58 fish/set, which was one of the lowest levels ever recorded on Myrtle Lake.  Conversely, the 2002 assessment was the highest abundance ever recorded on Myrtle Lake (23.67 fish/set).  Bluegills are warmwater fish, so wide variation in year-class strength is typical due to the fact that Myrtle Lake is located at the northern edge of their range.  In 2007, four year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-9 years.  The 2002 year-class represented 53% of the sample.  Total length in trap nets ranged from 3.2-8.3 inches and the mean was 6.5.  Growth was similar to area average.  The mean weight of bluegills captured in trap nets was 0.25 pounds, which was average for class 16 lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net abundance (12.11 fish/set) was the highest ever recorded for Myrtle Lake and well above most class 16 lakes.  Eight year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-11 years.  Several year-classes were well represented.  Mean length was 21.4 inches with a range from 10.4 to 30.9.  Growth was much lower than the area average.  The mean weight of northern pike captured in gill nets was slightly above what is found in most class 16 lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking records for Myrtle Lake date back to 1945 when fry were stocked.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked on three occassions from 1958 to 1965.  In 1967, a change back to fry was made and periodic stocking of fry continued through 1992, except in January 1984 when 532 adult walleyes (0.75lb each) were stocked.  Generally, fry stocking has been unsuccessful and natural reproduction has been unable to maintain index netting catches near the median.  Thus, starting in 2003, fingerling stocking resumed with a plan to stock every other year at a rate of 2 pounds per littoral acre. <br> \n <br> \nSuccess of stocking is dictated and confounded by many factors.  It would be irresponsible to try to evaluate the success of the new stocking protocol for Myrtle Lake with too few data points.  So, our goal for the first several investigations after the implementation of the new stocking protocol was to begin collecting information that when used with future investigations, will enable us to evaluate the stocking program for Myrtle Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2007, walleye gill-net abundance was 7.56 fish/set, which was near the median of 8.00 for class 16 lakes and the highest abundance observed since 1984.  Otoliths and scales were used to determine that eight year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-13 years.  The 2005 year-class represented 77% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 7.5-29.3 inches and the mean was 12.3.  Mean weight was 1.12 pounds, which was similar to the average observed in class 16 lakes.  Growth rate was good and exceeded the area average.      <br> \nYellow perch gill-net abundance was 35.11 fish/set, which was much greater than what is found in most class 16 lakes.  Seven year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 2-8 years.  Several strong year-classes were present in the sample.  Total length in gill nets ranged from 5.4-9.6 inches and the mean was 7.0.  Growth was similar to the area average.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Myrtle Lake is an 876 acre fishery located approximately seven miles east of the city of Orr, Minnesota. Myrtle has a maximum depth of 20 feet, and about 98% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. There is a public access on the east end of the lake with a concrete ramp and gravel lot. Myrtle Lake supports a fairly diverse fishery with populations of several species of gamefish that could be of interest to anglers. Myrtle Lake has no special regulations. Fishing regulations follow statewide regulations for inland waters. A standard fisheries survey was completed on Myrtle Lake in 2022 as part of a normal rotation of investigational surveys. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch rate was 3.0 fish per net, which was below average for similar lakes. Length ranged from 12.7 to 26.6 inches, with an average of 16.5 inches. Average weight was 1.8 pounds, which was well above average for similar lakes. A total of seven year-classes were present, and ranged from 4-20 years. Although Walleye abundance is less than similar lakes, size is above average. There are good numbers of Walleye in the 14\" - 20\" range, and a decent number over 20\" with the potential of catching a Walleye over 26\".  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trap net catch rate was 4.4 fish per net, which was above average for similar lakes. Length ranged from 4.5 to 10.0 inches, with an average of 8.1 inches. Average weight was 0.3 pounds, which was slightly below average for similar lakes. A total of eight year-classes were present, and ranged from 2-12 years. Myrtle Lake offers a good fishing opportunity with quality Black Crappie in the system.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catch rate was 4.1 fish per net, which was above average for similar lakes. Length ranged from 3.6 to 8.1 inches, with an average of 7.0 inches. Average weight was 0.3 pounds, which was above average for similar lakes. A total of six year-classes were present, and ranged from 2-8 years. Myrtle Lake offers a good fishing opportunity with quality Bluegills in the system.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch rate was 5.3 fish per net, which was above average for similar lakes. Length ranged from 11.6 to 36.6 inches, with an average of 23.3 inches. Average weight was 3.1 pounds, which was well above average for similar lakes. A total of 10 year-classes were present, and ranged from 1-10 years. There are good numbers of Northern Pike below 30\", providing a good fishing opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch rate was 10.6 fish per net, which was above average for similar lakes. Length ranged from 5.0 to 9.7 inches, with an average of 7.1 inches. Average weight was 0.2 pounds, which was below average for similar lakes. Yellow Perch can offer an additional fishing opportunity, but also offers great forage for Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye stocking records for Myrtle Lake date back to 1945 when fry were stocked.  Periodic stocking (mostly fry) continued through 1992.  Generally, fry stocking has been unsuccessful and natural reproduction has been unable to maintain index netting catches near the average for similar lakes.  Therefore, the strategy shifted to fingerling stocking in 2002.  The current plan is to stock every other year at a rate of 2 pounds per littoral acre.Success of stocking is dictated and confounded by many factors.  It would be irresponsible to try to evaluate the success of the new stocking protocol for Myrtle Lake with one year of new data.  So, our goal for the first survey after the implementation of the new stocking protocol was to begin collecting information that when used with future investigations, will enable us to evaluate the stocking program for Myrtle Lake.  In 2005, walleye gill-net abundance was 5.67 fish/set, which was below average for class 16 lakes.  Eight year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-12 years.  Length ranged from 6.6-26.7 inches and the average was 18.3.  Average weight was 2.61 pounds, which is greater than what is found in 75% of similar lakes.  Growth rate was good; length at age 4 was 16.0 inches, which exceeded the International Falls management area average of 14.4.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Myrtle Lake is an 876 acre fishery that is accessed about 8 miles east of the town of Orr, Minnesota. Myrtle has a maximum depth of 20 feet, and about 98% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. There is a public access on the east end of the lake with a concrete ramp and gravel lot. Myrtle Lake supports a fairly diverse fishery with populations of several species of gamefish that could be of interest to anglers. A standard fish survey was completed on Myrtle in 2017 as part of a normal rotation of investigational surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates during the 2017 survey were at a record high for Myrtle Lake, which has a long history of lake surveys dating back to at least 1951. There was an abundance of young fish caught in shallow trap nets, where the average size was about 7 inches. Larger fish were sampled in the deeper set gill nets, where they averaged just over 8 inches. While the 8 to 9 inch fish made up the bulk of what anglers could expect to encounter, there were larger Black Crappie up to 13 inches in the sample. <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill catch rates were also near record highs for Myrtle Lake. Similar to the Black Crappie population in Myrtle, there are good numbers of small to medium sized Bluegill in the lake. However, there are still some large fish present. Bluegill up to 8.5 inches were caught in trap nets, and gill nets sampled some up to 9.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBass are most effectively sampled with electrofishing equipment, which was used to catch both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass in Myrtle for the 2017 survey. Smallmouth made up the majority of the bass catch in 2017, with an average size of about 13 inches and fish up to nearly 20 inches in the sample. Very few Largemouth Bass were caught during the survey.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Myrtle Lake, and the average size is larger than what is typically expected from similar lakes. The average Northern Pike sampled during the 2017 survey was about 3.4 pounds. Catch rates during the 2017 survey were almost exactly equal to the historical average for Myrtle.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were down in 2017, and less than what would be expected for similar lakes. The average size is fairly large at nearly 19 inches, and growth is faster than most other International Falls area lakes. Fingerlings have been stocked in Myrtle Lake in odd numbered years, and 84% of the Walleye sampled in 2017 were from those year classes, indicating that natural reproduction is probably not contributing much to the total population.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates in 2017 were the highest recorded in Myrtle since 1951. The abundant population should provide good forage for predators, and the presence of a few larger fish up to nearly 10 inches can provide some harvest opportunities for anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during the 2017 survey included Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tadpole Madtom, and White Sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

Walleye gill net catch rates were within the normal range for similar lakes, but growth rates were high and the average length of walleye was 19.3\".  Over 60% of the walleye were age 3.  This group of fish should predominate the walleye catch for the next few years.  Northern pike catch rates were high for this type of lake, and growth rates for most year classes of pike were normal.  Age 3 pike were larger than average, indicting fast growth in one or more previous years.  Most of the pike were age 3 or 4.  The average length of pike was 21.6\".Both largemouth bass and smallmouth bass were collected in gill nets.  Gill nets do not sample these species well.  However, catch rates for both of these species were within normal ranges for this type of lake.  Largemouth bass averaged 11.1\" and smalmouth bass averaged 14.1\".Several species of panfish were present, including yellow perch, black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Yellow perch were abundant but slow growing, and probably contribute to the forage base more than to anglers.  The average length of perch was 6.0\". Black crappie were also abundant and slow growing, with an aveage length of 7.0\".  Typical numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed were present, but again, tended to be small.Other species present included brown bullhead, black bullhead, rock bass, white sucker, golden shiner, and tadpole madtom.</p>",

However, black crappie abundance has generally been higher in most of the investigations since the mid-1980's.  In 2002, six year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-8 years.  The 1998 year-class represented 78% of the sample.  Length ranged from 3.0-11.0 inches and the mean was 8.5.  Growth and mean weight were below average.  Bluegill trap-net abundance was the highest ever recorded on Myrtle Lake (23.67 fish/set) and almost eight times greater than the median value for similar lakes.  Six year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-9 years.  The 1998 year-class represented 72% of the sample.  Total length in trap nets ranged from 3.4-8.8 inches and the mean was 5.8.  Growth and mean weight were below average.  Northern pike gill-net abundance (11.56 fish/set) was the second highest ever recorded for Myrtle Lake and well above the median of 3.63 for class 16 lakes.  Eight year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-8 years.  Several year-classes were well represented.  Mean TL was 22.8 inches with a range from 9.6 to 29.8.  Growth was greater than the statewide average, but lower than the area average.  Mean weight was much higher than most class 16 lakes.  Walleye gill-net abundance was 1.89 fish/set, which was well below the median of 8.00.  Seven year-classes were present and age ranged from 4-15 years.  Although abundance was low, the walleyes sampled were large.  Total length ranged from 17.1-29.6 inches and the mean was 22.7.  Mean weight was 4.27 pounds, which greatly exceeded the third quartile (1.34) for class 16 lakes.  Growth rate for walleye was exceptional.  Length at age 4 was 19.0 inches, which was over 4.5 inches larger than the average age-4 walleye in the International Falls management area.Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 21.78 fish/set, which was much greater than the median of 9.20.  Seven year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 2-8 years.  The 1998 year-class represented 59% of the sample.  Total length in gill nets ranged from 5.3-9.3 inches and the mean was 7.4.  Growth was similar to the area average.  Mean weight was lower than what is found in class 16 lakes. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Myrtle Lake is located approximately seven miles east of Orr, Minnesota on rolling terrain within a mixed deciduous-coniferous forest.  There is a state owned public access on the east end of the lake on County Road 23.  Myrtle is a Class 16 lake with a total surface area of 889 acres.  The maximum depth is 20 feet; however, 97% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  Myrtle Lake has diverse fish and aquatic plant communities.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was well above the expected range for this lake type.  However, black crappie abundance has often been higher, especially in the mid-1980's.  In 2012, seven year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-10 years.  The majority of the fish in the sample were young; age-2 fish represented 89% of the sample.  Length in trap nets ranged from 3.7-12.4 inches and the mean was 5.2.  Due to the many young fish in the sample, the mean weight of black crappies captured was well below the expected range found in this lake type.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-8 years.  Many of fish in the sample were young; age-2 fish represented 80% of the sample.  Total length in trap nets ranged from 3.2-9.2 inches and the mean was 4.8.  Due to the many young fish in the sample, the mean weight of bluegill captured was slightly below the expected range found in this lake type.    <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was used to sample largemouth and smallmouth bass on May 30-31, 2012.  A total of 218 bass were captured.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured at a rate of 66.65 per hour of on-time, which was the highest level ever recorded for any lake in the International Falls Management Area.  Ten year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 2-11 years.  Age-2 fish represented 74% of the sample. Length ranged from 4.4 to 17.8 inches and the mean was 8.2.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were captured at a rate of 84.71 per hour of on-time, which falls in the middle of the range for lakes in the International Falls Management Area.  Seven year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 2-10 years.  When combined, ages 2 and 3 represented 84% of the sample.  Length ranged from 3.7-17.5 inches and the mean was 7.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was well above the expected range for this lake type.  Several year-classes were well represented.  Length ranged from 10.5 to 37.2 inches and the mean was 21.9.  The mean weight of northern pike captured was above the expected range found in similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking records for Myrtle Lake date back to 1945 when fry were stocked.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked on three occasions from 1958 to 1965.  In 1967, a change back to fry was made and periodic stocking of fry continued through 1992, except in January 1984 when 532 adult walleyes (0.75lb each) were stocked.  Generally, fry stocking has been unsuccessful and natural reproduction has been unable to maintain abundance above or near the middle of the expected range.  Thus, starting in 2003, fingerling stocking resumed with a plan to stock every other year at an accelerated rate. <br> \n <br> \nSuccess of stocking is dictated and confounded by many factors.  It would be irresponsible to try to evaluate the success of the new stocking protocol for Myrtle Lake with too few data points.  So, our goal for the first several investigations after the implementation of the new stocking protocol was to begin collecting information that when used with future investigations, will enable us to evaluate the stocking program for Myrtle Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nRecent investigations indicate that walleye abundance is higher than during the previous two decades, including a new record high observed in 2007.  However, abundance still slightly below what is generally observed in similar lakes.  Seven year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-8 years in 2012.  The 2009 year-class represented 54% of the sample.  Several year-classes were well represented and all occurred in odd numbered years which coincide with stocking.  Total length ranged from 7.1-21.5 inches and the mean was 15.0.  Mean weight was 1.38 pounds, which exceeded the top of the expected range.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was near the upper end of the expected range for this lake type.  Overall average size was small, but the length range included fish up to 10.9 inches; which should provide anglers with another harvest option.</p>",
