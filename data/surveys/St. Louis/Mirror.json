Because of this, brown trout was chosen as a means to biologically control other fish species present in Mirror Lake.     Brown trout abundance in gillnet and trapnet samples increased between 1994 and 1996.  Mean length was 10.4 inches and age distribution was 34 age I and two age II.  Index netting  values for yellow perch and golden shiner increased dramatically.  white sucker, black crappie and pumpkinseed sunfish remained relatively stable.  Walleye, northern pike and largemouth bass, which had been sampled from previous assessments, were not present in the 1996 survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mirror is a 18 acre lake with 16 (89%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 27 feet.  Mirror Lake, which is located 8 miles north of Duluth off St. Louis County #294, has a gravel, back-in public access.  Mirror Lake was managed for rainbow trout from 1956 through 1976.  Management for trout was discontinued because other fish species became established and chemical reclamation was deemed impractical.  Management for trout was re-implemented in 1991.  Brown trout have been stocked annually as a means to reduce the abundance of other fish species.     Only one brown trout was captured in 1 gillnet and 9 trapnets.  The brown trout was 20.1 inches long and weighed 4.0 pounds.  A total of 21, 24 and 37 brown trout were captured during 1992, 1994 and 1996 investigations, respectively.     A total of 242 yellow perch were sampled during the 2001 investigation.  Only 46 yellow perch were sampled during the 1996 investigation.  Mean length of yellow perch sampled in 2001 was 6.4 inches.     A total of 4 northern pike were sampled during the 2001 investigation.  Mean length of northern pike was 29.8 inches.       Other fish species sampled in 2001 include black crappie, bluegill, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.  Black crappie were first identified from the 1994 investigation.  It is unknown how this species became established.     It appears that success of brown trout stocking may be limited by the presence of other fish species.  A stocking shift from brown trout to splake is proposed.  Splake may be better able to control the abundance of other fish species in Mirror Lake, as well as provide better angling.  This change will occur in the spring of 2003.  The management plan will be revised in 2002.</p>",

With that possibility, brown trout were stocked in an attempt to rehabilitate the lake by reducing unwanted species.   Following the trout introduction in 1991, yellow perch and white sucker numbers have declined while providing the only brown trout inland lake fishery in the Duluth area.  The 1994 population assessment indicated good numbers of trout present until at least mid September.  These browns averaged 10 inches in length with a range of 8.7 to 10.9 inches.     Unfortunately, there also are northern pike and walleye present.  These species compete with and prey on the brown trout.  Anglers are encouraged to catch and remove any walleye or northern pike they catch, thus helping the trout population.</p>",
