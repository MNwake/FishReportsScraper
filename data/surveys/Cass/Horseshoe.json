Information that we obtained indicates that individual from Iowa owns the landing.  Public does use the access at no charge and with acknowledgment of the owner.  The average northern pike size has been decreasing over the years, locals blame winter spearing pressure.  Population at present is made up of young fish, so no conclusion should be made at present time as why size decreased.Additional Field Notes: Observed 2 adult loons with two young.  Panfish nest observed but no fish on the nest.  Observed one active beaver house, also observed very heavy snail population around the entire lake (heaviest snail population I have ever observed).Present Fish Population Status:  Northern pike abundance (10.5 per gill net)  is excellent with majority of the northern pike belonging to the II and III age class groups.  The size range of northern pike is skewed to the small side but the growth rate is good.  Bluegill abundance is extremely high with a few large fish present but growth rate is slow.  Largemouth bass abundance is excellent with all size groups present and exhibiting a good growth rate.  The abundance of black crappie is good and the population is made up mainly if II, III and IV year old fish which shows a good growth rate.  Yellow perch as forage food are present in good numbers.  Walleye numbers are almost non-existant.</p>",
