                "narrative": "<p>Ham Lake is a 168 acre, class 38 lake located in northern Anoka County, primarily managed for Largemouth Bass with Northern Pike as a secondary management species.  There is a public access located in the city park on the south side of the lake, and a 2004 survey found angling pressure to be relatively high compared to other lakes in the area at 101.5 hrs/acre.  The fish community of Ham Lake reflects a typical Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Northern Pike community.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a catch rate of 8.33 fish per gillnet,above average for class 38 lakes.  The average sampled pike was 20.95 inches in length, and the largest pike sampled was 29 inches.  Over 52% of Northern Pike sampled in this survey were longer than 21 inches, and 4% were greater than 26 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are typically not sampled effectively in gillnets and trap nets, but bass catch rate in gillnets (2.33 fish per net) was above average for abundance in class 38 lakes.  Sampled bass ranged from 8 to 16 inches, with an average length of 12.71 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rate was 17.25 fish per trap net, above average for class 38 lakes.  Sampled Bluegills ranged from under 3 inches to 8 inches in length, with an average length of 5.53 inches.  Size structure was poor, 36% of sampled Bluegills were greater than 6 inches in length and 2% were greater than 7 inches.  Black Crappie catch rate was 0.88 fish per trap net, below average for class 38 lakes, and Pumpkinseed Sunfish catch rate was 2.75 fish per trapnet, above average for class 38 lakes.  Yellow Bullheads were sampled at 9.33 fish per gillnet, significantly above average for class 38 lakes. </p>",

These fish are primarily of the III age group and exhibited good growth.  A fair number of largemouth bass YY were seined and they appear to represent a fairly strong year class.  One 13\" largemouth bass was captured that showed fast growth.  The bluegill catch rate was just below the average catch for this area.  The majority were of the 5.5-7.0\" length group.  Very few YY bluegills were sampled seining.  White sucker, black bullhead, and hybrid sunfish were equal to or above the median catch rate.  The gillnet catch of black crappies was also high.  Pumpkinseeds were present, but in low numbers.</p>",

Northern pike yearlings and crappies (adult) were stocked in November of 1972, along with largemouth bass fingerlings in September 1972 and adult sunfish in June of 1972.  Northern pike fingerlings were stocked in May of 1973.  The black bullhead population appears to be increasing very rapidly and are present in large numbers.  Finding large numbers of bullheads in a lake following a winterkill is typical.  Shoreline seining showed good natural reproduction for largemouth bass and poor or none for the other species, except bullheads.</p>",

Northern Pike (NOP) were sampled in the highest gill net catch rate ever recorded for this lake. The average size of NOP sampled was 21.6 inches and 2.2 pounds, with approximately 8% of all captured fish measuring 25.0 inches or larger. No adult Largemouth Bass were captured during this survey, however, young-of-year were present in good numbers in the natural reproduction check. Bluegill (BLG) were sampled above the median level for abundance in the trap net catch. The average BLG captured was 5.1 inches and 0.1 pounds. Pumpkinseed Sunfish (PMK) were sampled at the highest level observed since 1979. The average size of PMK was 5.7 inches and 0.2 pounds. Black Crappie (BLC) were sampled at the lowest catch rate recorded in the last 30 years. The average size of BLC captured was 7.0 inches and 0.2 pounds. Yellow Perch were sampled in low abundance and small average size (6.2 inches and 0.1 pounds). Black Bullhead (BLB) were sampled in low numbers but above average size. The average BLB captured was 13.9 inches and 1.6 pounds. Yellow Bullhead were sampled in the highest gill net catch rate recorded for this lake with the average fish being 10.8 inches and 0.75 pounds.</p>",

Brown bullhead, northern pike, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and hybrid sunfish were found at above local median levels.  Largemouth bass are present and reproduction confirmed by shoreline seining.  The numbers of bullheads is significantly lower than in 1974 and has remained relatively stable since 1979.  No commercial removal is necessary at this time.  Northern pike are more abundant than in 1979 (7.0 fish/lift) and average weight has decreased.  Bluegills are more abundant than in previous nettings and average size continues to decline.  Black crappies have remained stable since 1974 and show good size distribution.  No carp have been sampled in Ham Lake since the rotenone treatment in 1955.</p>",

This catch rate of 80.7/trapnet is the highest catch rate of five surveys dating back to 1974.  Bluegill up to 7.4 inches were sampled, however, average size was small (5.5 inches).  Only 0.5% of the bluegill sampled during the survey were 7.0 inches or larger.  Bluegill in Ham Lake exhibit slow growth.  Northern pike abundance was low, with a gillnet catch rate of 1.2/net.  This catch rate is the lowest in five nettings dating back to 1974.  While abundance of northern pike was low, average size and weight was good; 27.5 inches and 5.1 lbs, respectively.  Northern pike up to 31.1 inches were sampled.  Largemouth bass were sampled in high numbers by electrofishing (45 bass/hour).  Largemouth bass had a good size structure with 53% of the largemouth bass sample 16.0 inches or larger, and with fish up to 20.0 inches measured.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers, and were small in size, with an average length of 6.9 inches.  Black crappie up to 8.3 inches in length were sampled.  Pumpkinseed were present in low numbers with fish measured up to 7.0 inches.  Yellow perch were present in moderate numbers with small average size (6.7 inches).  Yellow perch were measured up to 8.3 inches.  Black bullheads were sampled in low numbers, and were large in size with an average length of 12.8 inches.</p>",

Brown bullhead, black bullhead and black crappie were taken in trapnets in lower numbers than the local median.  Northern pike numbers are similar to that found during the 1974 survey.  In both instances a good distribution of fish over the sizes expected to be taken were found.  These fish result primarily from natural reproduction.  Bluegill numbers are higher than in 1974 with a slight decrease in average size.  Black crappie numbers for both years are nearly the same.  Fewer large fish (8\") were taken in 1979 than in 1974.  Pumpkinseed numbers have increased greatly since the last test netting.  Comparison of trapnet catches would indicate a large decrease in both black and brown bullheads since 1974.  The gillnet catches of these species would show an increase since 1974.  Based on length frequencies the absence of large numbers of black bullheads under 5.0 inches would indicate a lessening of their numbers.  The average size of brown bullheads has also increased.</p>",

Surviving sunfish grew fast, resulting in a population of bluegill, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish with small young and older individuals between 7 and 9 inches.  Numbers are lower than in recent nettings, but fish are still plentiful.  Northern pike were captured in higher numbers than in recent nettings.  Most fish were young with few individuals over 25 inches.  Largemouth bass were abundant in the electrofishing samples.  A wide range of sizes were present with some over 20 inches.  Black crappie were moderate in abundance with no large individuals sampled.  Yellow, brown, and black bullhead were present, many large in size.  A few yellow perch and white sucker were also sampled.</p>",
