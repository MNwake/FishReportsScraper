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p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Guckeen Lake is a small 28.0 acre borrow pit located immediately south of I-90, north of the Town of Guckeen in Faribault County. Guckeen Lake is unique in that it provides angling opportunity to an area of Minnesota that has a limited number of lakes. Prior to 2007, Guckeen Lake was annually stocked with adult bluegill and black crappie. Currently, no fish are stocked in Guckeen Lake as fish populations sustain themselves naturally. The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, white crappie, and northern pike. A population assessment was conducted on 8-29-2012 to monitor the sport fish community using 2 gill nets and 3 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nHistorical northern pike catch rates have varied in Guckeen Lake from 0.5/gill net in 1981 to 11.5/gill net in 1987. In 2012, northern pike were captured at a rate of 8.5/gill net, which is high when compared to similar lakes. Size structure of northern pike was small, with pike measuring 17.2 to 27.2 inches in length and averaging 20.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie trap net catch rates decreased from 35.3/trap net in 2007 to 11.0/trap net in 2012, which is slightly higher when compared to similar lakes. Black crappie gill net catch rates increased from 16.0/gill net in 2007 to 24.0/gill net in 2012, which is high when compared to similar lakes. Black crappies were small as 99% were less than 7.5 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite crappies were captured at a rate of 5.3/trap net in 2012, consistent with what was observed in 2007, and high when compared to similar lakes. White crappies were small, ranging in length from 4.9 to 8.2 inches and averaging 6.2 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nPrior to the 2012 survey, bluegill catch rates have not exceeded 20.5/trap net dating back to the early 1980's. In 2012, the bluegill catch rate increased to 82.0/trap net, and was the highest observed catch rate for Guckeen Lake. The 2012 catch rate is very high relative to catch rates in similar lakes. Bluegills were small ranging from 3.5 to 6.1 inches in length and averaging 4.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOne 10.4 inch largemouth bass was caught in a gill net. This is the first documented capture of a largemouth bass in this system. Black bullhead, common carp, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and freshwater drum were also present, but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

IT WAS THOUGHT THAT GUCKEEN LAKE WOULD BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN A MODERATE NATURAL PANFISH FISHERY.  LOW REPRODUCTION AND SLOW GROWTH FOR CRAPPIE AND BLG HAVE LIMITED THIS FISHERY.  ANNUAL STOCKING OF PUT-AND-TAKE SIZE CRAPPIE AND NOP SEEMS TO BE A VIABLE MEANS OF SUSTAINING A QUALITY FISHERY.  NOP DECLINED FROM 11.50/GILL NET IN 1987 TO 5.00/GILL NET.  THE NORTHERN POPULATION IN 1987 WAS DOMINATED BY 1 YEAR OLDS (20 OUT OF 23) AND HALF OF THEM WERE MARKED FISH FROM STOCKING.  NORTHERNS ARE NOW DOMINATED BY 3 YEAR OLDS WITH AGES 4 AND 5 PRESENT.  PREVIOUS SURVEYS INDICATE MODERATE REPRODUCTION FOR NORTHERN IN HIGH WATER YEARS. WHC WERE MOST NUMEROUS, AVERAGING 13.0/GILL NET AND 7.0/TRAP NET COMPARED TO BLC WITH 1.50/TRAP NET.  WHC ARE SMALL WITH A MEDIAN OF 5.5 INCHES, WHICH ARE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1-3.  CRAPPIE EXHIBIT SLOW GROWTH AFTER AGE 2.  BLG REMAIN IN LOW ABUNDANCE WITH FOUR FISH NETTED IN 1987 COMPARED TO TWELVE SAMPLED IN 1992.  BLGS ARE REPRESENTED BY AGES 2-5 AND SLOW GROWTH OCCURS AFTER AGE 2.  YEP WERE NOT SAMPLED IN 1987 COMPARED TO SIX FISH NETTED IN 1992.  PERCH WERE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG AGES 1-3.  OTHER SPECIES PRESENT IN LOW NUMBERS INCLUDE CARP, GOS, BLB, WAE, AND OSS.</p>",
