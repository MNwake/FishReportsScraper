                "narrative": "<p>Ruby Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for smallmouth bass.  Walleye were sampled in gill nets at a rate that is higher than in past assessments and above the expected range for this type of lake. They had a mean length of 15.8 inches and a mean weight of 1.5 pounds.  Growth rates appear to be above average.  Most of the fish sampled were from nonstocked years suggesting that natural reproduction, not stocking, is providing most of the walleye in the lake.     Only two smallmouth bass were captured in gill nets, but the catch rate is still within the expected range.  Actual abundance is difficult to guage from netting data because bass typically avoid nets better than other species.     Largemouth bass from 7.0 to 20.1 inches in length were sampled.  The trap net catch rate is within the expected range.     Northern pike have typically been fairly abundant in Ruby Lake.  They were sampled in gill nets at a rate above their expected range in this assessment.  There appears to be a good number of larger fish (up to 39.4 inches).  The pike caught in gill nets had a mean length of 24.0 inches and a mean weight of 3.5 pounds.     Yellow perch were sampled in gill nets at a rate within their expected range.  They ranged from 5.6 to 10.0 inches in length.     Bluegill were sampled in trap nets at a range within the expected range.  Lengths of these bluegill ranged from 2.8 to 8.9 inches.     Tullibee, white sucker and rock bass were also sampled in this assessment and black crappie have been sampled in the past.     Lake shore owners and users have the ability to insure that Ruby Lake will continue to produce a quality fishery by practicing wise use of the land and water to preserve water quality and fish habitat.  Anglers might also consider practicing catch and release or selective harvest in order to keep the fishery healthy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ruby lake is a 243-acre lake in central Itasca County within the Mississippi River watershed.  Ruby Lake is located approximately 7 miles southeast of Marcell, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 88 ft.  Walleye gill-net catch was 2.6/net, which is higher than the expected range for similar lakes, but represents a decline from 7.8/net in the previous 1996 assessment.  Gill-net abundance in past assessments has varied from 1.0 to 7.8/set.  Although size structure was generally good, size structure declined from previous assessments.  Walleye growth was excellent, exceeding statewide averages until age five, then similar to statewide averages thereafter.  Walleye adults and fingerlings have been stocked four times since 1993.  Ageing revealed that 12 of 21 (57%) of walleye sampled were from nonstocked year classes, indicating good natural reproduction.  Deep clear lakes with a tullibee prey base like Ruby Lake have the potential to produce large walleye.  Anglers can help to improve the size structure by practicing selective harvest and releasing walleye over 19 inches.Ruby Lake is included in a statewide research project evaluating different stocking strategies including fry, frylings, and three densities of fingerlings.  As part of this research project, Ruby Lake was stocked with fry in 2001 and is scheduled for fry stocking in 2003.Northern pike gill-net abundance was 7.5/net, which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance declined slightly from the 1996 assessment of 9.0/net, but is very similar to the most recent assessments.  Size structure was moderate with fish up to 32 inches sampled, however overall size structure in this assessment declined from previous assessments.  Northern pike growth was good and similar to statewide averages with fish reaching 23 inches after 5 years.  Fisheries research conducted a tagging study in 2001 and determined the population of fish greater than 13.7 inches to be 1,381 fish or 5.7/acre.  Anglers can help to improve the size structure of the population by releasing fish over 24 inches (3 pounds).  These fish have survived the early years of high predation and mortality, are most likely to become the 10 - 12 pound fish of the future.Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time to evaluate the largemouth bass and smallmouth bass populations.  The catch rates were 11/h and 24/h for largemouth bass and smallmouth bass respectively.  Ruby Lake is an oligotrophic lake, thus it is expected that smallmouth bass would be more abundant than largemouth bass.  Size structure was moderate for both largemouth bass and smallmouth bass.  Gill-net catch of yellow perch was 6.4/net and was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Tullibee gill-net catch was 5.6/net and was also within the expected range.  Abundance in previous assessments has varied from 0.5 to 6.5/net.  Bluegill trap-net catch was 62.0/net, which was higher than the expected range.  Bluegill abundance has increased dramatically from the 1996 assessment, which had a trap-net catch of 9.1/net.  Historically, abundance has been much lower.  Size structure was poor with few fish exceeding eight inches.  Other species sampled include pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker. Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by practicing selective harvest.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ruby Lake is a 243 acre lake located 7 miles southeast of Marcell, MN in the Big Fork River watershed and the Chippewa National Forest.  Ruby Lake has been part of a statewide study evaluating different walleye stocking strategies including fry, fryling and three densities of fingerlings.  All stocked fish were marked with oxytetracycline (OTC) to determine the relative contribution of stocked fish from natural reproduction.  Since the most recent assessment was part of the stocking evaluation, gill nets were the only gear used and age and growth data were only collected from walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nRuby Lake was stocked with approximately 92,000 marked walleye fry in 2001, and 106,000 marked fry in 2003.  In addition, 117 lbs of marked fingerlings (1,229 fish) were stocked in 2005.  Night electrofishing assessments for young of the year or yearling walleye were conducted annually from 2001 through 2006 to evaluate these stockings.  These assessments sampled very few fish.  The 2008 walleye gill-net catch rate was below the lake class median at 2.0/net.  Of the 12 fish sampled, four were aged to an OTC marked stocking year (2005), and all four were confirmed to have OTC marks.  Previous gill-net assessments in 2004 and 2006 sampled very few marked fish from the 2001 and 2003 fry stockings.  Overall, the results of the various assessments on Ruby Lake have indicated the fry stockings were generally unsuccessful, while fingerlings have performed somewhat better.  Some natural reproduction has been documented in all recent assessments.  Walleye growth in 2008 was above the statewide average for ages 1-4, and similar to the statewide average for all other ages. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch rate was 9.3/net; above the lake class normal range but similar to previous assessments.  Size structure was moderate; sampled pike ranged from 14.8 to 32.7 inches, with a mean length of 22.6 inches and a mean weight of 2.7 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for largemouth bass equaled the lake class first quartile (0.5/net), while the catch rate for smallmouth bass approached the lake class third quartile at 1.3/net.  Gill-net catches for both species have typically been low, although catch rates for smallmouth bass have exceeded the lake class median in the last two assessments. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill-net catch rate was within the lake class normal range at 2.8/net, similar to recent assessments.  The gill-net catch rate for tullibee was below the lake class normal range at 0.5/net.  Catch rates in previous assessments have varied from 0.2 to 6.5/net. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye were sampled with gill nets at a rate within the lake class expected range, but it was the second lowest catch rate since 1967.  The fish sampled were a good size, averaging 4.1 pounds, but it appears that there was limited recruitment and no fish were sampled below 17.3 inches.  The average length was 22.2 inches and the longest was 27.6 inches.  Ruby has been part of a statewide research project evaluating different stocking strategies.  As part of this project, Ruby has been stocked with oxytetracycline (OTC) marked fry in 2001 and 2003, and OTC marked fingerlings in 2005.  Only two fish were sampled that were aged to an OTC marked stocking year (2001).  One fish was marked representing a stocked fish and the other was not (natural reproduction). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate within the lake class expected range, similar to the 2001 assessment but below the highest rate in the 2004 special assessment.  The longest northern pike sampled was 33.5 inches, and the average length was 23.4 inches.  The size structure was good with 17% of the fish sampled over 29 inches.  The growth rate was above the state average for ages one, two and five, and similar to the state average for the rest. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in gill nets at an expected rate for the lake class, while smallmouth bass, sampled in gill nets, were above the lake class expected range.  Both species were also sampled with electrofishing at a moderate rate, but because of changes in the survey stations no real relationship to the previous assessment can be made.  The electrofishing stations used for the bass population assessment were run concurrent with the six stations used for the walleye research project.  The size structure appears to be moderate and growth rates were below or near the state average for both species. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled in trap nets at a rate above the expected lake class range, similar to the previous assessment.  Historically, the abundance has been lower.  The size structure was poor with an average length of 5.2 inches and no fish sampled over eight inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled within the lake class expected range, and slightly lower than the previous assessment.  Only one tullibee was sampled in 2006, the lowest recorded catch rate.  Both species have had fluctuating populations and have been historically sampled at lower densities.  Other species sampled include black crappie, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ruby Lake is located seven miles southeast of Marcell, MN in the Big Fork River watershed and the Chippewa National Forest.  Ruby is a deep, clear lake with steep drop-offs and a limited amount of aquatic vegetation.  The 2009 lake management plan lists Walleye as the primary management species with Northern Pike and Smallmouth Bass as secondary management species.   <br> \n <br> \nRuby Lake has generally been known as a lake that produces lower numbers of Walleye, with the opportunity to catch bigger fish (>25 inches).  Recent management included stocking Walleye fingerlings in odd numbered years at one pound/littoral acre.  A targeted survey (gill nets only) was conducted in early July 2017 to evaluate the success of the stocking and collect updated information on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in numbers similar to past surveys and within the typical range for similar lakes.  Size structure declined from past surveys.  Walleye ranged from 9.4 to 22.2 inches with an average length of 15.2 inches.  Ages 2, 4-6 and 9 were represented with age 2 fish making up 58% of the age distribution.  Six of the previous ten years were stocked year classes, and 95% of the sample corresponded to stocked years.  Growth was average with Walleye attaining 17.3 inches at age 5.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers declined slightly from previous surveys but were within the typical range for similar lakes.  Size structure was modest; pike ranged from 15.4 to 29.3 inches with an average length of 21.8 inches.  Ages 2-5 and 7 were represented with ages 2 and 4 the most frequently sampled.  Growth was average with pike attaining 21.5 inches at age 4. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate was similar to other recent surveys within the typical range for lakes like Ruby.  Perch ranged from 5.7 to 8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Ruby Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nLakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water surface and should be left in place. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike are very abundant, evidenced by a gill net CPUE of 7.4/set.  A wide range of sizes were sampled, age I-VII are represented.  Age III comprise 36% of the sample.  Growth is good until age V, then a limited sample suggests a slow down in growth.The walleye gill net CPUE, at 4.6/lift, approaches the third quartile (4.75/lift) for Schupp's lake class #23.  There is a large portion of walleye greater than 20.0 inches in the sample; this is also reflected in a PSD value of 74.  A wide range of sizes were captured, but there appears to be several year class blanks, indicating erratic natural reproduction.Largemouth and smallmouth bass were both sampled:  YOY largemouth in the seine and one adult smallmouth in gill nets.  Other centrarchids were not sampled readily either, probably due in part to the steep sloping shoal areas making trap nets less effective.  Historical trap net CPUE's for bluegill have decreased from 27.8 in 1972, 4.6 in 1978, 0 in 1983, and only 0.3 in 1990. It is unknown if this is due to a real population change or an increased chance of sampling variability due to the steep shoal areas.Yellow perch and tullibee are two important forage species.  The yellow perch gill net CPUE is low at 1.8/lift, which approaches the first quartile (1.7/lift) for lake class #23.  The tullibee CPUE is less than the lake class median of 5.8/lift but falls within the first and third quartile for lake class #23.</p>",
