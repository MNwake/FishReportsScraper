                "narrative": "<p>Bear Creek Reservoir (Chester Lake) continues to develop as a fishery.  Adult largemouth bass stocked in 1995 have spawned and produced two year classes that are being seen in annual electrofishing assessments.  The 1996 year class (4-year olds) are presently about 10 inches long and are very abundant.  The 1997 year class is just starting to show up in our survey work, and are about 8-9 inches long.  Our management objective for largemouth bass is to maintain high numbers, so they will prey on small bluegill and keep them from overpopulating the lake.  The 15-inch minimum size limit is designed to help acheive this objective.    Over 2500 bluegill and black crappie adults were stocked in 1996-1997.  Fall trapnetting with small-mesh nets show the presence of thousands of small offspring or young-of-year bluegill and black crappie.  Many of the original adults stocked have grown to a size acceptable to anglers.  To prevent over-harvest of the largest bluegill, a year-round 10 fish bag limit will go into effect in 2001.  Also, a 7-inch minimum size limit (bluegill must be 7 inches or longer to keep) will be in effect annually from November 1 through April 30.  These regulations, together with a high density largemouth bass population will hopefully maintain good average bluegill size. At this time, black crappie appear to be doing well.  Our trapnet catch was 4.2/set, compared to .7/set in 1998.  Average size 7 to 9 inches.   Six-thousand channel catfish yearlings were stocked in 1996 and 1997.  These fish are now 13 to 15 inches long and are abundant (26.5/gillnet set).  Some fish caught were over 20 inches.  All indications are that the channel cat-fishery is in good shape and should provide good angling opportunity.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring trapnetting was conducted from May 1-3, 2012 to evaluate the status of the bluegill, black crappie, and channel catfish populaitons in Bear Creek Reservoir.  Eleven nets were set instead of the typical 12 nets due to low water at one of the net locations.  A total of 307 bluegill were captured at a rate of 27.9 fish/net.  Bluegill mean length was 7.11 inches with a maximum size of 9.53 inches.  Bluegill size structure was excellent with 31% of the fish eight inches or longer.  The black crappie catch rate was 7.0 fish/net with a mean length of 8.08 inches.  The largest crappie was 9.88 inches.  No channel catfish were captured. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing was conducted at night on October 15, 2012.  Four stations were sampled.  A total of 228 largemouth bass were collected at a rate of 176.71 fish/hr.  Mean length was 9.91 inches with the largest bass measuring 16.81 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan has emphasized maintaining a high density population of largemouth bass to prevent overpopulation and stunting of the bluegill population.  This management strategy has been successful.  Angling regulations were revised in 2010.  Anglers can harvest up to 10 bluegill, crappie, and yellow perch in combination per day, however only five crappie can be kept.  The largemouth bass bag limit is one fish per day of any size.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Creek Reservoir is located in Chesterwoods County Park, 6 miles east of the City of Rochester on Highway 14.  An Olmsted County Parks permit is required to access the park and reservoir.  The reservoir is 118 acres, has a maximum depth of 37 feet, and is comprised of multiple arms and small coves.  There is an abundance of standing timber in the reservoir.  A paved ramp is available, however boats are restricted to electric motors only.  There are several fishing piers with good access, including an accessible pier by the boat ramp.  There is also a campground and swimming beach within the park. <br> \n <br> \nA survey of Bear Creek Reservoir was conducted April 2019, immediately after ice out to assess the Northern Pike population after anglers reported catching them.  Northern Pike have never been stocked into the reservoir by MN DNR and they have not been sampled in previous surveys.  Methods included electrofishing, trapnetting, and gillnetting.  Gillnets were the only gear to sample Northern Pike.  Twenty-one Northern Pike were sampled with an average length of 26.2 inches, with a range of 14.1 inches to 36 inches.  It appears this is an established, quality Northern Pike population.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included 183 Black Crappie with an average size of 9.1 inches and the largest being 11.5 inches.  There were 108 Bluegill sampled with an average length of 6.5 inches and the largest was 9.8 inches.  Fifty-four Largemouth Bass were sampled with an average length of 11.5 inches and the largest was 18.8 inches.  A total of 18 White Suckers were sampled with an average length of 17.9 inches and the largest was 23.2 inches.  One Black Bullhead and one Fathead Minnow was also sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nPopulations of Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie appear to be in very good condition in Bear Creek Reservoir.  The numbers of fish, as well as the number of quality size fish, are excellent and should provide good angling in coming years.  <br> \n  <br> \nSpecial fishing regulations are in effect on Bear Creek Reservoir:  Sunfish, crappie, yellow perch: combined possession limit is 10, with no more than 5 crappie.  Largemouth Bass: possession limit is 1.  The Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations apply: Possession limit is 2, with a minimum size of 24 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Creek Reservoir is located in Chesterwoods County Park, 6 miles east of the City of Rochester on Highway 14.  The reservoir is 118 acres and has a maximum depth of 37 feet.  The reservoir is comprised of multiple arms and small coves.  There is an abundance of standing timber remaining in the reservoir.  A boat ramp is present, however an Olmsted County Parks sticker is required for parking.  Boats are restricted to the use of electric motors only.  There are several fishing piers with good access, including a pier by the boat ramp that is accessible by persons with a disability.  There is also a campground and swimming beach within the park. <br> \n <br> \nBear Creek Reservoir was sampled by daytime electrofishing on 5/27/2015.  At this time, Bluegill were beginning to construct nests for spawning.  Largemouth Bass were also in shallow water and vulnerable to electrofishing.  A total of 56 Bluegill were collected.  Average length was 6.9 inches and the longest Bluegill was 9.2 inches.  Ninety Largemouth Bass were captured with an average length of 11.9 inches and a maximum length of 18.4 inches.  Black Crappie are not as vulnerable to capture by electrofishing, however 15 were captured.  The average Black Crappie length was 8.7 inches with a maximum length of 11.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPopulations of Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie appear to be in very good condition in Bear Creek Reservoir.  The numbers of fish as well as the number of quality size fish are excellent and should provide good angling in coming years.</p>",
