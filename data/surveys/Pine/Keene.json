                "narrative": "<p>Keene Lake, located in Pine Counnty, has a surface area of 13 acres and has been assigned to lake class 28.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike with black crappie and bluegill sunfish as the secondary species.During the week of June 16, 1998, a standard lake survey was conducted to evaluate the current status of the fish population.  Standardized gear types utilized included spring night electrofishing, two gill nets, four standard lake survey trap nets, and two 1/4 inch trap nets.  The selected gear types were chosen based on guidelines obtained from the MN DNR Manual of Instructions for Lake Survey.According to previous surveys northern pike catch rates have been low in numbers.  During the 1998 survey one 17.5 inch pike was captured.Black crappie abundance was found to be at a normal level, while the average weight (0.2 lbs.) fell slightly below normal for lakes of this type.  Measured crappie ranged from 3.3 to 9.6 inches in length with an average length of 7.1 inches.  When compared to statewide averages, black crappie growth was typical of normal.Bluegill sunfish numbers were below normal when compared to lakes similar in type.  An average weight of 0.1 pounds was calculated and found to be normal.  Bluegill total lengths extended from 3.0 to 6.7 inches with an average length of 5.6 inches.  Growth was above average when compared to statewide averages for this type of lake.Spring nighttime electrofishing was conducted for the first time on Keene Lake to sample for largemouth bass.  On June 4, 1998, the entire shoreline of Keene Lake was sampled.  One largemouth was captured with a total length of 5.4 inches.  Although catch rate averages for this gear type by lake class have not been formally developed, this catch appears to be low.Two 1/4 inch trap nets were utilized for sampling natural reproduction on September 8, 1998.  Results indicated that bluegill sunfish had some reproductive success in 1998.Other fish species that made up the species composition in Keene Lake included black bullhead, golden shiner and yellow bullhead.  Black bullhead and golden shiner numbers were within a normal range for this type of lake, while yellow bullhead were found to be below normal in abundance.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  In June 1988 two gillnets and four trapnets were set in Keene Lake as part of an initial lake survey.  The gamefish species caught in these test nets consisted of northern pike, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie.  \n  Based on respective local medians the present fish population is as follows:  The northern pike (4.00/set) was slightly above the local median catch of (3.88/set).  The length distribution ranged from 17.0 to 31.9 inches with a median length group of 23.0-23.9 inches for the eight northern pike taken by gillnets.  Mean weight was a respectable 3.34 pounds.  The age groups ranged from III-VI years and expressed normal growth in inches, however, observed and actual condition factors were above normal for all northern pike.  \n  The bluegill sunfish (3.25/set) had a catch well below the local median (25.67/set).  The length frequency ranged from 5.0 to 7.4 inches with a median length group of 6.5- 6.9 inches.  Although the sample size was small, the mean weight of 0.20 pounds consists primarily of the III and IV year age groups.  Age growth of the 13 bluegill sunfish collected were of normal length to that of statewide averages.\n  A trapnet catch of eighty black crappie (20.00/set) was slightly above the local median catch (18.45/set).  The length distribution ranged from 4.0 to 10.9 inches with a median length group of 7.0-7.4 inches.  Mean weight was 0.21 pounds, but it is noteworthy that the majority of the catch were of the II, III, and IV age group fish.  Correlation between scale aging and lengths indicate that these fish were growing at a near normal rate.\n  Other species taken in test nets (golden shiner, white sucker, black bullhead, and brown bullhead) were all below their respective local median net catches.  At the time of the survey, it was inconclusive as to whether the number of bullheads had significant effects on any parameters of the gamefish population.\n  Largemouth bass did not appear in the survey test net gear, although these fish have reportedly been caught by local anglers.\n</p>",
