The fish population in Jack Lake is comprised of northern pike, yellow perch and white sucker.     Test nets in 1997 found northern pike abundance about average compared to other lakes in this lake class.  Northern pike up to 3.7 pounds were sampled, however 66% of the fish sampled were less than 1.0 pound.     Yellow perch were sampled in above average numbers in the 1997 survey and averaged 7.9 inches in length.  Yellow perch up to 11.4 inches were observed, with approximately 33% of the fish greater than 9.0 inches in length.  There are indications that a certain year class of yellow perch is quite abundant and as a result by the summer of 1999 the average size of yellow perch may be larger.  Currently there is very little angling directed at yellow perch.</p>",
