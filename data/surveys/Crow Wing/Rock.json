                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike and bluegill catches indicate a higher than average size population in numbers, and also pounds per net of these species present because they exceed the third quartile of the regional median for numbers and pounds. Black crappie net catches fall within the first and third quartiles, thus they indicate an average population abundance. All three species also exceed local medians for abundance for their respective gear. Age classes 2, 3, 4, and 6 were found present from the six northern pike aged. All age classes exhibited good growth when compared to the statewide growth averages. The northern pike ranged from 11.9 inches at annulus 2 to 28.2 inches at annulus 6. The mean weight was 2.24 lbs which compares to local average of 2.13 lbs. The bluegills growth rate was good with five age classes present in the nets. Size range at annulus formation was 3.2 inches at annulus 2 and 11.14 inches at annulus 9. The bluegill population is comprised mainly of fish four years and younger, and 98% of the fish were under eight inches. The mean weight of the individual fish is 0.18 lbs, compared to the local average of 0.17 lbs. Black crappie abundance was excellent with 1-4 annulus fish present in the nets. The growth rate was good when compared to statewide averages. Size range varied from 2.6 inches at annulus 1 and 8.0 inches at annulus 4.</p>",
