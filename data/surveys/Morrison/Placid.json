MEAN SIZE IS LARGER AT 2.78 POUNDS WHICH IS ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE OF 1.61 POUNDS. GROWTH RATES ARE NORMAL FOR ALL THE AGE GROUPS SAMPLED (III, V-VIIII,X,XIV).  FRY STOCKING HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ANNUALLY SINCE 1986. AGING DATA INDICATE FEW STOCKED HAVE SHOWN UP IN THE TEST NETS.  SEVERAL AGE GROUPS WERE FOUND REPRESENTING FISH NATURALLY PRODUCED IN YEARS PRIOR TO THE FRY STOCKING.  SPRING ELECTROFISHING IN 1987 TURNED UP NUMEROUS YEARLING FISH THOUGH IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER THESE WERE STOCKED FISH OR NATURALLY REPRODUCED.  IMIGRATION OF FISH FROM THE CROW WING RIVER LIKELY OCCURS.  NORTHERN PIKE ARE PRESENT IN AVERAGE NUMBERS AND MEAN SIZE.  NO  WEIGHT HAS INCREASED FROM 1.71 POUNDS IN 1985 TO 2.31 POUNDS IN 1990.  NORMAL GROWTH RATES ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF ALL LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE REPRE- SENTED BY ONLY THREE SMALL FISH CAPTURED IN THE TRAPNETS.  THIS IS CONSIDERED AN AVERAGE NET CATCH AS THIS SPECIES IS DIFFICULT TO SAMPLE USING LAKE SURVEY GEAR.  THE NET CATCH WAS ALSO QUITE LOW IN 1985 (1 FISH).  BLUEGILL NUMBERS ARE AVERAGE AND MEAN SIZE IS NORMAL.  AVERAGE WEIGHT IS 0.13 POUNDS AS COMPARED TO 0.20 POUNDS IN 1985. LENGTH FREQUENCY DATA SUGGEST THE PRESENCE OF SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES.  YELLOW PERCH ARE ALSO PRESENT IN NORMAL NUMBERS AND AVERAGE SIZE IS NORMAL.  NET CATCHES IN 1985 WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THE CURRENT CATCHES AND AVERAGE WEIGHT HAS NOT CHANGED.  BLACK CRAPPIE WERE NOT SAMPLED IN THE SELECTIVE GEAR (TRAPNET), HOWEVER, FOUR FISH WERE CAUGHT IN THE GILLNETS.  THIS INFORMATION SUGGESTS A LOW POPULATION IS PRESENT.  PREVIOUS SURVEYS SHOW LOW CRAPPIE POPULATIONS ARE THE NORM FOR THIS LAKE.  WHITE SUCKER, SHORTHEAD REDHORSE, AND ROCK BASS POPULATIONS ARE HIGH.  ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILES.  THE WHITE SUCKER, SHORTHEAD REDHORSE, AND SILVER REDHORSE POPULATIONS DISPLAY A WIDE RANGE OF SIZES INDICATING NUMEROUS AGE GROUPS. THE ROCK BASS ARE SMALL IN SIZE, BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE.  BOWFIN, YELLOW BULLHEAD, BROWN BULL- HEAD, AND PUMPKINSEED ARE FOUND IN AVERAGE NUMBERS.  COMMON CARP AND BLACK BULLHEAD POPULATIONS ARE LOW ACCORDING TO NET CATCH INFORMATION.  A COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN REMOVED 1,000 POUNDS OF BULLHEADS FROM THE LAKE IN 1990 UNDER CLASS</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Placid or Pillager Reservoir is near the town of Pillager and is formed by the Pillager Power Dam on the Crow Wing River.  Water turbidity is affected by flows from the Crow Wing River and several minor tributaries.  Suspended sediment in the water column during the survey produced a secchi disk reading of only 4 feet.  The lake has light to moderate development along the shoreline with much it's natural vegetation still intact.  The diversity of the fish community is a reflection of a riverine lake system.    Non-game species such as silver redhorse, common carp, greater redhorse, shorthead redhorse, and white suckers account for much of the biomass in the lake.  Northern pike and walleye numbers have remained relatively stable at levels low to normal when compared to similar type lakes.  Average size of the pike seen in the survey was 21 inches or about 2 pounds.  Anglers can occasionally catch larger fish as pike over 33 inches have been documented in past surveys.  The walleye population appears to be dominated by larger fish as all of the fish caught were over 19 inches.  Natural reproduction sustains the fishery in this lake and the absence of smaller walleye could mean poorer fishing for the next couple of years.  Some nice size yellow perch were seen in the survey up to 13 inches, however, the average size was around 6.5 - 7 inches.    Panfish species in Lake Placid include black crappies, bluegills, pumpkinseeds, and rock bass.  Crappie abundance appears low and the fish small as they were all less than 8 inches in the survey.  Black crappies, however, can be difficult to catch with standard lake survey gear.  Summer surveys also tend to sample the smaller panfish that hang out close to shore.  Bluegills provide an important fishery for Placid and the survey did show the presence of \"keeper\" size fish.  While the average size was about 6 inches, a fair number of the bluegills were over 7 inches and one over 8 inches was measured.  All of the pumpkinseeds in the survey were less than 6 inches in length and the rock bass were under 7.5 inches.  Largemouth and smallmouth bass can both be found in the lake, however, little is known about their populations since they are difficult to catch with lake survey gear.  The two smallmouth seen in the survey were decent size and going upstream of the lake may even provide better fishing.    All three species of bullheads, black, brown, and yellow, were sampled in the lake.  Numbers appeared low for all of the species and some larger fish up to 13 inches are present.  Bowfin or dogfish are also in the lake, which could provide some exciting fish.  Because of the low gamefish populations, catch and release is encouraged to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  It is important to minimize impacts to the reservoir from dam operations through the proper timing and duration of drawdowns.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Placid Reservoir is an impoundment on the Crow Wing River formed by thePillager Dam.  The fish community shows characteristics of a riverine system.  Non-game species such as silver redhorse, greater redhorse, shorthead redhorse, andwhite sucker dominate the fish community.  The lake historically has had a lownorthern pike population and the 1996 survey indicates this remains unchanged. Average size was about 21 inches, however, one pike exceeding 33 inches wassampled, suggesting potential for larger fish.  Walleye numbers also appear low andfish sampled were between 14 and 28 inches in length.  Walleye fry were stockedannually from 1986 to 1991, while fingerlings were stocked in 1992 and 1994.  Fallelectrofishing conducted in 1996 documented natural reproduction, indicatingstocking is not necessary.  Yellow perch numbers indicate low abundance in thelake.  Neascus (a small black grub) was common on many of the northern pike,walleye, and yellow perch.  Bluegill abundance appears low, with fish averagingfive to six inches.  Black crappie numbers continue to be low. One 12 inch crappiewas sampled during the survey, suggesting if crappies can be located, they may benice size.  Also present in Lake Placid are largemouth and smallmouth bass, yellowbullhead, carp, and bowfin.  Little is known about the bass populations as they aredifficult to assess with lake survey gear.  Carp abundance is also difficult todetermine with nets.  Yellow bullheads and bowfin appear to be low in numbers.State maintained accesses are located near Pillager Dam and upstream of thereservoir on the Crow Wing River (Al-Vahs).  Water clarity is impacted by rainevents and flows from the Crow Wing River.  It is important to minimize impacts tothe reservoir from dam operations through the proper timing and duration ofdrawdowns.  Because of the low gamefish populations, catch and release isencouraged to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community. Development is increasing on the lake and the importance of vegetation must bestressed to protect habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Placid Lake or Pillager Reservoir is formed by the Pillager Power Dam on the Crow Wing River near the town of Pillager.  Most of the development on the reservoir is located on the north shore and along two inlets on the south side of the lake.  Fast drop-offs along shore, sunken bars and vegetation beds, as well as islands provide structure in the lake.  Anglers have the choice of fishing in the reservoir or traveling up the Crow Wing River.  Water turbidity can be affected by flows from the Crow Wing River and several minor tributaries.  Increased flows from recent rains produced a secchi disk reading of 5 feet during the survey as well as making for difficult netting conditions.  Suspended detritus and algae in the water attached to the nets, which affected sampling efficiency.  The species diversity of the fish community is a reflection of a riverine system. <br> \n     Non-game species such as silver redhorse, common carp, greater redhorse, shorthead redhorse, and white sucker account for much of the biomass in the lake.  Gamefish species found in the lake include northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass.  The walleye population has been sustained at low levels by natural reproduction since the mid-90s when stocking was discontinued.  Results from early summer electrofishing in 2008 suggest that Placid Lake supports modest populations of both largemouth bass and smallmouth bass.   Most of the bass observed in the sampling were less than 12 inches in length, however, there were some fish over 18 inches of both species measured.    <br> \n     Bluegill provide an important fishery on the lake and the survey did show the presence of \"keeper\" size fish.  While the average size was about 6 inches, a fair number of the bluegill were over 7 inches in length with some over 8 inches.  Black crappie do not appear to be overly abundant but there were some nice fish over 11 inches documented.  Other panfish species in the lake include pumpkinseed sunfish and rock bass.    <br> \n     All three species of bullhead, black, brown, and yellow, were sampled in the lake.  Numbers appear to be low for all of the species and some larger fish up to 14 inches are present.  The connection to numerous inlets likely allows for the movement of fish in and out of the reservoir.  Proper timing and duration of drawdowns from dam operations as well as good land use practices around the inlets can minimize impacts to the reservoir. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Placid Lake or Pillager Reservoir is formed by the Pillager Power Dam on the Crow Wing River near the town of Pillager.  Fast drop-offs along shore, sunken bars and vegetation beds, as well as islands provide structure in the lake. Anglers have the choice of fishing in the reservoir or traveling up the Crow Wing River. Water turbidity can be affected by flows from the Crow Wing River and several minor tributaries.  <br> \n      Sampling in the lake has proven to be a challenge with the steep near shore drop-offs, suspended debris in the water column, and current.  This assessment was conducted with shoreline trap nets and daytime electrofishing as suspended debris and current makes gill netting difficult.   <br> \n      The species diversity of the fish community is a reflection of a riverine system.  Non-game species such as Silver Redhorse, Common Carp, Greater Redhorse, Shorthead Redhorse, and White Sucker account for much of the biomass in the lake.  Gamefish species found in the lake include Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass. The Walleye population has been sustained at low levels by natural reproduction since the mid-90s when stocking was discontinued.  Status of Northern Pike was not evaluated well with gear types used in this assessment.  Results from early summer electrofishing in 2014 suggest that Placid Lake supports a modest population of Smallmouth Bass.  Most of the bass observed in the sampling were more than 14 inches in length with one 19-inch Smallmouth Bass measured.   Bluegill provide an important fishery on the lake and the survey did show the presence of \"keeper\" size fish over seven inches in length.  Black Crappie do not appear to be overly abundant but anglers have a chance to find some nice fish over 11 inches.  Other panfish species in the lake include Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and Rock Bass. Two species of bullhead, Brown and Yellow, were sampled in the lake. Brown Bullhead was the more numerous and larger of the two species.   The largest Yellow Bullhead was around 10 inches while the largest Brown Bullhead was almost 14 inches.  <br> \n       The connection to Crow Wing River and numerous inlets allows for the movement of fish in and out of the reservoir.
