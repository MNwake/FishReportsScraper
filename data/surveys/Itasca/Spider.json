                "narrative": "<p>Spider Lake is relatively shallow, land-locked lake located eight miles southeast of Marcell, Minnesota.  The lake has one public access and shoreline development is almost exclusively on the north basin.  Spider Lake has a history of producing large Northern Pike so in an attempt to maintain or improve size structure a special regulation was implemented in the spring of 2006.  The regulation requires all Northern Pike from 24 to 36 inches to be released and only one over 36 inches can be in possession.  The daily limit remains at three.  The 2011 lake management plan (LMP) indicates Northern Pike, Muskellunge, and Walleye are the primary species of management with Black Crappie, Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass as secondary species.  The LMP goals were established based what the lake has produced in the past. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in July of 2016 to assess the fish community and evaluate the Northern Pike special regulation.  A total of 12 gill nets and 12 trap nets were used in the survey as well as spring night electrofishing for Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass.  A spring targeted survey was conducted to better evaluate the Muskellunge and Northern Pike populations but those results are presented in a separate report.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches were below average from 1949 to 1999 but noticeably increased in the last three surveys.  In 2016, the catch was a record high for the lake and did not achieve the LMP goal.  High Northern Pike numbers are not desirable because growth and size is generally negatively affected.  The sampled fish ranged from 14.9 to 34.1 inches and averaged 23.0 inches.  Size structure goals were also not attained despite there being more large fish sampled than many other Northern Pike populations.  Natural reproduction has been consistent with fish from 2 to 12 years old sampled.  The strong 2012 and 2013 year-classes represented 60% of the sample and shifted the size structure to more small fish.  Growth remained similar to the statewide averages with fish averaging 21.2 inches after four years.  The special regulation has only been in place for 10 years so additional time is necessary for proper evaluation.  The regulation has protected large fish but the 2016 survey demonstrated how a couple strong year-classes can influence an evaluation in the short-term. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge populations naturally exist at very low densities whether it be a population maintained by stocking or sustained by natural reproduction.  In addition to existing at low densities, Muskellunge are difficult to capture with standard survey gears during the summer.  Consequently, spring trap netting surveys targeting adult fish that move into the shallows to spawn are necessary to monitor the population.  Information on the spring targeted survey in 2016 is presented in a separate report.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye management began in the 1940s, but the 1949 survey suggests the population was very low or non-existent.  Various stocking strategies have been attempted since that time with annual fry stocking in recent years.  Natural reproduction has been observed but appears to be sporadic.  In the eight surveys since 1976, the gill-net catch rates have been within the normal range for lakes with similar habitat; however remained below the LMP goal for the third consecutive survey in 2016.  The sampled fish ranged from 15.9 to 26.8 inches and averaged 20.6 inches.  Nine age-classes were sampled that ranged from age 3 to age 17.  Growth was good compared to the statewide averages with fish averaging 17.0 inches after four years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have been quite variable since 1976.  In 2016, the catch was below average for the lake but similar to other lakes with comparable habitat.  The sampled fish ranged from 4.4 to 12.5 inches and averaged 7.5 inches.  Fish averaged 8.1 inches after four years, which is slow compared to other lakes with similar habitat.  Spider Lake is known for providing quality crappie fishing opportunities following periods of good natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and Smallmouth Bass have been sampled with spring night electrofishing three times since 2005.  Since the spring electrofishing samples typically occur on one night there is the potential for the catches to be influenced by the timing and weather surrounding that night.  The Largemouth Bass catch rates have declined since 2005 but the population remains good.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.2 to 18.6 inches and averaged 11.7 inches.  Good natural reproduction has resulted in fish from 2 to 12 years old being sampled.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages.  Largemouth Bass should provide some excellent fishing at times.        <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass electrofishing catch rates have been more stable but lower than Largemouth Bass.  In 2016, the sampled fish ranged from 11.6 to 19.3 and averaged 15.0 inches.  Six year-classes with fish from age 4 to 11 were sampled.  Growth was slow compared to statewide averages for all ages.  The combination of Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass opportunities in Spider makes the lake a good choice for action and some nice fish. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have been variable but above average compared to other lakes with similar habitat.  In 2016, the catch remained good in terms of numbers but the sampled fish were small; ranging from 5.6 to 9.8 inches with an average of 7.0 inches.  Yellow Perch are probably more important as a prey species within the fish community than a species targeted by anglers due to their small average size. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the survey included Bluegill, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spider Lake is relatively shallow, land-locked lake located eight miles southeast of Marcell, Minnesota.  The lake has one public access and shoreline development is almost exclusively on the north basin.  Spider Lake is a popular multispecies fishery with a history of producing large Northern Pike.  In an attempt to maintain or improve pike sizes a special regulation was implemented in the spring of 2006.  The regulation requires all pike from 24 to 36 inches to be released and only one over 36 inches can be in possession.  The daily limit remains at three.  The 2017 lake management plan (LMP) indicates Northern Pike, Muskellunge, and Walleye are the primary species of management with Black Crappie, Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass as secondary species.  The LMP goals were established based on what the lake has produced in the past. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was conducted in August of 2021 to assess the fish community, evaluate the pike special regulation, and Walleye stocking.  A total of 12 gill nets were used in the survey as well as spring night electrofishing for Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n  <br> \nSpider Lake has a history of lower Northern Pike densities with quality size structures.  The three surveys from 2005 to 2016 documented substantial increases in pike catches but the 2021 catch declined to 6.9 fish/net, which was much closer to the LMP goal.  Pike populations that are lower often have faster growing fish that attain larger sizes, and less negative influences on the rest of the fish community.  The 2021 survey sampled fish that ranged from 13.7 to 33.6 inches and averaged 23.3 inches.  Despite the size structure being better than many pike populations, the size structure goals have never been reached since the special regulation was implemented.  Fish from age 2 to 9 were estimated from bony structures.  Growth remained similar to statewide averages, with fish averaging 21.0 inches after four years.  Even though the special regulation has been in place for 15 years, it may require more time for proper evaluation, especially since the population went through a period of high recruitment.  Anglers could expect good action from mid-sized pike.  <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge populations naturally exist at very low densities whether it be a population maintained by stocking or sustained by natural reproduction.  In addition to existing at low densities, Muskellunge are difficult to capture with standard survey gears during the summer (none sampled in 2021).  Consequently, spring trap netting surveys targeting adult fish that move into the shallows to spawn are necessary to monitor the population.  Information on the spring of 2016 targeted survey is presented in a separate report.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye management began in the 1940s, but the 1949 survey suggests the population was very low or non-existent.  There has been some natural reproduction observed but it appears to be sporadic.  Walleye management has included various stocking strategies to boost the population, with annual fingerling stocking since 2017 the latest.  In the nine surveys since 1976, the catches have fluctuated from 1.3 to 4.5/net.  The catch of 1.3 fish/net in 2021 did not meet the LMP goal of 3.0 fish/net but more time is likely necessary to evaluate the change to fingerling stocking.  The sampled fish ranged from 10.5 to 26.5 inches and averaged 19.2 inches.  Seven age-classes were estimated using scales and otoliths ranging from age 1 to 20.  Growth similar to the statewide averages and fish averaged 14.6 inches after four years of growth.  The data suggests anglers would struggle to catch fish consistently at this time. <br> \n <br> \nSpider Lake can have good crappie fishing at times but they were not the target of this survey.  The 11 crappies sampled by gill nets ranged from 4.4 to 13.0 inches and averaged 9.0 inches.  No age and growth information was collected in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and Smallmouth Bass have been sampled with spring night electrofishing four times since 2005.  Since the electrofishing samples occur on only one night, the timing and weather around that night has potential to influence the catches.  For example, a strong cold front the day before the sample could move bass out of the shallows and reduce the catches.  The Largemouth Bass catches have declined since 2005 but the population remained good in 2021.  The sampled fish ranged from 3.5 to 19.8 inches and averaged 11.0 inches.  Good natural reproduction has resulted in fish from 1 to 14 years old being sampled.  Growth was slower than statewide averages for young fish then similar thereafter.    <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass electrofishing catch rates have been more stable but lower than Largemouth Bass.  The catches have modestly declined in each sample.  In 2021, fish ranged from 5.6 to 18.6 and averaged 14.7 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this survey.  The combination of Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass opportunities in Spider makes the lake a good choice for action and some nice fish. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have ranged from 10.2 to 99.2/net since 1949.  Though the catches have been variable they have been good compared to other lakes that have similar habitat.  The 2021 catch of 10.2 fish/net was the lowest on record so that will be noted for future management.  The sampled perch ranged from 5.2 to 9.4 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.  Yellow Perch are probably more important as a prey species within the fish community than a species targeted by anglers due to their small average size. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the survey included Bluegill, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye gill net CPUE has increased from each previous survey since 1949 and reflects a shift to fingerling stocking.  According to ageing techniques most of the fish sampled corresponded to those years when fingerlings were stocked.  The reason for an abundance of age 3 fish is clouded by the possibility that recruitment may have come from age 1 \"carry-over\" fingerlings stocked in 1987.  These fingerlings were larger (4-5 fish per pound) than usual (10-20 fish per pound) but were not aged.  Therefore it is not clear how much recruitment may have resulted from the 1986 fry stocking.  The walleye growth rate is similar to the state average for all age groups.The gill net CPUE for northern pike has decreased from 6.5 fish per net in 1982 to 3.9 fish per net in this study.  Most fish sampled were from age groups 2-5.  The average weight of each fish in the sample was 2.9 pounds.  Growth rates were good for younger age 2 and 3 fish but near state average for older fish.Smallmouth bass abundance appears to be increasing as the gill net CPUE of 3.5 fish per net is the highest ever recorded for the lake.  The average weight of each fish in the sample was 0.8 pounds and growth rates for all age groups were slightly below the state average.The yellow perch gill net CPUE has decreased significantly as the present CPUE has dropped about 267% from the previous rate in 1982.  The white sucker gill net CPUE has had a similar decrease (187%) since the previous investigation.  The decline of these two principal forage species may be due to an increase in the abundance of the predator species.The trap net CPUE for black crappie and bluegill has increased to an all time high of 18.3 and 29.6 fish per net respectively.  Most (70%) of the black crappie were distributed in the three length groups from 7.5 inches to 8.9 inches.  The size range for bluegills was from 3.5 to 8.4 inches where the model length group was 6.5-6.9 inches.  Both species are providing good fishing for quality sized fish (bluegills larger than 6.0 inches and black crappies larger than 8.0 inches).  Growth rates for both species were slightly below state average.Muskellunge and largemouth bass were not sampled effectively with the standard lake survey netting methods; therefore, no determinations will be made in this report.Black and brown bullheads, rock bass, and pumpkinseed sunfish were also captured in the survey nets.  With the exception of pumpkinseed sunfish, these species are low in abundance.  The trap net CPUE for pumpkinseed was 4.8 fish per net which is about normal for a bass-panfish lake in this area. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spider Lake is a 1349 acre lake located 15 miles north of Grand Rapids, MN.  The fish community is diverse including walleye, northern pike, panfish, as well as smallmouth bass and muskellunge.  Roughly half the lake is less than 15 ft deep with a maximum depth of 36 ft.Walleye gill-net catch was 4.5/set which is near the upper end of the expected range of similar lakes.  This is the highest catch rate ever recorded in Spider Lake.  Walleye fry are currently stocked one out of 3 years.  At least 50% of the fish from this assessment were from nonstocked year classes indicating that strong natural reproduction is occurring.  Size structure was excellent with several fish exceeding 20 inches.  Walleye growth was faster than the statewide average for ages 1 to 5, and slower than the statewide averages for ages 6 to 9.  On average it takes 7 years for walleye in Spider Lake to reach preferred length of 19 inches.  Because most walleye in a lake greater than 19 inches are females, and it takes at least 7 years to replace a fish of this size, anglers should consider releasing walleye greater than 19 inches.  Northern pike gill-net abundance was 4.5/set which is within the expected range of similar lakes.  Size structure was moderate with most fish around 20 inches, however, very few fish exceeded preferred length of 28 inches.  Muskellunge gill-net catch was 0.3/set which is within the interquartile range of 0.2 to 0.6/set.  A more detailed spring muskellunge survey was conducted in 1997 which described a healthy muskellunge population.Largemouth bass gill-net abundance was 0.2/set which is lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Trap-net catch was 0.7/set which was equal to the average catch rate for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with no fish greater than 10 inches sampled.  Smallmouth bass were abundant with a gill-net catch of 2.4/set which is higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was moderate with a few fish exceeding 14 inches.  Smallmouth bass growth was slightly below statewide averages.  Bluegill trap-net catch was 18.6/set which is within the expected range of similar lakes.  Size structure was moderate with a few fish exceeding 8 inches.  Anglers are often unaware that bluegill grow more slowly compared to other species.  On average it takes 7 to 8 years for bluegill to reach 8 inches.  Because it takes so long to replace an 8 inch or better bluegill, anglers should consider releasing a portion of their catch. Black crappie gill-net catch was 1.4/set which is similar to the average catch rate for similar lakes.  Size structure was moderate with a few fish exceeding 9 inches.  Black crappie growth was similar to statewide averages.  In Spider Lake it takes more than 5 years before black crappie reach preferred length of 10 inches.  Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 11.5/set which is within the expected range of similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with no fish exceeding 9 inches.Other fish species present include brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spider Lake is a 1,349 acre lake located 8 miles southeast of Marcell, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  Spider Lake has a maximum depth of 36 feet and clear water (13 ft Secchi depth).  Spider Lake is in lake class #25 and supports a diverse fish community.The 2005 walleye gill-net catch was down slightly from the previous assessment, but was still near the lake class average at 2.8/net.  Size structure was good; fish in the gill-net sample varied from 9.4 to 27.3 inches with an average length of 19.8 inches.  Some natural reproduction of walleye has been documented in past assessments, and the population is supplemented with fry stocked every third year.  Ages 1, 3, 4 and 6-10 were represented in the 2005 sample, with 67% of the fish attributed to stocked years.  Growth was slightly above the statewide average.The northern pike gill-net catch rate increased to a historic high of 8.2/net.  Gill-net sampled pike ranged from 10.9 to 40.8 inches with an average length of 20.5 inches.  Size structure was modest overall, but two fish over 36 inches were sampled.  Ages 1-5 and 9 were represented and growth was slightly above the statewide average. The gill-net catch rate for yellow perch (29.1/net) was above the lake class normal range third quartile (24.2), but lower than the catches in 4 of the 6 previous assessments.  Yellow perch in the 2005 assessment varied from 5.5 to 9.2 inches with an average length of 7.1 inches.  Yellow perch in Spider are more important as a prey species for larger gamefish than as a target for anglers.Smallmouth bass are present in Spider Lake and catch rates in gill nets have been above the normal range in all assessments since 1982.  This species is typically not sampled well with traditional test netting.  A night electrofishing assessment conducted in late May 2005 yielded a moderate catch rate of 17.0 smallmouth bass/hour of on-time.  Size structure was modest; fish ranged from 6.3 to 15.9 inches with an average length of 11.9 inches.  Gill-net sampled fish also had an average length of 11.9 inches.  Ages 3-7 were represented in the sample and growth was more than 15% below the statewide average.The electrofishing catch rate for largemouth bass was considerably higher at 104.2/hour of on-time.   Size structure was poor, however, with fish ranging from 4.9 to 18.6 inches and an average length of 9.3 inches.  Ages 2-8 were represented in the sample.  Growth was below the statewide average for ages 1 and 2, and similar to the statewide average for all other ages.  Two muskellunge were sampled in this assessment, both in the 34-35 inch range.  Muskellunge are generally not sampled well with mid-summer test-netting, but several spring muskie assessments have been conducted on Spider Lake since 1981.  The population is considered to be healthy and is maintained entirely by natural reproduction.The trap-net catch rate for bluegill (22.8/net) was within the normal range and similar to previous surveys.  Size structure was poor in 2005; fish in the sample varied from 3.4 to 7.3 inches with an average length of 4.9 inches.  The trap-net catch for black crappie was above the normal range at 4.3/net.  Size structure was moderate; fish in the sample ranged from 5.0 to 11.2 inches with an average length of 8.9 inches.  Ages 2 and 4-7 were represented in the sample.  Growth was below the statewide average for ages 1-3 and similar to the statewide average for ages 4-7.  Other species sampled in test nets included: common shiner, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker and brown bullhead.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spider Lake is a class 25 lake located about eight miles southeast of Marcell, Minnesota.  The lake is located in the Chippewa National Forest and has limited shoreline development.  The 2006 lake management plan indicates walleye, northern pike and muskellunge as the primary species of management with black crappie, largemouth bass and smallmouth bass as secondary species.  In 2006, a 24 to 36 inch protected slot length limit with only one fish over 36 inches in possession was implemented for northern pike.  The 2010 assessment also included additional sampling of near shore fish species in order to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough black crappie are often targeted by anglers on Spider Lake, our standardized summer assessments in early August have not sampled them well in most years.  The trap net catch rates have been below 1.0 fish/net in four of the seven assessments.  In 2010, the catch was 0.9 fish/net but was within the normal range for the lake class.  The sampled fish ranged from 3.5 to 11.2 inches and averaged 8.2 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates have been fairly stable in all assessments; ranging from 18.2 fish/trap net in 1976 to 39.1 fish/trap net in 1982.  In 2010, the trap net catch was 23.3 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 3.0 to 8.2 inches and averaged 5.1 inches.  Size structure was similar for bluegill sampled by gill nets.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass have been sampled with spring night electrofishing three times.  The catch rates were 12.2/hr in 1994, 104.2/hr in 2005, and 49.1/hr in 2010.  In 2010, the sampled fish ranged from 5.5 to 16.2 inches and averaged 11.4 inches.  Most of the fish were from 11 to 14 inches.  Fish from age 2 to 9 were identified with age 4 & 5 representing 59% of the sample.  Growth was somewhat slow compared to statewide averages. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are rarely sampled in our standardized summer assessments.  Special spring assessments targeting muskellunge around the time they spawn is used to evaluate their population.  The last muskellunge assessment was in the spring of 2007. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill net catch rates have ranged from a low of 0 in 1949 to a high of 9.2 fish/net in 2010.  The 2006 management plan indicates the goal for northern pike is to maintain a gill net catch of 4.0 fish/net while increasing the proportion of fish over 28 inches to 25% and over 34 inches to 10%.  The sampled fish ranged from 15.5 to 36.6 inches and averaged 22.8 inches.  The proportion of fish over 28 inches was 21% while 3% of the fish were over 34 inches.  Although size structure appears to be improving, recruitment has remained high.  Interestingly, regardless of length or age, all the northern pike sampled in the gill nets were sexually mature.  In addition to abundant spawning habitat and good conditions, early sexual maturity is probably responsible for the high recruitment.  Eleven year-classes from age 1 to 14 were identified from scales and cliethra, with age 2 to 4 the most common.  However, there were a fair number of fish age 6 and older likely in response to the protection the slot length limit is providing.  Growth was similar to the statewide averages. <br> \n  <br> \nSmallmouth bass have been sampled in Spider Lake since 1976.  The catch has been above average in each assessment except 1976.  The 2010 catch was 1.5 fish/gill net.  The electrofishing catch rate of 15.6/hr in 2010 was similar to the catch in 2005 ( 17.0/hr).  These fish ranged from 5.0 to 16.2 inches and averaged 11.3 inches.  Seven year-classes were identified from scales and opercles with fish from age 2 to 8 present.  Growth was slow compared to the statewide averages. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2006 management plan indicates the goal for walleye is to maintain a gill net catch of 3.5 fish/net.  The walleye gill-net catch rate was 1.7 fish/net in 2010; the lowest since 1976.  It is likely the increase in bass and northern pike in the last couple assessments is at least partially responsible for the poor walleye numbers.  The sampled fish ranged from 12.4 to 26.6 inches and averaged 17.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry have been stocked roughly every three years since 1992.  Although natural reproduction has been documented in previous assessments, the walleye aged in the 2010 assessment strongly corresponded to stocked years.  Six year-classes were identified by scale, opercle and otolith analysis with fish from age 2 to 14 present.  Walleye growth was good with three year old fish averaging 14.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population has fluctuated considerably over the years yet has never been below the lake class average.  In the previous three assessments, gill net catch rates were 11.5 in 1999, 29.1 in 2005 and 10.6 in 2010.  The 2010 gill net catch was lowest ever recorded for the lake.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5.6 to 8.7 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.  Due to the yellow perch size structure, they are probably more important within the fish community as a competitor and prey source than as a species desired by anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed in the assessment include brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker.  Additional species documented while conducting IBI sampling include banded killifish, bluntnose minnow, brook stickleback, central mudminnow, log perch, spottail shiner, and tadpole madtom. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water\u0019s edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spider Lake is a designated muskellunge lake located eight miles southeast of Marcell, Minnesota within the Chippewa National Forest and Mississippi River Watershed.  The lake is in Lake Class 25.  Lakes in this classification are hard water lakes of moderate size and depth with a high percent of littoral area.  Spider Lake is 1,349 acres (55% littoral), has a maximum depth of 36 feet, total alkalinity of 86 ppm and a Secchi disk reading of 7.5 feet.  The lake has no defined inlets or outlets.\n\nSpring muskellunge assessments have been conducted on Spider Lake since 1981.  The data is used to evaluate changes in management such as regulations, stocking regimes, and the effect of catch and release on the population.  Muskellunge were first stocked in Spider Lake in 1953 to create a brood lake for propagation and a fishery.  Following the 1981 spring assessment, muskellunge stocking was discontinued due to the high numbers of small fish observed and the anticipation of the population to be naturally self-sustaining.  It appears the Shoepack strain was the only strain of muskellunge ever stocked in Spider Lake.  Northern pike were also targeted in 2007 in an effort to evaluate the 24 to 36 inch protected slot length limit.  All other species numbers were counted (low numbers) or estimated (high numbers) from each net.\n\nAs the ice retreated from the lake on 4/23/07, 16 large-frame trap nets were set with the last four nets set on 4/25/07 for a total of 20 trap nets.  Sampling occurred from April 23 to May 3, a period of 10 days that resulted in 171 net nights.  All muskellunge and northern pike were measured for length and given a caudal fin punch as a mark.  All muskellunge were weighed, sexed, and scales were collected.  Recaptured fish were recorded each day but were not re-measured.  The multiple census method was used to estimate primarily the sexually mature muskellunge population during the pre-spawn movements in response to warming waters.\n\nSpring weather conditions were ideal for sampling muskellunge that included stable weather patterns with low wind and gradually warming water temperatures.  A total of 70 different muskellunge were sampled of which two were hybrids.  The catch rate of 0.74 muskellunge/net exceeded the Lake Management Plan goal of 0.4 fish/net; however, the catch rate likely reflected the ideal weather conditions more than population density.  The 31 males sampled ranged from 28.9 to 34.8 inches while the 39 females ranged from 32.1 to 45.3 inches (Figure 1).  The lack of overlap of lengths for males and females may indicate only a few age-classes are present in the population (Figure 2).  \n\nMuskellunge were not aged due to difficulty in aging and lack of confidence in the ages.  A cliethrum bone was collected from a dead 30.7 inch male that appeared to be from 9 to 11 years old.  The fish with the bone was one of the smaller fish sampled and we decided that reliable estimates of age could not be determined from scale samples in this population with the current size structure.\n\nThe spring population estimate was determined by the Modified Schnabel method.  Of the 126 muskellunge captured in this assessment 56 were recaptured individuals (Figure 3).  The adult population was estimated at 93 fish with 95% confidence intervals of 70 to 116 fish (Table 1).  The estimate translates into one muskellunge for every 14.5 acres or 0.07 fish/acre.  The spring muskellunge catch rate was the second highest ever observed for Spider Lake but the population estimate was the lowest ever (Table 2).  This is evidence that spring muskellunge trap net catch rates should not be used to infer population density.  The low population density may partially explain why we observed the highest ever mean length, weight, largest fish, and percent of fish greater than 36 and 40 inches for Spider Lake in 2007 (Table 3). \n\nIn previous years, northern pike lengths were sub sampled during spring muskellunge assessments.  Due to the large number of small fish measured in most assessments, there was speculation as to whether these small fish were representative of the true size structure or if they were disproportionately recaptured.  Also, population estimates are generally calculated for muskellunge but there has been a growing interest in estimating northern pike density as well.  In an effort to answer these questions, all northern pike were measured and given a fin punch for the first time in 2007.\n\nA total of 1,545 northern pike were captured (234 were recaptured) resulting in a catch rate of 9.04 fish/net.  The catch per day declined throughout the assessment and despite a large number of fish receiving marks each day, the proportion of fish recaptured did not increase substantially (Figure 3).  Consequently, it appears northern pike behavior violates the multiple census assumptions sufficiently so that a population estimate cannot be calculated.  The large proportion of new northern pike sampled each day also indicates the high number of small northern pike likely reflects the population size structure as opposed to re-measuring a high proportion of recaptured fish.\n\nEffectively monitoring northern pike size structure is one of the main tools for evaluating the special slot length regulation.  The spring assessment in 2007 was the first sampling since implementation of the regulation in 2006.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 12.6 to 38.3 inches with a mean length of 21.4 inches.  Based on the measured fish, 26% were 24 inches or longer (Figure 4) and these fish were within the 24 to 36 inch protected length range of the regulation.  Spring trap net PSD, RSD-P, and RSD-M values were 59, 8, and 0.3, respectively.  Additional spring and summer assessments will continue to monitor the population for the next 15 years.\n</p>",

Walleye catch per unit effort (CPUE) in gill nets was down from 3.7 in 1989 to 2.9 in 1994.  The lake class median is 3.4.  Five assessments have been completed on Spider Lake since 1949 and the average CPUE of walleye is 2.0/set.  Average size of walleye, however, is excellent and well above the lake class median.  Spider Lake is known as a lake with moderate abundance of walleye but large sized fish.Northern pike CPUE in gill nets is also down from 3.9 in 1989 to 2.5 in 1994.  The lake class median is 5.8.  Average abundance of northern pike in the five assessments since 1949 is 3.3/set.  As with walleye, average size of northern pike is excellent, approximately 4.0 pounds per fish.Muskellunge were last stocked in 1979.  Natural reproduction is occurring and one fish was sampled in this assessment.  Anglers have reported catching fish greater than 40 inches in length.Bluegill abundance is very similar to that found in 1989.  Average size is 6.8 inches in the gill nets and 6.3 inches in the trap nets.Smallmouth bass abundance, although down from the 1989 assessment, is still above the third quartile for the lake class.  Average size of smallmouth bass sampled in 1994 was 12.3 inches.  Largemouth bass and black crappie are also present in moderate abundance.</p>",
