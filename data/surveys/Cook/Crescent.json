The walleye population was supported entirely by natural reproduction.  Muskellunge were present in fair numbers, but none over 32 inches were collected.  All of the muskellunge collected were produced naturally.  The likelihood of catching a legal-sized muskellunge in this lake appeared to be remote, since the fish did not grow quickly, and were descendants of Shoepac Lake-strain fish, which do not attain a large size.  No northern pike were found in this assessment, but they may be present in small numbers, since they have been found in this lake in the past.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>As has usually been the case in this lake, walleye were abundant in 1999.  The mean weight for walleye (0.9 lb/fish) was one the highest seen in this lake since 1954, and many fish larger than 16 inches were collected.  The walleye population was entirely self-sustained, with strong year classes in 1997 and 1996.  Walleye growth rates had been about average for the area; four-year-old fish averaged 14.4 inches in length when collected in mid-July.Muskellunge were also abundant, but small.  Crescent Lake muskellunge are Shoepac-strain fish, and rarely (if ever) exceed the 40-in minimum size limit.  Most of the musky collected in 1999 were four and five-year-old fish, less than 30 inches in length.  The musky population is also entirely self-sustained.Smallmouth bass were collected in this lake for the first time in 1999, after being reported by anglers in 1998.  They were probably introduced illegally, since none have ever been seen in this watershed before.  The species seemed to be well-established; fish from four year classes were collected.  Most were young fish, under 10 inches in length.Forage for game fish was provided by a modest yellow perch population, and by fair numbers of small white sucker.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crescent Lake is currently managed for walleye and muskellunge, and has a reputation for producing fairly high numbers of small walleye.  Smallmouth bass were first found in the lake in the late 1990s, and have complicated walleye fishing since.  The current lake management plan (2010) established a long range goal for walleye of a minimum gill net catch of 6.0 fish/set.  The goal for the muskellunge population was a minimum gill net catch of 1.0 fish/set, with some fish over 30 inches present.  The 2014 survey was to have been the second of three intended to monitor walleye and muskellunge populations and determine whether the introduction of smallmouth bass had an adverse effect on walleye, muskellunge, or yellow perch in this lake.  The first survey (in 2011) was canceled due to a lack of staff and funding. <br> \n <br> \nAs has usually been the case in this lake, walleye were fairly abundant, but small, in 2014.  The number of walleye caught per gill net met the long range goal from the lake management plan and was above average for this type of lake; however, the catch was low for this lake historically.  Mean individual weight for walleye taken in gill nets was the second highest for the lake historically, and was above average for the lake class.  Walleye have not been stocked in Crescent Lake since 1976, so all walleye found in 2014 were naturally produced.  Ten year classes were identified in the sample: 2002, and 2004-2012.  No year class stood out as exceptionally strong, but the catch was dominated by two- three-, and four-year-old fish.  Walleye growth rates had been close to average for the lake class. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were fairly abundant in Crescent Lake in 2014, and many were larger than 30 inches; however, there was very little chance of catching a 'legal' size fish in this lake.   <br> \nMuskellunge were introduced in Crescent Lake in the late 1970s, and have been self-sustained since that time.  Unfortunately, muskellunge stocked in Crescent Lake were Shoepack-strain fish with very limited potential for producing large fish.  The 2014 muskellunge catch met management goals for the species in this lake, and included fish as large as 40 inches.  Very few larger fish have ever been seen or reported from Crescent Lake, or any other lake in Cook County.  The 2014 catch was similar, in terms of number and size of fish taken, to catches seen in every assessment of Crescent Lake since 1993.   Mean weight of gill netted muskellunge ranked well above the median for the lake class.  Two gillnetted fish were considered to be tiger musky based on color and pattern.  A few northern pike were also present in Crescent Lake in 2014, but northern pike numbers have been low since muskellunge became established in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were first caught in assessment nets in 1999. They were probably more abundant in 2014 than catches in gill and trap nets would indicate.  The 11 bass taken in 2014 had grown slowly. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was high in 2014, but most were too small to have been of much interest to anglers.  Growth rates of perch appeared to have started out slow and to have gradually improved as the fish aged. <br> \n <br> \nThe number of white sucker caught in 2014 was the lowest seen in this lake historically, although it was within the usual range for the lake class.  The average size of white sucker was also the lowest in the lake's assessment history. <br> \n <br> \nSmall-mesh (0.25-inch) trap nets used in this survey caught a few small pumpkinseed sunfish and numerous golden shiners.  Additional small species have been caught in previous surveys and are likely still present in the lake.  Small-mesh trap nets also collected average numbers of young-of-year yellow perch, and high numbers of young-of-year white sucker.  No young-of-year walleye were captured. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crescent Lake had a fairly large population of fairly small walleye.  Most walleye were from 11 to 14 inches long.  All resulted from natural reproduction, which appeared to have been successful for ten straight years.  Growth rates appeared to have been slightly above average for the first two years and slightly below average for the next three years, when compared to similar lakes.  Crescent Lake walleye reached 9.5 inches at age 3, 11.5 inches at age 4, 12.7 inches at age 5, and 18 inches by age 8.Muskellunge abundance could be considered moderate, but because this species is not common in the area few lakes are available for comparison.  Over the last ten years the population appears to have been stable and average size has increased slightly to 5.7 pounds.  One fish caught reached the legal minimum length of 40 inches.Smallmouth bass were first collected in 1999.  The 2002 catch was above the lake-class median, but average size was smaller than usually seen in similar lakes.Yellow perch abundance was lower in 2002 than in most previous assessments, but was not unusually low for lakes of this class.  Maximum length of yellow perch was 8 inches, which was typical for this lake.  White sucker abundance was slightly above average, and their mean size was slightly below average, when compared to similar lakes.  Both species provide forage for the game fish in Crescent Lake.</p>",

Mean weight of walleye in gill nets was higher than it had been in any previous assessment of Crescent Lake, and was above average for the lake class.  Walleye have not been stocked since 1976, so all were naturally produced.  Ten year classes were identified, indicating consistent natural reproduction.  Growth rates of walleye had been close to the average for the lake class.Muskellunge appeared to be somewhat less abundant, but larger, than in most recent assessments, but none exceeded the minimum legal length.  Stocking ended after 1979, so all were naturally produced.This was the third assessment that collected smallmouth bass; it produced the highest gill-net and trap-net catches so far.  Bass were more abundant, but smaller, than the average for the lake class.  Growth had been slower than the average for the area.Northern pike have not been abundant since muskellunge were introduced, but they grow quickly.The gill-net catch of yellow perch was among the higher catches for both the lake and the lake class, but average size was small.  The growth rate of perch had been close to the average for the area.The number of white sucker caught in gill nets was typical of catches in previous assessments in this lake and similar lakes.  Mean weight in this assessment was fairly low for the lake and lake class.</p>",
