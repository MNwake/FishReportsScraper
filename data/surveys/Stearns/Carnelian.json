Other species present are Blackchin Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow, White Sucker, Black, Yellow and Brown Bullhead, Banded Killifish and Yellow Perch. Northern Pike are abundant. Catch was 11.5/lift, over twice the local median. Abundance has declined somewhat from the 1981 assessment of 16.8/gill net. Fish ranged from 11 to 31 inches and the average weight was 1.6 lbs. Age classes 1-6 are represented and growth was average. Bluegills were the most common sunfish sampled. Catch of (22.8/trap net) is similar to the local area median. Several age classes were represented and growth is below average. Green Sunfish (0.2/trap net) and hybrid sunfish (0.7/trap net) were present in numbers below the respective lower quartile catch rates. A total of 19 Largemouth Bass were sampled using standard survey gear. Age classes represented were young of the year, 1, 2, 5 and 9. An additional 53 bass were taken during spring electrofishing. Again, several age classes were represented and lengths ranged from 3 to 21 inches. Growth was average. Catch of Black Crappie was 1.2/trap net- near the lower quartile. Ages 1-6 were present and growth was average. Ten out of twelve Walleyes sampled were survivors of a 1979 fingerling stocking. The catch rate of 2.0/gill net is near the local median of 1.7/lift the fish ranged in length from 11 to 29 inches. Mean lengths for same-age males vs females are 20 & 25 in., respectively. The average weight was 4.2 lbs. Composite growth is average. Contributions from natural reproduction are minimal. The relative abundance of Black and Yellow Bullheads has increased slightly since 1981. Black Bullheads were readily taken in gill nets with 9-10 inch fish common. Yellow Perch were captured at a rate of 0.8/gill net - below the local median of 6.8/ lift. That was similar to the 1981 catch of 0.3/ gill net.</p>",

Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 6 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 3 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 1 station. Nearshore sampling captured 12 species of fish including 2 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish and Blackchin Shiner) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in June 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Carnelian Lake from this survey is below an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes..  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Sauk River Watershed.</p>",

Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six sites, a 15-foot seine was used at three sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at one sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Blacknose Shiner) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2016 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Carnelian Lake from this survey is below an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Sauk River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

The catch rate of northern pike in gill nets did not significantly change for the last survey and remained within expected levels for this lake type.  Northern pike caught ranged in length from 13.4-29.3 inches and averaged 22.1 inches in length.  The average weight of northern pike sampled (2.6 pounds) was also within expected levels for this lake class.  No dominant year class was apparent and the growth rate of pike was average when compared with other populations in the state.      The catch rate of walleye in gill nets did not significantly change from the last survey of the lake, but remained low for this lake class.  Walleye caught ranged in length from 19.4-26.4 and averaged 22.8 inches in length.  The average weight of walleye sampled was 4.5 pounds which is large for lakes similar to Carnelian.  The growth rate of walleye was fast for one to four year old fish and average for ages five through nine.     The catch rate of bluegill in trap nets did not appear to change from the previous survey and remained within expected levels for this lake type.  Bluegill caught ranged in size from 3.1-7.2 inches and averaged 4.7 inches in length.  Two to seven year old fish were sampled with three and four year old fish making up 71% of the total catch.  The overall growth rate of bluegill was average when compared with other populations in the state.     The catch rate of black crappie in trap nets did not change and remained average for this lake type.  Black crappie caught ranged in length from 7.6-10.7 inches and averaged 8.6 inches in length.  Three to five year old fish were sampled and the growth rate of black crappie was average.     Spring electrofishing estimated that there were 858 largemouth bass in Carnelian Lake over 8 inches in length.  The catch rate of all sizes of bass was 86.4 fish per hour of sampling time.  This is over four times the average rate for bass sampling in the Montrose Area.  One to ten year old fish were sampled, with four and five year old fish dominating the catch (79%).  The growth rate of largemouth bass was average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carnelian Lake is a small, 164 acre lake located three miles north of the town of Kimball in Stearns County.  The lake has a maximum depth of the lake is 36 feet and a public access is located on the south side of the lake, but with limited parking.  An experimental regulation of five sunfish per day has been in place since 2007 with the goal of improving the average size of Bluegill.  The lake supports a diverse aquatic plant community, which provides important fish habitat as well as shoreline protection from erosion.  Some of the more common submergent plant species included: coontail, northern watermilfoil, sago pondweed, bushy pondweed, and Illinois pondweed.   <br> \n <br> \nA targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted on Carnelian Lake from May 26 to May 29, 2015.  This assessment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the 5 fish daily bag limit as well as to get an idea of the size structure of the spawning Bluegills.  A total of 276 Bluegills were sampled during this assessment and averaged 7.7 inches long with the largest measuring 9.5 inches.  Fisheries biologists describe the size structure of a fish population using terms such as Proportional Stock Density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD).  For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 6\".  The PSD of Bluegill from Carnelian was 89.  So, 89% of the Bluegill sampled larger than 3\" were also larger than 6\".  Similarly, RSD8 is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 8\".  The RSD8 on Carnelian Lake was 54.  In addition to Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish were also sampled during the assessment.  A total of 35 Hybrid Sunfish were sampled and averaged 8.3 inches long with a maximum length of 9.7 inches.  A similar assessment was completed in 2011 but extremely high water levels reduced the effectiveness of the trap nets and likely limited catches.  Only 59 Bluegill were sampled in the 2011 assessment and fish averaged 7.8 inches with a maximum length of 10.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe average replacement time for an eight inch sunfish in central Minnesota is 5 8 years.  Therefore anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill.  Especially adult males which are more colorful during the spring time when they are in the process of spawning and are more easily exploited by anglers.  The larger male Bluegills are important to maintaining a healthy size structure as they limit the potential that the rest of the population can get to.  Anglers can help to maintain good fishing for Bluegill on Carnelian Lake by selectively harvesting medium sized females and releasing larger males. <br> \n <br> \nAnother targeted Bluegill assessment will be completed on Carnelian Lake in the spring of 2016 to collect additional data for the DNR to use in deciding the future of the experimental regulation.  This review process will begin in the fall of 2016 and a public meeting will be held then to discuss the findings.  Early indications are that the regulation has been successful in improving the numbers of larger Bluegill in Carnelian Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carnelian Lake is a small, 164-acre lake located three miles north of the town of Kimball in Stearns County. It has a maximum depth of 36 feet and an average water clarity of 13.1 feet during the summer. Oxygen was adequate for sport fish to a depth of 18 feet during the second week of August. Carnelian Lake has a small watershed (2,950 acres) in which land use consists primarily of agriculture (56%), open water (14%), hay/pasture (11%), residential (9%), forest (6%) and grassland (4%). A public access is located on the south side of the lake, with parking for four vehicle/trailer combinations. A special 5-fish bag limit is in place with the goal of increasing and preserving the size structure of the Bluegill population. A standard survey was conducted in 2016 to monitor the effects of the special regulation as well as changes in the fishery since the last survey conducted in 2004. Along with the standard survey, a targeted Bluegill survey was conducted in May and emergent and floating leaf plant mapping and near-shore Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) surveys were conducted in August to evaluate the physical habitat of Carnelian Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCarnelian Lake has a diverse aquatic plant community. While no submerged aquatic plant survey was conducted in 2016, one conducted in 2004 found 37 species of aquatic plants with Chara spp., coontail, northern milfoil, bushy pondweed, Illinois pondweed, and sago pondweed being the most common. Emergent and floating leaf vegetation was mapped and it was determined that approximately 40% of the shoreline contained at least one type of native vegetation with bulrush and yellow waterlily being the most common. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate increased from the previous survey in 2004. This catch rate was greater than the long term average for Carnelian Lake and higher than what is considered ideal to maintain a balanced population of predator species. The average size of Northern Pike sampled was 1.6 pounds an 19 inches. Anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike (under 22 inches) and release the larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and to improve growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also increase Walleye stocking success and allow Yellow Perch numbers (which are low) to increase. Higher perch populations are desirable as they are an important prey species for both Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \nThe catch rate of Walleye in Carnelian Lake remained unchanged since 1994, and was below expected levels for lakes with similar characteristics. The historical catch of Walleye has been consistently low, ranging from 0 to 2.0 per gill net. The average size of Walleye caught in gill nets was large at 3.4 pounds and most ranged in length from 21 to 25 inches. Walleye are not stocked in Carnelian Lake by the DNR, but they have been occasionally stocked privately with the last recorded stocking taking place in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing at a rate that was three times higher than the average daytime rate for the Sauk Rapids Area. The Largemouth Bass size structure is well balanced and fish are in good condition. Of the catchable size Largemouth Bass (> 8 inches) caught, 47% were greater than 12 inches and 22% were greater than 15 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Black Crappie in trap nets and gill nets increased from the previous survey, and were higher than expected values for lakes similar to Carnelian. Black Crappie catches are known to fluctuate widely depending on the success of spawning which is largely dependent on environmental factors. Anglers should expect good fishing for Black Crappie in the next few years on Carnelian as the majority of fish ranged in length from 6 to 11 inches with an average length of around 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Bluegill in Carnelian Lake was similar to 2004 and remained near the long term average. While the average size of Bluegill from the August survey was only about 6 inches, the spring survey showed that quality size Bluegill up to nearly 10 inches can be found and 35% of the Bluegill sampled were larger than eight inches. Seasonal differences in trap net catches for panfish related to size and abundance have to do with water temperatures and the completion of spawning. Generally catches are not as good in late summer due to the fact that larger mature fish move into deeper, cooler water where they are not sampled as well by trap nets that are set in shallow water near the shore. The average replacement time for an eight inch sunfish in central Minnesota is 5-8 years. The reduced bag limit of five sunfish per day has the effect of reducing harvest, especially during the times of the year when sunfish are more easily exploited by anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. All of these species (with the exception of Bowfin) were sampled at rates either within or below the range of expected values for the respective lake class.  <br> \n <br> \nChanges in shoreline development have the potential to negatively affect the health of a lake. It is important that all lake shore owners follow County shoreline rules and only mow a small area down to the lake to allow access and avoid clearing their entire shoreline. Native vegetation helps stabilize shoreline soils and acts as a buffer reducing the amount of pollution that enters a lake from runoff. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carnelian Lake is a small, 164 acre lake located three miles north of the town of Kimball in Stearns County. The lake has a maximum depth of 36 feet and a public access is located on the south side of the lake, but with limited parking. Carnelian Lake has had experimental regulations restricting the harvest of sunfish since 1996. In 1996, the sunfish bag limit was reduced from 20 to 10/day. This regulation was in place until 2007 when the sunfish bag limit was further reduced to five sunfish per day. The goal of the regulation is to reduce harvest and improve the average size of sunfish. A targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted on Carnelian Lake from May 31 to June 3, 2016. This assessment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the 5 fish daily bag limit as well as to get an idea of the size structure of the spawning Bluegills. A total of 365 Bluegills were sampled during this assessment and averaged 7.0 inches long with the largest measuring 9.6 inches. Fisheries biologists describe the size structure of a fish population using terms such as Proportional Stock Density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD). For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 6\". The PSD of Bluegill from Carnelian was 76. So, 76% of the Bluegill sampled larger than 3\" were also larger than 6\". Similarly, RSD8 is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 8\". The RSD8 on Carnelian Lake was 38. In addition to Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish were also sampled during the assessment. A total of 35 Hybrid Sunfish were sampled and averaged 8.3 inches long with a maximum length of 9.7 inches. A Bluegill assessment was completed in 2015 and results were similar. A total of 276 Bluegill were sampled in the 2015 assessment and fish averaged 7.7 inches with a maximum length of 9.5 inches. The PSD was 89 and RSD8 was 54. These results are similar to previous assessments on Carnelian Lake and very favorable when compared to other lakes in the Sauk Rapids management area.  <br> \n <br> \nA public meeting was held in the fall of 2016 and based on positive results of the experimental regulation and comments from the public the decision was made to make the 5 sunfish daily bag limit permanent beginning in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nThe average replacement time for an eight inch sunfish in central Minnesota is 5 8 years. Therefore anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill. Especially adult males which are more colorful during the spring time when they are in the process of spawning and are more easily exploited by anglers. The larger male Bluegills are important to maintaining a healthy size structure as they restrict reproduction of smaller males, allowing the smaller males to put more energy into growth and less into reproduction. Anglers can help to maintain good fishing for Bluegill on Carnelian Lake by selectively harvesting medium sized females and releasing larger males. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carnelian Lake is a small, 164-acre lake located three miles north of the town of Kimball in Stearns County.  The maximum depth of the lake is 36 feet.  A public access is located on the south side of the lake, but with limited parking.  Black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, and yellow perch are all present in the lake.  A special regulation is in place with the goal of improving average size of bluegill; the limit is ten per day.  In August of 2004, a lake survey was conducted on Carnelian Lake. The netting of the lake revealed the following information about the fish populations. The northern pike catch rate by gill nets increased from the previous survey in 1994 (6.8/net) to 2004 (11.5/net).  This catch rate was greater than the expected range for lakes that are similar to Carnelian Lake.  The average size of northern pike caught in gill nets  decreased from 2.6 pounds to 1.0 pounds during the same period.  Growth rates were slow.The catch rate of walleye in Carnelian Lake (1.2/net) remained unchanged from 1994 (1.0/net), and was below expected levels for lakes with similar characteristics. The average size of walleye caught in gill nets was 2.8 pounds.  Most of the walleye ranged in length from 17 to 20 inches.  Walleye is the only species stocked in Carnelian Lake, and was privately stocked in 2001 and 2003.  The largest age class present was from the 2001 stocking, but one walleye sampled was estimated to be 16 years old and did not correspond to any documented stocking efforts.  Growth rates of the 2001 fingerlings were good compared to statewide averages.  The historical catch of walleye has been consistently low, ranging from 0 to 2.0 per gill net. The gill net catch rate of yellow perch in Carnelian Lake (2.5/net) decreased from the last survey (4.8/net), and also fell below the expected range for lakes similar to Carnelian. The yellow perch sampled were between 5.5 and 9 inches in length, which is typical for this type of lake.  Largemouth bass were sampled in spring by night electrofishing. The catch rate was over three times the average rate for lakes in the Montrose management area. Of the catchable size bass (greater than 8 inches), 34 percent were greater than 12 inches. The largest bass sampled in 2004 was just over 19 inches.The catch rate of black crappie in trap nets was similar to the 1994 survey, and was within expected values for lakes similar to Carnelian. The majority of the crappies sampled on Carnelian Lake were either 2 or 3 years old, and averaged 7.9 inches in length; this is considered average growth.  The catch of bluegill (13.8/net) decreased from 1994 (29.1/net) but remained within expected levels for this lake type.  The average weight of bluegill was low, and their growth was considered typical of statewide averages.  The majority of bluegill caught in trap nets ranged in size from 4.5 to 7.0  inches with a maximum of  8.3 inches. Bluegill captured in the gillnets however, tended to be larger with most ranging between 6.0 to 8.0 inches and four individuals over 9 inches.  </p>",
