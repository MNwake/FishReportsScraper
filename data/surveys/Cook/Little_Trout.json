Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 16 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 27.2 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 7.2?C (45.0?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 8.8?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Lake Trout. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Lake Trout was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. Data collected in 1970-2002 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat in most years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1999. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Lake Trout are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

The gill net catch was above the normal range for a Class 3 lake.  The average weight for lake trout collected in 2011 was 2.2 lb/fish, which was close to average for lakes of this class.   <br> \n <br> \nLake trout in Little Trout Lake are native.  All had been produced naturally, and several year classes were present.  Growth rates had been about average for this lake class in this area.  Five-year-old fish (the 2006 year class) appeared to be relatively abundant, and averaged 17.8 inches long when captured. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker are present but not currently abundant.  They were caught only in shallow waters in 2011.  The only other known fish species in Little Trout Lake are several minnow species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Compared to other Lake Trout lakes in this area, Little Trout is relatively small, and relatively shallow.  It supports a simple native fish community, with its major species limited to Lake Trout and White Sucker.  Goals for the Lake Trout population in this lake (from the 2017 lake management plan) are to maintain a self-sustained population with a minimum gill net catch (deep and shallow sets combined) of 3.0 fish/set.  This was the first of two surveys scheduled in the 2017 plan to monitor the Lake Trout population, and to determine the age and size at maturity for the species in this lake.  The next is scheduled for 2026. <br> \n <br> \nThe combined Lake Trout catch in deep and shallow gill net sets in this survey (13.00 fish/set) easily met the long range goal for the species in the 2017 plan, and was the second highest ever seen in this lake.  Sizes of Lake Trout taken in 2018 were typical for this lake, where large fish have been very rare.  Twelve year classes, all naturally produced, and including fish as old as 15 years, contributed to the catch.  Year classes produced in 2012 and 2008 appeared to have been relatively strong.  Lake Trout growth had been slow; fish reached a mean length of 14.6 inches at the end of their sixth year, compared to an area mean of 17.5 inches.  With no cold-water forage species available, Lake Trout were largely limited to an invertebrate diet.   <br> \n <br> \nAge and length at maturity for Lake Trout could not be determined because only one immature fish was included in the catch, and no sex was determined for that fish.  Mature males as young as four years (length 15.7 inches) were collected, while the youngest mature females sampled were six years old (length 16.6 inches). <br> \n <br> \nThe White Sucker gill net catch (1.00 fish/set in deep and shallow sets combined) was one of the lowest seen in this lake.  No adult White Sucker were collected.  White Sucker catches as high as 34.00 fish/set had been seen in this lake in the past. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
