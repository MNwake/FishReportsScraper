Northern pike and walleye were sampled in average numbers, although abundance of both species may have declined in recent years.  Both the pike and walleye populations support fair numbers of quality-sized individuals with pike up to 30 inches and walleye up to 26 inches being present.  Bluegill and black crappie are present in good numbers and appear to be increasing in abundance as several large year-classes are recruiting to the adult population.  Average size is small, but should improve in the near future, providing good angling opportunity.  White bass were caught in abundance in 2001 but were not captured in 2006 suggest a decline of this species.  Largemouth bass are present but little information exists on this species as electrofishing surveys have not been conducted in recent years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 311 acre lake located in Rice County north of Faribault. The lake has a maximum depth of 47 feet. A DNR-maintained public access and fishing pier are located on the south end of the lake. The west shoreline of the lake is developed with residential houses. Fox Lake is classified in Lake Class 24 based on limnological variables and lake characteristics. Other lakes in this classification include German Lake (Le Sueur County), Reeds Lake (Waseca County), and Roberds Lake (Rice County). Fox Lake is managed primarily for Black Crappie, Walleye, and Northern Pike and secondarily for Bluegill. Fox Lake is stocked with Walleye fry every other year (even-numbered years) at a rate of 1,000 fish per littoral acre to maintain the population. Northern Pike fry are stocked in the direct watershed two of every three years. Future surveys will be conducted every six years. <br> \n <br> \nFox Lake is designated as infested due to the presence of Eurasian water-milfoil, which was first discovered in the lake in 2009. Eurasian water-milfoil limits recreational activities by forming dense mats on the water surface and disrupts aquatic ecosystems by competing with and displacing native plants. Eurasian water-milfoil is spread primarily by the introduction of plant fragments, which can easily be transported by boaters. Always be sure to clean all aquatic plant material and drain all water from boats, trailers, and equipment before leaving the lake access. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted the week of July 24th, 2017 by the MN DNR as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). This survey included deploying five gill nets and eleven trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 3.5/trap net, which was an increase from the 2011 survey (2.1/trap net).  Black Crappie were also sampled with gill nets at a rate of 16.8/gill net. The average length of Black Crappie sampled with trap nets and gill nets was 7.0 inches and ranged from 3.8 inches to 12.6 inches. Six year classes of Black Crappie were present during the survey (2006, 2011-2014, and 2016). Sixty-nine percent of aged Black Crappie were from the 2016 year class. The discrepancy between gill net and trap net catch rates makes it difficult to judge the status of the Fox Lake Black Crappie population, however given the excellent size structure, numerous year classes sampled, and presence of a large year class (2016) of young fish, the population appears healthy. Black Crappie management goals (15/gill net and 15% greater than 8 inches) were exceeded in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nFox Lake supports a good population of Walleye when compared to other class 24 lakes.  Walleye were sampled at a rate of 10.4/gill net in 2017, up from 8.6/gill net in 2011.  The size structure of the Walleye population was dominated by lengths preferred by anglers; average length was 15.1 inches and Walleye ranged from 9.9 inches to 18.5 inches. Walleye were aged using scales and otoliths and four year classes (2012-2014, 2016) were sampled. Walleye fry are stocked in even years meaning the 2013 year class likely was the result of natural reproduction. Walleye mean length at 1 year was 10.5 inches, 15.1 inches at 3 years, and 15.9 inches at 4 years. Walleye management goals (6/gill net) were exceeded in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nPast surveys have indicated low Northern Pike abundance in Fox Lake, despite stocking of fry every two-of-three years.  Northern Pike catch rates in 2017 were 0.8/gill net, which was less than the 2011 survey (8.4/gill net). Gill net catch rates in 2011 were the highest recorded in the last two decades at 8.4/gill net. The average length of Northern Pike sampled in gill nets and trap nets was 22.3 inches and lengths ranged from 15.7 inches to 26.4 inches. Only 2 (29%) Northern Pike sampled exceeded 24 inches. Northern Pike management goals (4/gill net) were not met in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled at a rate of 6.6/trap net, which less than the 2011 survey (12.9/trap net). The average length of Bluegills was 6.6 inches and lengths ranged from 3.2 inches to 9.3 inches. Only 3 year classes of Bluegill were sampled (2011, 2012, and 2015) indicating poor recruitment and potentially limiting spawning or nursery habitat within the lake. Bluegill management goals (30/trap net and 15% over 8 inches) were partially met in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nA daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on June 5th, 2017 to assess the Largemouth Bass population in Fox Lake. Largemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 6.9/hour. Largemouth Bass sampled averaged 12.1 inches total length and ranged from 6.5 inches to 15.6 inches. Future standard surveys (every 6 years) will be accompanied by a Largemouth Bass targeted electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Yellow Perch have been moderately abundant in Fox Lake with occasional large catches.  Yellow Perch catch rates in 2017 (5.2/gill net) decreased from 2011 (7.2/gill net).  Yellow perch sampled in 2017averaged 7.6 inches in length and ranged from 5.3 inches to 9.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead populations have declined substantially since surveys done in the early 1990s. Black Bullheads were captured at a rate of 184.0/gill net and 305.5/trap net in 1991.  Catch rates have steadily declined in each subsequent survey and Black Bullheads were captured at a rate of just 0.4/gill net and 0.1/ trap net in 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), Largemouth Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Hybrid Sunfish were observed during the 2017 assessment but occurred in low numbers. <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 311-acre lake located in Rice County north of Faribault. The lake has a maximum depth of 47 feet. A DNR-maintained public access and fishing pier are located on the south end of the lake. The west shoreline of the lake is developed with residential houses. Fox Lake is managed primarily for Black Crappie, Walleye, and Northern Pike and secondarily for Bluegill. Fox Lake is stocked with Walleye fry every other year (even-numbered years) at a rate of 1,000 fish per littoral acre to maintain the population. Northern Pike fry are stocked in the direct watershed two of every three years. Fox Lake has been designated as a Tier II lake in the Waterville area and future surveys will be conducted every six years. <br> \n <br> \nFox Lake is designated as an infested water due to the presence of Eurasian water-milfoil, which was first discovered in the lake in 2009. Eurasian water-milfoil limits recreational activities by forming dense mats on the water surface and disrupts aquatic ecosystems by competing with and displacing native plants. Eurasian water-milfoil is spread primarily by the introduction of plant fragments, which can easily be transported by boaters. Always be sure to clean all aquatic plant material and drain all water from boats, trailers, and equipment before leaving the lake access. <br> \n <br> \nFox Lake was surveyed the week of 24 July 2023 by the MN DNR as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program. This survey included deploying 5 gill nets and 12 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie relative abundance was 2.2/trap net. The 2023 trap net catch rate was less than the previous survey in 2017 (3.5/trap net) and less than the lake average since 1996 of 2.6/trap net. Black Crappie were also sampled with gill nets at a rate of 5.2/gill net which was less than the lake average since 1996 (8.9/gill net), and the previous survey in 2017 (16.8/gill net). The average length of Black Crappie sampled with trap nets was 5.8 inches and ranged from 4.1 inches to 10.2 inches. Black Crappie sampled in gill nets ranged from 4.3 inches to 10.3 inches with an average of 6.0 inches. Black Crappie were aged using scales and otoliths. Five year-classes of Black Crappie were present during the survey (2017, 2018, and 2020-2022). Eighty-one percent of aged Black Crappie were age-1 (2022 year class). Black Crappie management goals (15.0/gill net and 15% greater than 8 inches) were not met in 2023. <br> \n <br> \nFox Lake supports a good population of Walleye when compared to other class 24 lakes, with catch rates often exceeding the upper quartile for class 24 lakes.  Walleye were sampled at a rate of 11.6/gill net in 2023, up from 10.4/gill net in 2017. Size structure of the Walleye population was dominated by lengths preferred by anglers; average length was 19.2 inches and Walleye ranged from 10.0 inches to 22.5 inches. Walleye were aged using scales and otoliths and seven year-classes (2013-2016, 2018-2020) were sampled. Walleye fry are stocked in even years meaning the 2013, 2015, and 2019 year-classes likely were the result of natural reproduction. Walleye average length at age-1 was 8.5 inches, 15.1 inches at age-3, and 16.7 inches at age-4. Walleye management goals (6.0/gill net) were exceeded in 2023. <br> \n <br> \nPast surveys have indicated low Northern Pike abundance in this system, despite watershed stocking of fry every two-of-three years.  However, Northern Pike relative abundance in 2023 was 17.0/gill net, which was nearly triple the lake average since 1996 (6.1/gill net). Average length of Northern Pike sampled in gill nets was 22.7 inches and lengths ranged from 17.6 inches to 29.1 inches. Only 21% of Northern Pike sampled exceeded minimum length-limit of 24 inches. The Northern Pike management goal of 4.0/gill net was met in 2023. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 26.3/trap net which was greater than the 2017 survey (6.6/trap net). Average length of Bluegills was 5.8 inches and lengths ranged from 2.7 inches to 10.5 inches. Six year-classes of Bluegill were sampled (age-1 through age-6) indicating consistent recruitment. Sixty-two percent of Bluegills sampled were age-1. Bluegill management goals (30.0/trap net and 15% over 8 inches) were not met in 2023. <br> \n <br> \nA daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on 31 May 2023 to assess the Largemouth Bass population in Fox Lake. Largemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 14.5/hour. Largemouth Bass sampled averaged 11.3 inches total length and ranged from 3.3 inches to 17.6 inches. Future standard surveys (every 6 years) will be accompanied by a Largemouth Bass targeted electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Yellow Perch have been moderately abundant in Fox Lake.  Relative abundance in 2023 (35.4/gill net) was seven times greater than from 2017 (5.2/gill net) and was double the lake average since 1996 (17.5/gill net).  Yellow perch sampled in 2017 averaged 6.2 inches in length and ranged from 5.2 inches to 8.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead populations have declined substantially since surveys done in the early 1990s to the point where Black Bullhead are now rare in Fox Lake. Black Bullheads were captured at a rate of just 0.8/gill net and 0.1/ trap net in 2023.  <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), Largemouth Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead were observed during the 2023 assessment but occurred in low numbers.  River species are likely present due to connection with the Cannon River via Circle Lake and Wolf Creek. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor <br> \n</p>",

Black bullhead and yellow perch were the most abundant species in the gill net catches with over 30 fish of each species caught per gill net.  White bass (20 per net) and freshwater drum (14 per net) were also common in the gill net catches.  Trap net catches were comprised primarily of freshwater drum (23 per net) and black bullhead (18 per net).  Walleye abundance is good with the gill net catch of 8 per net.  Walleye up to 27.6 inches were captured.  Few bluegill or black crappie were captured in the survey nets.  However, the bluegill and black crappie present were generally large with the largest bluegill 9.3 inches and the largest black crappie 11.6 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a small (311.7 acres), eutrophic lake in Rice County located near the Town of Millersburg.  A population assessment was conducted on Fox Lake in July of 2011 to assess the status of the fish community.  Residential development around the perimeter of Fox Lake is present primarily on the west/southwest shore.  The remainder of the shoreline is in good condition as approximately 1.5 miles of the shoreline is undeveloped and contains a thin riparian buffer zone separating the lake and adjacent agricultural fields.  A DNR owned ramp located on the south shore provides access for the public.  The sport fish community consists of bluegills, black crappies, northern pike, and walleyes.  The walleye and northern pike populations are maintained through stocking.  The current management plan calls for walleye fry stocking to occur in even years beginning in 2010, and for northern pike fry stocking to occur in 2 out of 3 years beginning in 2007.  <br> \n <br> \nPast surveys have indicated low northern pike abundance in this system.  Gill net catch rates in 2011 were the highest recorded in the last two decades at 8.4/gill net, which is high for lakes similar to Fox Lake.  Although abundance was high, size of northern pike was small ranging from 13.8 to 27.2 inches in total length and averaging 19.2 inches.  Ninety-eight percent of northern pike sampled were less than 23.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nFox Lake supports a good population of walleyes when compared to other similar lakes.  Likely a result of fry stocking, walleyes were captured at a rate of 8.6/gill net in 2011, up from 3.6/gill net in 2006.  The size of the walleyes ranged from 8.1 to 19.1 inches in length and averaged 14.9 inches.  Sixty-seven percent of gill netted walleyes were between 15.0 and 19.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish abundance is relatively low when compared to similar lakes.  Bluegills were the most abundant panfish with a catch rate of 12.9/trap net, which is below average for similar lakes.  Black crappies were also present and had catch rates (2.1/trap net) that were below average for this lake class.  Size was small for bluegills and black crappies as 84% of bluegills were less than 6.0 inches in length and 82% of black crappies were less than 10.0 inches.  Consistent with past surveys, the 2011 survey indicated a low abundance, small panfish population. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, yellow perch have been moderately abundant in Fox Lake with catch rates being above average compared to similar lakes in most years.  Catch rates in 2011 (7.2/gill net) were consistent with 2006 catch rates (6.6/gill net), but were below average when compared to similar lakes.  Yellow perch sampled in 2011 averaged 7.3 inches in length and did not exceed 8.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead populations have declined substantially since surveys done in the early 1990s.  Catch rates in 1991 were extremely high, as black bullheads were captured at a rate of 184.0/gill net and 305.5/trap net.  Catch rates have steadily declined in each subsequent survey and were captured at a rate of 0.8/gill net and 0.1/trap net in 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth buffalo, bowfin, common carp, freshwater drum, golden shiner, largemouth bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and hybrid sunfish were observed but occurred in low numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Fox Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

Generally, these fish are taken while suspended during the summer using jigs and minnows.  Bluegills are few, and may be difficult to locate.  Most are 6-7 inches.Northern pike numbers are up slightly from previous years, with the average sized fish being 26 inches and about 4 pounds.  Like crappie these fish lack shoreline habitat and are often taken while suspended in the open water.  Walleye numbers are similar to previous years, with the average fish being 14.5 inches.  These fish seem to relate strongly to shoreline cover even during the summer, since most of the fish were sampled in trap nets.  Evening fishing may provide the best angling depending upon water clarity.  Black bullhead are abundant with the majority of fish between 8-10 inches.</p>",
