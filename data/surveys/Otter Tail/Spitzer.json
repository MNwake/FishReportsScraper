There are high abundances of bluegills, pumkinseeds, and black crappies; however, most are small.  Anglers report a good population of average-size largemouth bass.  Recent walleye stockings have had fair success.</p>",

Investigation in the spring revealed that a substantial winterkill had occurred.  <br> \n     Walleye numbers are down considerably from the 1982 survey. There is no evidence of natural reproduction of walleye.  It appears as though the population was severely affected by the winterkill.  The northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie populations were also severely affected by the winterkill as their numbers declined considerably. Yellow perch numbers have increased approximately three-fold since 1982 <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Spitzer Lake is a 728-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately five miles northwest of Urbank, MN.  Spitzer Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  There are several intermittent, unnavigable inlets and outlets connected to Spitzer Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwood forests.  The maximum depth is 33 feet; however, 87% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2018 lake survey was 13.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.1 to 13.1 feet.  Periodic plankton and algae blooms during the summer months can influence secchi disk readings on this lake.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline remains undeveloped.  A DNR concrete public water access is located off of County Road 38 along the south shoreline of the lake.  Stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the entire lakeshore.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     <br> \n     Spitzer Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.  The abundance of these species can be attributed to the diversity of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     A high-density Northern Pike population exists.  Pike size structure has historically been poor.  Pike ranged in length from 14.6 to 34.9 inches with an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.2 pounds. Northern Pike attain an average length of 23.5 inches at five years of age.     <br> \n     Data from an electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.1 to 18.9 inches with an average length and weight of 14.0 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 12.8 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     The Bluegill population is abundant and age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good; however, size structure is poor.  Only 15% of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.6 inches at six years of age.        <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    <br> \n     Spitzer Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Spitzer Lake is a 728-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately five miles northwest of Urbank, MN.  Spitzer Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  There are several intermittent, unnavigable inlets and outlets connected to Spitzer Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwood forests.  The maximum depth is 33 feet; however, 87% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2007 lake survey was 5.5 feet.  Secchi disk readings from past lake surveys have ranged from 5.1 to 9.0 feet.  Periodic plankton and algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Spitzer Lake remains undeveloped.  The 1997 lake resurvey reported that 47 houses and one resort were located on the shoreline of Spitzer Lake.  A DNR concrete public water access is located along the south shoreline of the lake.  Stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the entire lakeshore.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     <br> \n     Spitzer Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Fiske Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance has historically fluctuated.  The test-net catch rate in this survey indicate that pike abundance is presently at a moderate level.  Pike size structure has historically been poor.  In this survey, only 7% of the pike were at least 24.0 inches in length.  Pike ranged in length from 12.8 to 33.1 inches with an average length and weight of 20.1 inches and 1.9 pounds. Northern pike attain an average length of 21.5 inches at five years of age.      <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists in Spitzer Lake.  Age data suggest that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 4.0 to 19.1 inches with an average length and weight of 13.2 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 13.8 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate indicates that they are abundant.  Bluegill abundance has fluctuated immensely over the historical series of surveys.  Age data from this survey indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good; however, size structure is poor.  Only 2% of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.0 inches at six years of age.        <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Spitzer Lake is a 728-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately five miles northwest of Urbank, MN.  Spitzer Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  There are several intermittent, unnavigable inlets and outlets connected to Spitzer Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwood forests.  The maximum depth is 33 feet; however, 87% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.1 to 9.0 feet.     <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Spitzer Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR concrete public water access is located along the south shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the entire lakeshore.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.1 to 18.9 inches with an average length and weight of 14.0 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 12.8 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Spitzer Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
