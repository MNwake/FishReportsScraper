                "narrative": "<p>NOP WERE CAUGHT AT A RATE OF 7.1/GILLNET LIFT WHICH WAS WITHIN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 5.8-11.60.  THE MEAN WEIGHT FOR NOP IN 1991 WAS 1.68 POUNDS.  FOR 1988 AND 1983 SURVEYS, THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 1.97 AND 1.76 POUNDS, RESPECTIVELY. THE RANGE IN LENGTHS FOR 1991 NOP WERE FROM 10 TO 29 INCHES, WITH THE MODAL LENGTH GROUP BEING 21.0- 21.9 INCHES.  THE PSD AND RSD FOR NOP OVER OVER THE PAST THREE SURVEYS HAS NOT CHANGED:  1991-PSD (36), RSD (4.5); 1988-PSD (37.5), RSD (6); 1983- PSD (31), RSD (4).  THE GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR BOTH SEXES AT ALL AGES.  THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN LENGTHS OF THE SEXES (M=18.8, F-19.2 INCHES).  THERE SEEMS TO BE A GOOD VARIETY OF FORAGE SPECIES AVAILABLE.  THESE INCLUDE:  LKW (0.9/GILLNET LIFT), WTS (1.1/GILLNET LIFT) AND YEP (10.9/GILLNET LIFT).  THOUGH NO SAMPLED, THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF THE PRESENT IN TEN MILE LAKE.  WHEN INSPECTING THE NOP AND WAE, THERE WAS A GOOD SUPPLY OF VISCERAL FAT, INDICATING THAT THEY WERE FEEDING WELL.  WAE ABUNDANCE IN 1991 (9.1/GILLNET LIFT) REMAINED THE SAME AS IN 1988 (9.2/LIFT).  THE HISTORICAL RANGE (1958-91) IS 1.67-9.87.  FOR LAKES IN CLASS 22, 9.1/LIFT WOULD BE ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE (8.21/LIFT).  THE WAE RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 9.5 TO 29 INCHES, WITH A MODAL LENGTH GROUP OF 19.0- 19.9 INCHES.  THE MEAN LENGTH MALE WAE FOR 1991 WAS 14.8 INCHES, AS COMPARED TO FEMALE WAE OF 17.5 INCHES.  THE GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR BOTH SEXES AT ALL AGES, WITH FEMALES TYPICALLY GETTING A BETTER START THE FIRST YEAR, AS COMPARED TO MALES.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE CONTRIBUTION OF STOCKING WAE, SINCE THE LAKE HAS BEEN STOCKED ANNUALLY SINCE 1968.  HOWEVER, THERE WERE A COUPLE OF YEAR CLASSES THAT WERE WELL REPRESENTED WHEN SMALLER NUMBERS IF FINGERLINGS WERE STOCKED.  THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT WAE NATURAL REPRODUCTION MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE WAE POPULATION.  THE BLG ABUNDANCE OF 15.2/TRAPNET LIFT WAS WITHIN THE HISTORICAL RANGE, BUT WELL BELOW WHAT WAS CAUGHT IN 1988 (127.10/LIFT).  THE 15.2/LIFT WAS SIMILAR TO THE MEDIAN (16.66/LIFT) FOR LAKE CLASS 22.  THE BLG RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 3.5 TO 7 INCHES, WITH THE MODE BEING 6.5-6.9 INCHES.  GROWTH HAS BEEN TYPICALLY SLOW WHERE IT TAKES 7 YEARS TO GROW TO 6.5 INCHES.  THE PMK AND HSF MADE UP 81% OF THE SUNFISH OVER 7 INCHES.  THERE WERE 44 LMB CAPTURED COMBINING THE TESTNETTING AND ELECTROFISHING EFFORTS.  THESE FISH RANGED IN LENGTH FROM <3 INCHES TO 13 INCHES.  THESE FISH EXHIBITED GOOD GROWTH AT ALL AGES.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ten Mile Lake is a 4669-acre lake located near Hackensack, MN that has 21.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 208 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public access on the southwest shore off of County Road 12.  The DNR has classified Minnesotas lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Ten Mile Lake is in Lake Class 22. Lakes in this class are very large, very deep, clear, and irregularly shaped.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant in Ten Mile Lake and the catch rate has been historically high compared to other Lake Class 22 waters.  The mean length for northern pike was 21 inches and fish up to 30 inches were sampled.  Since 1997, a regulation has been in effect which requires all northern pike 20 inches or longer to be released and the percentage of northern pike greater than 20 inches has increased since this regulation went into effect.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has increased and exceeded the long-range management goal for Ten Mile Lake.  There was a variety of sizes of walleye available for anglers; sampled fish ranged from 11 to 28 inches.  About 28% of the walleye sampled were greater than 20 inches.  In 2007, the majority of the walleye catch will likely come from the 2001 and 2003 year-classes.  These year-classes correspond with fingerling stocking but natural reproduction contributes to the year-classes present in Ten Mile Lake.  Other fish species that are available to anglers to catch are black crappie, bluegill, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, largemouth bass, lake whitefish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.      <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Ten Mile Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesotas lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cant support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the waters edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ten Mile Lake is a 5,080-acre lake with 24.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 208 feet located north of Hackensack, MN. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned public access is located on the west shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Ten Mile Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are generally clear, large, deep lakes with a low percentage of shallow water area and have very irregularly shaped shorelines with many bays or points. Other area lakes in this class include Little Boy, Steamboat, and Wabedo. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass and Walleye and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Lake Whitefish, Tullibee (Cisco), and Yellow Perch. A standard survey was completed in 2021 to assess game fish populations and provide additional fish information to the MNDNR Long Term Monitoring Program. Ten Mile Lake is designated infested with Zebra Mussels; Chinese Mystery Snail and Purple Loosestrife are also present. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance declined from previous surveys and were within management goals. Northern Pike ranged in length from 10 to 29 inches with an average length of 18 inches long. Walleye abundance declined from the 2018 survey but was near the minimum management goal. Walleye ranged in length from 11 to 27 inches with an average length of 17 inches long. Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass also provide additional quality fishing opportunities to anglers. Largemouth Bass measuring up to 18 inches and Smallmouth Bass measuring 20 inches long were sampled. Additional sampling targeting these species is required to develop management goals. Yellow Perch populations remain low and were below management goals and generally consist of small fish. Lake Whitefish are present with fish up to 21 inches sampled. Black Crappie and Bluegill abundances were below management goals for both species. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently the aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Ten Mile Lake are Zebra Mussels, Chinese Mystery Snail and Purple Loosestrife. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

THOUGH NONE WERE COLLECTED DURING THIS ASSESSMENT, THERE ALSO IS A LARGE POPULATION OF  OF APPROXIMATELY 6 TO 7 INCHES. THE NORTHERN PIKE GILLNET CATCH OF 8.6/GN IS WITH- IN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 5.8 TO 11.6/GN FROM PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY OF SAMPLED NORTHERN PIKE IS EXCELLENT WITH FISH GREATER THAN 30 INCHES REPRESENTED. NATURAL REPROCDUCTION AND YEARLY RECRUITMENT APPEAR TO BE EXCELLENT. THE BLUEGILL TRAPNET CATCH OF 127.1 IS VERY HIGH. HISTORICALLY IT HAS RANGED FROM 19.5 TO 43.6 PER TRAPNET. ONLY 5 PERCENT OF THE BLUEGILLS MEASURED WERE GREATER THAN 7 INCHES IN LENGTH. THE GROWTH RATE OF BLUEGILL IS NOT FAST; SEVEN YEARS OF GROWTH IS NEEDED FOR A BLUEGILL TO ATTAIN A LENGTH OF 6.5 INCHES. THE NUMBER OF QUALITY SIZE BLUEGILL PRESENT IN TEN MILE APPEARS TO HAVE DECLINED SINCE THE 1971 ASSESSMENTS. THE TRAPNET CATCH OF PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH HAS ALSO INCREASED FROM HISTORICAL LEVELS. THE TRAPNET CATCH OF 13.5 FOR LARGEMOUTH BASS IS UNUSUALLY HIGH WHEN COMPARED TO TRAPNET CATCHES FOR MOST LAKES. HISTORICALLY, THE CATCH OF LARGE- MOUTH BASS HAS RANGED FROM 2.7 TO 7.3 PER TRAPNET. MOST OF THE LARGEMOUTH BASS CAPTURED RANGED FROM 6 TO 8 INCHES IN LENGTH WITH FISH UP TO 16 INCHES. PRESUMABLY DUE TO THE TYPES OF SAMPLING GEAR USED, ONLY 3 BLACK CRAPPIE WERE CAPTURED. THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 10.5 TO 11.5 INCHES. THE GILLNET CATCH OF 16.9 YELLOW PERCH IS WITHIN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 13.2 TO 25.5. YELLOW PERCH UP TO 11 INCHES WERE SAMPLED. THE 1988 GILLNET CATCH OF WALLEYE WAS 9.2. HIS- TORICALLY IT HAS RANGED FROM 1.6 TO 9.9. TEN MILE LAKE HAS BEEN STOCKED ANNUALLY SINCE 1971 WITH WALLEYE FINGERLINGS, SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASCER- TAIN WHAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE WALLEYE POPULATION. COMPARING YEAR CLASS STRENGTH IN THIS AND PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS WITH STOCKING RECORDS, THERE ARE SEVERAL APPARENTLY STRONG YEAR CLASSES THAT CORRESPOND WITH YEARS WHEN FEW WALLEYE FINGERLINGS WERE STOCKED. THIS SUGGESTS THAT WALLEYE NATURAL REPRODUCTION MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE WALLEYE POPULA- TION.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ten Mile Lake is a 4669-acre lake with a maximum depth of 208 feet.  It is located seven miles south of Walker.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Ten Mile Lake is in lake class 22.  Approximately 28% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  The primary public access is located on the southeast corner of the lake off of county road six.Ten Mile Lake is well known as a good walleye lake especially early in the season.  Walleye as big as 15 pounds have been caught in the lake.  Anglers also have good luck catching sunfish, largemouth bass, and black crappie especially in the bays. There is an abundant population of northern pike especially of the smaller size (18 - 22 inches).  There is an experimental regulation in effect where all northern pike 20 inches or larger must be immediately returned to the lake.  This will hopefully improve the quality of northern pike.  There is also excellent whitefish netting in the fall.Walleye abundance was above what was found in previous surveys as well as what is typically found in other lake class 22 lakes.  Fish ranged in length from 10 to 25 inches with an average length and weight of 16.3 inches and 1.6 pounds.  There has been much stocking of walleye in Ten Mile Lake.  In 1994, stocking didn't occur but this age was well represented in the sampled walleye in the 1997 survey.  This would be mean that natural reproduction is producing walleye in Ten Mile Lake.  There is other evidence that natural reproduction is contributing significantly to the walleye fishery.  There is also abundant spawning habitat in the lake for walleye to spawn.Northern pike abundance was typical of previous surveys and of other lake class 22 lakes.  Fish ranged in length from 12.7 inches to 29 inches with an average length and weight of 20 inches and 1.8 pounds.  The reason for the experimental regulation is that northern pike has been below average in size.  The objective of this regulation is to decrease the amount of time it takes for anglers to catch northern pike over 20 inches.  The end of the evaluation period for this regulation is 2008. The main food fish for predator fish is yellow perch, cisco, and whitefish.  All three fish are abundant in the lake.  Bluegill are abundant in Ten Mile Lake.  Fish sampled ranged in length from 3.6 to 8.1 inches with an average length and weight of 6.6 inches and 0.2 pounds.  There was many bluegill over six inches but an absence of fish over 8 inches.  The likely reason for this is that bluegill grow slowly in Ten Mile Lake and anglers are catching them before they can grow to a larger size.  At six years old, bluegill are only five inches long.Rock bass  is an abundant fish that is not intentionally angled for that can offer good action and quality size.  Sampled rock bass ranged in length from 3.6 to 10.0 with a mean length and weight of 7.7 inches and 0.38 pounds.  Few black crappie have been sampled.  Anglers, however,  have had good success in catching this species. Other fish sampled include: largemouth bass, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.Ten Mile Lake is one of the most desirable lakes in the area to live on.  There is concern that this demand and development may be impacting the aquatic habitat.  Since 1958, the number of lakehomes on the lakes has increased from 310 to 453.  Activities such as bulrush removal and adding sand to the shoreline has impacted habitats for several kinds of fish at different stages of their life cycles. To help maintain quality fish populations in Ten Mile Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife.  They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff water.  They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Ten Mile Lake is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Findings from the 1996 creel survey on Ten Mile Lake, where anglers were interviewed, found that only 29% of the walleye 20 inches or longer were released.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the quality of the fish population and provide anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ten Mile Lake is a 4669-acre lake with a maximum depth of 208 feet.  It is located two miles northwest of Hackensack.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Ten Mile Lake is in lake class 22.  Typically lakes in this class are moderately clear, deep waters over 1000 acres in size.  Approximately 28% of the lake is 15 feet or less deep. Ten Mile Lake is quite clear (clarity reading of 17 feet in August 2000), and it has good amounts of oxygen for fish even in deep water.  The public access is located on the southwest corner of the lake off of Cass County Road 6.       Ten Mile Lake is well known as a good walleye lake, especially early in the season and later in the fall.  Anglers also have good luck catching sunfish, largemouth bass, and black crappie, especially in the shallow bays.  There is an abundant population of northern pike especially smaller size (18-22 inches) fish.  There is an experimental regulation in effect which requires that all northern pike 20 inches or larger must be immediately returned to the water.  This regulation is intended to increase the average size of northern pike.  Ten Mile Lake also provides whitefish netting in the fall and some limited whitefish angling in the summer.       Walleye abundance in the 2000 sampling was at the level typically found in other lake class 22 lakes.  Sampled walleye ranged from 12 to 24 inches, with an average length of 17.2 inches and weight of 1.7 pounds.  Though Ten Mile Lake has been stocked with walleye fingerlings for many years, walleye do reproduce naturally in Ten Mile Lake as well.  DNR Fisheries is presently evaluating how much walleye stocking helps the Ten Mile Lake walleye population.        Bluegill are abundant in Ten Mile Lake, and this species comprised almost one-quarter of the fish kept on the lake during summer daytime fishing in 1996. Rock bass were abundant in the 2000 net sampling, and a 1996 angler survey found that rock bass accounted for about one-sixth of the fish kept on this lake.  Even though few black crappie were found by the netting survey in 2000, this species accounted for about one-eighth of the fish kept in the summer of 1996.        Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Ten Mile Lake and provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.     Most of the land around Ten Mile Lake is privately owned.  In 1958, a lake survey crew counted 310 lake homes around the shoreline, and by 1997 this number had increased to 453 homes.  With increasing use of lakeshore areas by people, it is essential that shoreline areas be protected from degradation.          Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.     Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.     Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ten Mile Lake is a 5080-acre lake located near Hackensack, MN that has 24.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 208 feet. There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public access on the southwest shore off of County Road 6. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Ten Mile Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are large, deep, clear, and irregularly shaped. Other lake class 22 lakes in the Walker Area include Steamboat, Woman, Little Boy, and Wabedo lakes. There is a lot mid-lake structure with steep drop offs in the lake. The purpose of this survey was to assess game fish populations and provide additional fish information to the MNDNR Long Term Monitoring Program. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike in the 2018 sample averaged 20 inches long with fish up to 31 inches sampled. Currently there is 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit which has been in effect since 2008.  Walleye are abundant in Ten Mile Lake compared to other Lake Class 22 waters. Large year classes from 2015 and 2013 should provide immediate and future fishing opportunities. Nearly half the walleyes sampled in 2018 were between 15 and 20 inches long with fish up to 27 inches long present. On the main part of the lake, Walleyes will often suspend over deep water while feeding on the abundant small Tullibee (Cisco) which only reach a maximum length of around 6 inches. Largemouth and Smallmouth bass also provide additional quality fishing opportunities to anglers. Fish approaching 19 inches long for both species have been sampled. Yellow Perch populations are low and the fish are small. Lake Whitefish are present with an average length of 18 inches, but they can be difficult to locate. Winter fishing can be difficult due to limited public access and highly variable ice conditions. Even during the coldest winters the ice can be inconsistent from area to area, with several ice ridges forming on the lake adding to the hazards of on ice travel and creating potentially dangerous conditions. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently the aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Ten Mile Lake are the Chinese Mystery Snail and Purple Loosestrife. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ten Mile is a 4,669-acre lake located in northern Cass County, about three miles northwest of the city ofHackensack.  Ten Mile has a maximum depth of 208 feet and 28 percent of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  TenMile has excellent water clarity and has good oxygen concentrations through much of the water column. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types,based upon physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Ten Mile is in Lake Class 22.  Other local lakes in thisclass include Little Boy, Wabedo and Woman (near Longville) and Steamboat (north of Walker).  Ten Mile has beensampled by the DNR in 1958, 1971, 1974, 1978, 1983, 1988, 1991 and 1994.The 1994 gill net catch rate of walleye in Ten Mile was 10.6 fish/net, which is higher than in any previoussampling. Walleye gill net catches have varied considerably in Ten Mile.  Catches in other years have ranged from1.6 to 9.9 walleye per net.  Average size of walleye has varied little during the past few years; most years theaverage weight was 1.9 to 2.1 lbs.  Ten Mile has an excellent walleye population in terms of numbers and averagesize of fish. Growth rate of walleye was similar to that found in other local Class 22 lakes.  The average lengthof walleye at age 5 was 17.7 inches.  As in most lakes, female walleye grew slightly faster than males in TenMile.  Average length of females at age 6 was 19.9 inches, compared to 18.7 inches for males. It has been difficult to assess the effects of walleye stocking on Ten Mile, since the lake has been stockedannually since 1968.  However, there were a couple of year classes that were well represented even when smallernumbers of fingerlings were stocked.  It seems likely that natural reproduction is contributing to the walleyepopulation.  No walleye were stocked in 1994, and the lake management plan for Ten Mile has set up a schedule forinterspersing years of stocking and no stocking so that walleye natural reproduction can be assessed.The gill net catch rate of northern pike in 1994 was 7.1 fish/net, which is within the historical range of catchrates for Ten Mile and within the middle to upper range for lakes of this type.  Northern pike are abundant inTen Mile. The average weight of northern pike was 1.7 lbs, which is similar to averages found in 1971, 1983, and1991.  Most northern pike in Ten Mile are small, but larger individuals are available for the persistent angler. Similar to most other years of sampling, the 19-inch category was the most common length group sampled in 1994. Northern pike growth was slower than the average growth rate found in other local lakes of this type.  An averagenorthern pike was 22.3 inches when it reached age 5.The gill net catch rate of yellow perch in 1994 was 7.3 fish/net.  This is the second-lowest catch rate that hasbeen found on Ten Mile, and is lower than most lakes of this type.  Yellow perch catch rates have declined eachsampled year since 1983, but the reason for this decline is not known.  Yellow perch ranged from 5.0 to 10.9inches, and about one-third of these fish were 8 inches or longer. The trap net catch rate of bluegill in 1994 was 15.3 fish/net, which is within the middle range and close to thecatch rates in 1958 and 1991.  The highest bluegill catch rate (127.1 fish/net) occurred in 1988.  The averageweight of bluegill in 1994 (0.19 lbs) was similar to average weights in most previous years sampled.  Ten Milecould provide some bluegills in sizes that would be acceptable to most sunfish anglers; about 64 percent of thesampled bluegill were 6 inches or longer, while about one-fourth were 7 inches or more.   Bluegill growth was slowcompared to average growth in other local Class 22 lakes.  An average bluegill in Ten Mile was 4.7 inches whenit became 5 years old, while the local Lake Class average was about 2 inches greater. In 1994, the trap net catch of pumpkinseed (1.8 fish/net) was lower than in previous surveys and most lakes ofthis type.  There are pumpkinseed in Ten Mile that would be large enough to interest most sunfish anglers.  Aboutone-third of measured pumpkinseed were 6 inches or longer, while about 5 percent were in the 7-inch range.Ten Mile has a good population of largemouth bass.  Most years the net catches of largemouth in Ten Mile exceededthe middle range for this lake type.  About one-third of the measured largemouth bass were 12 inches or more, andabout 9 percent were 14 inches or more.  An average largemouth bass in Ten Mile was 11.9 inches at 5 years old. This growth rate appears to be a bit slower than the local average for this lake class.Rock bass were commonly caught in the DNR's test nets in 1994.  The average weight of sampled rock bass was 0.33lbs, and these fish ranged up to 10 inches in length.  Only three black crappie were collected during the 1994netting. Just two lake whitefish (0.2 fish per gill net) were caught in the 1994 survey.  Catches of this species havevaried widely in Ten Mile from one survey to the next.  Other species sampled during the survey included bowfin,white sucker and yellow bullhead. To maintain and promote a healthy fish population on Ten Mile, lake shore residents and other users of the lakeshould protect fish habitat by preserving natural lake bottoms and aquatic vegetation.  Lake shore residents canalso help preserve Ten Mile's water quality by such actions as having a properly built and maintained septicsystem; by avoiding the use of lawn or garden chemicals near the lake; and by establishing a buffer strip ofnatural vegetation along their shoreline.  Anglers can help maintain fishing quality by practicing catch andrelease of larger fish. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ten Mile Lake is a 4669-acre lake located near Hackensack, MN that has 21.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 208 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public access on the southwest shore off of County Road 12.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Ten Mile Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are very large, very deep, clear, and irregularly shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike and walleye and secondarily for bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, lake whitefish, tullibee (cisco), and yellow perch.    Northern pike are abundant in Ten Mile Lake and the catch rate has been historically high for Ten Mile Lake compared to other Lake Class 22 lakes.  The mean length for northern pike was 22 inches and fish up to 31 inches were sampled.  Since 1997, a regulation has been in effect which requires all northern pike 20 inches or longer to be released and the percentage of northern pike greater than 20 inches has increased since this regulation went into effect.  Walleye abundance has increased and exceeded the long-range management goal for Ten Mile Lake.  The mean length for walleye was 18 inches and fish up to 29 inches were sampled.  The size structure of the walleye consist of larger fish with 44% of the walleye sampled were greater than 20 inches.   In 2004, majority of the walleye catch will come from the 1997, 1998, and 2001 year-classes and these year-classes correspond with fingerling stocking but natural reproduction contributes to the year-classes present in Ten Mile Lake.  Other fish species that are available to anglers to catch are black crappie, bluegill, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, largemouth bass, lake whitefish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Ten Mile Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ten Mile Lake is a 4669-acre lake located near Hackensack, MN that has 21.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 208 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public access on the southwest shore off of County Road 12.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Ten Mile Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are very large, very deep, clear, and irregularly shaped.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant in Ten Mile Lake and the catch rate has been historically high compared to other Lake Class 22 waters.  The mean length for northern pike was 22 inches and fish up to 36 inches were sampled.  Since 1997, a special regulation has been in effect for northern pike and in 2008, it was converted to a 24- to 36-inch protected slot and the size distribution has slowly been shifting to larger fish.  Walleye gill net catch rates were similar to those found in other lakes in this class.  Sizes ranged from 8 to 29 inches suggesting a variety of sizes of walleye available for anglers.  About 26% of the walleye sampled were greater than 20 inches.  According to the creel survey reports for Ten Mile Lake, walleye is the most sought after species; however, largemouth bass and smallmouth bass are becoming increasing popular for Ten Mile Lake anglers.  Other fish species that are available to anglers are black crappie, bluegill, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, lake whitefish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.      <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Ten Mile Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nTen Mile Lake is not currently known to be infested with any aquatic invasive species (AIS).  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat away from the landing prior to launching and again before leaving the access.  If you suspect you may have discovered a new infestation of an invasive species, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on AIS prevention and awareness, including the problems they cause, can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us).   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ten Mile Lake is a 5080-acre lake located near Hackensack, MN that has 24.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 208 feet. There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public access on the southwest shore off of County Road 12. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Ten Mile Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are very large, very deep, clear, and irregularly shaped. \n\nNorthern Pike are abundant in Ten Mile Lake and catch rates have been historically high compared to other Lake Class 22 waters. The mean length for Northern Pike was 20 inches and fish up to 32 inches were sampled. A 20-inch maximum length limit on Northern Pike was implemented to improve the size structure of the population.  The regulation was determined to be ineffective and was converted to a 24- to 36-inch protected slot limit in 2008.  This survey is the first completed since the regulation was modified, and more surveys are needed to evaluate its effect on the population. Good numbers of large Northern Pike are present and a large 2011 year class should become available to anglers soon. Walleye gill net catch rates were similar to those found in other lakes in this class, and lengths ranged from 10 to 30 inches, with 20% of the Walleye sampled exceeding 20 inches long.  Large year classes in 2009 and 2011 should provide immediate and future fishing opportunities. Largemouth and Smallmouth bass also provide additional quality fishing opportunities to anglers. Fish approaching 19 inches long for both species have been sampled. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Lake Whitefish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. \n\nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently the aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Ten Mile Lake are the Chinese Mystery Snail and Purple Loosestrife. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Ten Mile Lake was conducted on August 15-17, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at twenty-four sampling stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample sixteen stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured twenty-four species of fish including eleven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Longnose Dace, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Ten Mile Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results contribute to long-term monitoring for Minnesota Sentinel Lakes and will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
