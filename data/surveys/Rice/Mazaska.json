A fishery survey was conducted on Mazaska Lake in July 2002 to monitor the fish community and lake characteristics.  Black crappie have recently increased in abundance, while perch abundance has declined from previous high levels in the early 1990s.  Most black crappie were between 4 and 8 inches, although the largest were around 10.5 inches long.  Walleye catch per gill net has slightly increased over the last three surveys (1993, 1997, 2002).  In 2002, most walleye were between 14 and 25 inches long.  Bluegill were the most common fish in trap net catches.  Bluegill were up to 8.5 inches, although the mean length was 5 inches.  Northern pike are present in moderate numbers; most were around 15 to 30 inches long.  Other species present in Mazaska Lake include bowfin, common carp, freshwater drum, golden shiner, largemouth bass, longnose gar, pumpkinseed sunfish, white bass, white crappie, and yellow bullhead.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mazaska is a 672-acre lake located northeast of Shieldsville in Rice County. There is a county-owned access located off Lake Mazaska Trail on the southwest shore and a state-owned access located off Highway 21 on the southeast shore. Lake Mazaska has a maximum depth of 50 feet, with approximately 50% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. Lake Mazaska is primarily managed for Bluegill and Black Crappie and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. The lake was designated as infested in 2010 after the discovery of Eurasian Water Milfoil and annual efforts have been made to keep Eurasian Water Milfoil and Curly-leaf Pondweed below nuisance levels. <br> \n <br> \nLake Mazaska was surveyed the week of July 22, 2019 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nA total of 52 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 4.7/net, which was low when compared to similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 3.2 to 9.7 inches with an average of 5.7 inches. Larger fish were sampled at a higher rate by gill nets with a total of 33 fish averaging 8.1 inches sampled for a catch rate of 3.7/net. Approximately 75% of fish sampled with gill nets exceeded a length of 8.0 inches. Fish from both gears ranged from age-1 to age-6. Approximately 40% of the sample consisted of young age-1 and age-2 fish. On average, fish reached a length of six inches during their third growing season, indicating fast growth relative to other area lakes. According to a 2016 creel survey, Bluegills were one of the most commonly harvested fish from Lake Mazaska with an estimated 3,355 fish averaging 8.2 inches harvested during a 10 month period from January to October. Based on the creel and survey data, the Bluegill population in Lake Mazaska was described as healthy and desirable to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were the most commonly sampled game fish species in the gill nets with a total of 99 sampled for a catch rate of 11.0/net. Lengths ranged from 4.1 to 13.8 inches with an average length of 7.4 inches. Fish from both gears were between 1 and 10 years old. Nine year-classes were present, suggesting consistent recruitment. On average, fish reached 8 inches by age-4 and 10 inches by age-5, indicating moderate to fast growth relative to other area lakes. According to a creel survey completed in 2016, Black and White Crappies were collectively the most commonly harvested species with an estimated 6,086 fish averaging 10.3 inches harvested during a 10 month period from January to October. Based on creel and survey data, Black Crappies were the single most important species to the fishery of Lake Mazaska in 2016 and were highly desirable to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nBecause Largemouth Bass are not sampled effectively with standard survey nets, a spring boat electrofishing sample targeting Largemouth Bass was completed in 2019. A total of 46 Largemouth Bass were sampled. Lengths ranged from 3.4 to 19.3 inches with an average of 11.8 inches. The 2016 creel report offered some insight on the Largemouth Bass population in Lake Mazaska. An estimated 982 fish were caught during a 10 month period from January to October. Estimated lengths of released fish (n=141) ranged from less than 5.0 inches to 20.0 inches with an average of 12.4 inches.  <br> \nA total of 40 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.4/net, which was slightly above the lake-class median (3.75).   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers have surged in the last 12 years, with an average of 6.7/net, after averaging just 1.8/net from 1984 to 2002. Lengths ranged from 17.4 to 28.9 inches with an average of 20.8 inches. Fish from both gill nets and trap nets ranged from age-1 to age-5 with 5 year-classes present. On average, fish reached quality length (21.0 inches) by age-3, indicating fast growth relative to other area lakes. The 2016 creel estimated that a total of 1,260 Northern Pike averaging 21.0 inches were harvested during the study period, behind only Bluegill and Crappies in numbers harvested.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Mazaska is located in the Southern Northern Pike Regulation Zone.  In this zone a Northern Pike must be over 24 inches in length in order to be harvested.  The daily bag limit for this zone is 2 fish. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 16 Walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 1.8/net, which was low when compared to similar lakes. This was the lowest catch rate seen since 1997.  Lengths ranged from 13.4 to 21.6 inches with an average length of 18.4 inches.  Fish ranged from 4 to 7 years of age, with 4 year-classes present. Approximately 63% of the sample came from the 2015 (age-4) year class. On average, Walleyes grew at a moderate rate, reaching 15 inches by age-4. Results from the 2016 creel survey estimated that just 173 Walleyes were harvested during the 10 month study period. The majority of Walleyes caught were small (less than 9.0 inches) and subsequently released.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 15 White Bass were sampled during the 2019 survey. Lengths ranged from 8.7 to 18.3 inches with an average length of 16.3 inches. Fish ranged from 1 to 11 years of age, with 7 year-classes present. Eighty five percent of White Bass were age-6 or older suggesting few anglers target and harvest them despite trophy length (18.0 inches) fish being present in the population. The 2016 creel supported this assumption with only an estimated 256 White Bass caught during the study period of which approximately 80% were released. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 14 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 1.6/net, which was low when compared to similar lakes in the area. Since 2002, Yellow Perch have been sampled in low numbers (1.9/gill net) in Lake Mazaska. Prior to 2002, catch rates averaged 19.2/net. Lengths in 2019 ranged from 5.5 to 6.8 inches with an average of 6.2 inches. Size structure was poor with no fish of quality length (8.0 inches) sampled. The 2016 creel survey showed that anglers caught and harvested fish up to 11.5 inches which suggested gill nets may not have accurately reflected the size structure of the population. Yellow Perch are an important prey species in Lake Mazaska and low abundance could impact predator species abundance and growth. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum (sheepshead) were the most common fish sampled in Lake Mazaska in 2019. A total of 124 fish averaging 16.1 inches were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 11.3/net. By weight, Freshwater Drum accounted for approximately 66% of the trap net catch. Freshwater Drum were also the most commonly caught species in gill nets with a catch rate of 18.4/net. Eighty-seven percent of Freshwater Drum in the gill net sample exceeded 15.0 inches. Although undesirable to most anglers, Freshwater Drum are easily caught and provide a good fight and respectable table fare for the open-minded angler. <br> \n <br> \nBullheads have historically been rare in Lake Mazaska. In 2019, the most common species was Yellow Bullhead. A total of 32 were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 3.6/net, which was slightly above average when compared to similar lakes. Given the stability of the lake, Bullhead species will likely remain a small part of the fish community in Lake Mazaska. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2019 include Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Longnose Gar, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements included secchi depth, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. At the time of this survey, secchi depth was 3.2 feet, indicating low to moderate water clarity. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen readings throughout the water column ranged from 76.6 degrees Fahrenheit and 7.0 ppm at the surface to 62.1 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.0 ppm at 30 feet. A thermocline was detected at a depth of approximately 18 feet. <br> \n <br> \nLake Mazaska has an infested waters designation as Eurasian Watermilfoil has become established. It is important for all who use this waterbody to remember Clean In and Clean Out. CLEAN all visible aquatic plants, zebra mussels, and other prohibited invasive species from watercraft, trailers, and water-related equipment before leaving and entering any water access or shoreland. DRAIN water-related equipment (boat, ballast tanks, portable bait containers, and motor) and drain bilge, livewell and baitwell by removing drain plugs before leaving a water access or shoreline property. Keep drain plugs out and water-draining devices open while transporting watercraft. DISPOSE of unwanted bait, including minnows, leeches, and worms, in the trash. It is illegal to release bait into a waterbody or release aquatic animals from one waterbody to another. If you want to keep your bait, you must refill the bait container with bottled or tap water. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, natural resources specialist <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mazaska is a 672-acre lake located northeast of Shieldsville in Rice County. There is a county-owned access located off Lake Mazaska Trail on the southwest shore and a state-owned access located off Highway 21 on the southeast shore. Lake Mazaska has a maximum depth of 50 feet. Lake Mazaska is primarily managed for Bluegill and Black Crappie and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. The lake was designated as infested in 2010 after the discovery of Eurasian Water Milfoil and annual efforts have been made to keep it and Curly-leaf Pondweed below nuisance levels.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Mazaska was surveyed on 4 June 2019 as part of a targeted electrofishing survey focused on Bluegill. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Results from this targeted survey should not be compared to results from standard surveys. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing sampled 75 Bluegill. Average length of Bluegill was 7.8 inches and lengths ranged from 3.7 inches to 10.2 inches. The mean length of the 10 largest Bluegill sampled was 9.6 inches. Fifty-five percent of Bluegills sampled were greater than 8 inches, 15% were greater than 9 inches, and Bluegills greater than 10 inches were present. <br> \n <br> \nEight age-groups were present representing Bluegills 2 through 9 years of age. Age-5 Bluegills were the most prominent and made up 33% of the sample. Bluegill mortality appears low and reproduction is consistent with only one weak year-class (2012) among the last 8 years. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills grow fast in Lake Mazaska. Growth is much more rapid than the lake-class average. For example, the average back-calculated length of age-4 Bluegill in Lake Mazaska was 7.3 inches compared to the lake-class average of 4.6 inches. Bluegill growth slows after age-7 which may signify fish are putting energy into reproduction rather than body growth. <br> \n <br> \nLake Mazaska was selected for a targeted spring trap net survey because it is being considered for special regulations via the Quality Bluegill Initiative. Potential regulations could include a 5 or 10 Bluegill creel limit. To comment on potential regulations contact the Waterville Area Fisheries office by either phone or email. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder assistant area supervisor <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mazaska is a 672-acre lake located northeast of Shieldsville in Rice County. There is a county-owned access located off Lake Mazaska Trail on the southwest shore and a state-owned access located off Highway 21 on the southeast shore. Lake Mazaska has a maximum depth of 50 feet, with approximately 50% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. Lake Mazaska is primarily managed for Bluegill and Black Crappie and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. The management plan calls for an annual stocking of 15,000 Northern Pike fry in the connected wetland on the north side of the lake and 336 pounds of Walleye fingerlings stocked in even years. The lake was designated as infested in 2010 after the discovery of Eurasian Water Milfoil and annual efforts have been made to keep Eurasian Water Milfoil and Curly-leaf Pondweed below nuisance levels.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Mazaska was surveyed the week of July 25, 2022, as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 9 gill nets and 12 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. Daytime electrofishing was conducted to get a better understanding of the Largemouth bass population and size structure. The next standard survey for Lake Mazaska is scheduled for 2025. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 501 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 41.8/net. Lengths ranged from 2.8 to 7.2 inches with an average of 4.3 inches. Larger fish were sampled at a higher rate by gill nets with a total of 37 fish sampled for a catch rate of 3.7/net. Bluegills in gill nets ranged from 4.3 to 9.7 inches averaging 7.1 inches. Fish from both gears ranged from age-1 to age-8 with 6 year-classes present. Approximately 41% of the sample consisted of young age-1 and age-2 fish. On average, fish reached quality length (6.0 inches) during their fourth growing season, indicating moderate to fast growth relative to other area lakes. According to the 2022 creel survey, Bluegills were the most harvested fish from Lake Mazaska with an estimated 3,036 fish averaging 8.7 inches harvested during a 10-month period from December 2021 through September 2022. Based on the creel and survey data, the Bluegill population in Lake Mazaska was described as healthy and desirable to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were the second most sampled fish species in the gill nets with a total of 78 sampled for a catch rate of 8.7/net. Lengths ranged from 5.4 to 13.1 inches with an average of 8.8 inches. Fish from both gears were age-1 to age-10 with 9 year-classes present, suggesting consistent recruitment. Growth was moderate to fast growth relative to other area lakes. According to a creel survey completed in 2022, Black and White Crappies were collectively the second most harvested species with an estimated 1,050 fish averaging 11.1 inches harvested during a 10-month period from December 2021 through September 2022.  <br> \n <br> \nBecause Largemouth Bass are not sampled effectively with standard survey nets, a spring boat electrofishing sample targeting Largemouth Bass was completed in 2022. A total of 46 Largemouth Bass were sampled. Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 16.7 inches with an average of 12.7 inches. The 2022 creel report offered some insight on the Largemouth Bass population in Lake Mazaska. An estimated 1,281 fish were caught during a 10-month period from December 2021 through September 2022. Estimated lengths of released fish (n=62) ranged from 6.0 to 19.0 inches with an average of 15.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 29 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 3.2/net, which was slightly below the lake-class average (3.75).  Lengths ranged from 19.1 to 29.5 inches with an average of 23.1 inches. Fish from both gill nets and trap nets ranged from age-2 to age-6 with 5 year-classes present. On average, fish reached quality length (21.0 inches) by age-3, indicating fast growth relative to other area lakes. The 2022 creel estimated only 58 Northern Pike averaging 25.5 inches were harvested during the study period. The new 2 fish daily creel limit and 24-inch minimum size limit likely limited harvest as the average length of Northern Pike harvested during the 2016 creel survey was just over 21 inches. The Northern Pike stocked into Lake Mazaska have been genetically marked. Tissue samples are taken from individual fish and sent to a lab. Here the DNA can be mapped.  The possible parent combinations are known, meaning offspring can be traced back to individual parents.  Once individual parents are traced, it is known exactly what year class the offspring came from. This information is then used to evaluate our stocking methods as well as ageing techniques. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 24 Walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 2.7/net, which was near the lake-class average (2.8). Lengths ranged from 16.0 to 26.6 inches with an average of 20.8 inches. Fish ranged from age-3 to age-17 with 10 year-classes present. Approximately 42% of the sample came from the 2014 and 2015 (age-7 and age-8) year class. On average, Walleye grew at a moderate rate, reaching 15 inches by age-3. Results from the 2022 creel survey estimated only 122 Walleyes were harvested during the 10-month study period from December 2021 through September 2022. Anglers kept 68% of all Walleye caught during the 2022 creel study. <br> \n <br> \nLake Mazaska has a unique opportunity for large White Bass that is not common in the Waterville Management area. Nine White Bass were sampled during the 2022 survey. Lengths ranged from 15.8 to 18.6 inches with an average of 17.4 inches. Fish ranged from age-10 to age-17 with 4 year-classes present. Because all White Bass were age-10 or older, this suggests few anglers target and harvest them despite trophy length (18.0 inches) fish being present in the population. The 2022 creel supported this assumption with only an estimated 363 White Bass caught during the study period of which approximately 80% were released. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 29 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 3.2/net. Lengths in 2022 ranged from 5.8 to 8.8 inches with an average of 6.4 inches. The 2022 creel survey showed that anglers caught Yellow Perch up to 9.0 inches, but no harvest of Yellow Perch was reported. Yellow Perch are an important prey species in Lake Mazaska and low abundance could impact predator species abundance and growth. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum were the third most common fish sampled in gill nets in Lake Mazaska in 2022. A total of 49 fish averaging 16.0 inches were sampled for a catch rate of 11.3/net. Eighty-four percent of Freshwater Drum in the gill net sample exceeded 15.0 inches. By weight, Freshwater Drum accounted for approximately 60% of the trap net catch.  Although undesirable to most anglers, Freshwater Drum are easily caught and provide a good fight and respectable table fare for the open-minded angler. <br> \n <br> \nBullheads have historically been rare in Lake Mazaska. In 2022, the most common species was the Yellow Bullhead. A total of 82 were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 9.1/net. This was the highest rate that Yellow Bullheads have been sampled in Lake Mazaska. Given the stability of the lake, bullhead species will likely remain a small part of the fish community in Lake Mazaska. <br> \n <br> \nFour common carp were sampled in gill nets. These fish averaged 17.2 inches in length. Only twice since 1984 (1984 and 1986) has the catch exceeded 1.5/net. Although destructive, Common Carp remained rare in Lake Mazaska and did not appear to negatively impact the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2022 include Bowfin (dogfish), Longnose Gar, Pumpkinseed, White Crappie and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements included secchi depth, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. At the time of this survey, secchi depth was 3.8 feet, indicating low to moderate water clarity. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen readings throughout the water column ranged from 77.2 degrees Fahrenheit and 7.9 ppm at the surface to 62.2 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.0 ppm at 40 feet. A thermocline was detected at a depth of approximately 22 feet. <br> \n <br> \nLake Mazaska has an infested waters designation as Eurasian Watermilfoil has become established. It is important for all who use this waterbody to remember Clean In and Clean Out. CLEAN all visible aquatic plants, zebra mussels, and other prohibited invasive species from watercraft, trailers, and water-related equipment before leaving and entering any water access or shoreland. DRAIN water-related equipment (boat, ballast tanks, portable bait containers, and motor) and drain bilge, livewell and baitwell by removing drain plugs before leaving a water access or shoreline property. Keep drain plugs out and water-draining devices open while transporting watercraft. DISPOSE of unwanted bait, including minnows, leeches, and worms, in the trash. It is illegal to release bait into a waterbody or release aquatic animals from one waterbody to another. If you want to keep your bait, you must refill the bait container with bottled or tap water. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Waterlilies were surveyed along much of the shoreline. The following taxa were noted during the survey: arrowhead (Sagittaria spp.), bulrush (round-stem group) (Schoenoplectus spp.), cattail (Typha spp.), large-leaved pondweed (Potamogeton amplifolius), white waterlily (Nymphaea odorata), wild celery (Vallisneria americana), and yellow waterlily (Nuphar variegata).

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Fourteen 100-foot long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place the week of 28 June 2021 with all 14 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50 foot seine was used at 9 stations and the 15 foot seine was used at an additional 5 stations.  Twenty-one native species were sampled including one species intolerant of habitat disturbance: Iowa Darter.  This nearshore survey was used along with the gill net survey conducted in 2020 and trap net survey conducted in 2021 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. Mazaska Lake was evaluated using Tool 2 Shallow and scored 38 which was below the threshold for impairment of 45. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mazaska is a 672-acre lake located northeast of Shieldsville in Rice County. There is a county-owned access located off Lake Mazaska Trail on the southwest shore and a state-owned access located off Highway 21 on the southeast shore. Lake Mazaska has a maximum depth of 50 feet. Lake Mazaska is primarily managed for Bluegill and Black Crappie and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. The lake was designated as infested in 2010 after the discovery of Eurasian Water Milfoil and annual efforts have been made to keep it and Curly-leaf Pondweed below nuisance levels.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Mazaska was surveyed the week of 18 May 2021 as part of a targeted survey focused on Bluegill. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Results from this targeted survey should not be compared to results from standard surveys. <br> \n <br> \nTrap netting sampled 222 Bluegill. Average length of Bluegill was 5.1 inches and lengths ranged from 1.9 inches to 9.7 inches. The average length of the 10 largest Bluegill sampled was 7.8 inches. Only 1.4 percent of Bluegills sampled were greater than 8 inches and less than 1 percent were greater than 9 inches. <br> \nSeven age-groups were present representing Bluegills 1 through 7 years of age. Age-1 and age-3 Bluegills were the most prominent and made up 64% of the sample. <br> \n  <br> \nBluegills grow fast in Lake Mazaska. Growth is much more rapid than the lake-class average. For example, the average back-calculated length of age-4 Bluegill in Lake Mazaska was 7.0 inches compared to the lake-class average of 4.6 inches. Standard surveys have shown Bluegill growth slows after age-7 which may signify fish are putting energy into reproduction rather than body growth. <br> \n <br> \nLake Mazaska was selected for a targeted spring trap net survey because a special regulation via the Quality Bluegill Initiative was started on 1 March 2022. The regulation will be evaluated with standard summer trap netting which may be supplemented with spring trap netting. Previous spring targeted survey include spring electrofishing conducted in June of 2019. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder assistant area supervisor <br> \n</p>",

IN 85 THE CATCH RATE WAS ONLY 4.00 FISH PER LIFT; HOWEVER, SINCE THE CURRENT POPULATION IS DOMINATED BY IV-VII YEAR OLDS IT IS LIKELY THE CHANGE IN CATCH RATES REFLECTS NETTING EFFICIENCY DIFFERENCES RATHER THAN POPULATION CHANGES. MOST FISH ARE BETWEEN 7.5 AND 8.5 INCHES; QUITE ACCEPTABLE TO ANGLERS. GROWTH IS GOOD. THE BLACK CRAPPIE CATCH DECLINED FROM 18.25 FISH PER TRAPNET SET IN 85 TO 10.50 FISH PER SET IN 86, BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 15.00 FISH PER SET. GILLNET CATCHES WERE DOWN FROM 43.50 FISH PER SET IN 85 TO 8.25 FISH PER SET IN 86. SIZE CLASS DISTRIBUTION IS FAIRLY FROM 43.50 FISH PER SET IN 85 TO 8.25 FISH PER SET IN 86. SIZE CLASS DISTRIBUTION IS FAIRLY EVEN WITH 61% OF THE POPU- LATION OVER 5 INCHES. I AND II YEAR OLDS ARE THE DOMINATE AGE CLASSES PRESENT. GROWTH IS GOOD. WHITE CRAPPIE NUMBERS INCREASED FROM 6.75 FISH PER GILLNET SET IN 85 TO 27.75 FISH PER SET IN 86, WELL ABOVE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS. SIZE CLASS DISTRIBUTION FAVORS SMALLER FISH WITH ONLY 32% OF THE POPUALTION OVER 6 INCHES. I AND II YEAR OLDS ARE THE DOMINATE AGE CLASSES PRESENT. GROWTH IS GOOD. THE YELLOW PERCH POPULATION IS QUITE HIGH AT 28.25 FISH PER GILLNET SET, WELL ABOVE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS. IN 85 PERCH AVERAGED JUST 9.50 FISH PER SET. SIZE CLASS DISTRIBUTION IS FAIRLY EVEN WITH I AND II YEAR OLDS THE DOMINATE AGE CLASSES PRESENT. GROWTH IS GOOD. THE WALLEYE POPULATION REMAINS AT A LOW LEVEL, 1.75 FISH PER GILLNET SET. IN 85 THE CATCH WAS ONLY 0.25 FISH PER SET. MOST OF THE WALLEYES SAMPLED WERE II YEAR OLDS BETWEEN 12 AND 14 INCHES. GROWTH IS GOOD NORTHERN PIKE NUMBERS REMAIN AT A LOW LEVEL WITH ONLY 1 FISH SAMPLED DURING THIS ASSESSMENT. OTHER SPECIES PRESENT IN RELATIVELY LOW NUMBERS INCLUDE LONGNOSE GAR, BOWFIN, BIGMOUTH BUFFALO, WHITE SUCKER, BLACK BULLHEAD, YELLOW BULLHEAD, WHITE BASS, AND PUMPKINSEED.

THE IMPROVED CATCH OF NORTHERNS IS PROBABLY ATTRIBUTED TO STOCKING OF NORTHERNS IN '86. THE WALLEYE CATCH CONTINUES TO REMAIN LOW AVERAGING 0.67/GILLNET COMPARED TO 1.75/GILLNET IN '86. THE PRESENT WALLEYE POPULATION IS REPRE- SENTED BY FIVE AGE CLASSES WITH MOST OF THE FISH IN THE III - V AGE CLASSES. THE WALLEYES AGED DO NOT CLOSELY CORRESPOND TO STOCKING RECORDS AND MAY REFLECT SOME NATURAL REPRODUCTION OR INACCURACY IN AGING FISH THAT HAVE SPENT VARYING YEARS IN REARING PONDS. THE WHITE CRAPPIE CATCH RATE HAS DECLINED FROM 27.25/GILLNET IN '86 TO 14.11/GILL- NET IN '87. WHITE CRAPPIES HAVE A FAVORABLE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION WITH MANY FISH 7.0'- 8.9' IN LENGTH. SIX AGE CLASSES WERE SAMPLED WITH I AND II YEAR OLDS SHOWING THE MOST STRENGTH. THE BLACK CRAPPIE CATCH RATE DECLINED FROM 10.50/ TRAPNET IN '86 TO 6.87/TRAPNET IN '87. THE BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATION IS WELL REPRESENTED BY I - VII AGE CLASSES SAMPLED WITH II AND III YEAR OLDS WHOWING THE MOST STRENGTH. THE CATCH RATE FOR BLUEGILLS DECLINED FROM 50.00/TRAPNET IN '86 TO 9.50/TRAPNET IN '87. THE PRESENT BLUEGILL POPULATION IS YOUNGER THAN THE '86 POPULATION WITH I AND II YEAR OLDS DOMINATING COMPARED TO IV - VII YEAR OLDS DOMINATING IN '86. PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH CONTINUE TO REMAIN LOW IN ABUNDANCE AVERAGING 1.62 TRAPNET IN '87 COMPARED TO 0.75/TRAPNET IN '86. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE NOT SAMPLED IN THE '86 ASSESSMENT COMPARED TO TWO FISH CAPTURED IN '87. FISHING REPORTS INDICATE A FAIR LARGEMOUTH BASS POPULATION PRESENT. PERCH CATCH RATES REMAIN HIGH AVERAGING 20.11/GILLNET COMPARED TO 28.25/GILLNET IN '86. PERCH ARE STONGLY REPRESENTED BY I - III AGE CLASSES COMPARED TO DOMINATE I AND II AGE CLASSES IN '86. WHITE BASS CATCH RATES REMAIN LOW AVERAGING 0.33/GILLNET COMPARED TO 0.75/GILLNET IN '86. OTHER SPECIES SAMPLED IN RELATIVELY LOW NUMBERS INCLUDE WHITE SUCKER, BOWFIN, BLACK BULLHEAD, YELLOW BULLHEAD, CARP, AND BIGMOUTH BUFFALO.

The number of black crappies caught declined, from the previous survey, to a low 4.8/trap net, while the comparable figure for bluegills remained high at 25/trap net.  Populations of these two species have tended to behave in a somewhat cyclical manner in this lake, with large, single cohorts appearing from time to time and persisting for several years.  If this pattern continues, black crappie numbers should soon increase.Northern pike numbers have increased, perhaps due, at least in part, to 1992 fingerling stocking.  Walleye abundance remains low in spite of stocking efforts.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nMazaska Lake is a 672 acre lake located northeast of Shieldsville in Rice County. There is a county-owned access located off Mazaska Lake Trail on the southwest shore and a state-owned access located off Highway 21 on the southeast shore. It has a maximum depth of 50 feet, with approximately 50% of the lake classified as littoral area. It is placed in Lake Class 24, which includes other Waterville Area lakes such as Clear Lake (Waseca County), East Jefferson Lake (Le Sueur County), and French Lake (Rice County). Mazaska Lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Black Crappie and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. The management plan calls for an annual stocking of 15,000 Northern Pike fry in the connected wetland on the north side of the lake and 336 pounds of Walleye fingerlings stocked 2 out of 3 years. Recent Walleye dispositions include fingerlings stocked in 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015. The lake was designated as infested in 2010 after the discovery of Eurasian Water Milfoil and annual efforts have been made to keep it and Curly-leaf Pondweed below nuisance levels. Mazaska Lake was surveyed the week of July 25, 2016 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 9 gill nets and 12 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nA total of 124 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 10.3/net. Since 1984, catch rates have varied from 4.0/net in 1985 to 50.0/net in 1986 with an average of 21.6/net. Lengths ranged from 2.8 to 9.1 inches with an average of 4.1 inches. Larger fish were sampled at a higher rate by gill nets with a total of 36 fish averaging 7.4 inches sampled for a catch rate of 3.9/net. Approximately 50% of fish sampled with gill nets exceeded preferred length of 8.0 inches. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 6 years old with 6 year-classes present. Approximately 82% of the sample consisted of young 1 and 2 year old fish. On average, fish reached 6.0 inches during their third growing season, indicating fast growth relative to other area lakes. According to a 2016 creel survey, Bluegills were one of the most commonly harvested fish from Mazaska Lake with an estimated 3,355 fish averaging 8.2 inches harvested during a 10 month period from January to October. Based on the creel and survey data, the Bluegill population in Mazaska Lake was described as healthy and desirable to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nBlack Crappies were the most commonly sampled fish species in the gill nets with a total of 175 sampled for a catch rate of 19.4/net.  Since 2002, catch rates have remained high with an average of 32.5/net. Lengths ranged from 4.5 to 13.1 inches with an average of 7.8 inches. An additional 23 fish averaging 8.4 inches were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.9/net. Fish from both gears were 1 to 8 years old with 7 year-classes present, suggesting consistent recruitment. Over half the sample was 2 years old. On average, fish reached 8.0 inches by 4 years old and 10.0 inches by 6 years old, indicating moderate to fast growth relative to other area lakes. According to a creel survey completed in 2016, Black and White Crappies were collectively the most commonly harvested species with an estimated 6,086 fish averaging 10.3 inches harvested during a 10 month period from January to October. Based on creel and survey data, Black Crappies were the single most important species to the fishery of Mazaska Lake in 2016 and were highly desirable to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \nDue to time constraints, a spring boat electrofishing sample targeting Largemouth Bass was not completed in 2016 and was postponed to 2017. A total of 4 Largemouth Bass were sampled with net gears. Lengths ranged from 7.8 to 15.8 inches with an average of 13.4 inches. The last electrofishing sample was conducted in 2007 and resulted in a catch rate of 67.0/hour. Those fish ranged from 6.1 to 19.4 inches with an average of 8.8 inches. The 2016 creel report offered some insight on the Largemouth Bass population in Mazaska Lake. An estimated 982 fish were caught during a 10 month period from January to October. Estimated lengths of released fish ranged from less than 5.0 inches to 20.0 inches with an average of 12.4 inches. Additional analysis of the population will be possible upon completion of the electrofishing sample scheduled for spring 2017. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nA total of 76 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 8.4/net. Northern Pike numbers have surged in the last 10 years, with an average of 7.4/net after averaging just 1.8/net from 1984 to 2002. Lengths ranged from 15.4 to 38.3 inches with an average of 22.2 inches. An additional 17 Northern Pike ranging from 13.0 to 31.0 inches were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.4/net. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 8 years old with 6 year-classes present. On average, fish reached 21.0 inches by 3 years old, indicating fast growth relative to other area lakes. The 2016 creel estimated that a total of 1,260 Northern Pike averaging 21.0 inches were harvested during the study period, behind only Bluegill and Crappies in numbers harvested. Northern Pike were an important member of the Mazaska Lake fishery in 2016 but high catch rates work against Walleye management and reduced stocking should be considered if Walleye numbers fall below management goals. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nA total of 63 Walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 7.0/net. Much like the Northern Pike population, catch rates have increased in last 10 years with an average of 7.1/net after averaging just 1.3/net prior to 2007. Lengths ranged from 7.5 to 27.4 inches with an average of 15.5 inches, indicating good size structure. Fish ranged from 1 to 8 years old with 7 year-classes present. Approximately 97% of the sample came from years when Walleye fingerlings were stocked. On average, Walleyes grew at a moderate rate, reaching 15.0 inches by 4 years old. Curiously, results from the 2016 creel survey estimated that just 173 Walleyes were harvested during the 10 month study period. The majority of Walleyes caught were small (<9.0 inches) and subsequently released. Based on the gill net data, the Walleye population appeared to be in great shape and has increased in recent years to favorable numbers under the current stocking regime. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappie <br> \nA total of 12 White Crappies were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 1.3/net.  Catch rates have declined in recent years with an average of 2.9/net since 2007 after averaging 11.6/net before 2007. Lengths ranged from 7.7 to 12.2 inches with an average of 9.5 inches. An additional 9.5 inch White Crappie was sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 2 to 6 years old with 3 year-classes present. On average, fish reached 8.0 inches by 3 years old, indicating fast growth. Although less abundant than Black Crappies, White Crappies were estimated to be the third most commonly harvested species behind Black Crappie and Bluegill in the 2016 creel survey. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass <br> \nA total of 31 White Bass were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 3.4/net. Like other predator species in the lake, White Bass numbers have increased to an average of 3.5/net since 2007 after averaging just 0.4/net prior to 2007. Lengths ranged from 9.1 to 18.5 inches with an average of 15.8 inches. Fish ranged from 1 to 15 years old with 9 year-classes present. Eighty percent of White Bass were 6 years old or older suggesting few anglers target and harvest them despite trophy length (? 18.0 inches) fish being present in the population. The 2016 creel supported this assumption with only an estimated 256 White Bass caught during the study period of which approximately 80% were released. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nA total of 27 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 3.0/net.  Since 2007, predator species such as Walleye, Northern Pike, and White Bass have increased in number and the result was the decline of Yellow Perch during this time to an average of 2.4/net. Prior to 2007, catch rates averaged 16.6/net. Lengths in 2016 ranged from 5.5 to 7.8 inches with an average of 6.4 inches. The 2016 creel survey showed that anglers caught and harvested fish up to 11.5 inches which suggested gill nets may not have accurately reflected the size structure of the population. Yellow Perch are an important prey species in Mazaska Lake and low abundance could impact predator species abundance and growth. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum <br> \nFreshwater Drum were common in Mazaska Lake in 2016. A total of 68 fish averaging 17.4 inches were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 5.7/net. By weight, they accounted for approximately 61% of the trap net catch. They were also the second most commonly caught species with gill nets with a catch rate of 11.3/net. Sixty-seven percent of Freshwater Drum in the gill net sample exceeded 15.0 inches. Although undesirable to most anglers, Freshwater Drum are easily caught and provide a good fight and respectable table fare for the open-minded angler. <br> \n <br> \nBullhead Species <br> \nBullheads have historically been rare in Mazaska Lake. In 2016, the most common species was the Yellow Bullhead. A total of 26 were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 2.9/net. Since 1984, catch rates have varied from 0.0/net in multiple samples and 5.0/net in 2007 with a mean of 1.5/net. Given the stability of the lake, Bullhead species will likely remain a small part of the fish community in Mazaska Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp <br> \nA single 12.3 inch Common Carp was sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.1/net. Only twice since 1984 (1984 and 1986) has the catch exceeded 1.5/net. Although destructive, Common Carp remained rare in Mazaska Lake and did not appear to negatively impact the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nOther species sampled in 2016 include Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Longnose Gar, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

THE GILLNET CATCH OF 43.50/GILLNET IN 85 WAS ALSO LESS COMPARED TO 66.66/GILLNET IN 81. THE CRAPPIE SIZE HAS IMPROVED SINCE 81, AN EVEN AGE CLASS DISTRIBUTION WITH FIVE AGE CLASSES IS PRESENT. IN 81 A DOMINENT III AGE CLASS WAS PRESENT, WITH ONLY A FEW II AND V YR CLASS FISH PRESENT. WHITE CRAPPIES HAVE ALSO DE CLINED IN ABUNDANCE SINCE 81, AVERAGING 6.75/GILL- NET COMPARED TO 28.11/GILLNET IN 81. TRAPNET CAT- CHES WERE CLOSE TO THE SAME, WITH 2.25/TRAPNET CAPTURED IN 85, COMPARED TO 1.75/TRAPNET IN 81. THE AVERAGE SIZE OF WHITE CRAPPIE HAS IMPROVED SINCE 81 AND CAN PROBABLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO IMPROVD GROWTH RATES. WHITE CRAPPIES ARE REPRESENTED BY I- V AGE CLASSES, WITH THE III AGE CLASS DOMINATING. WHITE CRAPPIES IN 81 WERE REPRESENTED BY II-IV AGE CLASSES WITH THE III AGE CLASS DOMINATING. BLUE- GILLS HAVE SHOWN A NOTABLE DECLINE FROM 45.87/ TRAPNET IN 81 TO 4.00/TRAPNET IN 85. BLUEGILLS HAVE EXPERIENCED POOR RECRUITMENT WITH ONLY OLDER IV-VI AGE CLASSES SAMPLED COMPARED TO DISTRIBUTION OF I-VI AGE CLASSES IN 81 WITH I-III AGE CLASSES DOMINATING. THE WALLEYE POPULATION HAS DECLINED FROM 1.00/GILLNET IN 81 TO 0.25/GILLNET IN 85. THE LOW WALLEYE NUMBERS REFLECT THE DISCONTINUED STOCKING OF WALLEYE FINGERLINGS. THE NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION HAS EXPERIENCED LITTLE CHANGE, NOW AVG- ING 0.75/GILLNET COMPARED TO 1.00/GILLNET IN 81. MAINTENANCE STOCKING OF NORTHERNS APPEAR TO BE NECESSARY IF AN ACDEPTABLE POPULATION IS TO BE PRESENT. THE YELLOW PERCH CATCH DROPPED FROM 17.55 GILLNET IN 81 TO 9.50/GILLNET IN 85. OTHER SPECIES HAVE EXPERIENCED LITTLE CHANGE AND ARE PRESENT IN RELATIVELY LOW NUMBERS AND INCLUDE LONGNOSE GAR, CARP, YELLOW BULLHEAD, WHITE SUCKER, LARGEMOUTH BASS, FRESHWATER DRUM, AND BLACK BULLHEAD, IT WAS NOTED THAT NO PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH WERE PRESENT, BUT AVERAGED 2.00/TRAPNET IN 81.

WALLEYES NOW ARE DOMINATED BY OLDER FISH V AND VI YEAR CLASS FISH WITH IV-VII YR CLASSES PRESENT. WALLEYES IN 81 WERE REPRESENTED BY I- IV YR CLASSES WITH STRONG I AND II YR CLASSES. THE NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION IS LOW, AS IN 81. NORTHERNS AVGD 1.00/GILLNET IN 81 AND NOW RUN 1.25/GILLNET. NORTHERNS SAMPLED WERE REPRESEN- TED BY II AND IV YR CLASS FISH AND 81 WERE REPRE- SENTED BY II AND III YR CLASSES. BLACK CRAPPIE HAVE DECLINED SINCE 81 AND REFLECT THIS IN BOTH TRAPNET AND GILLNET CATCHES. BLACK CRAPPIES DROPPD FROM 47.37/TRAPNET TO 10.50/TRAPNET AND FROM 66.66 GILLNET IN 81 TO 32.75/GILLNET IN 84. TODAYS BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATION HAS A FAIRLY EVEN DISTRIBUTION OF II-V YR CLASSES. THE 81 BLACK CRAPPIE POPULA- TION HAD A STRONG III YR CLASS. TODAYS BLACK CRAPPIES SHOW SLOW GROWTH AFTER AGE III. THE WHITE CRAPPIE POPULATION HAS REMAINED STABLE SINCE 81. WHITE CRAPPIE SHOWED AN INCREASE IN TRAPNET CATCHS AND A DECREASE IN GILLNET CATCHES. SINCE THE 81 SURVEY, THE GILLNET CATCH DROPPED FROM 28.11//NET IN '81 TO 9.50/NET TODAY. TRAPNETS AVERAGED 90.00/NET TODAY COMPARED TO 1.75/NET IN 81. GROWTH RATES ARE GOOD AND UNCHANGED FROM 81 WITH SIMILAR AGE CLASS DISTRIBUTIONS AS IN 81. BLUEGILLS HAVE SHOWN A SLIGHT DECREASE FROM 45.87/TRAPNET IN 81 TO 38.75/TRAPNET TODAY. THREE YEAR CLASSES, III-V YEAR OLDS WERE SAMPLED WITH A STRONG IV YR CLASS DOMINATING. IN 81 BLUEGILLS WERE FAIRLY EVENLY DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN I,II,III,V, AND VI YEAR CLASS- ES. PERCH HAVE SHOWN A LARGE DECLINE FROM 17.55/ GILLNET IN 81 TO 1.25/GILLNET TODAY. THE LOW PERCH POPULATION MAY REFLECT THE CONTINUOUS STOCKING EFFORTS OF WALLEYE AND NORTHERN PIKE. MAZASKA HAS A DIVERSE POPULATION OF NON-GAMEFISH MADE UP OF FRESHWATER DRUM, YELLOW BULLHEAD, BLACK BULLHEAD, WHITE SUCKER, CARP , LONGNOSE GAR, GOLDEN SHINER, AND BOWFIN. THE NON-GAMEFISH POPULATIONS ARE LOW COMPARED TO SIMILAR LAKES IN THE AREAS AND DON'T SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM. LM BASS WERE NOT SAMPLED IN THE 81 SURVEY OR 84 NETTING; FROM FISHING REPORTS LARGEMOUTH BASS SEEM TO BE DOING WELL.</p>",

Northern pike abundance is up from previous assessments with the average fish being 20 inches and around 2 pounds.  Northern pike over 10 pounds are possible but not all that common.  Bluegill numbers remain stable with many fish in the 6 - 8-inch size range.  Crappie numbers are down compared to previous assessments; however, the average size is attractive at 8.2 inches and 0.25 pounds.  Yellow perch remain abundant and support a nice average size of 7.2 inches and 0.2 pounds.  Yellow bullhead are average in abundance, and most exceed 12 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Low black bullhead abundance appears to be characteristic of this lake.  Other species sampled were  dogfish, carp, freshwater drum, largemouth bass, longnose gar, pumpkinseed sunfish, white bass and white sucker.  </p>",
