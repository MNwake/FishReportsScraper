At the same time, the black crappies averaged 4.7, 7.4, and 7.0 inches for one- two- and three-annuli fish, respectively.Carp are present in limited numbers, but large in size.Bullheads are very abundant, but small in size.Northern pike are scarce, but comparatively large in size.Yellow perch are very scarce.Walleye are scarce.Largemouth bass in less than average abundance.Sunfish are much less than average abundance.Crappies, both the white crappies and the black crappies appear to have stunted three-year-old fish, and fast growing one- and two-year-old fish.  The two-year-old black crappies had already caught up with the three-year olds in size at the time the last annulus was laid down, and by the time they were caught in midsummer the two-year-olds were bigger than the three's.  The white crappies showed much the same growth pattern, with the two-year-olds equaling the three's in size by the time they were caught.    Summary and Discussion:Coon Lake is an excellent panfish lake with a large population of black and white crappies, some bluegills and has a tendency to become overpopulated with bullheads.  Largemouth bass reproduction is excellent but northern pike did not appear to be too successful, these being few and large.Because of its size, 1704 acres and shape of the lake basin, and low population of northern pike, occasional stocking with walleye fingerlings is recommended to maintain predator balence. No rough fish removel or fish population control is necessary at this time.  The bullhead population should be watched; removel may be desirable in a year or two.</p>",

Black crappie numbers are down from previous years. The trap net and gill net catches were the lowest seen in this lake for many years. Lengths ranged from 3.9 to 8.9 inches. Only 10% exceeded 8 inches. Northern pike are abundant in Coon Lake. Their population is currently at one of the highest levels recorded for this lake. Lengths ranged from 12.5 to 34.4 inches, with 44.6% over 21 inches and 14.3% over 25 inches. The numbers of largemouth bass sampled are similar to previous surveys. All 3 species of bullhead native to Minnesota were sampled during this survey. Black bullhead numbers have declined since the most recent survey. Brown bullhead numbers have been variable in this lake. Yellow bullhead were sampled at some of the highest numbers in the lake. Eurasian Watermilfoil was confirmed to be present in the lake in 2003.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coon Lake has a typical Northern Pike-Bluegill-Largemouth Bass population structure. Past attempts to introduce Walleye (WAE) into the system through fry stocking have yielded poor results and were discontinued. Walleye yearlings, adults, and larger fingerlings have been stocked in recent years in a renewed attempt to establish a fishable population for this species. Only one WAE was captured during this assessment and it was 22.8 inches long and weighed 4.3 pounds. This fish was 6-years-old and would be one of the 5,000 yearlings stocked by the local lake association in 2004. Northern Pike (NOP) are the dominant predator in this lake. In 2009, the gill net catch rate was the second highest ever recorded for this lake and catch rates have been over 10 fish per set since 1998. Sampled NOP ranged from 11.7-32.8\" in length with the average size of fish captured being 25.2 inches and 4.1 pounds. Over one-third of all NOP captured measured 26 inches in length or longer. Growth rate for NOP is normal with the average fish reaching 26.0 inches by six years of age. Catch rates for Yellow Perch have remained low since 1998 and in 2009 the average size of YEP sampled was only 5.8 inches and 0.08 pounds. The Black Crappie (BLC) population also continued to show signs of low abundance as catch rates in 2009 were the second lowest ever recorded. The average size of BLC sampled was 7.11 inches and 0.18 pounds. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coon Lake is a 1,250-acre, class 35 lake located in northern Anoka County.  Coon Lake is made up of two major basins.  The eastern basin is smaller, deeper (maximum depth of 27ft), and has better water clarity.  Walleye and Northern Pike are the two primary management species in Coon Lake.  Walleye yearlings are currently stocked annually at a rate of 0.5lbs fish per littoral acre (549lbs of fish).  A 17 inch minimum length limit on Walleye was implemented in 2009 to improve walleye size structure. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch per unit effort (CPUE) in gillnets was 1.50 fish per net, between the first and second quartiles for abundance in class 35 lakes.  This is the highest CPUE of Walleye ever recorded in Coon Lake, and three times higher than in the 2013 survey.  The average Walleye sampled was 15.2 inches long, with fish up to 23 inches.  Northern Pike were sampled at a CPUE of 17.00 fish per gillnet during the 2015 survey, above the third quartile for class 35 lakes.  The average pike sampled in 2015 was 19.73 inches long, and the largest fish was 32.8 inches.  Yellow Perch CPUE was 13.67 fish per gillnet, above the median abundance for class 35 lakes and the highest CPUE for perch in Coon Lake since 1993.  The average size Yellow Perch sampled in the 2015 survey was 6.59 inches long, with only one fish over 8 inches observed.  Largemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 11.5 fish per hour of on-time during night-time electrofishing.  The average Largemouth Bass sampeld was 11 inches long, and the largest was 16.85 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill CPUE was 30.18 fish per net in the trap nets, above the third quartile for abundance in class 35 lakes.  Bluegill average length was 6.24 inches, and the largest fish sampled was 7.80 inches long.  Black Crappie CPUE in trap nets was 1.18 fish per net, between the first and second quartiles of abundance for class 35 lakes.  The average Black Crappie sampled in the 2015 survey was 8.03 inches long and the largest fish sampled was 11.89 inches. <br> \n</p>",

A population structure for northern pike  with consistent year class recruitment was seen and these fish had above normal growth rates.  Largemouth bass were age I, II, and IV and had a normal rate of growth.  Natural reproduction check indicated good year classes of bluegill, pumpkinseed, and largemouth bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coon Lake has a typical Northern Pike-Bluegill-Largemouth Bass population structure. Past attempts to introduce Walleye into the system through fry stocking yielded poor results and were discontinued. Walleye yearlings were purchased and stocked under DNR permit in 2004 by the local lake association. Northern Pike were sampled in relatively high numbers for abundance in gill nets. Sampled Northern Pike ranged from 15.3\"-32.3\" in length with the average fish being 22.3\" and 2.6 pounds. Approximately 5% of all Northern Pike captured measured 30\" or longer. The 2001 year class made up the majority of the Northern Pike captured. Yellow Perch were sampled in very low numbers. Their abundance has declined significantly since 1993. Bluegill were sampled in the highest abundance recorded for this lake since 1983. The average size of Bluegill sampled was 5.75 inches and 0.125 pounds. Approximately 6% of the Bluegills captured measured 7.0\" or larger. The Black Crappie population continues to show signs of decline. The catch rate for Black Crappie in 2005 is the lowest ever observed for this lake. The average Black Crappie sampled was 6.4\" and 0.122 pounds. Largemouth Bass were sampled in adequate numbers for all sampling gears. Although the majority of Largemouth Bass sampled averaged small in size, a 19.1\" fish weighing 4.0 pounds was captured in a trap net. A 13.8\" Smallmouth Bass weighing 1.45 pounds was captured and a second adult was sighted during this assessment. This is the first time Smallmouth Bass have ever been captured during fisheries assessments of this lake.</p>",

White sucker are below the gill net median in numbers and above the median in weight.  Black bullhead, pumpkinseed and white and black crappies are present in numbers above the median trap net catches.  Black bullhead and black crappie are above the median weight per set while pumpkinseed and white crappie are very nearly equal to the median.  The following species were present in numbers and weights below the median trap net catches: carp, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, bluegill, and hybrid sunfish.  Caution should be taken when attempting to judge largemouth bass numbers in net catches since they do not net readily.  Golden shiners were taken only in trap nets and were above the medians for that year.</p>",

The brown and yellow bullheads were very high and high respectively.  The black crappie had an exceedingly high population with 41.5 per set while the white crappie was high and the pumpkinseed very high compared to their respective medians.  The yellow perch, white sucker, golden shiner, bluegill, and largemouth bass all had low or slightly low population figures.  The walleye was high at 5.20 per set and the northern pike was about average at 2.40 per set.  Bullheads, black and white crappie, pumpkinseed and bluegill are of a small average size.  It can be assumed from shoreline seining results, that spawning success was fair for the northern pike and black crappie and good for the bluegill, pumpkinseed, yellow perch, and largemouth bass.</p>",

There is an abundant northern pike population.  Average size was 21.5 inches, 50% were over 21 inches, 15% were over 25 inches, and 3% were over 30 inches.  Largemouth bass were not adequately sampled by the gears used, but the population appears to be healthy.  One 19.5 inch walleye was captured.  There are moderate numbers of black, yellow, and brown bullheads with an average length for each species of approximately 10.5 inches.  Small yellow perch are present in low numbers - average length 5.5 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coon Lake is a 1,250-acre, class 35 lake located in northern Anoka County.  Coon Lake is made up of two major basins. The eastern basin is smaller, deeper (maximum depth of 27 feet), and has better water clarity. Walleye and Northern Pike are the two primary management species in Coon Lake. Walleye yearlings are currently stocked annually at a rate of 0.5 lbs. fish per littoral acre (549 lbs. of fish).  A 17 inch minimum length limit on Walleye was implemented in 2009 in an attempt to improve Walleye size structure. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 survey was targeted at Walleye and only gill nets were used in the sampling. Walleye catch per was 3.33 fish per net, which is above the third quartile for abundance in class 35 lakes. This is the highest CPUE of Walleye ever recorded in Coon Lake. The average Walleye sampled was 18.4 inches long, with fish up to 21 inches netted. Northern Pike were sampled at a catch rate of 10.83 fish per gill net during the 2017, which is the lowest rate of the past four surveys. The average pike sampled in 2017 was 21.5 inches long, and the largest fish was 31.6 inches. Yellow Perch catch rates were 0.50 fish per gill net, one of the lowest rates on record for Coon Lake and seem to be following a statwide trend in decreasing numbers of Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the Walleye population seems to be doing well in Coon Lake based on our netting surveys. The majority of Walleye sampled in 2017 were either 3 or 4 years old and will continue to provide angling opportunities for several years to come. The lower Northern Pike catch rates in the gill nets is a good sign, and may indicate a more balanced population in Coon Lake compared to previous surveys when high numbers of small fish were sampled.</p>",

Past attempts to introduce Walleyes (WAE) into the system through fry stocking have yielded poor results and were discontinued.  Walleye yearlings, adults and larger fingerlings have been stocked in recent years in a renewed attempt to establish a fishable WAE population. Averaging 18.40 inches in length and 2.2 pounds, only three WAE were captured during this assessment.  Similar to years past, Northern Pike (NOP; 14.5/gill net) were the dominant predator in Coon Lake.  Sampled NOP ranged from 14.4 inches to 33.7 inches in length with the average size of fish captured being 22.8 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Over 24 percent of NOP captured measured 26 inches in length or longer.  Catch rates for Yellow Perch (YEP) have remained low and in 2013 the average size of YEP sampled was only 6.0 inches and 0.07 pounds. The Black Crappie (BLC) population showed signs of increase in abundance. The average size of BLC sampled was 6.1 inches in length and 0.11 pounds.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coon Lake is a 1,250 acre lake located in northern Anoka County and assigned to lake class 35. This lake was historically susceptible to winterkills but there are currently two aeration systems in place which appear to be preventing severe winterkill. The primary management species are Walleye and Northern Pike. A mix of Walleye fingerlings and adults are stocked ranging from about 500 to 600 lb annually. In 2009 a 17 inch minimum length limit for Walleyes was implemented with the goal of protecting smaller fish from harvest. Coon was sampled with gill nets, trap nets, and night time electrofishing in June 2019.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled by gill nets at a rate of 10.6 fish per net, which is higher than average for the lake class but typical relative to historic catches and is meeting the long range goal. Mean weight of 2.4 lb was also higher than average for the lake class. Lengths of fish were well distributed from 12 to 35 inches with an average of 21.5 and 11% of Pike exceeded 30 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill net catch rate of 0.6 fish per net failed to meet the goal of 1 fish per net. This catch rate is substantially lower than the previous survey catch of 3.3 fish per net but it is typical for the last decade of sampling. Walleyes averaged 19 inches in length with the largest measuring 22.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Black Crappie were sampled at a low abundance by trap nets (0.6 fish per net), they were sampled at a much higher rate of 8.8 fish per net in gill nets. This rate is above average for the lake class and the highest catch in a survey since 1988. The gill net fish tended to be small with an average length of 6.8 inches and the few trap net fish were larger with an average length of 9.3 inches. The largest fish sampled was 11.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 92.5 fish per trap net. This is up considerably from the previous rate of 30 fish per net in 2015 but it is similar to other surveys since the early 1980's. Mean weight of 0.15 lb was less than average for the lake class and typical for the lake. Bluegill averaged 5.5 inches in length with the largest individual sampled measuring just over 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate of 2.6 fish per gill net was low. Catch rates have historically been variable but only one of the previous eight surveys has exceeded the lake class mean. The few fish sampled were small with an average length of 6 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted on Coon Lake August 13-14, 2019 by Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) program staff.  Sampling methods targeted nearshore, small-bodied fish and included seining and backpack electrofishing. Eighteen sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all eighteen stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. A 50-foot seine was used to sample ten stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations and soft substrates and dense emergent vegetation prevented the use of seines at four sites. Nearshore sampling captured 13 native species of fish including two species intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter) and one species tolerant of habitat disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill net survey completed June 2019 and a standard trap net survey completed July 2019 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Coon Lake is in good health as indicated by a FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Lower St. Croix River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

About 1\\3 of the bluegill sampled were large enough to interest anglers. Black crappie are common, but the average fish are small.  Larger crappie are present, but in low numbers. Bullheads are common and of large average size.  Northern pike are abundant, with fish up to 30\" taken in thecatch.  Walleye were stocked, but survived in low numbers.  Very few walleye are thought to be present in thelake.  Largemouth bass were taken in low numbers, but past angler reports and bass tournament results indicatea good bass population is present in this lake.  Yellow perch are common, but all perch sampled were too smallto be of interest to anglers.</p>",
