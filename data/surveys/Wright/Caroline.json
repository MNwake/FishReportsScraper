                "narrative": "<p>Species caught in gill nets included Cisco, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Walleye.  Five Cisco were sampled; this is notable because this species had not been seen in test nets in this lake since 1958, and habitat in this lake appears marginal for Cisco.  Northern Pike numbers were high (7.5/gill net) and showed a significant increase from the 1985 survey. Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 19.0-29.9 inches, with an average length of 22 inches.  Ages 3, 4, 5, and 7 were present and growth was average.  Yellow Perch catch rates were average (7.2/gill net); sizes ranged from 5.5-7.4 inches.  Walleye were present in average numbers (1.0/gill net) and have increased significantly from low numbers in 1985.  Walleye lengths ranged from 15.0-26.9 inches.  Ages 5, 6, and 8 were present.  Walleye growth was average and size was large (3.6 pound average weight).  Trap net catches yielded Black Bullhead and Yellow Bullhead, Channel Catfish, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass.  Yellow Bullhead were present in high numbers (9.3/trap net).  One Channel Catfish was caught; it measured 26 inches with a weight of 9.4 pounds.  Bluegill numbers were high (78.0/trap net) and lengths were from 4-8 inches.  Black Crappie continued to have relatively high numbers (35.8/trap net).  The length frequency distribution for Black Crappie was bimodal, with highest numbers at 6.0-6.4 inches and 8.0-8.4 inches.  Largemouth Bass catch rates from summer trap netting indicated high numbers (1.7/trap net) and average size (0.5 lb).  Lengths ranged from 5.0-15.9 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Caroline is a 126 acre lake located along the Clearwater River in Wright County east of the city of Fairhaven. The lake has a surface area of 126 acres with a maximum depth of 45 feet and a mid-summer secchi depth of 5 feet. Lake Caroline has no public access; however it can be accessed from Lake Augusta via the Clearwater River when free from obstruction during high water conditions. The watershed is large and dominated by cultivated crops and pasture land; the lake is lightly developed.  An emergent and floating leaf survey was conducted on July 17, 2019. The shoreline was made up of 19.5% emergent vegetation with Yellow Waterlily, White Waterlily, cattail, bulrush, and sedge species observed.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike and Largemouth Bass are the primary managed species. A standard survey of all the lakes along the Clearwater River was completed in 2014. These include: Louisa/Marie, Caroline, Augusta, Clearwater, and Grass lakes. Similarly, in 2019 with the exception of Grass Lake, these lakes were surveyed again. The survey included spring Largemouth Bass electrofishing; then gill netting and trap netting for all species. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass sampled ranged in length from 11 to 19 inches with an average length of 15 inches. Anglers should have opportunities to catch quality-sized Largemouth Bass as 90% percent of fish sampled were longer than 12 inches and 60% were longer than 15 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate increased from the previous survey, and was in the expected values for lakes similar to Lake Caroline. Anglers should have opportunities to catch quality-sized Northern Pike as fish in the survey ranged in length from 17 to 35 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate was higher than the previous survey and was in the range of expected values for lakes similar to Lake Caroline. Bluegills up to eight (8) inches were sampled with an average length of five (5) inches. Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed were also observed in the survey. <br> \nThe 2019 catch rate of Black Crappie was similar to the previous survey. Black Crappie sampled ranged in length from 4 to 12 inches with an average length of 9 inches. Thirty percent of black crappie were longer than 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate was less than the previous survey, but was still within the expected values for lakes similar to Lake Caroline. Walleye ranged in length from 9 to 24 inches with an average length of 17 inches. Walleye populations occur either through natural reproduction or from stocked fish migrating via the Clearwater River from Clearwater Lake. Growth rates were relatively fast, which is probably due to an abundance of available forage. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch have been absent from previous surveys since 1997, but were caught in the 2019 survey with a catch rate in the expected range of values for lakes similar to Lake Caroline. Yellow Perch sampled ranged in length from 4 to 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were sampled in low numbers again with three (3) total fish caught. Channel Catfish ranged in length from 13 to 23 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species that were noted in the sample include Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, Bowfin (Dogfish), Tulibee (Cisco), and White Sucker. Most of these species were sampled in low numbers, with the exception of White Suckers, compared to other lakes similar to Lake Caroline. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Caroline Lake is a 126 acre lake located five miles northeast of Annandale.  The lake is part of the Clearwater River system, has 3.2 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 45 feet.  During late June 1997, there was adequate dissolved oxygen presentfor fish to a depth of 13 feet.  The lakeshore is developed with 20 private homes and cabins as well as a Boy Scout camp, which has 23 cabins.  Sixteen aquatic plant species were identified in the 1997 survey.  There is no public access on Caroline Lake; however, the lake can be reached via the Clearwater River from Augusta Lake.     Caroline Lake is located within 50 miles of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area and receives moderate fishing pressure.  Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, Largemouth Bass and Walleye are all present in the lake.  In a lake survey conducted in the summer of 1997, test netting revealed the following information about the fish population.     Northern Pike catch rate was 5.0/gill net, which is within the expected range for lakes similar to Caroline.  The average northern pike weighed 2.7 pounds and was 23.6 inches long, which was in the expected range for the lake type.  Northern Pike growth was average compared to other populations in the state.  Gill net catch of Walleye (1.3/gill net) was normal for this lake type.  Walleye averaged 1.8 pounds and 17.2 inches long, which is in the expected range for similar lakes.  Yellow Perch catch was 0.3/gill net, which is lower than expected.  Yellow perch catch has been variable in past surveys.      Trap net catch of Black Crappie (4.5/trap net) was within expected levels for the lake type, but appeared to be lower than in previous surveys.  The average Black Crappie was 6.9 inches long.  Bluegill catch rate (7.7/trap net) was in the expected range.  The average size of Bluegill was 5.3 inches and ranged from 2.8-8.3 inches long.  Bluegill reproduction is good, and a typical Bluegill reaches six inches by age five. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Caroline is a 126 acre lake located along the Clearwater River in Wright County.  Lake Caroline has no public access, however under high water levels and when the Clearwater River is free from obstruction it can be accessed from Lake Augusta.  In 2005, all of the lakes along the Clearwater River were surveyed.  These include: Louisa/Marie, Caroline, Augusta, Clearwater, and Grass lakes.  Largemouth Bass DNR crews sample largemouth bass by electrofishing.  Largemouth are collected in the evening in spring with a specially designed boat to stun the bass with electric current.  The fish are released after data collection.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 24.7 fish/hour, which is about half of the mean catch rate for Montrose area lakes (52.0/hr).  Largemouth ranged in length from 8.0  to 20.2 inches with a mean length of 14.1 inches.  Good numbers of largemouth bass over 15 inches exist in the population.Northern PikeThe northern pike catch was lower in 2005 (2.8 fish/gill net) than in 1997 (5.0 fish/gill net) and is lower than expected for lakes similar to Caroline.  Northern pike ranged in length from 17.4 to 30.8 inches.  Mean length and weight of northern pike sampled was 21.5 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Anglers can expect fair fishing for smaller northern pike.WalleyeThe walleye catch rate (1.2 fish/gill net) was the same as observed during the 1997 survey and is in the lower range for lakes similar to Caroline.  The low catch rate for walleye is not surprising since no walleye are stocked and walleye do not naturally reproduce here.  Fish may move into the lake from  adjoining lakes, Augusta and Clearwater.BluegillThe bluegill catch rate in 2005 (11.9 fish/trap net) was similar to that observed during the 1997 survey (7.7 fish/trap net), but within the range of expected values for lakes like Caroline.  Bluegill sampled ranged in length from 3.5 inches to 8.9 inches with a mean length of 7.2 inches.The black crappie catch rate 6.0 fish/trap net) was within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Black crappie ranged in length from 3.5 inches to 10.2 inches with a mean length of 8.6 inches.Other fish species sampled during the survey included: black and yellow bullheads, bowfin, common carp, channel catfish, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Caroline is a 126 acre lake located along the Clearwater River in Wright County.  Lake Caroline has no public access, however under high water levels and when the Clearwater River is free from obstruction it can be accessed from Lake Augusta.  This is one of the few lakes in the Montrose Fisheries Office that has Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass are the primary managed species. In 2005, all of the lakes along the Clearwater River were surveyed.  These include: Louisa/Marie, Caroline, Augusta, Clearwater, and Grass lakes. Similarly, in 2014 all of these lakes were surveyed again. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during day via electrofishing. Thirty-nine fish were sampled.  The catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 38.8 fish/hour, which is an increase from the 24.7 fish/hour seen in 2005. Largemouth Bass from the electrofishing survey varied in length from 10.2 to 18.7 inches with a mean length of 14.6 inches.  The size range is similar to that seen in 2005. Proportional stock density (PSD) was 100 and the relative stock density\u0013preferred (RSD-P) was 56. The number of quality and preferred sized fish sampled increased from 2005 when PSD was 80 and RSD-P was 40. Additionally, three fish were sampled in trap nets. Notably, one of these fish was 20.1 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-two Northern Pike were sampled in the gill nets for a catch rate of 3.7 fish/net.  This is an increase from 2005, but is still below the 5 fish/gill net seen in 1997. The 2014 catch rate puts Northern Pike near the expected average for similar lakes. Similar length ranges were seen to previous surveys with Northern Pike sampled varying in size from 17.3 to 33.9 inches. The average fish was 23.1 inches long and 2.7 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low. A catch rate of 6.63 fish/trap net put Bluegill below the average number of expected fish.  Fish from trap nets and gill nets ranged in length from 2.8 to 8.7 inches with an average size of 6.3 inches and 0.3 pounds. The length range has remained consistent to previous surveys, but the average length decreased from 7.2 inches in 2005.  In addition to Bluegill, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseeds were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie had a trap net catch of 5.88 fish/net.  Trap net and gill nets sampled fish from 3.9 to 13.4 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches and 0.6 pounds. Although the average size is lower than seen in 2005, 8.6 inches, multiple fish were seen over 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA total of thirty Walleye were sampled from Caroline Lake. Of this twenty-seven were captured in the gill nets for a rate of 4.5 fish/net.  Fish sampled varied in size from 13.6 to 28.3 inches. The average Walleye was 17.5 inches and1.6 pounds. It is interesting to note that this lake is not stocked with Walleye.  Either natural reproduction occurring in Caroline or fish are migrating into this system from either upstream or downstream.  If the later, fish from upstream in Louisa and Marie would be natural reproduction.  If the fish migrated upstream they could be either naturally reproduced or from stocking events in Clearwater Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were sampled in low numbers again with three fish sampled and a catch rate of 0.5 fish/ gill net. Fish sampled were 17.9-19.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nAll three Bullhead species, Common Carp, Rock Bass, Bowfin, and White Sucker were also sampled in this survey. Most of these underutilized species were sampled in low numbers, with the exception of White Suckers. Twenty-seven White Suckers were sampled in the gill nets for a catch rate of 4.5 fish/net, placing them in the upper quartile for Lake Class 24. They varied in size from 15.7 to 21.7 inches in length with an average size of 17.8 inches and 2.5 pounds. <br> \n</p>",

Common Carp (3.3/trap net), Black Bullhead (37.2/trap net),and White Sucker (4.7/gill net) constitute the high roughfish population. Walleye (0.2/gill net) and Yellow Perch (0.2/gill net) have suffered major declines, while Northern Pike (2.7/gill net) catches have declined somewhat. Bluegill (15.2/trap net) have maintained a population similar to the local average and Black Crappie (26.1/trap net) have increased in number to well above the local average. All game fish appear to exhibit normal growth rates.</p>",
