WHEN COMPARED TO LAKES OF THE SAME CLASS (27), THIS WAS BELOW THE MEDIAN AND AROUND THE FIRST QUARTILE.  WHEN LOOKING AT THE LENGTH FREQUENCIES FOR 1991, MANY YEAR CLASSES WERE PRESENT, SHOWING RECRUITMENT TO MANY AGES.  WHEN COMPARING WITH THE 1988 LENGTH FREQUENCIES FOR WALLEYE, ALL THE YEAR CLASSES WERE MORE WELL REPRESENTED. THE MEAN LENGTH FOR WALLEYE CAPTURED IN 1991 WAS 15.0 INCHES, WHICH WAS ABOUT THE SAME IN 1988 (14.3 INCHES).  THE WALLEYE IN 1991 RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 9.5 - 25 INCHES, WITH THE MODE REPRESENTED IN FIVE DIFFERENT LENGTH GROUPS.  GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR ALL AGES WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATE AVERAGES.NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE (2.00/GILLNET LIFT) WAS ALSO LOWER THAN IN 1988 (6.9/LIFT), BUT FELL IN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 2.0 - 6.9.  WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER LAKES IN THE SAME CLASS, THE 1991 NORTHERN PIKE GILLNET CATCH RATE FELL BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE (3.13).  THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 13 - 29 INCHES, WITH A MODE OF 22 INCHES.  FAST GROWTH OCCURRED FOR THE FIRST 3 YEARS.  AFTER THAT, GROWTH WAS GOOD.YELLOW PERCH ABUNDANCE (43.4/LIFT) FELL WITHIN THE HISTORICAL RANGE (9.9 - 54.8).  YELLOW PERCH ALONG WITH WHITE SUCKER AND CISCO OFFER THE NORTHERN PIKE AND WALLEYE ADEQUATE FORAGE.BLUEGILL WERE CAUGHT AT A RATE OF 3.3/TRAPNET LIFT, WHICH WAS COMPARABLE TO PAST ASSESSMENTS (0.7 - 9.2/LIFT).  THIS WAS EQUAL TO THE FIRST QUARTILE FOR LAKE CLASS 27 LAKES.  GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR ALL AGES.  PUMPKINSEED, HYBRID SUNFISH AND ROCK BASS WERE OTHER SPECIES OF SUNFISH THAT WERE CAUGHT.VERY FEW LARGEMOUTH BASS AND NO BLACK CRAPPIE WERE CAUGHT.  ICE OUT TRAPNETTING AND/OR ELECTROFISHING WILL NEED TO BE DONE TO ASSESS THEIR STATUS IN THE FUTURE.ALL THREE SPECIES OF BULLHEADS WERE PRESENT IN OUR CATCHES AT LEVELS COMPARABLE TO PAST ASSESSMENTS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pine Mountain Lake is a 1567-acre lake with a maximum depth of 80 feet.  The city of Backus is located on the east side of the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classess based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Pine Mountain Lake is in lake class 22.  Lakes in this lake class are typically large in size, moderately deep, and moderately clear.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Ten Mile, Steamboat, Woman, Little Boy, and Wabedo Lakes.  Approximately 47% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  There is a city-owned access on the east side of the lake.  Pine Mountain Lake provides good fishing for northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.In 1999 walleye abundance was comparable to that found in 1996 and in 1994.  Anglers can expect to catch walleye of many sizes.  Natural reproduction of walleye can create abundant year classes in Pine Mountain Lake.  At present it is unclear whether or not stocking adds significantly to the population.  Fish were growing at a rate that was typical of other area lake class 22 lakes.  Growth was typical of other lakes in the same lake class.Northern pike abundance was the highest found of any survey conducted on Pine Mountain Lake.  Though many small fish are present, the lake is known to produce big fish.There are many kinds of panfish anglers can fish for in Pine Mountain Lake.  Panfish of quality size include bluegill, black crappie, rock bass, and yellow perch.  To maintain such good quality, anglers need to use some restraint if large panfish are really biting.  Release the larger panfish and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size panfish have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.Lakeshore development has doubled in less than 30 years.  In 1968 there were 61 lakehomes. In 1994 there were 119 lakehomes.  This development has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> <br> \nPine Mountain Lake (DOW# 11-0411; Lake Class 22) is a 1,612 acre lake located near Backus, MN. There is a city-owned public access on the east shore. Pine Mountain Lake has 9.44 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 80 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Pine Mountain Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in the class are generally clear, large, deep lakes with a low percentage of shallow water area and have very irregularly shaped shorelines with many bays or points. <br> \n <br> \nPine Mountain Lake is an excellent Walleye, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike lake in the Walker area. Walleye catch rates were similar to other lakes in the same lake class. Walleye up to 25 inches were sampled with a large number of fish between 15 and 18 inches. In addition a good number of Yellow Perch were present with fish up to 9 inches. Pine Mountain Lake also has a good Northern Pike population with fish of all sizes. Northern Pike up to 36 inches were sampled in addition to many fish from 22 to 26 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Crappie, Bowfin (Dogfish), Bluegill, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass,  Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. No aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Pine Mountain Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Pine Mountain Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting July 22, 2019. Eighteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lakeshore and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 18 sites with four sites sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 12 sites, a 15-foot seine was used at two sites, and deep, soft sediments prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Two of the 50-foot seine sites were boat assisted hauls. Nearshore sampling captured 23 native species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey will be combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2019 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Pine Mountain Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pine Mountain Lake (DOW # 110411) is a 1,567-acre lake located on the west side of Backus, MN.  There is a public access located in a city park on the lake's east shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.   Pine Mountain Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are generally clear, very large, very deep, have a low percentage of shallow water area, and have very irregularly shaped shoreline with many bays or points.  Pine Mountain Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and walleye, and secondarily for cisco (tullibee), bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie, and yellow perch.Both the number and average size of northern pike in Pine Mountain Lake are good; sampled fish ranged from 9 to 31 inches and had an average length of 23 inches.  Walleye abundance in the 2005 sampling in Pine Mountain Lake was similar to the average of ecologically similar lakes.  Fish from 8 to 27 inches were sampled in MNDNR test nets. Stocking has been successful in helping to maintain a good walleye population in this lake.  Historical survey data suggest that there could be significant natural reproduction occurring in Pine Mountain Lake.  The frequency and timing of stocking that has occurred in Pine Mountain Lake has not afforded the opportunity to gauge the consistency of natural reproduction.  However, consideration will be given to scheduling one to three years of no stocking between stocked years to get a better measure of the role of natural reproduction in this lake.  Bluegill abundance was similar to other lakes of this type, and some 6- to 8-inch bluegill are available.  Yellow perch are abundant in Pine Mountain Lake.  Most yellow perch sampled in MNDNR test nets were small, with a limited number in the 8- and 9-inch categories.  Other species present include bluegill, black crappie, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, cisco (tullibee), hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.   Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Pine Mountain Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pine Mountain is a 1567-acre lake located in northern Cass County. The lake is about a mile wide and three mileslong, and has a maximum depth of 80 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classifiedMinnesota's lakes into about 40 different types, based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  PineMountain is in Lake Class 22.  Other area lakes in this same class include Ten Mile (located nine miles to thenorth) and Woman (located 12 miles to the northeast).  The City of Backus is located on the east shore of PineMountain, and a boat launching ramp is located in a city park on the lake's east shore. Walleye catch during the 1994 survey was 5.8 fish per experimental gill net, which is similar to the catch inother lakes of this class. The average weight of walleye sampled was 1.5 lbs, and sampled walleye ranged from 6through 26 inches. This lake has an excellent walleye population in terms of abundance and size. The growth rateof walleye was similar to other area lakes in this class. Pine Mountain has been stocked with walleye for manyyears prior to 1985, and since 1985 it has been stocked only on odd-numbered years.  Walleye were found from someof the years in which no stocking took place, indicating that natural reproduction occurs in the lake. Northern pike appear to be less abundant in Pine Mountain than they are in other similar lakes, but the averagesize of the fish is good (3.1 pounds per fish). Northern pike sampled ranged from 13 to 33 inches, and theirgrowth rate was similar to that found in other area lakes of this class.Yellow perch were about as abundant as in other lakes in this class, and ranged in length from 5 through 9 whichwas similar to findings of earlier surveys. Few of the perch were large enough to interest most anglers. Bluegill were not sampled as frequently in Pine Mountain as in many Class 22 lakes. In 1994, sampled bluegillranged from 3.5 to 7.9 inches. Though no \"lunker\" bluegill were sampled, this population will provide some qualitysize fish for sunfish anglers. About one-fifth of the bluegill sampled were in the 7-inch group. Similarly, thoughthe pumpkinseed sunfish numbers were lower than in most lakes of this type, the pumpkinseed population could alsoprovide some satisfactory sizes for sunfish anglers.   Largemouth bass from 5 to 14 inches were sampled during the 1994 survey and they grew at rates similar to otherlocal lakes in this class.  Other species present in Pine Mountain Lake include white sucker, black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead,bowfin (dogfish), hybrid sunfish and rock bass.  The number of private homes or cabins along the shore of Pine Mountain has almost doubled from 61 in 1968 to 119in 1994.  The number of cabins at resorts has declined from 27 in 1968 to 12 in 1994.  To maintain and promote a healthy fish population on Pine Mountain, lake shore residents and other users of thelake should protect fish habitat by preserving natural aquatic vegetation. Lake shore residents can also helppreserve Pine Mountain's water quality by such actions as having a properly built and maintained septic system;by avoiding the use of lawn or garden chemicals near the lake; and by establishing a buffer strip of naturalvegetation along their shoreline.  Anglers can help maintain fishing quality by practicing catch and release oflarger fish.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pine Mountain Lake (DOW # 110411) is a 1,567-acre lake located on the west side of Backus, MN.  There is a public access located in a city park on the lake\u0019s east shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota\u0019s lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Pine Mountain Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are generally clear, very large, very deep, have a low percentage of shallow water area, and have very irregularly shaped shoreline with many bays or points.   <br> \n <br> \nPine Mountain Lake provides very good angling opportunities for northern pike and walleye and both species are abundant in Pine Mountain Lake.  For anglers targeting northern pike, there is the opportunity to catch some very large fish.  Several year-classes of small walleyes are present, which should provide some good angling opportunities in the future.  Bluegill and black crappie are not very abundant, however quality size fish are available for anglers that take time to find these species.  Quality size largemouth bass are present for anglers seeking these species.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Pine Mountain Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pine Mountain Lake (DOW# 11-0411; Lake Class 22) is a 1,612 acre lake located near Backus, MN. There is a city-owned public access on the east shore. Pine Mountain Lake has 9.44 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 80 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Pine Mountain Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in the class are generally clear, large, deep lakes with a low percentage of shallow water area and have very irregularly shaped shorelines with many bays or points. Other Lake Class 22 lakes in the Walker Area include Baby 9 (DOW# 11-0283), Big Sand (DOW# 11-077), Ponto (DOW# 11-0234), and Stony(DOW# 11-0371) lakes. The purpose of this survey was to assess game fish populations and to monitor Walleye stocking. <br> \n <br> \nPine Mountain Lake is an excellent Walleye and Northern Pike lake in the Walker area. Walleye ranged in length from 8 to 22 inches with an average length of 16 inches. Most of the Walleye sampled were between 14 and 23 inches long. Walleye fry are stocked during odd years and nine consecutive year classes were sampled with the strongest produced during 2011 and 2013. Although Walleye are moderately abundant numbers in the 2019 survey did not meet the management goal of six fish per gill net. Northern Pike are abundant and ranged in length from 12 to 37 inches with an average length of 20 inches long. Northern Pike size restrictions and possession limits for Pine Mountain Lake are defined in the North Central Zone Northern Pike regulations. Anglers are encouraged to harvest Northern Pike under 22 inches long. The Black Crappie population has increased over the last fifteen years. The average length of Black Crappie in the sample was 10 inches long and lengths ranged from 4 to 12 inches. Bluegill over 8 inches long were present but most of the Bluegill sampled were under 7 inches long. Largemouth Bass up to 18 inches long were sampled. Yellow Perch were small and averaged 7 inches long and ranged in length from 5 to 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Crappie, Bowfin (Dogfish), Bluegill, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. No aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Pine Mountain Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

There is a city-owned public access on the east shore. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Pine Mountain Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in the class are generally clear, large, deep lakes with a low percentage of shallow water area and have very irregularly shaped shorelines with many bays or points. Other Lake Class 22 lakes in the Walker Area include Baby, Big Sand, Ponto, and Stony lakes. A standard lake survey was completed in 2022. <br> \nPine Mountain Lake is an excellent Walleye and Northern Pike lake in the Walker area. Walleye abundance was the highest recorded in 2022. Walleye ranged in length from 8 to 28 inches with an average length of 16 inches. Most of the Walleye sampled were between 12 and 15 inches long. Walleye fry are stocked during odd years and eleven consecutive year-classes were sampled. Northern Pike were abundant and ranged in length from 14 to 34 inches with an average length of 21 inches long. Northern Pike size restrictions and possession limits for Pine Mountain Lake are defined in the North Central Zone Northern Pike regulations. Anglers are encouraged to harvest Northern Pike under 22 inches long. Black Crappie and Bluegill numbers were within management goals and provide quality angling opportunities. Black Crappie ranged in length from 5 to 13 inches with an average length of 11 inches. Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 10 inches with an average length of 6 inches. Largemouth Bass up to 18 inches long were sampled. Yellow Perch were abundant but small in size averaging 7 inches long and ranging in length from 5 to 9 inches. <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently Pine Mountain Lake is infested with Zebra Mussel, and Curly Leaf Pondweed. Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

THE SAMPLE COLLECTED EXHIBITS A GOOD LENGTH FREQUENCY WITH FISH OVER 30 INCHES IN LENGTH PRESENT.  NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS EXCELLENT.  FAIR NUMBERS OF 6 TO 8 INCH NORTHERN CISCO HAVE BEEN SAMPLED IN ALL ASSESSMENTS CONDUCTED ON PINE MOUNTAIN.  THEY PROVIDE EXCELLENT FORAGE FOR LARGER NORTHERN PIKE.ALL THREE SPECIES OF BULLHEAD ARE WELL REPRESENTED (NOT OVERLY ABUNDANT) IN THE NET CATCHES.  BULLHEAD FROM 9 TO 13 INCHES IN LENGTH DOMINATE THE SAMPLE COLLECTED.THE PRESENT TRAPNET CATCH OF BLUEGILL, THOUGH NOT PARTICULARLY HIGH AT 9.2/NET, IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN WHAT IT HAS BEEN DURING PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS (RANGED FROM 0.7 TO 2.2 PER TN).  FORTY PERCENT OF THE SAMPLE OF BLUEGILL IS GREATER THAN 7 INCHES IN LENGTH, BUT NO FISH OVER 9 INCHES WERE COLLECTED AS IN ALL PAST ASSESSMENTS.  THE GROWTH RATE OF BLUEGILL IN PINE MOUNTAIN LAKE IS EXCELLENT, A BLUEGILL ATTAINS A LENGTH OF 7 INCHES IN 5 YEARS OF GROWTH.FEW LARGEMOUTH BASS OR BLACK CRAPPIE WERE COLLECTED, PRESUMABLY DUE TO THE TYPES OF SAMPLING GEAR USED.  THOUGH NOT COLLECTED, BLACK CRAPPIE UP TO 12 TO 14 INCHES WERE OBSERVED WHILE ELECTROFISHING DURING OCTOBER.  SPRING ELECTROFISHING NEEDS TO BE CONDUCTED TO BETTER ASSESS BLACK CRAPPIE AND LARGEMOUTH BASS POPULATIONS.THE GILLNET CATCH OF YELLOW PERCH WAS 54.8 PER GN WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN DURING PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS (1968-9.9; 1976-31.5; 1983-19.6).  ALL YELLOW PERCH SAMPLED WERE BETWEEN 5 AND 9 INCHES IN LENGTH.THE WALLEYE GILLNET CATCH OF 7.9 PER GN INDICATES A FARILY HIGH POPULATION AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CATCHES FROM ALL PAST ASSESSMENTS (RANGE FROM 7.0 TO 8.9 PER GILLNET).  THE GILLNET SAMPLE OF WALLEYE EXHIBITED AN EXCELLENT LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION.  ALL AGE CLASSES GREATER THAN II+ WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE GILLNET CATCH.  THE 1985 YEAR CLASS APPEARED TO BE PARTICULARLY STRONG.  ONLY 485 WALLEYE FINGERLINGS ALONG WITH 1,000,000 FRY  WERE STOCKED IN 1985.  THIS STRONG A YEAR CLASS WOULD INDICATE THAT MOST OF THESE WALLEYE ARE THE RESULT OF THE FRY STOCKING AND/OR NATURAL REPRODUCTION.ELECTROFISHING DURING OCTOBER YIELDED 185 WALLEYE WITH 3.05 HOURS OF EFFORT.  ELECTROFISHING SAMPLED WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN ABUNDANT 1986 YEAR CLASS; WHICH ARE MOST OF THE WALLEYE BETWEEN 9 AND 11.5 INCHES.  (SIXTEEN SCALE SAMPLES WERE CHECKED IN THIS SIZE GROUP AND FOUND TO HAVE 2+ ANNULI).  NO WALLEYE STOCKING TOOK PLACE DURING 1986, SO THESE FISH ARE ALL FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  SCALE AGING ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THE 6.5 TO 8.0 INCH FISH ARE FROM THE 1988 YEAR CLASS WHICH IS THE RESULT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pine Mountain Lake is a 1567-acre lake located on the edge of Backus, MN.  With a maximum depth of 80 feet, approximately 47% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  A public access is located in the town of Backus.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Pine Mountain Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are generally very large, low littoral area, clear and irregular shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike and walleye and secondarily for cisco, bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie, and yellow perch.   Walleye were abundant and many year-classes were present which will provide fishing opportunities in the future.  Lengths ranged from 7 to 23 inches with a mean length of 14 inches.  Northern pike were abundant with fish up to 32 inches observed.  Bluegills were not abundant, however fish up to 9 inches long were observed.    Other fish species available for anglers to catch are include black crappie, bowfin, brown bullhead, cisco, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Pine Mountain Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore and littoral fish community, as well as coldwater habitat, in Pine Mountain Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 1-4 August 2022. Eighteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 18 sites with four sites sampled from the boat due to dense vegetation and deep, fine sediments. A 50-foot seine was used to sample twelve sites, a 15-foot seine was used at two sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 24 native species of fish including nine species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Burbot, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass) and one species (Fathead Minnow) that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 1-4 August 2022 by IBI Program Staff. Fifteen trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bowfin and Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was near but above 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 22 lakes and the average length was 6.3 inches, with 41% over 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nA temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Pine Mountain Lake on August 1st, 2022 to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 30 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 28.7 feet, which was above the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 21.2?C (70.2?F ). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values near 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are marginal to poor for Cisco. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations (less than 3 mg/L) near the thermocline and warm surface temperatures would limit Cisco distribution within the water column. Data collected in 1998-2019 further indicate marginal to poor oxythermal habitat in most years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2005 and 2008. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey agree with the presence of an exceptional fish community indicated from a 2019 survey. Data from this survey indicates that the warmwater fish community in Pine Mountain Lake is in good health as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. However, the TDO3 that indicated coldwater habitat conditions were marginal to poor for Cisco at the time of the survey. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community, and the coldwater habitat, to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
