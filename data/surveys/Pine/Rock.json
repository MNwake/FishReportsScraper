                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake is a 77 acre lake located entirely within the St. Croix State Forest in eastern Pine County.  The lake was chemically reclaimed in 1976 to provide a recreational fishery for campers in the State Forest campground.  A walleye population is maintained through biannual stocking.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical and chemical similarities.  Rock Lake is assigned to lake class 37.  Lakes in class 37 are typically shallow, small, and turbid with soft water.  In order to assess the current fishery in Rock Lake, netting was conducted in September of 2002.Walleye were shore oriented with trapnets out fishing the gillnets.  Catch rates were 3.2 and 1.8 respectively.  The walleye catch was high compared to other class 37 lakes.  Fish were good sized averaging 18.5 inches and 2 pounds.  The 1997 year class, a stocking year, was the most abundant.  Growth was good with walleye reaching 18 inches in 5 years.  The current population should provide ample fishing to lake users. Northern pike catch, 3.3/gillnet, was higher than past surveys and in the normal range for the lake class.  Northerns were of moderate size with a 20.8 inch and 2 pound average.  The northern population was relatively young.  Nearly all sampled northerns were between 3 and 4 years old.  Yellow perch were stocked following lake reclaimation to provide forage for walleye.  An over abundant perch population led to the stocking of northern pike in 1990.  The perch population has been checked and maintained in a desirable range since 1997.  The 2002 catch rate was 10.5/gillnet, very near the lake class median.  Sampled perch averaged 6 inches, to small for most anglers but good forage for the existing walleye and northern populations.Bluegill were not stocked after reclaimation but a sustaining popoulation was present by 1997.  The trapnet catch, 15.8/trapnet, was within the lake class norm and higher than the 1997 catch.  Fish size was small with a 5 inch average but some fish over 7 inches were present.  </p>",

NOTE:  Only walleye, yellow perch, and adult fathead minnows have been stocked in Rock Lake since it was reclaimed in 1976.  The walleye numbers dropped from 4.50 per set in 1980 to 2.50 in 1981.  The yellow perch (adult) catch dropped from 56.17 to 24.83 in the gillnet and from 341.50 to 27.25 in the trapnet.  Natural reproduction of yellow perch was confirmed in August 1980 and 1981.

                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake was reclaimed in 1976.  In 1977 a revised management plan was designed to establish a walleye fishery.  Walleyes, along with yellow perch to provide a forage base, have since been stocked.  The current walleye population (0.83/ set) shows a real decline from the 1985 assessment (1.83/set) to a level well below the local median (3.52/set).  Two age groups (I and V) represent the eight walleyes collected.  Six of these fish correspond to a 1982 fingerling stocking and 2 to a 1986 stocking.  The gap in year classes (II-IV) reflects non-stocking years and poor recruitment from natural reproduction.  Current growth rates are slow and overall size distribution is small (median length group 12.0 - 12.9 inches, mean weight 0.74 pounds).  Walleyes over 18.0 inches were not taken in the present survey.  In contrast, the 1985 survey had much better size and growth rates (median length group 19.0 - 19.9 inches, mean weight 1.3 pounds).  Interestingly, the decline in walleye growth rates appears to coincide with a dramatic increase in the yellow perch population in 1983.  The yellow perch population (103.33/set) remains extremely high, as it has been since 1983, compared to a local median of 24.27/set.  Perch attained high levels shortly after they were first stocked in 1980 with a major increase, as previously mentioned, occurring in 1983.  The median length group for yellow perch is 6.0 - 6.4 inches.  The range is 4.9 - 9.9 inches with few fish over 8.0 inches.  Two white suckers and 5 golden shiners were present in shoreline seining.  Previous records indicate that the lake was initially stocked with adult fathead minnows in April 1977, following reclamation.  In at least the past 3 surveys the fathead minnows have not appeared in any shoreline seining efforts.  Rock lake exhibits very low total alkalinity and pH levels that indicate a potential for problems associated with acid waters.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake is a 77 acre lake located entirely within the St. Croix State Forest in eastern Pine County.  The lake was chemically reclaimed in 1976 to provide a recreational fishery for campers in the State Forest campground.  A walleye population is maintained through biennial stocking.   <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical and chemical similarities.  Rock Lake is assigned to lake class 37.  Lakes in class 37 are typically shallow, small, and turbid with soft water.  In order to assess the current fishery in Rock Lake, netting was conducted in September of 2007. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was down compared to the 2002 sample.  Catch rates were 1.5 and 0.3 in the gillnets and trapnets respectively.  The walleye catch was within the normal range for lake class 37.  Fish were good sized averaging 20 inches and 2.6 pounds overall.  The current population should provide fishing opportunity to lake users.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch, 7.5/gillnet, continues to rise.  Although present in normal abundance, pike size was above the 75th percentile compared to other class 37 lakes.  Lengths ranged from 20.9 to 30.6 inches with 24 inch mode.  Northerns averaged 3.3 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were stocked following lake reclamation to provide forage for walleye.  An over abundant perch population led to the stocking of northern pike in 1990.  The perch population has been checked and maintained in a desirable range since 1997.  The 2007 catch rate was 11.5/gillnet, very similar to the lake class median and the 2002 sample.  Sampled perch averaged 5.9 inches, to small for most anglers but good forage for the existing walleye and northern populations. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were not stocked after reclamation but a sustaining population was present by 1997.  The trapnet catch, 28/trapnet, was above the lake class norm and the highest since the reclamation.  Bluegill size was small with a 5 inch average but some fish over 7 inches were present.   <br> \n <br> \nTwo white suckers and three golden shiners were also sampled during the assessment.  <br> \n</p>",

Based on fish samples collected at this time the present fish population of Rock Lake was evaluated through comparisons with previous investigations and lake class medians (lake class 37).\n  The northern pike gillnet catch (1.67/set) is below the first quartile value (3.00/set) of the lake class.  The captured northern pike ranged from 18.0-29.9 inches in length with a mean length group of 22.0-22.9 inches.  The mean weight was 1.88 pounds which is normal compared to the lake class mean of 1.86 pounds.  Back-calculated age data from scale samples indicated that sampled northern pike ranged from three to six years of age with 50% being four years old.  Growth was normal compared to the statewide growth rate of the species.  The northern pike population consists entirely of female fish stocked in 1990 to prey on the yellow perch population.\n  The walleye gillnet catch (1.00/set) is up from the 1987 catch of 0.83/set and normal compared to the lake class median of 2.50/set.  The captured walleye ranged from 13.0-21.9 inches in length with a median length group of 17.0-17.9 inches.  Sampled walleye had a mean weight of 1.76 pounds which is normal compared to the lake class mean of 2.00 pounds.  Back-calculated age data obtained from spine and scale samples indicated that captured walleye were either four or six years old with 2/3 being four years old.  Growth was normal compared to the statewide growth rate for the species.\n  The yellow perch gillnet catch (44.67/set) was down from the 1987 catch of 103.33/set but above the third quartile value (28.25/set) of the lake class.  Sampled yellow perch ranged from 5.0-8.4 inches with a median length group of 6.0-6.4 inches.  Sampled yellow perch had a mean weight of 0.09 pounds which is below the first quartile value of 0.10 pounds.  Back-calculated age data from scale samples indicated that captured yellow perch from four to seven years old and exhibited slow growth compared to the statewide growth rate for yellow perch.  The shoreline seine hauls sampled 150 young of the year yellow perch.\n  The white sucker gillnet catch (0.67/set) was up from the 1987 catch of 0.33/set but below the first quartile value (1.00/set) for the lake class median.  Sampled white suckers ranged from 17.0-21.9 inches with a mean length group of 17.1 - 17.9 inches.  The mean weight was 1.75 pounds which is normal compared to the lake class mean of 2.05 pounds.\n</p>",

Lakes in class 37 are typically shallow, small, and turbid with soft water. In order to assess the current fishery in Rock Lake, netting was conducted in September of 2012. <br> \n <br> \nBased on the gill net catch rate, both walleye and yellow perch numbers have dropped to their lowest level since their initial stocking.  Yellow perch were stocked following lake reclamation to provide forage for walleye. An over abundant perch population led to the stocking of northern pike in 1990. Although the pike catch rate decreased since the 2007 assessment, both numbers and quality are high enough to provide good angling opportunity.  Northerns averaged 26.5 inches and 4.25 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were not stocked after reclamation but a sustaining population was present by 1997.  The 2012 trapnet catch rate was the lowest since reclamation but still normal based on the lake class. Bluegill average size increased to 6 inches but few individuals reached the 7 inch mark.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker and golden shiners were also sampled during the assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake was chemically reclaimed in 1976 to establish a fishery that would provide fishing recreation for the campers and non-campers at the DNR Forestry campground.  It is managed primarily for walleye.  The stocking history since reclamation consisted of mainly walleye.  Yellow perch were stocked in 1980 for forage and female northern pike in 1990 to help decrease high yellow perch numbers that had developed since 1980.  Currently, the lake management plan calls for alternate year walleye stocking.Netting results from 1997 found the walleye abundance to be normal for this type of lake.  Lengths ranged between 6.9 to22.2 inches with an average length of 18.7 inches.  Walleye average weight was also normal at 2.3 pounds.Northern pike abundance was low, but the average weight was normal.  Lengths ranged from 18.2 to 29.7 inches with an average length of 22.1 inches.  Northern pike growth was average.For the first time since reclamation, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled in abundant numbers.  Bluegill abundance was average, while pumpkinseed numbers were high for this lake type.  The majority of the bluegills fell between 4.5 to 5.0 inches and most pumpkinseeds ranged between 4.0 to 5.0 inches.Yellow perch have been high in numbers since their introduction in 1980.  Currently, yellow perch numbers are normal for this type of lake.  Lengths ranged from 5.2 to 8.7 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches.Shoreline seining conducted as part of this survey showed successful reproduction for bluegill and yellow perch.Prepared by Audrey Posterick</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>ROCK LAKE IS A EXPERIMENTAL WALLEYE-PERCH LAKE LOCATED IN EASTERN PINE COUNTY. THE LAKE WAS RECLAIMED IN 1976 AND SUBSEQUENTLY STOCKED WITH WALLEYE FRY IN 1977 AND 1978. WALLEYE FINGERLING STOCKING WAS UNDERTAKEN IN 1981, 1982, AND 1986, WHILE YEARLING FISH WERE STOCKED IN 1987 AND 1989. ADULT YELLOW PERCH WERE STOCKED IN 1980 TO PROVIDE A PERMANENT FORAGE BASE. A POPULATION ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED IN SEPTEMBER OF 1989 TO OBTAIN INFORMATION REGARDING THE FISH POPULATIONS IN THE LAKE. SIX GILLNETS AND FOUR TRAPNETS WERE SET. SHORELINE SEINING WAS ALSO PERFORMED IN SEPTEMBER TO EVALUATE NATURAL FISH REPRODUCTION. THE WALLEYE NET CATCH SHOWED A REAL INCREASE FROM THE PREVIUOS SURVEY IN 1987, AND WAS ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 2.73/SET. THE 1989 GILLNET CATCH WAS THE HIGHEST RECORDED FOR TEST NETTING SINCE LAEK RECLAMATION IN 1976. THE TRAPNET CATCH WAS ALSO A RECORD HIGH AND ACCOUNTED FOR 35 OF THE 63 WALLEYES CAPTURED. THE INCREASE IN THE WALLEYE NET CATCHES CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE FINGERLING STOCKING IN 1986 AND THE YEARLING STOCKING IN 1987 76% OF THE WALLEYES SAMPLED AND AGED WERE FOUND TO BELONG TO THE AGE GROUP CORRESPONDING TO THE 1986 AND 1987 STOCKINGS. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRI- BUTION IN 1989 GILLENTS RANGED FROM 10.5 TO 24.9 INCHES WITH MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 13.0-13.9 IN. THE MEDIAN LENGTH REMAINED UNCHANGED FROM 1987. MEAN WEIGHT FOR GILLNETTED FISH WAS 1.25 PDS AND 0.97 PDS FOR ALL WALLEYES. THE RESPECTIVE MEAN WEIGHTS IN 1987 WERE 0.90 PDS AND 0.74 PDS. GROWTH RATES WERE VARIABLE FOR THE SIXTY-THREE WALLEYES AGED. NORMAL GROWTH RATES WERE EXHIBITED BY MOST AGE GROUPS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AGE GROUPS III AND VII. THESE AGE GROUPS DISPLAYED SLOW GROWTH RATES AND CORRESPOND TO FINGERLING STOCKINGS IN 1981 AND 1982. THESE YEAR CLASSES ARE REPRESENTED IN ALL SURVEY REPORTS DATING BACK TO 1983 BUT HAVE NOT CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTI- ALLY TO THE NET CATCH SINCE THAT TIME. COMPETI- TION FROM A VERY HIGH POPULATION OF YELLOW PERCH IS BELIEVED TO BE A LIKELY CAUSE OF THE POOR SURVIVAL OF 1981 AND 1982 FINGERLINGS AND THE SLOW GROWTH OF THE AGE GROUPS III AND VII. AGE GROUP VII DID EXPRESS AN INCREASED GROWTH RATE BETWEEN THE TIME OF LAST ANNULUS FORMATION AND CAPTURE IN 1989. AVERAGE LENGTH AT LAST ANNULUS FORMATION WAS ONLY 8.74 INCHES. AT THE TIME OF CAPTURE IN SEPTEMBER THESE FISH AVERAGED 12.4 INCHES IN LENGTH. A GENERAL OF THESE FISH WAS NOTED BY THE FIELD CREW. STOCK- ING OF LARGER YEARLING WALLEYES WAS IMPLEMENTED IN 1987 IN AN EFFORT TO ENHANCE SURVIVAL AND GROWTH OF WALLEYES IN THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE PERCH POPULATION. A LIMITED AMOUNT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION LIKELY OCCURS AND IS EVIDENCED BY SMALL NUMBERS OF FISH REPRESENTING AGE CLASSES FROM NON-STOCKING YEARS. THE YELLOW PERCH NET CATCH WAS ALSO AT A RECORD HIGH SINCE 1976, HOWEVER, DID NOT SHOW A REAL IN- CREASE SINCE THE PREVIOUS SURVEY WHEN THE CATCH WAS 103.33/SET. YELLOW PERCH NET CATCHES HAVE NOT SHOWN A REAL INCREASE OF DECREASE SINCE 1983 AND SEEM TO HAVE STABILIZED AT THE CURRENT HIGH LEVEL. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 5.0 TO 9.4 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 6.5- 6.9 INCHES. THE MEDIAN LENGTH HAD BEEN 6.0-6.4 INHCES FOR THREE PREVIOUS SURVEYS DATING BACK TO 1984. MEAN WEIGHT OF YELLOW PERCH HAS REMAINED CONSTANT BETWEEN 0.10 PDS AND 0.15 PDS SINCE 1982. SHORELINE SEINING INDICATED CONTINUED REPRO- DUCTIVE SUCCESS AS YOUNG-OF-YEAR WERE CAPTURED. TWO OTHER SPECIES OF FISH WERE PRESENT IN THE TEST NETS; WHITE SUCKER AND GOLDEN SHINER. THE WHITE SUCKER NET CATCH WAS THESAME AS IN THE PREVIOUS SURVEY AND BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 1.50/SET. WHITE SUCKER NET CATCHES HAVE INVARIABLY BEEN BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND THE FISH HAVE BEEN ABSENT FROM THE TEST NETS IN SEVERAL SURVEY RE- PORTS. THE GOLDEN SHINER TRAPNET CATCH WAS 2.00/ SET COMPARED TO 1.67/SET REPORTED IN THE 1987 SURVEY. THIS CATCH IS ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH OF 0.46/SET. GOLDEN SHINER TRAPNET CATCHES HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH SINCE 1980. A TOTAL OF EMERALD SHINERS WERE CAUGHT IN SHORE- LINE SEINE HAULS IN ADDITION TO THE YELLOW PERCH MENTIANED PREVIOUSLY.</p>",
