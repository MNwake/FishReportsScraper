                "narrative": "<p>Little Spirit is a 572 acre lake located in Jackson County, MN and Dickinson County, IA.  This class 42 lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for largemouth bass, black crappie, and yellow perch.  Walleyes are to be stocked by Minnesota DNR in alternating regimes of fry and fingerlings.  Little Spirit is unique in that it also connects via a grated culvert to Big Spirit Lake in Iowa which is managed by the IA DNR.  Since part of Little Spirit is in Iowa, the Iowa DNR stocked 21,420 fingerlings in June of 2001.  Little Spirit, along with the other Iowa Great Lakes, has had extensive shoreline development.  Water samples taken during the spring of 2001 had a pH reading of 9.11 which is indicative of a highly productive lake.  Not surprisingly, locals reported large mats of foul smelling algae that were decaying along the shoreline.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of July 23, 2001 and utilized five gillnets, twelve trapnets, four standard seine hauls, and fall night electrofishing.The catch rate of walleyes was higher than normal but down considerably from the last survey (1997).  Total lengths of walleyes in gillnets averaged around 16 inches.  Walleye growth in Little Spirit appeared to be average for the Windom Area.  During a fall electrofishing survey on September 11, 2001, phenomenal  numbers of Age 0 walleye were shocked near shore, possibly from the Iowa DNR fryling stocking.  If these walleyes survive the winter and avoid predation, this will likely be a strong year class in the near future.  Good sized walleyes are present in the system that could be caught by the avid angler.  Overall, the yellow perch population seemed to be little lower than normal or expected.  Since the Windom Area rarely documents abundant perch populations greater than 6 years old, it is possible these year classes were caught by anglers, died of old age, or winterkilled.  A report of dead fish (common carp) was noted on April 16, 2001 on the south side of the lake.  Total lengths of yellow perch in gillnets averaged 6.43 inches.  Since perch populations tend to be cyclical in the pothole prairie region, it may be another 2-3 years until the population fully returns.  Black crappie were higher than usual.  Excluding the survey in 1985, this was the highest catch rate of black crappie ever recorded on Little Spirit, and they averaged over 8  inches in length.  Growth rates were a little slower in 2001 than we had seen in previous surveys, however the catch rate was nearly twice as high.  The take home message is that crappie numbers are normal and they're  \"dandies\".The catch rate of largemouth bass by electrofishing was 102.67/hour.  Previous electrofishing surveys (1995 and 1997) documented catch rates of less than 10/hour.   However, all of the bass captured were from the 2001 year class and total length averaged just over 5 inches.  If this huge year class of Age 0 fish survives the winter and avoids being eaten, they will likely provide some excellent fishing in approximately 3 years.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Little Spirit Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy. A total of nineteen species of fish were captured during the survey of 2001.  Other species captured were bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, common carp, freshwater drum, golden shiner, white bass, brown bullhead, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, quillback, yellow bullhead, and spottail shiner.Prepared by: Ryan Doorenbos    </p>",

THE 1985 WAE CPUE WAS FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN THE 1990 CPUE.  GROWTH FOR WAE AGE 2-4 WAS WELL BELOW NORMAL WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER LOCAL POPULATIONS.  AGE FIVE AND GREATER FISH SHOWED NEAR AVERAGE GROWTH.  THE TRAP NET CPUE WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN. IT APPEARS FROM THE AGE-FREQUENCY THAT SOME WAE NATURAL REPRODUCTION HAS OCCURRED.  THE BLC TRAP NET OF 1.50 FISH PER NET WAS FOUR TIMES LESS THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE FROM THE 1985 SURVEY WHEN THE CATCH AVERAGED NEARLY 32 FISH PER NET.  GROWTH WAS NEAR AVERAGE FOR BLC IN THE WINDOM AREA.  THE NOP GILL NET CPUE WAS BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN, HOWEVER THE TRAP NET CATCH WAS DOUBLE THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR THAT GEAR.  NOP CATCH RATES IN 1990 WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE RECORDED IN 1985.  THE BLB TRAP NET CATCH OF 10.9 WAS WELL BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE WINDOM AREA.  THE 1990 CATCH WAS SIMILAR TO THE 1985 CATCH.  MOST OF THE BLB COLLECTED WERE SMALL, 4-5 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH. LITTLE SPIRIT LAKE HAS A LARGE POPUALTION OF BIB. THE GILL NET CATCH OF SIX FISH PER NET WAS SIX TIMES GREATER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  THE MAJORITY OF BIB CAPTURED IN GILL NETS WERE 15-16 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Spirit Lake is a 643-acre lake located on the Minnesota-Iowa border in Jackson County.  Little Spirit Lake has a history of experiencing varying levels of winterkill and summer kill conditions due to low dissolved oxygen in the winter and severe algae blooms in the summer.  Thus, Little Spirit Lake is aerated by the Jackson County Conservation League to reduce winterkill frequency and/or severity.  In terms of invasive species, Little Spirit Lake is on the frontline, as Bighead and Silver Carp were sampled in Big Spirit Lake, which is hydrologically connected to Little Spirit Lake.  Additionally, Zebra Mussels are established in East and West Lake Okoboji, which are in close proximity to Big and Little Spirit Lakes.  Since the late 2000's, the Minnesota DNR has taken the lead on stocking Little Spirit Lake to prevent overstocking.  It is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  A survey was conducted the week of June 14, 2016 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets. The Largemouth Bass population was not assessed in this survey.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 catch rate of 11.0 per gill net was the highest Walleye catch rate since 1997.  The catch rate exceeded the long term average of 8.3 per gill net, and exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 7.3 per gill net).  Walleye ranged in length from 8.2 to 25.7 inches and averaged 16.5 inches.  Mean length at age-3 was 17.3 inches, which is fast growth, likely a result of abundant forage.  Age-2 Walleye (2014 year class) and age-3 Walleye (2013 year class) accounted for 44 percent and 53 percent of the sample, respectively.  The 2013 year class corresponds to a fry stocking, but the 2014 year class does not, suggesting that the 2014 year class came from Big Spirit Lake or natural reproduction occurred.  A strong year class of age-0 Walleye was present during the 2015 fall electrofishing (fry stocked year), but were not sampled in the 2016 survey (now age-1).  The 2015 year class may not have been vulnerable to the gill net and thus not sampled, or they may have not survived through the winter.  Anglers reported good Walleye fishing during the spring of 2016.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were captured at a rate of 0.7 per trap net, which is below the long-term average of 7.3 per trap net and the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.4 to 15.1 per trap net).  Black Crappie ranged from 3.4 to 8.4 inches and averaged 6.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 2012 to 125.8 per gill net in 1997 and have averaged 23.0 per gill net since 1985.  The 2016 catch rate was 11.7 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 26.5 per gill net).  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5.4 to 10.2 inches and averaged 7.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers decline from 163.3 per gill net in 2012 to 13.3 per gill net in 2016. Lengths of Black bullheads ranged from 7.5 to 14.0 inches and averaged 11.7 inches.  The Shortnose Gar catch rate was 11.3 per gill net in 2016, similar to the 2012 catch rate of 13.0 per gill net.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Northern Pike, White Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, Bluegill, Green Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n</p>",

Little Spirit Lake has a history of experiencing varying levels of winterkill and summer kill conditions due to low dissolved oxygen in the winter and severe algae blooms in the summer.  Thus, Little Spirit Lake is aerated by the Jackson County Conservation League to reduce winterkill frequency and/or severity.  In terms of invasive species, Little Spirit Lake is on the frontline, as Bighead and Silver Carp were sampled in Big Spirit Lake, which is hydrologically connected to Little Spirit Lake.  Additionally, Zebra Mussels are established in East and West Lake Okoboji, which are in close proximity to Big and Little Spirit Lakes.  Since the late 2000's, the Minnesota DNR has taken the lead on stocking Little Spirit Lake to prevent overstocking.  It is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch. A natural reproduction evaluation using night electrofishing was conducted on September 28, 2016 to determine if natural reproduction occurred in 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 37.3 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that some degree of natural reproduction occurred or they came from Big Spirit Lake.  Little Spirit Lake is connected to Big Spirit Lake in Iowa, which allows passage by small fish, so Walleye fry or fingerlings may have migrated from Big Spirit Lake as well.  The age-0 Walleyes ranged in length from 4.5 to 7.9 inches and averaged 6.5 inches. <br> \n</p>",

The seine hauls captured 16 species of fish, including Bigmouth Buffalo (N=1,388), Black Bullhead (N=36), Black Crappie (N=446), Bluegill (N=54), Brown Bullhead (N=1), Common Carp (N=6), Fathead Minnow (N=5), Freshwater Drum (N=87), Gizzard Shad (N=16), Golden Shiner (N=11), Johnny Darter (N=9), Largemouth Bass (N=54), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=1), Spottail Shiner (N=139), Walleye (N=1), White Bass (N=8), and Yellow Perch (N=34).  Electrofishing captured 14 species of fish, including Bigmouth Buffalo (N=25), Black Bullhead (N=3), Black Crappie (N=4), Bluegill (N=311), Common Carp (N=4), Freshwater Drum (N=115), Golden Shiner (N=2),  Iowa Darter (N=1), Largemouth Bass (N=51), Shortnose Gar (N=1), Spottail Shiner (N=19), Yellow Bullhead (N=5) and Yellow Perch (N=7).  Natural reproduction exists for some species of fish in Little Spirit Lake, as young-of-the-year Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Gizzard Shad, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, White Bass and Yellow Perch were sampled.  Walleye were not stocked in 2020. This is the first time that Gizzard Shad were sampled in a Windom Area Fisheries lake.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of Little Spirit Lake.  The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and could be used to indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community. The IBI score on Little Spirit Lake was 28, below the impairment threshold of 36.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Spirit is a 572-acre lake located in Jackson County, MN and Dickinson County, IA.  Little Spirit has a watershed to lake ratio of only 6:1 that covers approximately 2,700 acres.  Well over 200 acres of that watershed has restorable wetlands that are currently being used for row cropping.  It is this high productivity that likely causes dense mats of algae and musty smell during mid-summer.  Big Spirit Lake in Iowa is connected to Little Spirit through a grated culvert that restricts immigration and emigration of fish.  With that said, muskellunge have been captured in Little Spirit, which were probably from an IA DNR Big Spirit muskie stocking.  A helixor aeration system has been running each winter since 1992.  In recent years (2004) during mid-summer, some summer kill has occurred concurrent with large algae blooms.  This class 42 lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet and is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for largemouth bass, black crappie, and yellow perch.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 6, 2008 using 3 gill nets and 11 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers rebounded slightly from the previous survey on Little Spirit.  The catch rate for walleye in gill nets was 5.0 fish/set in 2008 compared to 1.8 fish/set in 2004. Total lengths of walleye sampled ranged from 9.2 to 19.0 inches with a mean of 16.9 inches.  Only 2 years out of the last 8 years have walleye, either fry, small fingerling, or large fingerling, not been stocked in Little Spirit either by MN or IA DNR.  Some nice eater walleyes can be caught.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers have changed substantially since the 2004 survey.  The catch rate for black crappie in trap nets was 0.27 fish/set in 2008 compared to 14.2 fish/set in 2004. Black crappie population abundance can be variable as success of spawning is negatively influenced by wind.  The Windom Area lakes experience a great array of wind direction and speeds, which influence the variable populations.  I would suggest targeting yellow perch before black crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers appear to be on the rebound.  Yellow perch are likely filling the panfish niche in Little Spirit.  The average fish was around 5.8 inches long and needs a few years of growth to be worthy of a skillet.  Although most of the perch were small, the numbers will likely provide some good angling action.   <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch rate of black bullhead was 16 fish/set, which was within the expected range (9.6 to 91.4 fish/set).  Our data suggests that the black bullhead numbers are low but larger fish dominate the population.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were bluegill, common carp, freshwater drum, longnose gar, northern pike, shortnose gar, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Ryan Doorenbos   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Spirit is a shallow prairie lake connected to Big Spirit Lake on the Iowa border.  Little Spirit is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, yellow perch, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  The management plan also has a goal to reduce black bullhead numbers to less than 50 per trap net.Walleye fishing should be good for the next couple of years on Little Spirit.  Walleye numbers were almost four times higher than in 1993.  When compared to lakes similar to Little Spirit, walleye numbers were six times higher than the average lake.  Walleye ranged from 10.1 to 27.6 inches and averaged 15.1 inches.  At least 25% of the walleye sampled in 1997 came from natural reproduction.  Naturally produced fish are identified by aging the captured walleye.  If walleye were aged from years with no stocking, they were either produced naturally or migrated from Big Spirit Lake.  Even in years when walleye were stocked, natural reproduction may have contributed fish.The yellow perch population has really exploded in the last few years.  Yellow perch numbers were five times higher than they were in 1993 and eight times higher than lakes similar to Little Spirit.  Yellow perch ranged from 5.4 to 11.2 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  Yellow perch have experienced excellent reproduction from 1994 to 1996.  Little Spirit yellow perch have good growth, averaging 9.1 inches in three years.  Fishing for yellow perch should be good for the next few years.Little Spirit Lake has a very diverse fish community, possibly as a result of being connected to Big Spirit Lake.  Eighteen species of fish and two species of turtles were observed during the 1997 survey.  Many of these species had only one to 10 fish representing them.  According to our results from netting, the black crappie and northern pike populations appeared to be fairly low.   In addition, despite reports of fairly good largemouth bass fishing, the electrofishing results suggest the population is low as well.One species that is often over-looked by anglers is the black bullhead.  In 1997, the black bullhead population consisted of good numbers of large bullhead, which ranged from 5.1 to 14.3 inches and averaged 9.8 inches.  So if you enjoy bullhead fishing, Little Spirit may be just the lake for you.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Little Spirit through watershed management.  People sometimes associate water quality problems in a lake with land use practices in the watershed.  Although this can be a problem area, lakeshore property owners also contribute to water quality problems.  For example, putting in sand beaches, removing trees, poor septic systems, fertilizing lawns, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Improved land use practices by everyone should insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Spirit Lake is a 643-acre lake located on the Minnesota-Iowa border in Jackson County.  Little Spirit Lake has a history of experiencing varying levels of winterkill and summer kill conditions due to low dissolved oxygen in the winter and severe algae blooms in the summer.  Thus, Little Spirit Lake has an  aeration system sponsored by the Jackson County Conservation League in an effort to reduce winterkill frequency and/or severity.  Little Spirit Lake is on the front line of invasive species, as Bighead Carp, Silver Carp, and Zebra Mussels were sampled in Big Spirit Lake, which is hydrologically connected to Little Spirit Lake.  Since the late 2000's, the Minnesota DNR has taken the lead on stocking Little Spirit Lake to improve coordination between Iowa and Minnesota.  It is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  A survey was conducted the week of July 27, 2020 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets. The Largemouth Bass population was not assessed during this survey due to logistics of COVID 19 in the Spring of 2020..   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 Walleye catch rate of 19.0 per gill net is the second highest catch rate in survey history, exceeding the long term average of 9.4 per gill net and the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 7.3 per gill net).  Nine year classes of Walleye were sampled, including fish from the 2007, 2008, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 year classes.  The 2018 year class was the most abundant, accounting for 55 percent of the sample.  Four of the year classes sampled were from non-stocked years, which suggests that natural reproduction occurred or a significant amount of movement occurs from Big Spirit Lake which is stocked with varying Walleye stages (fry, frylings, and fingerlings) annually.  Walleye lengths ranged from 10.3 to 26.4 inches and averaged 15.8 inches.  Walleye grow fast in Little Spirit Lake as mean length at age-2 was 14.1 inches.  Anglers should have success on Little Spirit Lake given the abundant Walleye population comprised of harvestable sized fish.  The Walleye angling season is open year around on Little Spirit Lake to provide additional opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates in Little Spirit Lake have been variable, ranging from 0.3 per trap net in 1993 and 2008 to 32.0 per trap net in 1985.  In 2020, the Black Crappie catch rate was 9.9 per trap net, an increase from 0.7 per trap net in 2016 and greater than the long term average of 7.6 per trap net since 1985. The 2020 catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.4 to 15.1 per trap net).  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 5.2 to 12.9 inches and averaged 9.9 inches, with 50 percent of them being 10.0 inches or greater.  Good numbers of 10 inch plus crappies are present in Little Spirit Lake which should provide a good opportunity for crappie anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nSince 2001, Yellow Perch catch rates have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 2012 to 39.7 per gill net in 2008.  In 2020, the Yellow Perch catch rate was 3.0 per gill net, which is a decrease from the 2016 catch rate of 11.7 per gill net.  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 6.0 to 10.8 inches and averaged 9.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate in 2020 was 13.1 per trap net.  The Shortnose Gar catch rate increased from 11.3 per gill net in 2016 to 15.7 per gill net in 2020.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Largemouth Bass, Muskellunge, Northern Pike, White Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n</p>",

A 1993 Lake Survey showed good numbers of walleye compared to lakes similar to Little Spirit (Talcot).  Walleye lengths ranged from 6.4 to 22.9 inches with an average weight of 0.7 lbs.  The small average weight was because of the high number of age one and two fish.  Walleye is the primary species managed for in Little Spirit.Secondary species managed for in Little Spirit are bluegill, black crappie, northern pike and largemouth bass.  Adult largemouth bass were stocked in 1992. We have had some reports in 1993 of bass up to 3 lbs being caught by area anglers.  According to the 1993 Lake Survey black crappie, northern pike and bluegill numbers are low.Yellow perch numbers were very good according to our 1993 Survey.  Lengths ranged from 4.8 to 9.5 inches and had an average weight of about 1/4 lb.  Another species with good numbers is black bullhead.  Black bullhead numbers ranged from 6.2 to 12.3 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Spirit Lake is located in Jackson County Minnesota and Dickinson County Iowa, has surface area of 572 acres , and a maximum depth of 8 feet. This class 42 lake is primarily managed for walleye with largemouth bass , black crappie, and yellow perch as secondary species. Little Spirit is unique in that it is connected to Big Spirit in Iowa via a grated culvert which allows small fish to move back and forth. Big Spirit is extensively managed and stocked by the Iowa DNR. Little Spirit has had considerable shoreline development in the last decade with the number of cabins increasing by approximately 30 from 1993 to 2001. Little Spirit has had historical problems with low dissolved oxygen because of its high nutrient levels. A summerkill was reported in July of 2004 resulting in the loss of a few hundred fish of various species. In recent years, reports of dense foul smelling algae mats along the shoreline have become quite common. A winter aeration system is operated by a local conservation club. A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 26, 2004 with five gill nets and 12 trap nets.The walleye catch rate was within the normal range for lakes similar to Little Spirit. Walleye fry or fingerlings have been stocked three out of the last four years. Fingerlings will again be stocked in the fall of 2005. Lengths of walleye ranged from 7.3 to 16.9 inches. Three year classes were observed during the survey.The yellow perch catch rate was within the normal range and up from the previous assessment. The average yellow perch sampled was nearly ten inches long and weighed over half-a-pound. Four different age classes were found with most fish being 4 years old. Yellow perch populations tend to be cyclical in the prairie pothole region and it appears the perch in Little Spirit are on the rebound. There are plenty of very nice yellow perch available to take your bait.The black crappie catch rate was above average and at its  highest level since 1985. Lengths of black crappie ranged from 4.5 to 10.4 inches and averaged 5.6 inches. Three year classes were sampled during the assessment. The crappie population is dominated by age 1 fish. Age and growth evaluation shows exceptional growth rates for age 1 fish and may provide excellent black crappie fishing in the near future.Largemouth bass are usually net shy and are typically sampled by night electrofishing. Sampling showed some nice adult bass and plenty of small age 0 fish indicating natural reproduction is taking place. Anglers have reported catching some nice largemouth in the late spring months. Care should be taken with these fish as they may be partly responsible for controlling bullhead numbers in Little Spirit.Black bullhead catch rates have never been as low as in the 2004 assessment. Numbers and size structure of the black bullhead population are right where we like to see them. The averaged black bullhead caught in the trap nets measured an astounding 12.3 inches and weighed over a pound. Anglers looking for a premier bullhead fishery to soak your nightcrawlers on a warm spring evening should check out Little Spirit..A few bluegills were sampled during the assessment. Shortnose gar have always been present in Little Spirit and catch rates are down from a historic high in 2001. Channel catfish numbers continue to climb since first being sampled in 1997. Nearby Loon Lake has experienced a similar channel catfish scenario. Channel catfish likely entered Little Spirit through illegal stocking prior to 1997 or entered from Big Spirit as small fish and are now becoming established in the fish community. The carp catch rates have held steady since 1997 with the population made up of mostly larger fish. A single muskie was observed during electrofishing and probably entered the lake from Big Spirit as a fingerling. A few anglers have reported catching muskie in Little Spirit.Other species of fish sampled during the assessment include bigmouth buffalo, freshwater drum(sheepshead), golden shiner, orangespotted sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled. Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality. Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake. It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Little Spirit through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Philip Nasby </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nLittle Spirit Lake is one of the Windom Fish Management Area's border water lakes with the state of Iowa.  This 634-acre lake located just north of Spirit Lake Iowa is a class 43 lake that is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for largemouth bass, black crappie, and yellow perch.  Although muskellunge are not stocked in Little Spirit, the Iowa DNR does stock Big Spirit Lake regularly with muskellunge.  As there is a connection between Big Spirit and Little Spirit Lake, a small grate keeps larger fish from moving between the lakes.  However, when muskellunge are stocked in the spring in Iowa, the fish are small enough to make it through the grate.  As a result, MN DNR captures an occasional muskellunge during surveys.  Little Spirit is aerated by the Jackson County Conservation League.  Little Spirit does have a history of heavy algae blooms at times.  In fact algae blooms have caused partial summerkills in some years.  Since the last survey, both the IA DNR and Iowa commercial fisherman have captured both silver carp and bighead carp in the East Okoboji and Big Spirit Lakes.  In the fall of 2012, Iowa DNR found a juvenile zebra mussel in East Okoboji.  The probability exists that within 5-10 years, zebra mussels may show up in Little Spirit Lake due to the connectivity of waters or the high recreational use of among the Iowa Great Lakes and the lakes in the vicinity of the Iowa Great Lakes.  Due diligence by those recreational users will be important to prevent the spread of both Asian carp and zebra mussels.  The Little Spirit Watershed is small given the size of the lake.  It has a watershed-to-lake ratio of about 6:1.  Little Spirit is managed by both the Iowa and Minnesota DNR.  In the past few years, MN DNR has taken the lead on stocking of Little Spirit Lake to prevent double stockings of fish.  Both agencies have been working together to improve both the water quality and fishery.  A population assessment was conducted on 6-11-2012 using 3 gill nets, 11 trap nets, and standard boat electrofishing.  Near shore assessments to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was done using seines and back pack electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nAccording to our netting done in 2012, the walleye population is lower than desired.  Historically catch rates have ranged from 1.8-26.7 fish per set compared to the 3.4 fish per set in 2012.  This is based on our gill netting information which we believe does not accurately reflect the true walleye population in Little Spirit Lake.  Common carp, black bullhead, and shortnose gar have never been higher in abundance in Little Spirit Lake.  It is our belief that at the time of netting, our gill nets tended to fill up with these species which in part meant that the net was not actively catching walleye.  According to local reports on the lake, angling for walleye has been quite good.  It would appear that the walleye being caught should be good sized fish (>16 inches).  We are currently stocking walleye fry every other year and believe that fry is the best strategy for maintaining a good walleye population.   <br> \n <br> \nLARGEMOUTH BASS <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are a species of secondary management in Little Spirit Lake.  The CPUE for largemouth bass electrofishing was 9.3 bass per hour.  Although our catch rates have been higher, we did sample young-of-the-year (just hatched in spring) that were about 1 inch long during IBI sampling.  This would provide evidence of natural reproduction.  The largest year class of bass represented was the 2009 year class.  Some larger bass are present and anglers can be successful in catching them. <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie CPUE in trap nets was 5.9 fish per set which was within the normal catch rate range of 2.4 to 15.1 fish per set.  Historically, catch rates have ranged from 0.25-32.0 fish per set.  The long term average is 8.1 which indicates the population is down slightly.  However, total lengths of black crappie ranged from 6 to 12 inches and had a mean of 7.5 inches. Overall, the fish were in good condition and quite plump.  It is likely that an angler could catch some nice sized crappies. <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nSurprisingly, no yellow perch were sampled in trap nets or gill nets in 2012.  However during near shore with seines and backpack electrofishing sampling we caught 6 yellow perch of various sizes.  This would indicate that some natural reproduction had occurred in the past and a population exists.  Considering the connection between Big Spirit Lake and Little Spirit Lake, it would be reasonable to assume that yellow perch will come back successfully on their own from Big Spirit Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n  <br> \nAs mentioned previously, rough fish were abundant in Little Spirit during sampling in 2012.  Shortnose gar, common carp, and black bullhead all had the highest catch rate ever recorded.  The shortnose gar CPUE in gill nets was 13 per gill net.  Common carp CPUE was nearly 25 fish per set, which is nearly 7 times the upper normal catch rate range.  The black bullhead CPUE in gill nets was 163.3 fish per set, which was above the normal catch rate range of 9.6 to 91.4 fish per set.  As mentioned previously, we believe this high catch rate may have affected our gamefish catch in gill nets and thus our netting summary may not accurately reflect true gamefish population abundances.   <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Little Spirit Lake; we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity.  Any improvements in the watershed can have a positive impact on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Ryan Doorenbos <br> \n</p>",
