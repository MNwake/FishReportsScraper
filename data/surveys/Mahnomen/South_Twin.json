                "narrative": "<p>Located two miles south of the community of Nay-tah-waush, MN in southeastern Mahnomen County, South Twin Lake lies entirely within the White Earth Indian Reservation.  Resource management is a shared responsibility between the tribal natural resource department and the state of Minnesota.  The lake is situated near the southeastern boundary of the Wild Rice River watershed.  Water enters the lake from five small unnamed spring fed inlets.  The sole outlet along the lake's north shore is controlled by a concrete weir barring fish movement from downstream.  Water leaving South Twin flows to North Twin Lake where it exits as Twin Lake Creek.  On its course north to the Wild Rice River and eventually the Red River, Twin Lake Creek flows through Rice, Little Rice, Sargent and Peabody lakes.Fish stocking and removal records date back to 1920.  Since 1945, South Twin has been stocked 24 years with various ages of walleye, 14 years with northern pike, three years with largemouth bass and one year each with bluegill and black crappie.  Northern pike stocking was discontinued in 1978.  A planned program of walleye stocking calls for biennial fry stocking.South Twin is one of eight area lakes included in lake class 27.  Other area lakes in lake class 27 include Big Floyd, Big Toad, Cotton, Strawberry, Sallie, Melissa and Tulaby.  Fish communities associated with lake class 27 are dominated by northern pike, bluegill, and walleye but exhibit great species diversity.South Twin Lake has a history of five fish population assessments dating back to 1954.  The current walleye catch rate of 2.8/gill net is slightly below the first quartile of 3.3/set for lake class 27.  This represents the lowest recorded rate since the 1954 survey and mirrors the catch rate recorded in 1992.  Though test netting indicates sporadic years of successful natural reproduction, most strong year classes correspond with years of either fry or fingerling stocking.  Recent fry stocking has failed to establish successful year classes.  This may be due in part to competition and predation from an exploding yellow perch population.  In the face of an increasing perch population, walleye fingerling stocking may prove to be more appropriate for the near future.  Though present walleye numbers are down, the current mean weight of 3.3 lbs. and length of 20.5 in. are at record high levels.  The current size structure reflects an aging walleye population with 82% of the catch seven years and older and little recruitment by younger age classes.  Growth rates of walleye were near statewide averages with females growing predictably faster than males.  Historically, northern pike catch rates have displayed wide fluctuations both above and below the normal range.  Though within the normal range, the current northern pike catch rate of 4.0/gill net is the second lowest recorded for these waters.  The mean length of 24.7 in. and weight of 3.3 lbs. describes a quality pike population.  Growth rates appear to be normal.The current yellow perch catch rate of 55.4/gill net is well above the normal range and represents a historical high for these waters.  Seventy-one percent of the sample came from the 1995 year class.  The very abundant 1994 and 1995 yellow perch year classes may have suppressed expansion of both the walleye and bluegill populations through predation and competition.Like many area lakes, South Twin has experienced large fluctuations in bluegill abundance.  The current catch rate of 6.3/trap net falls near the bottom of the normal range and is the second lowest on record.  Historically, bluegill and yellow perch abundances have displayed an inverse relationship, suggesting a high degree of competition between these species.  Suppression of the bluegill population by yellow perch may improve the overall health of the bluegill population by reducing numbers and improving growth.  The mean weight of 0.1 lbs. and length of 4.9 in. describe a bluegill population dominated by a large 1995 year class (age 2).  Growth of bluegill were nearly 20% behind statewide averages.South Twin's white sucker population experienced a significant die-off during the first two weeks of August 1998.  Laboratory findings indicated elevated levels of the bacterium flexobactor columnaris on the fish's gills.  Colunaris outbreaks are not uncommon in the summer months as fish become increasingly stressed by high water temperatures and lowered oxygen levels.  This bacteria affects a few species of fish and hasn't been found to pose a human health risk.  Outbreaks are generally short in duration.Since 1954, lakeshore development around South Twin has increased nearly five fold.  Lake friendly land stewardship practices are necessary if water quality, healthy fish populations, and property values are to be maintained.  Such practices as proper building siting, removal of dilapidated shoreline buildings, shoreline plantings, minimal use of lawn fertilizers and herbidcides, and proper installation and maintenance of septic systems can do much to enhance shoreline aesthetics and reduce lake eutrophication.  One of the most important contributions an individual can make is to get involved with their lake association and local COLA.  The collective efforts made by these groups can yield big dividends for the property owner, the lake, and the watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Twin Lake is a 1,126-acre lake with a high level of fishing pressure and considerable shoreline development.  The lake supports a diverse and abundant fishery with warmwater species including Largemouth Bass and Bluegill, as well as coolwater species like Northern Pike and Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike remain abundant in South Twin Lake with most fish ranging in length from 15 to 22 inches.  Walleye catch has declined since 2010, with the average Walleye caught measuring 17.2 inches in length.  Since 2007,Yellow Perch numbers have declined considerably in South Twin, concurrent with an increase in Northern Pike numbers.  South Twin supports an abundant Bluegill population, however few fish larger than 8 inches were captured.  Black Crappie abundance increased significantly compared to past surveys, but most fish were less than eight inches long.  Largemouth Bass caught averaged 12.6 inches in length, but fish up to 20 inches long were captured.   <br> \n <br> \nSouth Twin Lake is included in the Sentinel Lakes monitoring program, a statewide effort to track future changes in Minnesota's Lakes.  To help protect the status of South Twin in the future, lakeshore and watershed property owners can apply land management practices such as exceeding setbacks for structures and septic systems, leaving buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shoreline, leaving vegetation stands intact, and not fertilizing lawns.  These efforts play a significant role in maintaining a hearty and diverse fishery. <br> \n</p>",

Largemouth bass numbers were over 10 times the state and local medians with most of the fish falling in the 4-6\" length range.  Many bluegill were reported but appear to be stunted with length ranging from 3-5\".  Northern pike numbers were slightly above average with local medians with many being around 1 lb. range.  Tullibee numbers were quite high with almost 8 fish per gillnet lift.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Twin Lake has a diverse fish community that consists of warmwater species like largemouth bass and bluegill, along with coolwater species like northern pike and walleye, and coldwater species like tullibee (cisco).  Despite what is perceived as an increase in angling pressure and increased shoreline development, the fishery in South Twin remains relatively good with strong populations of northern pike, walleye, bluegill, and largemouth bass.Northern pike are generally small, averaging just under 19 inches, but a good range of sizes up to 33 inches was found.  In 2002, there was an abundant number of pike from the 1999 year class.  These young fish should add angling opportunites in coming years.Walleye spawning habitat is limited in South Twin.  During the late 1990's, conditions appeared favorable for providing additional walleye angling by increasing stocking rates in this lake.  Walleye stocking rates were increased in 2000 to take advantage of the abundant yellow perch forage base and the decreased numbers of northern pike in the lake at that time.  Since then, test net catches of walleyes have increased but it is not clear whether the increases are due to stocking or if there may have been a successful year class of naturally-reproduced fish.  Either way, angling opportunities for this species have increased in South Twin in recent years.Bluegill catches were also up in 2002.  Trap nets averaged 84.4 bluegills per set which was well above the lake's historical average of 52.2 per set.  The bluegill population was relatively young with four-year-old fish comprising the bulk of the sample.  Some larger fish were present, however.Minnesota's Pollution Control Agency (PCA) classifies South Twin Lake as mesotrophic (a middle-aged lake).  Lakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging of the lake (eutrophication) by using land management practices including (1) exceeding setbacks for structures and septic systems, (2) leaving buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shoreline, (3) leaving vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail) intact, and (4) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The cisco (tullibee) population abundance is within the normal range for class 31 lakes as evidenced by a mean gillnet catch of 3.3 fish per net.  The narrow size range of sampled fish (12-17 inches) was conspicuous for its lack of young fish.  The average cisco in South Twin Lake weighed 2.1 pounds and was 16 inches maximum total length (MTL).Northern pike numbers have increased significantly since 1987.  Gillnet catches are not only higher than the third quartile for class #31 lakes (11.2/GN), but also higher than during any past survey.  The average size of gillnet-captured pike is 18.5 inches in length and 1.6 pounds in weight.  Two, three and four-year-old fish are all strongly represented in the sample.  Growth rates appear normal.  The abundance of young fish shows itself in the low PSD of 21 percent.  Fish as large as 36 inches MTL were caught and the RSD(30) is 3 percent.  Although northern pike were stocked frequently from 1950 through 1978, they have not been stocked since.  Obviously, natural reproduction has been high in recent years.Black and brown bullheads remain rare.  Yellow bullheads, however, have steadily increased since the initial survey in 1954.  The mean gillnet catch of yellow bullheads (17.8/GN) is double the third quartile for similar lakes while the trapnet catch (2.67/TN) is within the normal range.  The average catch of yellows for both gears is higher than during any previous survey.Bluegill abundance has fluctuated markedly in the past 40 years.  Currently, numbers are high (41.3/TN) but within the inter-quartile range for trapnets in class 31 lakes.  Size structure has decreased steadily and significantly from the apparently unexploited bluegill population of 1954.  (1) Proportional stock density (PSD) of the 1954 sample was 92 percent, while presently that measure of > 6 inch fish is only 32 percent.  (2) In 1954, the RSD(8) was 16 percent, while no bluegills longer than eight inches were captured in 1992.  Growth rates were listed as somewhat slower-than-normal in 1954, but, are currently even slower.  In fact, the present bluegill population could be considered stunted.Though difficult to sample reliably with nets, largemouth bass appear to be relatively abundant.  Trapnet catch rates (0.75/TN) are within the normal range and gillnet catch rates (2.1/GN) are above the third quartile for similar lakes.  Historically, trapnet samples have remained consistent since 1954 with one exception-an abnormally large catch (9.75/TN) of small bass in 1987.  More and larger fish were captured in gillnets than in trapnets.  Overall PSD is 30 percent, while RSD(15) is 4 percent.  Sampled largemouth bass ranged from 4-17 inches MTL.  Growth rates are average.As evidenced by trapnet catches, black crappie abundance has not changed significantly and is within the normal classification range at 0.75 fish per trapnet.  Growth is normal.  Fewer fish over 10 inches MTL were captured in 1992 than in several past surveys.Following a dramatic increase of northern pike in the early eighties, the yellow perch population crashed and has not yet recovered.  At 2.3 fish per gillnet set, numbers remain well below the normal range for class #31 lakes.  Before 1987, however, South Twin Lake's historical yellow perch catch averaged 24.4 fish/GN.The walleye population has undergone significant shifts in abundance during the past 40 years.  From the historically low catch of 1.7 fish/GN in 1954, it peaked at 14.8 fish/GN in 1974, then declined again to the present 2.9 fish/GN.  The 1992 mean gillnet catch is within the normal classification range for similar lakes.  Average weight of sampled walleyes tends to be inversely related to walleye abundance and the current low numbers of walleye averaged nearly two pounds.  A large proportion of stock length walleyes are \"keepers\" [PSD=77 percent; and RSD(20)=17 percent].  Growth rates are average.  Age analysis appears to indicate some successful natural reproduction has taken place, though not on a consistent basis.  In recent years, there is correlation between fingerling stocking and strong year classes.  Walleye spawning habitat is considered poor and abundant natural year classes are probably infrequent.  Walleye have been stocked regularly as both fry and fingerlings since the early part of the century.The present condition of South Twin Lake's fishery is a common one to many Minnesota lakes.  As northern pike numbers have increased, yellow perch numbers have decreased.  Additionally, specific interaction (probably with yellow perch or yellow bullheads) coupled with angling pressure has seemingly caused bluegill numbers to increase and bluegill growth rates to decrease.  Walleye stocking has probably played a part in the yellow perch decline though the relationship is not as clear-cut from these data as is the pike/perch relationship.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Twin Lake has a diverse fish community of warmwater species like largemouth bass and bluegill, coolwater species like northern pike and walleye, and coldwater species like tullibee (cisco).  Despite possible increases in angling pressure and increased shoreline development, the fishery in South Twin remains relatively good with strong populations of northern pike, walleye, panfish, and largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are generally small, averaging just under 19 inches, but a good range of sizes up to 35 inches are present.  In 2007, there was an abundant number of pike from the 2004 year class.  These young fish should provide good angling opportunites in coming years. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye spawning habitat is limited in South Twin.  During the late 1990's, conditions appeared favorable for providing additional walleye angling by increasing stocking rates in this lake.  Walleye stocking rates were increased in 2000 to take advantage of the abundant yellow perch forage base and the decreased numbers of northern pike in the lake at that time.  Since then, test net catches of yellow perch have declined substantialy along with an increase in walleye catches, which appears to be due to increased stocking.  Young walleyes were most common and should provide good angling in the near future. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills do not grow particularly fast in South Twin and it appears most are caught before reaching the age of six years.  Consequently, bluegills over eight inches in length are rare, but they can be found.  Black crappie net catches increased since 2002 and they were also generally young.  However, crappies tend to grow fairly rapidly in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota's Pollution Control Agency (PCA) classifies South Twin Lake as mesotrophic (a middle-aged lake).  Lakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging of the lake (eutrophication) by using land management practices including (1) exceeding setbacks for structures and septic systems, (2) leaving buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shoreline, (3) leaving vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail) intact, and (4) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition, South Twin was added to the list of Minnesota lakes included in the \"Sentinel Lakes\" program in 2008.  These lakes will receive additional testing for biological, physical, and chemical parameters in coming years in attempt to signal any trends in the state's lakes due to climate and other changes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Twin Lake has a diverse fish community of warmwater species like Largemouth Bass and Bluegill, coolwater species like Northern Pike and Walleye, and coldwater species like Tullibee (Cisco).  Despite possible increases in angling pressure and increased shoreline development, the fishery in South Twin remains relatively good with strong populations of Northern Pike, Walleye, panfish, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were generally young and small, averaging just under 19 inches, but a good range of sizes up to 32 inches were present.  In 2014, there was an abundant number of pike from the 2011 year class.  These young fish should provide good angling opportunites in coming years. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye spawning habitat is limited in South Twin.  During the late 1990's, conditions appeared favorable for providing additional Walleye angling by increasing stocking rates in this lake.  Walleye stocking rates were increased in 2000 and again in 2004 to take advantage of the abundant Yellow Perch forage base and the decreased numbers of Northern Pike in the lake at that time.  Since then, test net catches of Yellow Perch have declined substantialy along with an increase in Northern Pike catches.  In 2014, three to five-year-old Walleyes were most abundant and should provide good angling in the near future.  However, several older fish were also sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills grow slowly in South Twin and it appears most are caught before reaching the age of six years.  Consequently, Bluegills over eight inches in length are rare.  Black Crappie net catches increased since 2009 and crappies were also generally young.  However, crappies tend to grow fairly rapidly in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota's Pollution Control Agency (PCA) classifies South Twin Lake as mesotrophic (a middle-aged lake).  Lakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging of the lake (eutrophication) by using land management practices including (1) exceeding setbacks for structures and septic systems, (2) leaving buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shoreline, (3) leaving vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail) intact, and (4) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition, South Twin was added to the list of Minnesota lakes included in the \"Sentinel Lakes\" program in 2008.  These lakes will receive additional testing for biological, physical, and chemical parameters in coming years in attempt to signal any trends in the state's lakes due to climate and other changes.</p>",

Few walleyes are taken but they were large.  It was reported that twenty five to thirty years ago the lake had a reputation as a good walleye lake but has declined through the years.  The past eight to ten years panfish and largemouth have shown a marked increase and have produced fairly good and consistent fishing.  Fishing observed on South Twin was largely trolling and some still fishing for northern pike and walleyes, and still fishing for panfish, and a few fishermen bait casting for largemouth bass.</p>",
