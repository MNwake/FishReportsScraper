                "narrative": "<p>The northern pike gillnet catch was lower than past surveys with a rate of 2 per net.  This catch rate is considered low compared to other lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics. Northern size was typical of the lake class but a pound smaller than the 2001 average of 3.1 pounds.  The six northerns ranged in length from 16.9 to 27.2 inches with a 20.9 inch mean.   <br> \n <br> \nOne yellow perch was netted, yielding a catch rate of 0.3 per gillnet.  The rate was below the lake class norm and lower than past surveys catches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish were sampled at a normal level by the trap nets (13/net) after exceeding 31 per set in 2001.  Lengths ranged from 3.1 to 7.3 inches with an average of only 4.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance has historically been low.  Eighteen crappies were sampled during the survey, up from 2 in 2001.  While the crappie catch rate, 2/net, fell in the normal range, average size was below the 25th percentile for the lake class.  Black crappie ranged from 3.8 to 8.7 inches with a 6.6 inch average. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were electrofished May 15th.  Fifty six minutes of shocking sampled 44 bass, for a catch rate of 58.7 per hour.  Though down from the 2001 catch, the rate is still indicative of a moderately high bass population, especially considering the lakes low fertility.  Sampled bass ranged from 6.4 to 21.4 inches with a 12.6 inch and 1.2 pound average, a moderate increase compared to the 2001 average.  The 2001 year class dominated the catch, representing 25% of the sample.  Bass grew well, likely due to the susceptibility of the bluegill population to bass predation. <br> \n <br> \n        <br> \nCompared to the previous sample, overall fish abundance and quality has decreased on Lake Five.  The 2001 survey listed fishing pressure as moderate.  Angler harvest could easily impact the fishery due to the lakes small size, 42 acres <br> \n</p>",

This catch rate is considered normal compared to other lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics. Northerns were larger than normal for the lake class with an average weight of 3.1 pounds.  The fourteen northerns ranged in length from 17.6 to 31.6 inches with a 23.4 inch mean.  Yellow perch were caught at a rate of 7 per gillnet.  The catch rate was similar to the lake class norm and to past surveys with the exeption of 1982 when the catch was high.  Sampled yellow perch where small with a 6.7 inch average.  Bluegill sunfish were sampled at a record high by the trapnets (31.9/net).  This catch rate was still within the normal range.  Lengths ranged from 3.5 to 8.5 inches with a 6 inch average.  Twenty percent of the catch exceeded seven inches.  Black crappie have historically been in low abundance.  Only two crappies were sampled during the survey.Largemouth bass were electrofished in Lake Five for the first time on May 29, 2001.  Fifty four minutes of shocking sampled 76 bass yielding a catch rate of 84.6 per hour.  This is an impressive catch rate when compared to other lakes in northern Kanabec County especially considering the lakes low fertility.  Sampled bass ranged from 5 to 19 inches with an 11.3 inch and 0.9 pound average.</p>",

Bluegill were abundant in trap nets, with quality sized bluegill up to 9 inches present. However, growth is slow; 7 year old bluegills averaged less than 7 inches at capture. Crappie and bluegill average sizes could be easily impacted by increases in angler harvest.  <br> \n <br> \nSampling by night electrofishing in late May revealed good numbers of largemouth bass for a lake this size. The mean length was over 12 inches; one 19 inch bass was sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOnly 3 walleye were sampled in this survey, all from the 2009 stocking.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked from 2004-2009, but stocking was discontinued due to the lake's marginal capacity to support walleye.  <br> \n   <br> \nThe lake is bordered to the south and south west by a wildlife management area which includes an earthen public access with parking for five vehicles. The road leading to the access can be rough and is accessible only by snowmobile or ATV in winter. <br> \n </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Five (Bland Lake) is a 44-acre lake located in Kanabec County.  The lake is primarily suited for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Black Crappie. Bluegill and Yellow Perch are also present.  To assess fish populations, a survey was conducted using trap and gill nets in June 2023.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch was 6 fish, resulting in a catch rate of 2.0 fish per net.  This catch was below the long-term average of 3.3 fish per net.  The average length of pike in gill nets was 22.5 inches, while lengths ranged from 19.6 to 28.4 inches. Two pike were caught in trap nets and had an average length of 25.0 inches.  Four of the pike sampled in gill nets were aged, two were age-3 and two were age-4.   <br> \n <br> \nBased on the trap net catch of Black Crappie, the population appears high.  The catch rate was 4.5 per net, with a total catch of 36 fish.  The average size was 8.6 inches with lengths that ranged from 4.2 to 12.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets were used to evaluate Bluegill number and size.  The total catch was 97 for a catch rate of 12.1 per net.  This was the lowest catch and catch rate of the last four assessments, indicating population numbers have declined.  Bluegill sampled in trap nets ranged in length from 2.6 to 8.5 inches with most fish being 3 to 4 inches.  The average length was 5.0 inches in 2023, which compares to the average length of 5.6 inches in 2011.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were not targeted with electrofishing gear in this assessment, and only two were caught in nets, one in a gill net and one in a trap net.  The last time Largemouth Bass were targeted with electrofishing gear was in 2006.  At that time the population looked balanced with an even distribution of size classes up to 20 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the fishing on Lake Five for many species can be good.  There are good numbers of Black Crappie and average numbers of Bluegill, although Bluegill are relatively small at this time.  Northern Pike numbers are currently below the long-term average, but pike have a respectable average size.  Largemouth Bass are also present, although their current status is unknown.  <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",

THREE GILLNETS AND FOUR TRAPNETS WERE SET AND TWO SHORELINE STATIONS WERE SEINED.  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THESE EFFORTS THE STATUS OF THE FISH POPULATIONS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS SURVEYS AND TO LAKES OF THE SAME CLASSIFICATION STATEWIDE ARE DESCRIBED.  THE NOP NET CATCH (6.00/SET) WAS HIGHER THAN THE PREVIOUS SURVEY NET CATCH (4.33/ SET) AND WAS THE HIGHEST CATCH RECORDED FROM ALL SURVEYS DATING BACK TO 1963.  THE 1991 CATCH WAS ABOVE THE MEDIAN CATCH (5.00/SET) BUT BELOW THE THIRD QUARTILE (8.20/SET).  THE NOP CAPTURED RANGED FROM 14.0 TO 24.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 20.0-20.9 INCHES.  THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 1.96 POUNDS WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN WEIGHT FOR NOP OF THIS LAKE TYPE (1.99 POUNDS).  AGE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT CAPTURED FISH WERE FROM TWO TO SIX YEARS OLD.  AVERAGE BACK-CALCULATED LENGTHS FOR EACH AGE CLASS WERE TYPICAL OF NORMAL GROWTH RATES THROUGHOUT THE STATE.  ALL NOP CAPTURED WERE THE RESULT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION IN AND/OR AROUND LAKE FIVE. THE BLG NET CATCH (48.00/SET) WAS HIGHER THAN THE PREVIOUS SURVEY CATCH (22.50/SET).  THIS 1991 CATCH WAS ABOVE THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN CATCH (19.25/ SET) AND THIRD QUARTILE (39.37/SET).  THE BLGS RANGED FROM 3.0 TO 7.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 4.5-4.9 INCHES.  THE MEAN WEIGHT (0.10 POUNDS)  WAS AT THE FIRST QUARTILE WEIGHT FOR BLGS OF THIS LAKE TYPE.  AGE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT CAPTURED FISH WERE FROM TWO TO EIGHT YEARS OLD. AVERAGE BACK-CALCULATED LENGTHS FOR EACH AGE CLASS SHOWED SLOW GROWTH RATES FOR BLGS WHEN COMPARED TO STATEWIDE AVERAGES.   NATURAL REPRODUCTION  WAS EVIDENT FROM THE PRESENCE OF YOUNG-OF-YEAR, HOW- EVER, ONLY FOUR YOU WERE CAPTURED WHICH MAY BE SOME INDICATION OF A POOR 1991 YEAR-CLASS.</p>",
