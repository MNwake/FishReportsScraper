                "narrative": "<p>Minett-Krantz is a 10 acre reservoir created when a dam was constructed in 1988 as part of an Area II flood control project.  The impoundment has relatively clear water and abundant emergent and submergent vegetation.  The 2000 survey indicated muck as the dominant shoalwater substrate.  The lake is managed for bluegill as the primary species while northern pike and largemouth bass are managed secondarily.  Northern pike and black bullhead were collected during the initial survey in 1991 indicating these species were probably local residents of the Redwood River watershed prior to dam construction.The bluegill trapnet catch rate was 10.8 fish per net which was similar to other lakes like Minett-Krantz.  The bluegill catch rate was 11.5 in 1995.  Lengths of bluegill ranged from 3.8 to 9.4 inches with an average mean of 5.4 inches.  Three year classes of bluegill were sampled during the survey.  The population was dominated by age 1 fish (85% of the bluegill sampled).The northern pike trapnet catch rate was 0.6 in 2000 compared to 2.0 in 1995.  Lengths ranged from 18.9 to 20.8 inches with an average length of 19.9 inches.  Gillnets were not used during the Minett-Krantz survey because of it's small size and shape.  Year classes from 1997 and 1998 were collected during the survey.The largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 8.0 in 2000 compared to 4.0 fish per hour in 1995.  Lengths of largemouth bass collected electrofishing ranged from 11.2 to 17.6 inches with an average length of 14.1 inches.  Year classes from 1995, 1996, 1997, and 2000 were collected during the survey indicating some natural reproduction.The black bullhead trapnet catch rate of 35.2 was high compared to similar lakes.   Lengths ranged from 6.0 to 8.3 inches with an average length of 7.2 inches.  The black bullhead population was on the small side in 2000.  To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Minett-Krantz Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.            </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minett Krantz Reservoir was completed in 1988.  This impoundment covers 10-acres and is managed primarily for bluegill.Bluegill numbers are considered normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  Bluegill collected in our trapnets ranged in length from 3 to 8 inches with an average of 6 ? inches.  Bluegill have reproduced naturally since they were initially stocked in 1989 and appear to thrive in Minett Krantz Reservoir.     The reservoir also has good numbers of northern pike.  Pike ranged in length from 18 to 31 inches with an average of 23 inches.  On average, northern pike weighed 3 ? lbs.  Although pike were never officially stocked, this species also appears to fare well in Minett Krantz Reservoir.  Adult largemouth bass were stocked in 1993.  None of these fish were collected in our sampling gear in 1995; however, it appears they reproduced in 1993.  Presently, bass numbers are considered low.  On average, the bass were 13 inches in length and weighed approximately 1 ? lbs.  Currently, it is unclear whether or not largemouth bass have established themselves in Minett Krantz Reservoir.  The key to future success is to provide good numbers of larger bass the opportunity to reproduce.Bullhead numbers have increased since our last survey in 1991 and are currently considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Bullhead ranged in length from 4 to 11 inches with an average of approximately 7 inches.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Minett Krantz Reservoir through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",
