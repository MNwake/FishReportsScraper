                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 176-acre, class 43 lake located in Murray County approximately 4.5 miles north of the City of Currie. Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 8.5 feet and has a history of poor water quality (secchi depth=0.7 ft.), likely a result of a highly agricultural watershed.  An unknown sized culvert connects Fox Lake and Bloody Lake (although not visually apparent), as water has been observed draining west to east under the road during high water. Currently, Fox Lake is managed as a \"pike/perch\" fishery, with Yellow Perch being the primary management species, and Northern Pike and Black Crappie being the secondary management species.  Dissolved oxygen levels were less than 1.0 parts per million throughout much of the winter of 2022-2023, below the threshold of 2.0 ppm when fish begin to be stressed.  Additionally, windrows of dead fish were observed along the gravel road on the west side of Fox Lake when the ice came off in the spring.  A survey was conducted on May 15, 2023, using boat electrofishing to determine the extent of the winterkill on Fox Lake.  During the standard survey in 2020, 11 species of fish were sampled in Fox Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nNine species of fish were sampled in the 2023 winterkill check including Bigmouth Buffalo (20.0 per hour), Black Bullhead (8.0 per hour), Black Crappie (68.0 per hour), Channel Catfish (20.0 per hour), Common Carp (12.0 per hour), Fathead Minnow (3169.0 per hour), Spotfin Shiner (4.0 per hour), Walleye (4.0 per hour), and Yellow Perch (4.0 per hour).  Black Crappie and Channel Catfish are susceptible to low dissolved oxygen levels, so the presence of these species in the winterkill check indicates that it was a minor winterkill at Fox Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake, near the town of Currie, is a 174 acre lake with a maximum depth of 8.5 feet.  Winterkill frequency has been fairly high, as Fox Lake has been opened for liberalized fishing 17 times since 1950.  Currently Fox Lake is managed primarily for yellow perch and secondarily for black crappie.  The last fish stocking of yellow perch and black crappie adults was in 1988.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of July 8, 2002 using 2 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and 4 seine hauls.Yellow perch catch rates were higher in the previous survey (1996), however the catch rate in 2002 was within the expected range for this lake.  Most of the fish were smaller individuals in poor condition. Additionally, growth rates were less than desirable as Age 2 perch averaged just over 6  inches in length compared to Lake Sarah Age 2 perch averaging just over 8 inches.  It is likely the perch population could benefit from a northern pike stocking.  It is not likely that northern pike would reproduce in Fox Lake but would provide additional angling opportunities and improve the size structure of yellow perch.  The take home message is that perch numbers are where they should be, but sizes are less than desirable.The black crappie catch rate in trap nets was more than triple the normal range.  The average weight per fish was 0.09 pounds, which indicated most fish were small.  The average fish was just over 5 inches in length and was produced in 2001 (95%).  Crappies that were captured were quite \"plump\" which indicated they were healthy.  Growth rates were average as Age 1 fish were 5.5 inches and Age 2 fish were near 9 inches in length.  Crappie fishing in Fox Lake should provide some consistent action but may require a lot of sorting for a fish fry.Even though few bluegill were captured, oxygen levels have been high enough for some bluegills to survive.  It is also possible that these bluegills could be from a remnant population in Fox Lake that was not sampled in the previous survey (1996), or from Bloody Lake through a tile, or from an unauthorized stocking.Many small bigmouth buffalo and few adult buffalo were captured, which would indicate these fish immigrated from another source lake.  Most of them were likely Age 1 fish that could have come from Lake Shetek via Bloody Lake.Other species captured were black bullhead, common carp, brown bullhead, green sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, walleye, white crappie, yellow bullhead, fathead minnow, and johnny darters.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Fox Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Ryan Doorenbos         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox is a 174 acre lake located in Murray County with a maximum depth of approximately 9 feet.  Fox is connected to Shetek through Bloody Lake which may allow free movement of fish during certain times of the year.  The lake is managed primarily for yellow perch with black crappie managed as a secondary species.The yellow perch population is considered high compared to lakes similar to Fox.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5 to 9.5 inches and had an average length of about 6 inches.  The yellow perch population should provide excellent fishing opportunities in the following years.The black crappie population is in good shape compared to lakes similar to Fox.  Our survey results indicate a very balanced population.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 4 to 12.5 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches and average weight of 1/3 lb.The black bullhead population is made up of primarily large fish.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 4 to 12 inches and averaged about 9 inches.  The average weight of black bullhead was ? lb.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Fox Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 176-acre lake located in Murray County approximately 4.5 miles north of the City of Currie. Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 8.5 feet and has a history of poor water quality (secchi depth=0.7 ft.).  It is believed that there is some sort of connection between Fox Lake and Bloody Lake (although not visually apparent), as water has been observed draining west to east under the road during high water. Currently, Fox Lake is managed as a \"pike/perch\" fishery, with Yellow Perch being the primary management species, and Northern Pike and Black Crappie being the secondary management species. A survey was conducted during the week of July 6, 2020 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and eight trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2020 was 1.5 per gill net, which is the lowest catch rate recorded and is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Historically, catch rates have varied from 77.0 per gill net in 1996 to 1.5 per gill net in 2020 and have averaged 27.3 per gill net since 1996.  The three Yellow Perch that were sampled ranged in length from 7.2 to 8.8 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates in Fox Lake have ranged from 10.7 per trap net in 2014 to 54.8 per trap net in 2002.  The 2020 catch rate was 30.3 per trap net, which is near the long term average of 28.8 per trap net, and exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 3.8 to 11.1 inches and averaged 8.6 inches.  Fox Lake has a fishable population of Black Crappie that should provide a good angling opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Northern Pike have occurred in extremely low abundance, with the only one Northern Pike being sampled in the 1996 survey.  In 2020, four Northern Pike were sampled for a catch rate of 1.0 per gill net, below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 23.6 to 31.1 inches and averaged 27.6 inches.  Northern Pike adults and fingerlings were last stocked in 2016, due to several years of poor pike fingerling production.  While Northern Pike abundance is low, average size is quality for anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 Walleye catch rate was 3.5 per gill net, which indicates that there is a passable connection to Bloody Lake because Fox Lake is not stocked with Walleye.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 11.1 to 26.9 inches and averaged 20.5 inches. Channel Catfish were first sampled in Fox Lake in 2014.  In 2020, the Channel Catfish catch rate was 12.5 per gill net, a large increase from 0.5 per gill net in 2014.   Multiple year classes of Channel Catfish were present, as lengths ranged from 12.4 to 31.1 inches and averaged 20.0 inches.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Common Carp, White Crappie, and White Sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nFox Lake is a 176-acre lake located in Murray County approximately 4.5 miles north of the City of Currie. Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 8.5 feet and has poor water quality (secchi depth=1.2 ft.), likely a result of a highly agricultural watershed. Because of its shallowness and high biological oxygen demand (BOD), frequency of winterkill has been often, as it was opened for liberalized fishing 17 times since 1950. An \"Ice Eater\" aeration system was installed in the northwest corner of the lake in 2010 to help decrease the frequency and severity of winterkills. Since installation, winterkill on Fox Lake has been minimal. It is believed that there is some sort of connection between Fox Lake and Bloody Lake (although not visually apparent), as water was observed draining west to east under the road during high water in the spring of 2014; however, it is not known if this connection is passable by fish. Currently, Fox Lake is managed as a \"pike/perch\" fishery, with yellow perch being the primary management species, and northern pike and black crappie being the secondary management species. Northern pike fingerlings are stocked one out of three years, with recent stockings occurring in 2007 and 2010. A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 7, 2014 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and nine trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nSince the initial survey done in 1996, yellow perch catch rates have ranged from 14.5 per gill net in 2002 to 77.0 per gill net in 1996. In 2014, yellow perch were captured at a rate of 16.0 per gill net which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net). Yellow perch have not been stocked in the recent past, indicating that this population is able to sustain itself through natural reproduction. Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5.0 to 11.0 inches and averaged 6.5 inches. Yellow perch were plump, suggesting that a good forage base for yellow perch is available. Establishment of a top-level predator such as northern pike or walleye would help to increase the size structure of the yellow perch population, and provide an additional angling opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPPIE  <br> \nFox Lake has historically been known for its above average crappie angling which was a result of the strong 2001 year class. As a result of this year class, the catch rate of black crappie in 2002 was 76.4 per trap net. As this strong year class died off, it appears little to no reproduction occurred, as the 2014 catch rate fell to 2.1 per trap net. The 2014 catch rate of 2.1 per trap net is near the low end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net), indicating that it is a low abundance population in Fox Lake. Four crappies greater than 12.0 inches were sampled in trap nets, indicating that some spawning brood stock is still available in the lake. The other 15 crappies sampled were 4.5 to 5.5 inches long. Despite low population abundance, it appears that natural reproduction is occurring, as a near shore survey conducted during this survey sampled 517 young-of-the-year (YOY) black crappies in 10 seine hauls, which is indicative of a strong year class. If the strong 2014 year class is able to survive through the winter, expect good crappie angling in three to four years.  <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nZero northern pike were sample in the 2014 survey on Fox Lake. Historically, northern pike have occurred in extremely low abundance, with the only one northern pike being sampled in the 1996 survey. If a connection passable by fish existed between Bloody Lake and Fox Lake, one would expect a slightly more abundant northern pike population because Shetek Lake (connected to Bloody Lake) is stocked extensively with northern pike fingerlings. Stocking will continue to try to jump start the northern pike population in Fox Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \nDespite the lack of a top-level predator in Fox Lake, the black bullhead population has remained in check, being captured at rates of 51.5 per gill net and10.7 per trap net, which are within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes. Lengths of black bullhead in gill nets ranged from 4.8 to 10.9 inches, and in trap nets ranged from 4.6 to 12.3 inches and averaged 7.6 inches. Fox Lake should continue to provide a good angling opportunity for black bullheads.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nTwo channel catfish (5.6 and 23.5 inches) were sampled in the 2014 survey marking the first time that they have been documented in Fox Lake. If a passable connection exists, they could have moved from Bloody Lake into Fox Lake, or they were illegally introduced.  To avoid unintended introductions, anglers should be diligent about disposing of unused bait in the trash, and should report unpermitted movement of fish. <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth buffalo were captured at a rate of 1.0 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.2 to 1.04 per trap net). Bigmouth buffalo ranged in length from 16.8 to 25.3 inches and averaged 21.9 inches. Nearly 850 YOY bigmouth buffalo were sampled in the near shore survey, indicating that natural reproduction or immigration of YOY fish is occurring in Fox Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include brown bullhead, common carp, walleye (N=2), and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",
