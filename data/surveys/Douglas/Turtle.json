Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Turtle Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nTwelve species were collected during this survey, indicating a relatively simple nearshore fish community.  Only one species (Iowa Darter) was considered \"intolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Turtle Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike gillnet catches averaged 1.8 fish/net in 1994.   Gillnet catches have been highlyvariable in past surveys.   Catches averaged 5.3 fish/net in 1989, 18.0 fish/net in 1984, and 1.0fish/net in 1979.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physicalcharacteristics is 2.0 - 10.8 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1994 was 2.2 pounds. Approximately 64% of the fish captured were 21 inches in length or greater, however no fish exceeded28 inches in total length.  The low catch rate recorded in 1994 is likely a result of poor reproductivesuccess during low water years in the late 1980's and 1990.   Only age-1 and age-2 fish wererepresented in the gillnet catches.  Northern pike fry and adults were stocked in 1993 and 1994 tosupplement the northern pike population.  Daytime DC electrofishing yielded 16.0 largemouth bass perhour.  Many of the fish captured were large individuals.  Over one-half of the fish were 15 inches inlength or greater.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.9 pounds.  The size structure and age classdistribution of the population suggests erratic natural reproduction.  Daytime AC electrofishingyielded 48.5 fish per hour in 1989.  Bluegill trapnet catches averaged 10.1 fish/net.  Catches haveranged from 5.8 to 28.8 fish/trapnet in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  The normal range of meancatch rates from lakes with similar lakes is 3.5 - 57.1 fish/trapnet.  The bluegill population iscomprised mostly of small individuals.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds.  Present sizestructure is a function of the age class distribution of bluegill captured in trapnets.  Age-2 fishcomprised 99% of the catch.  Black crappie catches averaged 2.8 fish/trapnet.  Trapnet catches havebeen highly variable in past surveys; averaging 14.3 fish/net in 1989, 0.0 fish/net in 1984, and 39.8fish/net in 1979.  Variable trapnet catch rates are likely related to the formation of occasionalstrong year classes.  Age-3 fish comprised 92% of the fish captured in 1994.  These age-3 fish averaged9 inches in total length at time of capture.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.4 pounds.  Yellowperch catches averaged 56.3 fish/gillnet which exceeds the normal range of mean catch rates for similarlake types (2.0 - 22.3 fish/gillnet).    As with other species, yellow perch catches have also beenhighly variable in past surveys.  Gillnet catches averaged 0.3 fish/net in 1989, 76.3 fish/net in 1984,and 1.0 fish/net in 1979.  Size structure of the yellow perch population has remained constant in pastsurveys.  Most of the fish captured were between 5 and 8 inches in length.  Walleye gillnet catchesaveraged 3.3 fish/net in 1994. Previous catches have ranged from 0.0 to 1.0 fish/gillnet in surveysdating back to 1979.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.9 pounds.  Age-1 fish comprised 40% of thefish captured in gillnets.  These fish may have migrated from lakes Reno and Maple which alsoexperienced strong 1993 year classes.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake, located between Alexandria and Glenwood, can provide good fishing opportunities.  Water quality depends upon the season but can get quite poor during mid to late summer.  The secchi reading was 2.0 feet during the mid-summer survey.  Dense algae blooms are generally the culprit and can hinder swimming.  Turtle Lake consists of two distinctly different basins.  The western half is quite shallow with an abundance of emergent vegetation fringing the shore.  Submergent vegetation is prevalent throughout the entire half of the lake.  The eastern half is deeper with less aquatic vegetation present.A quality fishery exists on Turtle Lake.  Walleye catches of 5.5 fish/gillnet was the highest catch recorded.  The mean weight of the sampled fish was 2.3 pounds.  The mean length was 18.8 inches with a 25 incher being sampled.  These fish can be caught on the eastern half of the lake trolling subtle structure changes.  Ice anglers have reported good success catching these fish as well.Northern pike are extremely abundant but run on the small side.  The catch rate was 20.3 fish/net.  The average length of these fish is 20 inches.  Anglers catch these fish almost anywhere on the lake with all types of tackle.  This would be a great lake to introduce youngsters or novice anglers to fast action pike fishing.Bass fishing can be good.  Although numbers are relatively low (electrofishing catch rate of 32 fish/hour) there are some quality fish present.  The mean length of the sampled fish was 14.8 inches with the largest fish measuring 18.6 inches.  The west half offers classic bass structure but the east half offers deep water opportunities.Panfishing can be good as well.  Bluegill numbers are not high but they can still be found.  Catch rates were 14.1 fish/trapnet.  The sampled fish averaged 6 inches with the biggest fish going just over 8 inches.  Black crappie numbers are relatively high with a catch of 25.4 fish/trapnet.  The mean length was 8.6 inches and the largest fish measured 11.6 inches.  Look for these fish on the weedline between the basins or on the east end during the winter.Turtle Lake may be of interest to carp bow-fishermen.  There are good numbers present and these fish can be approached.  The shallows on the west side can be good but don't overlook open water on the east side when the cottonwood  \"cotton\" falls on thelake. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake is a shallow, productive basin located in southern Douglas County.  Consisting of two large bays, average depth is only 7.0 feet and aquatic vegetation is common.  Water clarity was approximately 13.0 feet at the time of the July survey.  A concrete boat launch is located in the southwest corner of Turtle Lake just off Douglas County Road 88 SW.  \n\nTurtle Lake supports an abundant Walleye population (10.7/gill net).  Average size was 14.8 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Despite a moderate average size, approximately 25% of the population currently exceeds 18.0 inches.  Rapid growth rates allow smaller individuals to reach desirable lengths quickly.  Two- and five-year-olds were the most common.  Alternate year fingerling and yearling stocking efforts appear to be creating a productive fishery.   \n\nNorthern Pike catch rates (2.3/gill net) were slightly below the statewide average of similar lakes (4.7/gill net).  Approximately 50% of Northern Pike were between 14.0 and 21.0 inches.  The largest individual was 28.6 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to take advantage of the liberalized pike harvest regulation (anglers are able to keep up to 10 pike with no more than two fish longer than 26 inches; all fish from 22-26 inches must be released).  Largemouth Bass are common (69.3 bass/hour of electrofishing).  Average length was 7.8 inches, but large bass are present.  Maximum length was 19.8 inches.  On average, it took 5.3 years for bass to reach 12.0 inches.  Bluegill abundance was high (48.1/trap net).  Over 65% of individuals were between 6.0 and 8.0 inches.  The largest individual was 8.3 inches.  High densities appear to be limiting growth and total length.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the abundant, moderately-sized Bluegill (6.0-8.0 inches).  Reduced densities would allow some individuals to grow larger.  Black Crappie were abundant, but most were not large enough to contribute to the fishery (average length was 7.1 inches).  Low average size is related to the strong one- and two-year-old year classes.  A remnant of the strong 2014 year class will provide the opportunity for some larger crappies.  Maximum size of crappie in 2021 was 11.4 inches.  Yellow Perch were common (9.3/gill net), but average size was modest.  Over 95% of all perch were between 5.0 and 8.0 inches.  \n\nOther species recorded in the 2021 lake survey included Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed and Yellow bullhead.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2027.  \n\nTurtle Lake is designated as infested with zebra mussels.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to other lakes.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake appears to have a large Black Crappie population; however catch rates have declined significantly in response to fluctuations in year class strength. Trap net catch rates have declined from 158.8 fish/net in the 1963 assessment and 16.4 fish/net in 1989. PSD values have been quite variable in response to variable year class strength. Average weight has not increased in response to an apparent decrease in relative abundance. Northern Pike abundance has also declined. Surveys conducted in 1963 and 1984 yielded gill net catches of 11.8 and 18.0 fish/net. Netting efforts in 1989 yielded 5.3 fish/set. The decline in numbers has not resulted in an increase in average size. Mean weight was calculated at 2.16 lbs/fish. Population structure indices have remained relatively stable. PSD values have ranged from 30.0 - 40.0 percent. Bluegill catches also declined; however, PSD has increased to 87.0 percent. Mean weight was 0.30 lbs. Growth is very good. Age 4 fish averaged 7.3 inches in total length. The quality of the Bluegill fishery is probably attributable to the abundant Largemouth Bass population. Electrofishing gear was used to evaluate the Largemouth Bass population. Sixty Largemouth Bass were captured per hour of electrofishing. This catch rate would indicate an abundant bass population. Growth rates have been variable but generally good. Fish attained 15.0 inches in length in their fifth growing season. Walleye were sampled in the 1963 and 1984 assessments, but were not recorded in 1989. Bullhead and carp are present, but do not appear to be a problem at this time.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake is a shallow 218-acre, productive basin located in southern Douglas County.  Basin structure is somewhat unique in that the western half of the lake is very shallow with depths of five feet or less.  The deeper portion of the lake is located in the eastern half of the lake, where maximum depth approaches 21.0 feet.  Aquatic vegetation is common in the western basin and is present around the eastern shoreline.  Water transparency at time of the mid-July survey was measured at 5.5 feet. <br> \n <br> \nTurtle Lake is now designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels, which were first confirmed in 2013.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.  For more information regarding aquatic invasive species in Minnesota see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html  <br> \n <br> \nA standardized fish community assessment was completed on Turtle Lake, July 13-17, 2015.  A combination of six gill nets and nine trap nets were used.  An electrofishing survey was completed on June 5, 2015 to assess abundance and size structure of the Largemouth Bass population.   <br> \n <br> \nTurtle Lake supports an abundant Walleye population.  Gill net catches averaged 15.0-Walleyes/net.  Average size of captures was 14.7 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Most captures were young fish (less than five-years-old).  Walleyes grow fast in Turtle Lake.  Many four-year-old fish were sampled in the 2015 survey and should approach 18.0 inches in 2016.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike remain abundant in Turtle Lake.  Gill net catches averaged 7.5-fish/net.  Average length of pike captures was 21.2 inches.  The largest individual caught measured 26.9 inches.  Due to high numbers of small Northern Pike, anglers are encouraged to harvest these fish to reduce densities.  Increased harvest of small pike would provide potential benefits to growth rates and size of pike, and increase survival of young Walleyes stocked into Turtle Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nTurtle Lake supports a fair to good Largemouth Bass fishery.  An electrofishing catch rate of 32.8 bass/hour of effort describes a modest population density.  Total lengths of electrofishing captures ranged from 3.5 to 17.3 inches and averaged 10.6 inches.  Eight of 66 captures were 15.0 inches or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches were much higher than anticipated in response to greater recruitment of young Bluegills into the population since 2010.  The high proportion of young Bluegills in the population was evident in the modest average size of the trap net catch (5.8 inches).  Bluegill growth is rapid, so fishing quality should improve as the population ages.  The faster growing individuals produced in 2010 should exceed 8.0 inches in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nTurtle Lake continues to support an elevated abundance of Black Crappie.  The 2015 trap net catch was composed of six age groups (ages 1-6).  Average length of crappies captured with trap nets was 8.3 inches.  Length of all captures ranged from 3.5 to 13.2 inches.  Growth was rapid in Turtle Lake.  Young crappies from two large year classes (2011 and 2013) will quickly grow into desirable sizes.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch also proved to be abundant at time of the 2015 survey.  Most perch captures were between 5.0 and 8.0 inches in length.  Yellow Perch constitute an important prey base for predators in Turtle Lake, but few grow large enough to harvest.  Only one 10.0-inch perch was recorded in the gill net catch.  <br> \n <br> \nA concrete boat launch is located in the southwest corner of Turtle Lake just off of Douglas County Road 88 SW.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of nearshore fish species was conducted on August 4, 2016 by IBI Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 4 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 4 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 2 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 11 species of fish including 1 species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and 1 that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2015 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for Turtle Lake is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and is indicative of a healthy fish community.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Turtle Lake is located in the Chippewa River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

Each Yellow Perch are very abundant and provide ample forage for predator fish. Relative abundance of Black Crappies have declined significantly from 40  fish/trap net in the 1979 survey to 20 fish/trap net in 1984, but is still well above state and local medians. The PSD of Black Crappies was very low in 1979 and was very high in the 1984 survey. This indicates a shift to a higher quality crappie fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake, located between Alexandria and Glenwood, can provide good fishing opportunities.  Water quality depends upon the season but the lake is susceptible to dense algal blooms during summer months.  Secchi clarity was 4.5 feet during the 2005 survey.  Turtle Lake consists of two distinctly different basins.  The western half is quite shallow with an abundance of emergent vegetation fringing the shoreline.  Submergent vegetation is prevalent throughout this half of the lake.  The eastern half is deeper with less aquatic vegetation present.A quality fishery exists on Turtle Lake.  Walleye catches averaged 2.0 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of sampled fish was 2.1 pounds.  Mean length of sampled walleye was 17.9 inches.  The largest fish measured 23.7 inches in length.Northern pike are abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 8.2 fish/net in 2005.  Sampled fish averaged 19.6 inches in length.  The largest fish measured 26.6 inches.  Mean weight of sampled fish was 1.5 pounds.Largemouth bass are abundant.  Electrofishing catches averaged 62.1 fish/hour in 2005.  Mean length of sampled fish was 14.3 inches in length.  The largest fish measured 18.6 inches.  Over 36% of captured fish exceeded 15.0 inches.Bluegill catch rates averaged 8.0 fish/trapnet.  Sampled fish averaged 7.1 inches in length.  The largest fish measured 10.2 inches.  Growth rates are very good.  Age-5 fish averaged 7.6 inches in length.Black crappie relative abundance declined.  Catch rates averaged 3.8 fish/trapnet in 2005.  Mean length of captured fish was 9.8 inches.  The largest fish measured 11.6 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake is 220 acre, shallow ice block basin located between Alexandria and Glenwood, west of State Highway 29 and Maple Lake.    Maximum depth is 19.0 ft.  This deeper water area exists in the eastern portion of the basin.  The western half of the lake is less than 5.0 ft deep.  This shallow portion of the lake supports much of the lake's emergent and submergent vegetation.  Water clarity can vary greatly during summer months in response to algae blooms or wind and wave induced re-suspension of sediments. <br> \n  <br> \nTurtle Lake is a fertile basin and despite seasonal water quality shortcomings, it can support a relatively high standing stock of gamefishes.   Most fishing pressure is directed at walleye and black crappie.  Fishing success and average sizes of these popular gamefishes can be annually inconsistent due to irregular recruitment of young fish into the fishery.  In the near term, 2010 fish survey statistics describe potential for very good fishing. <br> \n  <br> \nA record-high walleye catch of 15.7 fish/gillnet occurred in 2010.  Over 37% of captured fish exceeded 15.0 inches.  Two- and five-year-old walleye comprised 96% of total captures from gillnets.  A very strong 2008 year class was likely resultant from natural reproduction.  Average length of sampled walleye was 15.3 inches.  Northern pike are abundant but average size is small.  Most pike captured were between 15.0 and 25.0 inches in length.  Largemouth bass are also abundant, but the population is largely comprised of young fish.  Only 25% of the total bass catch exceeded 15.0 inches.  Black crappie numbers have increased in response to strong year classes established in 2007 and 2008.  Cohorts of the 2007 year class should reach 9.0 inches in 2011.   Bluegill are present in moderate numbers.  Most of the fish captured were between 5.0 and 7.0 inches in length, but a few 8.0-inches and larger bluegill were measured. <br> \n</p>",
