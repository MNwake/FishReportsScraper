                "narrative": "<p>     West Lost Lake is a 723-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately seven miles north of Underwood, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural and marsh land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  West Lost Lake is part of the Otter Tail River chain of lakes.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the east shoreline while the outlet is located along the north shoreline. The maximum depth is 16 feet with 96% of the lake 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 7.3 miles and the secchi disk reading was 9.5 feet. <br> \n     A DNR owned public access is located on the east shoreline. Three active resorts are located on the lake.  A large majority of the shoreline remains undeveloped.  The dominant shoreline substrates are sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and common cattail are scattered along the shoreline of the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern pike, Largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.      <br> \n     A special gillnetting assessment was conducted to analyze the Northern Pike and Walleye populations.  A spring trapnetting assessment was conducted to analyze the Bluegill population. <br> \n     Age data from recent surveys indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good at a high level.  As a result, Northern Pike abundance has historically been high which has been accompanied by corresponding poor size structure.  Pike ranged in length from 10.8 to 28.0 inches with an average length and weight of 19.8 inches.  Pike attain an average length of 22.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance is low which is consistent with previous surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 15.9 to 20.4 inches with a mean length 19.3 inches.      <br> \n     Data from the special spring trapnetting assessment indicated that an abundant Bluegill population with an excellent size structure exists.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Seventy- four percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.5 inches at age-V. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of Bluegill fishing in West Lost Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller and medium sized fish for eating.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Lost Lake is a 723-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County.  The maximum depth is 16 feet with 96% of the lake 15 feet or less in depth.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  West Lost Lake is part of the Otter Tail River chain of lakes.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the east shoreline while the outlet is located along the north shoreline.  The shoreline length is 7.3 miles and the secchi disk reading for this survey was 9.5 feet.  West Lost Lake is included in class 39 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.  A county owned public access is located on the east shoreline.      The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  There are three resorts located on the lake.  Lakeshore development has been shown to negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient levels and shoreline erosion.  This can result in increased plankton/algae blooms, aquatic plant growth and suspended sediments, all of which can lead to decreased water clarity.  By using best management practices (BMP's) and \"lakescaping concepts\", impacts of shoreline development and erosion can be minimized.  Contact any county extension office for information on BMP's and your local DNR-Fisheries office for more information on lakescaping techniques.     The dominant shoreline substrates are sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail are prevalent in many areas throughout the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     West Lost Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the lake.       Northern pike abundance is within the normal range for class 39 lakes.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 16.8 to 35.4 inches with an average length and weight of 22.1 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 19.3 inches at four years of age.     The bluegill population is abundant and possesses a very good size structure present.  Fifty-seven percent of the bluegill from a spring assessment were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegill attain an average length of 7.8 inches at six years of age.      Numerous year classes of largemouth bass and black crappie were sampled, indicating that these species have suitable spawning habitat available to maintain good populations present in West Lost Lake.  Bass ranged in length from 5.6 to 18.7 inches while crappies ranged in length from 4.4 to 10.7 inches.     Walleye abundance has remained stable in recent surveys and is within the normal range for class 39 lakes.  Natural reproduction and supplemental stockings of fry have contributed to the walleye population.  Walleye ranged in length from 15.0 to 23.9 inches with an average length and weight of 19.1 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Walleye fry are stocked on a biennial basis in West Lost Lake.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.6 inches at four years of age.     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in West Lost Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     West Lost Lake is a 723-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately seven miles north of Underwood, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural and marsh land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  West Lost Lake is part of the Otter Tail River chain of lakes.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the east shoreline while the outlet is located along the north shoreline. The maximum depth is 16 feet with 96% of the lake 15 feet or less in depth.   <br> \n     A DNR owned public access is located on the east shoreline. Three active resorts are located on the lake.  A large majority of the shoreline remains undeveloped.  The dominant shoreline substrates are sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and common cattail are scattered along the shoreline of the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern pike, Largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.      <br> \n     A reduced daily bag limit regulation for sunfish (10 per day) was implemented in 2021.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain the quality of the Bluegill size structure.  A special spring trapnetting survey was conducted to collect baseline data on the Bluegill population, which will be used for regulation evaluation purposes in future surveys.  The Bluegill population is very abundant and has a high quality size structure.  Seventy-four percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length, while 29% was 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegill growth rates are fast with an average length of 8.0 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain or improve the quality of fishing in West Lost Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller and medium sized fish for eating.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n     West Lost Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2017.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Northern pike abundance, as measured by catch per gill net, has remained the same, 4.0 per gill lift during the last three surveys.  The average weight has declined from 3.0 lbs. in 1969 and 1982, to 1.3 lbs.  Age data indicated consistent pike reproduction with ages II+, III+, and IV+ represented in the sample.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased from 3.5 per trap net lift in the 1982 survey to 16.5 per trap net lift, but remains below the area median. This increase in abundance has not yet correlated with a decline in the average size as 73% of the bluegills measured were greater than 7.0 inches in length.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance declined from 14.5 per gill net lift in 1982 to 8.0 per gill net lift, which is about half the area median.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance increased from 2.0 per gill net lift in 1982 to 8.0 per gill net lift.  The average weight of walleye has declined from 2.6 lbs. in 1982 to 1.0 lbs. Age data indicate walleye natural reproduction is occurring as fish aged II+ and IV+ were sampled, which correspond to skip years in the stocking sequence. Walleye natural reproduction is most likely occurring in the Otter Tail River. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in West Lost Lake was conducted on July 13, 2017 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 14 sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at six stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net data from an August 2005 survey and gill net data from a June 2015 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates West Lost Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
