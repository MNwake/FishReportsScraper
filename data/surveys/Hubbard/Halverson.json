Mean weight of individual northern pike was 3.62 pounds.  The size structure (PSD=67, RSD-P=17) indicates high numbers of quality-length and preferred-length fish; however, no northern pike sampled were >30 inches.  Mean northern pike length at age 4 is 17.78 inches.  No large prey are available in East Halverson Lake and their absence is the limiting factor of northern pike growth.  Northern pike age analysis suggests consistently low annual recruitment.Trapnet catches of pumpkinseed and black crappie were well above the third quartile for lakes in Class 21.  These high density populations have very small size structures (pumpkinseed PSD=0, black crappie PSD=2).  Similar to northern pike, slow growth rates cause the poor size structures.  Black crappie average 5.62 inches at age 4.Golden shiner and black bullhead trapnet catch rates were also above the third quartile for Lake Class 21.  These two species have small size structures similar to the high density pumpkinseed and black crappie populations.  The one white sucker sampled was enough to place gillnet catch rates within the normal ranges of this species.</p>",

There is a primitive DNR Forestry campground with an unimproved earth ramp located on the southeast shore of the lake.  Due to its small size and low fertility, East Halverson is very susceptible to over-harvest.  Anglers must practice selective harvest it they want to improve the fishery in East Halverson.The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into  43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  East Halverson is in lake class 21.  Other area lakes in this same classification include McCarty, Robertson, and Twenty.East Halverson provides fishing opportunities for northern pike and black crappie.  Northern pike abundance (7.5 pike/gillnet) was at the high range when compared to other class 21 lakes.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.3 inches and 2.6 lbs,  with pike measured up to 31.8 inches.  Northern pike growth was slow when compared to other area lakes.   A low forage base may be limiting northern pike growth.  East Halverson has an abundant black crappie population, however, crappie run small in size with few fish over 8.0 inches.  The black crappie population in East Halverson is limited by slow growth rates.Other species sampled included pumpkinseed, black bullhead, and golden shiner.  High numbers of pumpkinseed and black bullhead are present in the lake, however, they are generally not an acceptable size for angling.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Halverson Lake is a small 21 acre lake located within the Paul Bunyan State Forest in northern Hubbard County.  There is an undeveloped access with an earthen ramp located on the southeast shore of the lake.  Due to its small size and low fertility, Halverson is very susceptible to over-harvest from angling.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest if they want to maintain or improve the fishery in Halverson.   Halverson provides fishing opportunities for Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Pumpkinseed.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Halverson is in lake class 21, one of four in the Park Rapids management area.  Class 21 lakes have the characteristics of being small bodies of water, with a high littoral zone (water depth less than 15 feet deep), and very soft water.  Other class 21 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include McCarty, Robertson, and Twenty. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish species composition in Halverson has been increasing over time.  The initial survey in 1974 only sampled Northern Pike and Pumpkinseed, while recent surveys have sampled Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass populations.  Halverson supports a moderate Northern Pike population composed of small to medium sized fish. Sampled Northern Pike had an average length of 24.0 inches with pike measured up to 32.9 inches.  Present and past surveys have shown that Black Crappie abundance fluctuates from moderate to high numbers and a population dominated by small sized fish.  Anglers will find Black Crappie up to 9.0 inches with low numbers of fish above that size.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed were sampled in moderate numbers with fish in the 6-7 inch size range.  Largemouth Bass were sampled in moderate numbers, however size of fish was small.  Largemouth Bass up to 12.1 inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Halverson.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
