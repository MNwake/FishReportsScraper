                "narrative": "<p>The July 15, 2013 lake survey was the initial data collection of lake characteristics on Weapon Lake.  Prior to the lake survey a hiking trail (approximately 0.4 mile) was cut across U.S. Forest Service land from U.S. Forest Service Road #369 to the east shore of the lake.  This route crosses three tributaries and Arrowhead Creek, although Arrowhead Creek was dry below the beaver dam on the east shore of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWeapon Lake is 6.5 acres, had a maximum depth in 6.5 feet of clear water with a Secchi disk visible to the bottom.  Arrowhead Creek and many of the tributaries in the area are spring fed influencing the water chemistry of Weapon Lake, a basin in the Arrowhead Creek system.  Muck and detritus were \"common\" shoreline substrates, with gravel, rubble and sand rated \"rare\".  Vegetation was found to the deepest portion of the lake, floating-leaf pondweed was \"common\" and found over much of the lake surface.  The north end of the lake had a large area of bog.  A beaver dam on the outlet along the east shore, Arrowhead Creek, had a head of 3.4 feet that maintained the lake at the present level. <br> \n <br> \nSampling techniques captured 12 white suckers that had an average weight of 0.25 pound.  Also sampled were Common Shiners, Brook Sticklebacks, Blacknose Shiners, Finescale Dace and Blacknose Dace.  There was no evidence, at the time of the survey in 2013, of anglers traveling to or recently fishing Weapon Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA population assessment on July 12, 1985 caught eight Brook Trout that ranged from seven inches to thirteen inches and averaged 9.9 inches.   Arrowhead Creek, which flows into the south end of Weapon Lake, is a designated trout stream with a self-sustaining population of Brook Trout and a likely source of Brook Trout residing in Weapon Lake. <br> \n</p>",
