                "narrative": "<p>Timber Lake has a surface area of 278 acres and a maximum depth of 12 feet.  The lake is located in far western Cook County and is part of the Timber-Frear Canoe Route.  This area is a US Forest Service designated canoe route with maintained campsites and portages, but with less strict regulations than the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.  There is one campsite on Timber Lake located on a point on the northeast shore of the lake.  There are no good direct accesses to Timber Lake, but the lake can be accessed from two portage trails.  There is a 60 rod portage from the west shore of Timber Lake into a marsh then a 5 rod portage to the east shore of Frear Lake.  A 38 rod portage connects the south end of Timber Lake to the north end of Elbow Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of the 2018 survey was to provide an update to the status of the Walleye and Northern Pike populations.  Walleye catch in Timber Lake was above average when compared to similar lakes.  The average weight was almost a pound with the heaviest Walleye tipping the scales at roughly four pounds.  Average length was approximately 14 inches with the longest fish measuring 22 inches.  Twelve different ages of Walleye were identified in the sample ranging from zero to 15 years old.  The most commonly sampled age was age-2, which represented 33 percent of the sample; these fish had an average length of 11 inches at the time of sampling.  Walleye growth in Timber Lake was slow when compared to similar lakes in the area. <br> \n <br> \nOnly two Northern Pike were sampled during this survey making catch well below average.  These fish measured 16 and 24 inches and were age-4 and age-5. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Yellow Perch catch was also below average when compared to similar lakes.  The average length was 8 inches with fish up to 11 inches long sampled.  These fish ranged from age-2 to age-7.  Large numbers of young of the year Yellow Perch were sampled in mini trap nets; these fish appear to be the primary forage available in Timber Lake.  Johnny Darter, Blacknose Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow, Creek Chub, and White Sucker were also sampled during this survey. <br> \n <br> \nTimber Lake offers some good opportunities to catch eater size Walleye for those willing to put in the effort to get to the lake.  Anglers may also come across Northern Pike and Yellow Perch however the limited numbers mean their populations will be of little interest to most angers.  The lake also provides opportunities for camping and canoeing as part of the Timber-Frear Canoe Route.     <br> \n</p>",

Mean size of Walleye increased with 13.6 inches the highest ever sampled. Ages IV, V and VI comprise nearly 71% of the sample with Age V representing 38% of the catch. No Age II fish were taken. Walleye growth is good to Age III but slows beyond that.     Northern Pike densities previously  showed a sharp decline after Walleye became established. Northern Pike catch/net continues to remain low however quality size fish are present as indicated by a mean length of 25.0 inches.      Yellow Perch densities have historically been low and gillnet catches of 0.5/lift indicates this tendency has not changed.     White Sucker continue to thrive with the gillnet catch of 20.5/lift being the highest ever recorded.</p>",
