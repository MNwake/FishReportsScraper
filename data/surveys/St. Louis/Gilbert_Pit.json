The city has developed an area for recreation that includes an access, campground, swimming beach and picnic area. The IRRRB stocks yearling rainbow trout annually in this mine pit. Eurasion water milfoil and zebra mussels are present. <br> \n <br> \nEight species of fish were sampled during the 2014 population assessment. With the exception of rock bass (60% of the catch) the remaining seven species were sampled in numbers below average compared to similar lakes. Bluegill and white sucker are the only species that have been sampled in all six assessments. This is the first assessment where walleye were not sampled. <br> \n <br> \nTwo lake trout, the largest measuring 28 inches were sampled. Two smallmouth bass, two northern pike and two yellow perch were sampled. One pumpkinseed was also sampled. Historically these species have been present in low abundances with white sucker showing a slight decline. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gilbert Pit (Lake Ore-B-Gone) is a 243-acre mine pit located near Gilbert. The city of Gilbert owns and maintains a public park on the northwest side of the lake that includes a concrete boat ramp and parking for numerous vehicles. The lake has a maximum depth of 443 feet and extremely clear water. <br> \n <br> \nOn June 26, 2023, Gilbert Pit was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 71 F and a temperature of 39 F at a depth of 100 feet. Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish throughout the top 100 feet of the water column. Six gill nets were used to sample gamefish in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nTwo lake trout were sampled in 2023 resulting in a catch rate of 0.3 fish/net. This catch rate is similar to previous surveys of Gilbert Pit. The lake trout were 24.4 and 28.9 inches in length. Lake trout have not been stocked in Gilbert Pit since 1985, indicating that the lake supports a low-density, naturally reproducing population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 1.7 fish/net, the highest catch rate ever recorded in Gilbert Pit. Pike lengths ranged from 23.6 inches to 32.7 inches and averaged 29.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBoth largemouth and smallmouth bass were sampled at a rate of 0.5 fish/net. Smallmouth tended to be larger in size, averaging 17.3 inches compared to 10.5 inches for largemouth. One walleye, measuring 21.8 inches in length, was also sampled in the gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in gill nets included bluegill, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow smelt are a non-native species that were first reported in Gilbert Pit in the late 1990s. Targeted sampling using small mesh gill nets was conducted for the first time in 2023 and resulted in a catch rate of 11.5 smelt/net. Rainbow smelt introductions in other lakes in the Tower area have resulted in declines of other species including walleye, cisco, and lake whitefish. Visitors to Gilbert Pit should take extra caution to ensure they are not transporting any live smelt or smelt eggs to other lakes. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to rainbow smelt, Gilbert Pit is also infested with Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels. It is important for anglers and boaters to follow regulations when moving between lakes because these species can survive in or on boats, trailers, and equipment for some time. Be sure to drain all water from bait containers, live wells, bilge, and watercraft, dispose of any unused bait, and carefully inspect and remove any plants or animals attached to the watercraft, trailer, anchor, or other equipment before leaving the lake.  <br> \n</p>",
