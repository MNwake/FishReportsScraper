There is no developed public access located on Skunk Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Skunk Lake is in lake class 32.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Upper Bass, Coon, Gillette, and Island. <br> \n <br> \nSkunk Lake provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, panfish, and largemouth bass.  Northern pike abundance (7.8 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 2.1 pounds, with pike measured up to 33.0 inches.  Skunk Lake supports an abundant sunfish population consisting of bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range and black crappie in the 9-10 inch size range.  Skunk Lake supports a healthy largemouth bass population.  Anglers have reported catching good numbers and sizes of largemouth bass.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Skunk Lake.  Walleye are also present, but were sampled in low numbers.  The last recorded walleye stocking in Skunk Lake occurred in 1948. Other species sampled include moderate numbers of yellow perch, rock bass, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Skunk Lake is located in central Hubbard County, thirteen miles north of Park Rapids.  Skunk Lake has a surface area of 198 acres and a maximum depth of 55 feet.  There is no public access located on Skunk Lake.  Private access is available from Niawa Star Resort.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Skunk Lake is in lake class 32.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Upper Bass (6 miles northeast of Akeley), Coon (8 miles north of Nevis and 15 miles north of Park Rapids), Gillette (6 miles southeast of Lake George), and Island (3 miles southeast of Akeley).The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 8.7/net is within the range typical for lake class 32.  The two previous surveys had similar gillnet catch rates, 9.0/net (1984) and 11.3/net (1989).  The initial survey in 1961 had a lower gillnet catch rate (2.5/net).  Sampled northern pike were small in size with an average length and weight of 21.0 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Northern pike up to 32.0 inches were sampled.  Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to other class 32 lakes.Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers (4.5/gillnet), but within the range typical for lake class 32.  Historical yellow perch gillnet catch rates have been higher: 7.3/net (1989), 11.3/net (1984), and 110.8/net (1961).  The yellow perch population in Skunk Lake is primarily a forage base for the northern pike population and are generally too small in size to be acceptable to anglers.  Sampled yellow perch were an average length of 5.9 inches with fish sampled up to 9.2 inches.The black crappie gillnet catch rate of 5.8/net is above the range typical for lake class 32.  Black crappie gillnet catch rates have increased over time: 0.0/net (1961), 2.0/net (1984), and 7.0/net (1989).  Trapnet catches have been lower, but have followed the same trend as gillnets in increasing catches over time.  Sampled black crappie were a mean length of 7.6 inches with fish measured up to 14.2 inches.  Black crappie growth rates began to slow after age three when compared to other class 32 lakes.Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers (21.3/net), within the range typical for lake class 32.  Historical bluegill trapnet catch rates have fluctuated from moderate to high numbers: 107.8/net (1989), 52.3/net (1984), and 24.9/net (1961).  Average size of bluegill was small (5.1 inches), however, fish up to 8.6 inches were measured.  Bluegill growth rates were similar to other class 32 lakes.Sixteen largemouth bass were sampled (1.8/gillnet and 0.6/trapnet), similar to past surveys.  Largemouth bass up to 17.0 inches were sampled.  Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective methods to adequately assess largemouth bass abundance or size distribution.  To adequately assess a largemouth bass population special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted on Skunk Lake.  Skunk Lake has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that will help insure a healthy largemouth bass population.One 13.5 inch walleye was sampled in the 1997 survey.  No walleye were sampled in the 1984 or 1989 survey, however, walleye were abundant in the 1961 survey (14.7/gillnet).  It is interesting to note that the last recorded walleye stocking on Skunk Lake was in 1948.  Whether the walleye sampled in 1961 were from natural reproduction of from undocumented stocking is not unknown.Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass were sampled in low numbers, while white sucker were sampled in moderate numbers (1.3/gillnet).Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Skunk Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",
