Growth is above average. The average size of northern pike sampled was 19.6 inches and 1.9 pounds.Bluegills were sampled in average numbers with the average length sampled being only 5.7 inches. Only 5.2 percent of the bluegills measured exceeded 7.0 inches in length. Black crappies are currently at the highest level measured during fisheries surveys. Only 19.2 percent of the black crappies measured exceeded 8 inches. A majority of the black crappies sampled were age 4.The largemouth bass population remains stable. The average length sampled during electrofishing was 10.1 inches. Approximately 23 percent of the bass sampled were at least 16 inches in length. Yellow perch were sampled in average numbers, but the average size was only 6.3 inches in length.</p>",

Largemouth bass are also present in abundant numbers with a few quality size individuals available to anglers. Bluegill are present in abundant numbers with the average size being 6.0 inches long. Growth rate of bluegill is relatively slow. Black crappie are also present in good numbers, but the average size is only about 7.0 inches long and growth is slow. Carp were captured in high numbers using all sampling gears. The average size observed during data collection was 2.4 pounds and 17.0 inches long. One bowfin of near state record proportions was also handled during this assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Considered a good largemouth bass and northern pike fishery, Zumbra Lake is a 162-acre, class 24 lake located on the Carver Park Reserve (Three Rivers Park District) in northeastern Carver County.  The sport fish community also consists of black crappie, bluegill, white crappie, and yellow perch.  The lake was treated in 1993 and 1994 with fluridone to eradicate Eurasian watermilfoil and again in 2004 with Aquathol Super K (endothol) to control curly leaf pondweed.  Additionally, Zumbra Lake was used as a control lake in an evaluation of `no-harvest' regulations of largemouth bass and their subsequent effects on bass and bluegill fish communities in two Carver County lakes from 1992 to 2001.  Zumbra Lake boasts very respectable northern pike and largemouth bass populations.  Exhibiting good size structure and numbers, the pike population averaged approximately 24.5 inches and 3.8 pounds.  Sixty-eight percent of sampled pike were over 24 inches and 34% were greater than 26 inches.  Although gill nets and trap nets do not effectively sample largemouth bass, two fish were sampled.  Both trap net caught bass were approximately 19 inches and had an average weight of 4.2 pounds.  Zumbra Lake panfish vary in size and numbers.  Bluegills were sampled in high numbers with the average size of 6.2 inches.  Only 52 black crappies and 3 white crappies were sampled during assessment.  Approximately 27 and 85% of the black crappies sampled were above 8.0 and 7.0 inches, respectively.  One white crappie measuring 13.2 inches was sampled in a gill net.  Yellow perch, averaging 6.3 inches, were sampled in average numbers.  Additionally, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were present but only at low levels.  Black, brown, and yellow bullheads were sampled in varying numbers and lengths.   Additionally, bowfin (dogfish), golden shiners, and white suckers were sampled in limited numbers.       </p>",

Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at one station. Nearshore sampling captured nine species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish and Least Darter) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured nine species of fish. Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number and biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in the Zumbra portion of Zumbra-Sunny Lake is adversely impacted by stressors, as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River-Twin Cities Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Zumbra Lake is located in Carver County, near the town of Victoria.  It is 233 acres, with a maximum depth of 58 feet.  Much of the shoreline of the lake is undeveloped and is managed by Three Rivers Park District, within Carver Park Reserve.  MN DNR primarily manages Zumbra for its Northern Pike fishery, and secondarily for its Largemouth Bass and Bluegill fisheries.  In 2020, a Standard Fisheries Survey was conducted to assess the gamefish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nZumbra is a good fishing spot for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  The lake is not stocked, so no Walleye or Muskies are present.  Northern Pike are highly abundant in Zumbra.  Anglers will have a good opportunity to fill their limit of Northern Pike; 39% of the gill netted fish were smaller than 22 inches, while 16% exceeded 26 inches.  Largemouth Bass electrofishing was not conducted in 2020, however the lake has a reputation for its strong bass fishery.  When the lake was last electrofished, in 2015, the largest bass sampled was 20.1 inches and 4.8 pounds.  While the Bluegill tend to be on the small side, they are very abundant so would offer good fishing action.  The opposite is true for the crappies.  Black Crappie were sampled in low abundance in 2020, however several fish between 11 and 14 inches were present.   <br> \n <br> \nOverall, Zumbra offers high numbers of Northern Pike and Bluegill, and good-sized Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie.  Plenty of natural shoreline exists, and due to its smaller size, Zumbra is rarely teeming with recreational boaters.  The Three Rivers Park property leading to the boat launch is a quiet drive down a dirt road.  There is a dog park on the way to the boat launch, so it could be a good location to bring the pup.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Zumbra Lake is a 233 acre lake with a maximum depth of 58 feet, located in northeast Carver County.   Zumbra Lake provides somewhat limited recreational opportunities in a natural setting.  The boat launch is not large and the access ramp can be shallow during low water.  Large boats would have difficulty launching.  Most of the shoreline is in a natural state.  The majority of the lake is located within the Carver Park Reserve, managed by Three Rivers Parks.  Water quality in Zumbra Lake is very good, compared to other West Metro lakes.  By late summer most species of fish cannot inhabit water deeper than 22 feet for extended periods of time.  This should be kept in mind when fishing for northern pike or black crappie.  Boaters should also keep in mind, new laws require the drain plug be removed while on public roadways.     <br> \n  <br> \nThe predator community in Zumbra Lake reflects a natural state.  Northern pike numbers were high compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 21.5 inches and average weight was 2.31 pounds.  Northern pike numbers are high enough to prevent walleyes from being stocked.  Studies have shown high abundance of northern pike reduces the survival of stocked fingerlings.  In the 2010 population assessment largemouth bass abundance remained similar to past surveys.  Standard lake survey gear does not consistently provide an accurate estimate of largemouth bass abundance.  Angler reports suggest a quality bass fishery exists within Zumbra Lake.     <br> \n <br> \nFive species of panfish inhabit Zumbra Lake.  Black crappie abundance is low.  Large fish were sampled.  One black crappie over 12 inches was captured.  Average black crappie length was 7.8 inches.  Average weight was high.  Bluegill abundance increased compared to the 2004 survey and is above the historic average.  Average weight decreased to a low value.  Only 27.2% of sampled bluegill were greater than 6 inches.  Less than 1% were larger than 7 inches.  Pumpkinseed were sampled at a below average abundance.  Hybrid sunfish and green sunfish were also sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill in Zumbra Lake are becoming stunted.  In the Metro area, stunting in size is likely due to overpopulation and size selective harvest by anglers.  Overpopulation reduces the amount of food available to all fish, reducing growth rates.  Harvest of larger (keeper size) fish by anglers reduces the number of quality fish in a lake.  Harvesting large fish also removes the spawning stock and reduces the biological incentive to grow large.  Larger fish compete for spawning habitat and food more effectively.  Thus, fish have more incentive to grow large if large fish are present in a lake.  Harvesting smaller fish preserves spawning stock and increases the biological incentive to grow large, which promotes big fish genetics.      <br> \n <br> \nOverall, rough fish are present in low numbers.   Common carp were not sampled in the 2010 survey.  Black bullhead abundance decreased to an all time low.  Yellow bullhead were sampled at average abundance.  Bowfin (dogfish) were present in above average numbers.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Zumbra Lake is located in Carver County, near the town of Victoria.  It is a 233-acre, Class 24 lake with a maximum depth of 58 feet.  Most of the shoreline of the lake is undeveloped and is managed by Three Rivers Park District, within Carver Park Reserve.  MN DNR primarily manages Zumbra for its Northern Pike fishery, and secondarily for its Largemouth Bass and Bluegill fisheries.  In 2015, a Standard Fisheries Survey was conducted to assess the gamefish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, Northern Pike were highly abundant in the gill nets.  The catch rate of 17.5 fish per net greatly exceeded the 75th percentile for this Lake Class.  Size structure reflected a balanced population; 46% of the fish exceeded 21 inches, and 5% exceeded 28 inches.  The average size of Northern Pike was 21.2 inches and 2.15 pounds.  The largest fish measured 32.3 inches.  Northern Pike aged 2 through 9 were present in the sample, reflecting consistent reproduction and recruitment.  On average, fish attain a length of 20.0 inches by age 3, 24.4 inches by age 5, and 28.1 inches by age 7.   <br> \n <br> \nNighttime boat electrofishing was conducted during early June, sampling the Largemouth Bass population.  A total of 94 Largemouth Bass were sampled in 4 electrofishing transects, producing 48.9 bass per hour of on-time.  The size structure reflects a balanced fish population; 37% of fish exceeded 12 inches, and 10% of fish exceeded 15 inches.  Largemouth bass averaged 10.8 inches and 0.83 lbs.  The largest bass sampled was 20.1 inches long and 4.8 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were highly abundant in the trap nets, mostly of modest size, but with some larger specimens present.  The catch rate of 73.8 fish per trap net exceeds the 75th percentile for this Lake Class.  The average size was 5.6 inches and 0.15 pounds; the largest fish measured 8.5 inches and 0.45 pounds.  Eighteen percent of the Bluegill exceeded 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species caught in low abundance include Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, Green Sunfish, and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n</p>",
