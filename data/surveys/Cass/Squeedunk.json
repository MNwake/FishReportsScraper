Many sunfish are caught, along with largemouth bass and an occasional northern pike.  There are no records of fish stocking, fish removal, special regulations, or special projects and activities for this lake.Squeedunk Lake is a small, moderately deep lake.  It has no inlet or outlet.  There is one resort and one cabin on the lake.  Fishing pressure is light.The present fish population consists primarily of largemouth bass, slow growing sunfish, and northern pike as the predator species.  Slow growth of sunfish does not necessarily indicate a stunted population, but may be normal growth for these fish in the northern edge of this district.Although the water chemistry indicates that this lake may possess suitable oxygen and water temperature conditions for rainbow trout, the resident warm water fish population is not in need of rehabilitation.  Angler success for sunfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike was good at the time of the survey.</p>",
