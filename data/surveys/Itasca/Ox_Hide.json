                "narrative": "<p>Ox Hide Lake is a 121 acre, hardwater lake near Pengilly, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lakebed is characterized by a shallow, narrow shoal area adjacent to a steep drop off that rings most of the lake.  The lakeshore is forested and in a relatively natural state, although past mining activities are evident from tailings piles near the north and east shorelines.  Recent surveys have indicated good water quality with water clarity in excess of 20 feet.  The lake management plan lists Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass as the primary management species. <br> \n <br> \nIn general, Northern Pike numbers appear to have increased while size structure has decreased.  The catch rate in 2015 exceeded the expected range for similar lakes.  Age analysis indicated the sample was dominated by age 2 and 3 fish, thus size structure was poor.  Sampled pike averaged less than 21 inches and only two pike exceeded 30 inches.  Growth of Northern Pike was similar to the statewide average with individuals typically exceeding 22 inches by age 4.  Angling opportunities for pike may improve as some of the abundant young fish grow to more favorable sizes.  Ox Hide Lake historically produced some relatively large pike when numbers were lower. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled with spring night electrofishing.  The catch rate was moderately high compared to similar lakes and size structure was fairly good.  Sampled bass averaged over 15 inches and 2 pounds.  Age analysis suggested consistent natural reproduction with a large number of year classes represented.  Growth was average with bass approaching 15 inches at age 6.  Given the favorable size structure and catch rate, good bass angling opportunities exist on Ox Hide Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough they were sampled in low numbers in the most recent survey, angling opportunities also exist for panfish such as Bluegill, Black Crappie and Rock Bass.  Other species sampled with test nets include Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Tullibee and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ox Hide Lake is a 121 acre, hardwater lake near Pengilly, MN in Itasca County.  The lake has 38 littoral acres and is relatively deep with a maximum depth of 40 feet.  The lakebed is characterized by a shallow, narrow shoal area adjacent to a steep sided drop off that rings most of the lake.  The shoalwater is dominated by sand and marl substrates on the main basin and muck and detritus on the shallower southern basin.  The lakeshore is forested and in a relatively natural state, although past mining activities are evident as the north and east shorelines abut tailing piles.  No lake adjacent homes or cabins exist.  The lake has good water quality with Secchi disk readings in excess of 20 feet.  The lake supports a diverse aquatic plant community including widespread water lilies, bulrush, and cattail, especially in the southern basin.  There is a state owned access on the south end of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nOx Hide Lake supports a quality northern pike fishery.  Northern pike were the most common fish captured in the gill nets and catches were similar with those of similar lakes.  The pike population appears to have increased in recent history.  Four prior surveys from 1971 to 1989 resulted in relatively low pike catches.  In 1999, the catch rate exceeded the expected catch for lakes with similar characteristics.  Ox Hide Lake has a history of producing relatively large northern pike.  In 2009, the size structure remained favorable for anglers, as most individuals exceeded 21 inches and 13% exceeded 28 inches.  Pike averaged 22 inches in length and the largest pike exceeded 35 inches.  Several year classes were present, although recruitment appeared inconsistent.  Growth was near the statewide average, and individuals typically exceeded 21 inches in 5 years.  Age structure was dominated by younger individuals; only 23% of the captured individuals were 5 years old or older.  The skewed age distribution may indicate poor recruitment of earlier year classes, high natural mortality of older individuals, or high harvest pressure.  Given the current size structure and catch rate, good angling opportunities likely exist for pike in Ox Hide Lake.  Anglers are encouraged to help maintain the quality northern pike fishery by releasing pike exceeding 22 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were captured in relatively low numbers.  Most yellow perch were relatively small and angler interest may be limited by the poor size structure.  Growth was near the statewide average and perch grew to 8 inches in 6 years.  Although the perch fishery is limited, yellow perch are likely an important prey item in Ox Hide Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most common fish captured in the trap nets and were captured in average numbers compared to similar lakes.  Lakes like Ox Hide generally produce relatively slow growing bluegill, limiting the overall size structure.  The size structure of bluegill in Ox Hide Lake was moderate, as 68% exceeded 6 inches.  Few individuals exceeded 8 inches, however.  Captured bluegill averaged 6.5 inches in length and the largest was 8.3 inches.  Growth was average for the lake class, with individuals typically exceeding 6 inches in 6 years.  Given the catch rate and limited size structure, good angling opportunities likely exist for catching relatively high numbers of moderately or small sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were captured in relatively low numbers.  Black crappie catches have been inconsistent in Ox Hide Lake over the years, suggesting inconsistent reproduction and recruitment from one year to the next.  Inconsistency in reproduction is a common life history trait for black crappies and often results in \"boom and bust\" fishing cycles.  In 2009, the average size was 7 inches and the largest crappie was 9 inches.  Inconsistent recruitment resulting in low population densities may limit the popularity of the current black crappie fishery. <br> \n <br> \nRelatively good numbers of largemouth bass were captured using boat electrofishing.  Ox Hide Lake has a history of producing a relatively high population of bass.  In 2009, the size structure was favorable as fish exceeding 15 inches were common.  Bass averaged 11.8 inches and the largest bass exceeded 17 inches.  Growth was relatively slow as individuals exceeded 12 inches in 5 years.  The age distribution was well balanced and 60% of the sampled fish exceeded age-5.  Given the favorable size structure and catch rate, good bass angling opportunities likely exist on Ox Hide Lake.  Given the relatively slow growth, anglers should consider releasing large bass in Ox Hide Lake to help maintain the quality of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included blackchin shiner, bluntnose minnow, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, yellow bullhead, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nNatural, undistrubed shorelines are a major attribute of Ox Hide Lake.  The protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches results in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future.

Largemouth bass abundance is above average in both gillnets and trapnets, growth is average.  Bluegill numbers are about average as indicated by trapnet, but growth is slow.

                "narrative": "<p>Ox Hide Lake is a small undeveloped lake located one mile northwest of Pengilly, Minnesota.  The lake management plan indicates northern pike as the primary species of management with black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass as secondary species.  It appears that many species sampled in 1999 were either at a all time high or low.  The current high populations of bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike may make the lake a good choice for parents taking their kids fishing.  The average size of fish may be a little small as of 1999 but the quick action should keep their interestNorthern pike numbers have been fairly low and stable in our four assessments from 1971 to 1989.  In 1999, northern pike numbers were substantially higher than normal for this lake and exceeded our management goal for the population.  Northern pike ranged from 9.3 to 30.4 inches and had an average length of 19.9 inches.   Six year classes were identified from the scales ranging from one to six years old.  The 1997 year class represented nearly 36 percent of the sample.  Growth rates were better than statewide averages with fish averaging 25.0 inches after five years of growth.  Bluegill numbers have been good from 1971 to 1989.  In 1999, bluegills increased to an all time high.   Fish from 3.3 to 8.1 inches were sampled and they had an average length of 5.2 inches.  Bluegill from four to 10 years old were observed in the sample.  The cool summers of 1992 and 1993 resulted in poor year classes that can still be observed in the population six years later.  In 1995, environmental conditions must have been ideal for spawning since this year class represented nearly 50 percent of the bluegill sampled.   Growth was slower then lakes similar to Ox Hide.  Bluegill growth rates were likely slower due to an increase in competition for food.  Largemouth bass were sampled with spring electrofishing for the first time in 1999.  A total of 113 fish were captured, measured, scales taken for aging and released.  Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 20.1 inches with an average of 8.3 inches.  Fish from one to 12 years old were identified from the scales.  Two year old fish (1997 year class) represented 52 percent of the sample.  Growth for largemouth bass was slower than the statewide averages.  It took a bass seven years of growth to attain roughly 15.0 inches.A few other species sampled in 1999 include black crappie, tullibee, white sucker, and yellow perch.  Black crappie and yellow perch numbers were the lowest ever recorded in 1999.  Tullibee and white suckers were at healthy levels and their presence likely provides an important prey source for larger northern pike. </p>",
