                "narrative": "<p>Schelins lake is 148 acres and is located 4 miles west of Independence, MN on County Road 47.  There is no public access to Schelins Lake.  The maximum depth is 23 feet and 99 percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Some stocking occurred prior to 1964, but this was the first lake survey conducted.     The fish population is primarily composed of northern pike, yellow perch, black crappie, and bluegill.  Northern pike catch rates are typical for lakes in this lake class and growth is slow compared to other Duluth area lakes.  Yellow perch catch rates were high for lakes in this class but growth rates are typical compared to other Duluth area lakes.  Most yellow perch sampled (55%) were from the 1994 year class and the average size was 6.6 inches.  Black crappie catch rates were typical for lakes in this class, however, the average size was 8.5 inches.  Black crappie growth rates were slow compared to other Duluth area lakes.    Bluegill catch rates were typical, but the average size was 7.7 inches and growth rates were fast compared to other Duluth area lakes.  Bluegill age distribution indicated recruitment from 11 of 12 years from 1986 to 1997.     Young-of-the-year black crappie, largemouth bass and yellow perch were sampled in the shoreline seines.  All 26 black crappie and all of the 25 largemouth bass sampled were from the 1998 year class.  Fourteen of the 88 yellow perch sampled were from the 1998 year class.       Other species sampled in this survey include pumpkinseed sunfish and walleye.</p>",
