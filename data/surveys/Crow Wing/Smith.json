                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Smith Lake was conducted on August 2nd, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Smith Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous FIBI survey findings for Smith Lake which indicated that Smith Lake supported a healthy fish community. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Rum River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Quality fishing opportunities are limited to largemouth bass and sunfish; other species' numbers have remained low in the four surveys dating back to 1985.  The lake was not electrofished, but high numbers of largemouth bass were captured in both gill nets and trap nets.  Average length wasn't very impressive, however, (10.7\" in gill nets and 8.1\" in trap nets) and the largest fish was 14.8\".  Although bluegill numbers were decent, size was again the issue here.  The average length was 5.7\", with only 15% of the fish measuring 7\" or larger.  Although average size of the northern pike was good (25.7\"), very few pike were caught (3.1/net). <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included black crappie, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), walleye, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Various other species were caught while backpack electrofishing and seining, including brook silversides, sculpins, Iowa darters, and bluntnose minnows. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Smith Lake is 441 acres in size and is located just south of Garrison in eastern Crow Wing County.  It is within the boundaries of the 1837 treaty area.  There were about 72 homes/cabins and one resort along 6 miles of shoreline in 1997.  There was no designated public access present.  The lake is 54 feet deep and about 41% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with good phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity was about typical for the area.  Bottom soils in water less than four feet deep were a mix of sand, gravel, marl and muck.  The aquatic plant community was reasonably diverse.  Emergent aquatic species help cycle nutrients and provide some shore protection from erosion.  Species like bulrush improve the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish.  Species like wild rice often provide spawning habitat for northern pike.  Submergent and floating leafed plants provide important cover and food sources for a wide variety of aquatic life.The netting done in 1997 showed results fairly similar to those seen in previous surveys.  Northern pike were caught in \"low\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  The catch was similar to previous catches in Smith Lake.  Three age classes were sampled and growth was good.  Average size was 24 inches and 4.7 lbs..The walleye catch was also typical for the lake and \"low\" when compared to similar type lakes.  Only three fish were caught and averaged 20 inches and 3.2 lbs..Largemouth bass numbers were in the \"high\" category.  The 1994 year class was the strongest of the three sampled and bass growth was slow.  Bluegills were caught in \"average\" numbers and ranged from 3.3-8.2 inches long in the trap net catch.  About 14% were at least 7.0 inches long.  Bluegill growth was slow until about age six.  The crappie catch was also in the \"average\" category and had good growth.  As is common, one age class made up the majority of the crappie catch.  Other panfish species sampled included pumpkinseed and rock bass, both caught in \"average\" numbers.Forage species sampled included yellow perch, tullibees and white suckers.  Perch catch was typical for Smith Lake but \"low\" in comparison with similar type lakes.  White suckers were also found in \"low\" numbers, also typical for the lake.  The tullibee catch was in the \"average\" category and similar to past catches for the lake.Other species sampled included bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner and yellow bullhead.  Common carp were sampled in 1985 but not in 1997.</p>",

Access to Smith Lake is limited to property owners or through the resort on the north side.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were captured in average numbers in gill nets (2.4/net) and in trap nets (2.1/net), when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 9.5\" for gill net captured fish, and 8.6\" for fish from trap nets.  For both gears combined 76% were at least 8.0\" in length.  Black Crappies up to 12.6\" were sampled.  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers at 11.1/trap net.  Average length was 4.9\", with only 6% at least 7.0\" in length.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in low numbers, when compared to similar lakes, at 1.7/gill net.  Average length was nice at 25.1\" with 33% being at least 26.0\" in length.  Northern Pike up to 31.1\" were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in high numbers at 6.4/gill net.  Average length was 10.9\", with 29% at least 12.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels are present in Smith Lake.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Smith Lake on August 10, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 20 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 26.4 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 13.9?C (57?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations within the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1997-2014 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat in most years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2010. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",
