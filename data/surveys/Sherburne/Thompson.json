The lake has a maximum depth of 22 feet with an average depth of 10 feet. No designated public access is available. A standard survey was completed in 1978.\n\nBluegill were sampled in high abundance at almost four times higher than the normal range for the lake class. Yellow Perch were present in low numbers. Good populations of Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike were present. Black Crappie were low in numbers, but large in size. \n\nOther species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thompson Lake is an 84-acre lake in Sherburne County four miles northwest of the City of Big Lake. The lake has a maximum depth of 22 feet with an average depth of 10 feet. A standard survey was completed in 1990 to update fisheries data last collected in 1978.\n\nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 7.5/gill net, about equal to the statewide average catch. Pike ranged in length from 19 - 23 inches and most fish were either age four or five. Growth was slow. \n\nLargemouth Bass were collected by means of a volunteer angler in 1989. The length frequency of the angler-caught bass represented six age classes. Growth was average. \n\nBluegill, Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, and Hybrid Sunfish were captured with trap nets. Bluegill, by far, were the most abundant and had a catch rate of 81/trap net which was four times the statewide average. The size of Bluegill was small and averaged 5.5 - 6.5 inches in length with the longest at 6.9 inches. Bluegill were primarily age five or six and growth was slow. \n\nBlack Crappie were sampled in the gill nets, but not in the trap nets. Local anglers report that angling can be good for crappie.\n\nBlack Bullhead and Yellow Bullhead were present in low numbers. Common Carp were observed in the shallows and four were sampled in the trap net sets. Common Carp were not perceived to be problematic at Thompson Lake. \n\nOther species sampled included Bowfin (dogfish).\n</p>",
