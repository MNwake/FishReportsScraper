Inthe late 1980's, there were reports that anglers were catching walleye in the one- to three-pound range, butduring the winter of 1988-89, Cub experienced a winterkill. Cub was stocked with walleye fry in spring 1989, butno walleye or other game species were captured during the 1993 assessment of the lake. The only fish sampledduring this assessment were black bullhead, all of which were around 5 inches long.</p>",
