Commercial removal of 9,000 pounds of bullhead was completed in the fall of 1992.  Walleye gillnet CPUE of 1.6 per lift was just above the first quartile of 1.3 per lift for lake class 19.  The increase in walleye abundance since 1993 was not the result of recruitment of stocked fish.  Northern pike gillnet CPUE of 7.9 was just below the third quartile of 8.3 per lift for lake class 19.  The 1998 catch rate was much lower than the 1993 catch rate of 14.8 per gillnet lift.  Largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate of 14.8 per hour of on-time was lower than the 1993 catch rate of 30.9 per hour.  Poor weather conditions during the assessment may have contributed to the low catch rate for bass.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed trapnet CPUE values were both greater than their respective 3rd quartile values for lake class 19.  Size structure was also excellent for both species.  Black crappie trapnet CPUE was below the 1st quartile value of 0.8 per lift.</p>",

The lake is located one mile northeast of Central Lakes, MN off County Road #292 and has a DNR administered, gravel, back-in access.  The primary management species from the 2000 management plan is largemouth bass and the secondary management species is bluegill.     Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing in the spring of 2003.  Largemouth bass abundance of 20.6 per hour of electrofishing was below average compared to other lakes in the Duluth Area.  Mean length was 12.3 inches.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 12.1 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 1998 year-class and six year-classes represented from 1995 through 2001.      Bluegill abundance of 12.1 was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 7.4 inches.  Growth was average with length at age IV of 5.2 inches.  Age analysis revealed strong 1993 and 1998 year-classes and eight year-classes represented from 1992 through 2000.     Walleye abundance of 0.8 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of seven sampled walleye was 20.9 inches.  Growth was fast with length at age IV of 17.9 inches.  Age analysis revealed five year-classes represented from 1994 through 1999.     Northern pike abundance of 10.1 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 19.3 inches.  Growth was slow with length at age IV of 19.5 inches.  Age analysis revealed strong 1999 and 2000 year-classes and seven year-classes represented from 1994 through 2001.     Yellow perch abundance of 3.0 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 9.2 inches.     Other fish species sampled include black bullhead, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker and yellow bullhead.</p>",

Commercial removal of 9,000 pounds of bullhead was completed in the fall of 1992.     Walleye gillnet CPUE was 0.3 per lift, which is well below the lake class 15 first quartile of 1.3 per lift.     Northern pike gillnet CPUE of 14.8 per lift represents a dramatic increase from the 5.0 per lift documented in 1988.  Only 7% of the 143 northern pike from the 1993 sample were longer than 21 inches.  Northern pike were reaching 21.6 inches at age IV, which is average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.     Largemouth bass were sampled at a rate of 30.9 per hour of electrofishing.  Of the 34 largemouth bass sampled, 26% were longer than 12 inches.  Bass were reaching 11.3 inches in length at age IV.     Bluegill and pumpkinseed populations both seem to be in good shape.  Trapnet CPUE for bluegill was 7.2 per lift while pumpkinseed CPUE was 3.8 per lift.  Both these values are near their respective third quartile catch rate for lake class 15.  The percentage of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the sample longer than six inches was 66 and 78, respectively.  Bluegill growth rate was fast compared to populations from other Duluth Area lakes, reaching 5.9 at age IV.     Black crappie catch rates were 0.2 per trapnet lift with 37% of the 19 sampled fish longer than eight inches.  Black crappie were reaching 8.6 inches at age IV, which is fast compared to crappie from other Duluth Area lakes.</p>",

The lake is located near Central Lakes, MN and has a state owned, back in access on the west side of the lake.  Elliot was last surveyed in 2011.  Elliot was surveyed during the summer of 2018 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 17 Largemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The Largemouth Bass catch rate was 13.3 fish per hour, which was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Average length of sampled Largemouth Bass was 14.4 inches, but larger fish were sampled and should provide quality angling opportunities.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 5.6 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was small at 19.1 inches, but fish over 30 inches were captured.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill population densities were above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes, while Black Crappie population densities were average.  Black Crappie average length was 8.3 inches, while Bluegill average length was 6.2 inches.  Several strong year-classes of Bluegill were present, suggesting good Bluegill fishing should be expected in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elliot is a 373-acre lake with 100% littoral area and a maximum depth of 13 feet. The lake is located near Central Lakes, MN and has a state owned, back in access on the west side of the lake.  Elliot was last assessed in 2003.  Elliot was surveyed during the summer of 2011 to update information about fish populations and aquatic habitat.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 15 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 25.0 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Previous catch rates have ranged from 14.8 to 34.8 per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass average length was 13.5 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2007 were represented in the sample.  Eleven young-of-the-year (YOY) largemouth bass were captured during shoreline seining.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 7.1 per trapnet lift was down from 2003 (12.1) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 5.7 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2009 were represented.  Four YOY bluegill were captured during shoreline seining. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 1.9 per trapnet lift was up from 2003 (0.0) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 7.9 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2007 were represented.  Seven YOY black crappie were captured during shoreline seining. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 9.1 per gillnet lift was down from 2003 (10.1) but remained above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 18.4 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  A total of 17 northern pike were also captured in the trapnets, with fish up to 40.6 inches captured.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2010 were represented except 2003, with strong 2006 and 2008 year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nTwo large walleye were captured in the trapnets, one each aged from the 1997 and 1999 year-classes.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1991 due to poor survival of stocked fish.  Limited natural reproduction has been documented, but the lack of any young walleye during this survey suggests that recent natural reproduction attempts have failed.    <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 0.3 per gillnet lift was down from 2003 (3.0) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 7.3 inches but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Perch from the 2005, 2007 and 2008 year-classes were represented.  Fifty-four YOY yellow perch were captured during shoreline seining. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included black and brown bullhead, tadpole madtom, central mudminnow, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, blacknose shiner, golden shiner, common shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Forty-two aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 20 transects.  Flat-stem pondweed, large-leaf pondweed and northern milfoil were the most frequently found plants (90%, 90% and 85% of the transects, respectively).  The most common substrate types were muck, sand and gravel which were identified along 60%, 60% and 35% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Elliot is a slightly acidic, moderately hard water lake with moderate fertility. <br> \n <br> \nElliot Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2011.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.</p>",

It is unknown if this abundance is part of a trend, or is a one- time occurence possibly related to a partial winterkill. Northernpike are abundant, with many large individuals. Walleyes are rare, with none sampled and only a few caught by angling. Perch are numerous, with a good number of large individuals. Bluegills and crappies continue to provide a good fishery, but numbers are down slightly.With walleye catches alternating between good and poor, stocking fry or fingerlings at higher densities appears to produce results. Natural reproduction seems to be almost non-existent.</p>",
