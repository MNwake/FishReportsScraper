                "narrative": "<p>Pimushe Lake is a 1,268 acre lake with a maximum depth of 40 feet located in southeastern Beltrami County.  A U.S. Forest Service access is located on the east side of the lake off of County Road 39.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Pimushe Lake is in lake class 25.  Lake class 25 lakes are typically deep (50 - 75 feet), clear, hard water lakes with irregular shorelines.  All species typical of a lake class 25 fish community are found in Pimushe Lake.  The Pimushe Lake fish community is dominated by bluegill, northern pike, and yellow perch.  No stocking of any species occurs on Pimushe Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers pursue a variety of species on Pimushe Lake including bluegill, black crappie, northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass.  Pimushe Lake is known for its quality bluegill population, and because of this it has a special harvest regulation for sunfish that reduces the daily possession limit to 10 fish.  This regulation is intended to maintain or improve the quality size structure of the population.  In addition to complying with angling regulations, anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of bluegill populations as well as other species, by voluntary selective harvest. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to bluegill, black crappie is another species popular with anglers on Pimushe Lake.  At the time of this assessment, crappie from 10-12 inches in length were common with fish present up to 13 inches. Other members of the sunfish family that anglers can expect to catch are largemouth bass, pumpkinseed and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in Pimushe Lake has been relatively consistent over the past three assessments and is typical of other lake class 25 lakes.  Anglers will catch many pike between 18 and 21 inches with an occasional fish greater than 28 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPimushe Lake has had a self sustaining walleye population with remarkably stable abundance for over 30 years.  Gill net catch rates dating back to 1974 have been consistently between 3.4 and 4.7 per net. The 2008 catch rate of 2.6 per net is slightly lower than previous assessments but well within the normal range for this lake class.  It is somewhat concerning that most of the walleye sampled were age-3 or younger and sexually immature.  Obviously, mature spawners are critically important to lakes maintained by natural reproduction.  Voluntary release of mature females - generally fish that are 17 inches and larger - is strongly encouraged.  <br> \n <br> \nMost of the shoreline of Pimushe Lake is under public ownership and not at risk of future development.  However, a good portion of the south end of the lake is privately owned and has been increasingly developed over time. This development can degrade water quality and impact valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients, and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.

                "narrative": "<p>Pimushe Lake is a 1,230-acre lake located 5 miles north of Pennington in Beltrami County.  There is a U.S. Forest Service public water access with a concrete ramp and parking for 8 vehicles located on the east shore of the lake off of State Highway 39 (Scenic Highway).  Pimushe is managed for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Walleye, Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass.   <br> \n <br> \n A special regulation for Bluegill consisting of a 5-fish daily possession limit is in effect.  Statewide regulations apply to all other species.  Pimushe Lake has been known as a quality Bluegill fishery since the 1980s.  The 2022 survey results show that the lake's Bluegill population has continued to maintain a quality size structure with a good average size and fish approaching 10 inches in length captured.  The special Bluegill regulation in effect since 2014 has proven to be an effective tool at limiting harvest and maintaining a high-quality Bluegill population.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile Black Crappie may receive far less attention from Pimushe's anglers than Bluegill, they are nevertheless worth pursuing.  Catch rates for Black Crappie were above historical averages in 2022.  Similar to Bluegill, Black Crappie had a good average size with some fish approaching 13 inches in length.  Age data from the catch showed a healthy number of year classes present indicating that the population is sustaining itself nicely.  <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye numbers have been fairly consistent over the course of historical surveys however the 2022 catch rate (3.42/GN) was the highest recorded since 1999.  The lake's Walleye population has relied on natural reproduction within the lake as well as fish migration from the connected waters of the Turtle River and Cass Lake.  Walleye had an average size of over 13 inches in length, with fish up to 21 inches captured in this survey.  A large proportion of the walleye catch was comprised of younger fish ages 1-3 which holds promise for good Walleye fishing over the next few years as these fish grow to acceptable sizes for anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are commonly caught by anglers fishing Pimushe.  The number of pike captured increased considerably from the most recent survey (2017) with a slight decline in average size.  Northern Pike up to 31 inches were captured in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Largemouth Bass were not targeted as a part of this survey, previous survey results for bass depict a moderate density population with some large individuals present.  Similar to many lakes in the area, Pimushe contains abundant habitat for the species and plenty of options for bass anglers.  <br> \n  <br> \nOther species captured in this survey were Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Tullibee Cisco, Yellow Bullhead, White Sucker and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPimushe Lake is infested with zebra mussels and the aquatic plant, starry stonewort. Both are aquatic invasive species (AIS). AIS can be transferred by anglers and boats from infested to non-infested waterbodies. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. Please follow the current AIS regulations to avoid spreading to other lakes. <br> \n</p>",

The age and length frequency distributions indicate a healthy fishery with minimal presence of disease.</p>",

The northern pike population is slightly greater than average though most fish are small. About 75 % of the pike were between 16 and 22 inches in length, with an average of 18.5 inches, though pike as large as 27 inches were sampled. A few of the northern pike had neascus (black spot).   Walleye were found in good numbers, about average for comparable lakes. Natural reproduction has been consistant with the 1988 and 1989 years being very good. The largest walleye captured was 28.1 inches in length, and the average was 16.8 inches and weighed 1.7 pounds. This population has remained constant for the past 20 years and the fish are somewhat larger than in previous surveys.   Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing and by standard gear, but the numbers are low. Largemouth as large as 18 inches wee captured.   Black crappie were sampled but in low numbers. About 30% of the crappie sampled were 9 inches in length or larger.   Bluegill were captured in fair numbers, with about 23% of the bluegill being more than 8 inches in length. Pumpkinseed were found in low numbers, but the size is good. Rock bass were found in a range of sizes, but in low numbers.    Yellow perch have increased in numbers, but most perch are too small to be atractive to anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pimushe Lake is located about 5 miles north of Pennington off The Scenic Highway (County Road #39).  Pimushe Lake is a moderately sized, deep, clear water lake with an irregular shoreline and many small bays.  Pimushe is a popular fishing lake, and anglers can pursue their favorite species from the following list:  Largemouth bass, walleye, northern pike, and panfish.  The diversity of habitat types available has allowed this variety of species to maintain themselves through natural reproduction with no stocking since 1976. Bluegill have been the main attraction in recent times, and Pimushe Lake has a reputation for producing quality-size fish.  Size and abundance of bluegill has declined since 1988, though some quality size fish are still available.  About 14% of the bluegills sampled in the 1999 standard lake assessment were more than 8 inches long.  Increased angling pressure is likely contributing to the decline in abundance of larger bluegill, but other limiting factors seem to be contributing to the problem as well.  Anglers are encouraged to practice some harvest restraint to help retain the quality component of this fishery.Black crappie abundance is low, but they are pursued seasonally by anglers.  An aging sample from the spring assessment suggests that every year class back to 1992 is present, but some year classes are more prominent than others.  The largest crappie sampled in 1999 was 11.2 inches.Walleye are moderately abundant and assessment catch rates are similar to most comparable lakes.  Natural reproduction has been consistent as evidenced by the aging sample with all year classes since 1992 represented.  Anglers who get to know the lake structure, and fish for walleye, can do well.  The largest walleye captured in the 1999 assessment was 24.8 inches long; the average was 14.0 inches.Pimushe Lake has a long history of high angler catches of small northern pike.  The latest assessment confirms that this trend will continue.  The largest pike sampled was 25.3 inches long.  Average length was 18.9 inches.  No pike older than age five were sampled.Largemouth bass and rock bass are present and sought by some anglers.  Yellow perch, though not abundant, are common, and some are large enough to be acceptable to anglers.  White suckers and tullibee are present, but they are not commonly sought by anglers.  Their primary importance is as forage for the larger gamefish.  Tullibee can be legally harvested by gill nets during the fall.  Black, brown, and yellow bullheads, bowfin, and burbot are also present.Neascus (black spot) is common on northern pike, walleye, and all panfish.  Yellow grubs were observed in some perch.  Depending on the degree of infestation, fish with these parasites may be unsightly but are edible.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pimushe Lake is a 1,230-acre lake located 5 miles north of Pennington in Beltrami County.  There is a US Forest Service public water access with a concrete boat ramp and parking for 8 vehicles located on the east shore of the lake off of the Scenic Highway (State Highway 39).  Pimushe is managed for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Walleye, Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass.  A special regulation for Bluegill consisting of a 5-fish possession limit is in effect.  Statewide regulations apply to all other species.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Bluegill catch rate of 13.67 fish/trap net was near the median catch rate found in similar lakes (17.25 fish/trap net).  Bluegill captured had a good average size, with 58% of the catch exceeding 8 inches and fish up to 9.88 inches in length captured in the survey.  Pimushe is a popular destination for Bluegill anglers.  The special Bluegill regulation (5-fish limit) was reviewed extensively prior to being made permanent in 2014 and has proven to be an effective tool at limiting harvest and maintaining a high-quality Bluegill population.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate of 3.17 fish/trap net was comparable to some of the better catch rates found in similar lakes (3.18 fish/trap net).  Black Crappie up to 11.61 inches TL were captured in the survey.   <br> \n <br> \nPimushe Lake's Walleye population is maintained through natural reproduction and fish movement from the connected waters of the Turtle River and nearby Cass Lake.  Walleye numbers vary from year to year based on the strength of spawning migrations from these connected waters and the presence of barriers to migration such as beaver dams.  The 2017 Walleye catch rate of 2.25 fish/gill net was near the median catch rate for similar lakes (3.0 fish/gill net).  Walleye up to 22.36 inches in length were captured, with an average size of 15.78 inches in length and 1.38 lbs/fish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate (5.17 fish/gill net) was near the median catch rate for similar lakes.  Northern Pike had a small average size of 19.65 inches in length and 1.60lbs/fish.  The largest Northern Pike captured in 2017 measured 30.47 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass in Pimushe Lake were evaluated using night electrofishing.  Forty-six fish were captured in just under 2 hours.  Lengths of captured bass ranged from 3.2 to 17.8 inches and averaged 11.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2017 survey were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), Bowfin, White Sucker, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n</p>",
