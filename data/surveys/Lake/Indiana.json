                "narrative": "<p>Indiana Lake is located approximately 14 miles NE of Ely within the BWCAW. Because of its proximity to Basswood Lake and nearby entry points, Indiana is a popular lake with wilderness enthusiasts. Indiana Lake also has a reputation for quality bass fishing with some larger pike as an additional component. <br> \n <br> \nThere are portages from Basswood Lake and Good Lake for public access. A third option is a short portage near the Indiana Lake outlet which connects with the Hula Lake outlet entering Wind Bay on Basswood. There are two designated USFS campsites located on the N side of the lake for overnight use. <br> \n <br> \nSeven species of fish were sampled during the 2019 survey of Indiana Lake. Largemouth bass (59%) dominated the catch. Smallmouth bass were sampled in above average numbers and some good sized pike were also observed. The only other survey of Indiana Lake was completed in 1975. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers in 2019 were above the historical average of 6.3/gill net for this lake and well above the average of 0.5/gill net when compared to other similar area lakes where largemouth bass occur. The 2019 sample represents the highest gill net catch ever recorded for largemouth bass from an area lake. Largemouth average length was 13.1 inches (about 6 years old) which is larger than the historical average length of 9.3 inches. The largest largemouth sampled in 2019 measured 17.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers in 2019 were below the historical average of 5.6/gill net for Indiana Lake but above average when compared to other area lakes that are similar. Smallmouth average length was 14.3 inches which is larger than the historical average length of 13.4 inches. The largest smallmouth sampled was 15.9 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2019 were lower than the historical average of 2.4/gill net for this lake and slightly below average compared to other similar area lakes. However, pike sampled were of good size. Pike average length was 27.5 inches which is larger than the historical average length of 24.0 inches. The largest pike sampled in 2019 was 39.6 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
