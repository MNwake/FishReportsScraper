                "narrative": "<p>Hickory Lake is located on the Ripple River chain of lakes between Little Pine and Spirit lakes, approximately six miles south of Aitkin.  The lake is 197 acres with 56% of the lake being less than 15 feet deep and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  Public access is limited to a small sand access and shoreline within a Minnesota Department of Transportation wayside area at the inlet from the Ripple River.  Boaters can also gain access via a private campground on the west side of the lake. Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and silt, though areas of detritus, muck, gravel, rubble, and boulders may be found as well.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 35 species present and is integral to maintaining good water quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  While historically, Hickory has had moderately clear water (Secchi about 11 feet during past surveys), this survey had a Secchi depth of 24 feet, which has not previously been observed.  Lack of significant spring run-off in 2023 along with newly established populations of Zebra Mussels in upstream Little Pine and Farm Island Lakes, water clarity may tend to be clearer in the future. Hickory Lake is managed primarily for Bluegill and Northern Pike and secondarily for Walleye and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nHickory Lake has been regularly stocked with Walleyes in alternate years since 1954.  Although the numbers and sizes have varied, alternate year fingerling stocking was most common until 2017 when the management changed to a fry based stocking program. In addition to stocked Walleye, a spawning area on the Ripple River between Little Pine and Hickory Lake appears to be successful in producing some fish, and movement of fish from adjacent waters has also been observed. The 2023 Walleye catch of 0.8 per gill net was similar to past catches on Hickory, which average 1.1 per gill net, and is comparable to other similar lakes, yet does not meet the management goal of at least 3 per gill net.  Average length and weight were 19.5 inches and 2.3 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was above average when compared to similar lakes at 14.3/gill net in 2023. The 2023 catch was the highest catch rate that has been observed and exceeds the range of recommended levels (5-13 per gill net) for Hickory Lake.  Past catches have ranged from 7.0 to 13.5 per gill net, with an average of 11.1 per gill net.  Average length and weight were 19.2 inches and 1.7 pounds, with about 13% measuring at least 26 inches, and several over 30\" in length that were observed in the sample.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were caught in relatively modest numbers at 9.4 per trap net and with decent quality at over 15% greater than 8 inches. Previous Bluegill catches have ranged from 8.22 per trap net to 51 per trap net and averaged 26.8 per trap net. Prior to 2000, there were more Bluegills in the population but with a much poorer size structure (less than 2% over 8 inches). Bluegill size structure met the management goals in 2023 for size and numbers. Black Crappies were caught in low numbers at 0.7 per gill net and 0.2 per trap net.  Past Black Crappie catches have typically been low, ranging up to 1.7 per gill net and 0.8 per trap net. Crappie size structure was good in 2023, averaging 9\" with a maximum length of 11.3\". <br> \n</p>",

Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations and no seine was used at three stations due to site conditions. Nearshore sampling captured twenty species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, and Rock Bass) and zero that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Hickory Lake is Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Hickory Lake is fully supporting for aquatic life use. The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

The growth rate for the third increment was faster than normal. Growth rates for all other increments were normal. From these data an increase in walleye abundance from stocking could not be determined. Walleye have shown a significant increase in abundance since 1985 based on five gill nets sets. Bluegill have shown a significant increase in abundance since 1985 based on eight trap net sets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hickory Lake is located on the Ripple River chain of lakes and is downstream from Farm Island Lake. The fish community reflects this proximity, with the presence of tulibees and larger walleyes in the survey nets. The rest of the community resembles a typical lake for this lake class in Aitkin County. There are lots of small, young  northern pike  and just a few quality northerns. This has been consistent through a few surveys. A few larger northern pike do exist and are a favorite target of many anglers on Hickory Lake. The abundant northern pike keep the amount of larger forage, particularly yellow perch and white suckers,  cropped off and cause slow growth for both larger northern pike and larger walleyes.     There are also lots of small to medium sized sunfish and few large sunfish.  Over 70% of the sunfish in the trap nets were at least 6.0 inches long, so anglers have a good chance of catching many medium sized sunfish.   Largemouth bass probably do well in Hickory Lake. Their abundance is limited by predation from northern pike and the survivors are able to grow well on the forage base of small bluegills. Walleyes also swim in the waters of Hickory Lake and can reach large sizes. The walleyes in the survey gill nets ranged from 17.6 to 26.3 inches long. The absence of small walleyes is troubling, particularly given that walleye spawning habitat just upstream from Hickory Lake was improved and its success at producing spawning activity is documented.  Public access to the lake is limited to a small sand access and shoreline within a Minnesota Department of Transportation wayside area at the inlet from the Ripple River.  A small dam just downstream from the sand access limits everything except canoes and other very small watercraft. Canoes and other small watercraft may also be used to reach Hickory Lake from Spirit Lake, which is downstream. Boaters can also gain access for a fee through a private campground on the west side of the lake. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye have been stocked in Hickory Lake regularly since 1954.  Although the stocking density and sizes have varied, alternate year fingerling stocking was the most common method used.  The current stocking strategy of 2 pounds per littoral acre of fingerlings, stocked in alternate (odd-numbered) years, began in 2007.  This assessment was conducted to assist in evaluating the current stocking plan.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches during the 6 previous nettings have ranged from 0.4 to 2.0/net with mean and median values of 1.1 and 1.0/net, respectively.  The 2015 walleye catch of 1.0/gill net was similar to these past catches, though it was still below the management goal of 3-5/gill net.  The 6 walleye caught in the 2015 survey ranged in size from 15.1 to 19.4 inches, with a mean length of 19.4 inches.  Five year classes were present, which met the management goal of 4 year classes.  Four out of the 6 fish were from non-stocked years. This was similar to what was observed in a 2010 ice-out assessment when multiple non-stocked year classes were observed in the 65 fish sample from the spring spawning run (2010 Hickory special assessment, 4/14/2010). In 2015, two of the four walleyes from non-stocked years were from the 2010 year class, which also corresponded with a non-stocked year in neighboring and connected Farm Island and Spirit Lakes, suggesting that these were indeed naturally reproduced fish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers remained high and were above the normal range for lake class 29 lakes at 12.8/ gill net, although nearly 20% were over 24 inches long.  High northern pike numbers have likely been contributing to poor walleye fingerling survival and ultimately the lower walleye density at Hickory Lake.  Black crappie and yellow perch numbers remained low. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hickory Lake is located on the Ripple River chain of lakes between Pine Lake and Spirit Lake.  The lake consists of 197 acres and is classified as a northern pike and bluegill type lake.  The public access is limited to a small sand access and shoreline within a Minnesota Department of Transportation wayside area at the inlet from the Ripple River.  A small dam just downstream from the sand access limits everything except canoes and other very small watercraft.  Boaters can also gain access for a fee through a private campground on the west side of the lake.  Fish population indices have remained relatively stable over the past several surveys in Hickory Lake.  Northern pike abundance was above average this assessment and has been the last three surveys.  The northern pike catch index for gill nets was 10.5 fish per net and this abundance of pike should provide anglers consistent pike fishing.  The average northern pike was 18 inches in length and weight about 1.5 pounds.  The largest northern pike observed during the survey was 32.8 inches in length.  The number of walleyes has remained stable when compared to past surveys.  Though, the abundance of walleyes was a little below average, they were above average in size.  The average walleye captured was 19 inches, while the largest was nearly 29 inches in length and weighed 8.25 pounds.  Hickory Lake has been stocked every other year with walleye fingerlings.  Walleye-spawning habitat exists just upstream of Hickory Lake over which spawning fish have been observed, however no small walleyes were caught.  The abundance of yellow perch, a favorite prey species of both walleye and northern pike, was low.  Anglers' efforts can increase the abundance of yellow perch, an important forage species, by releasing northern pike greater than 22 inches and harvesting smaller pike.  This voluntary action may reduce predation pressure on yellow perch while at the same time increasing angler catch rates of larger pike.  Net catches of black crappies were similar to past surveys and are near the low range for this lake type.  Growth rates for black crappies were good with sizes ranging from 5 to 11 inches in length.  Trap net catches of bluegills decreased from the previous survey and averaged 14.4 fish per net.  This decrease however, represents a good trend for bluegills in this lake.  A lower abundance of bluegills may reduce competition for food resources between panfish allowing for better growth.  Growth rates were generally good with 25 percent larger than 6 inches.  Largemouth bass abundance indicated by trap nets was near the low end of the normal range for this lake type.  Other species sampled in the fish community include bowfin, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and black and yellow bullheads.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hickory Lake is located on the Ripple River chain of lakes between Little Pine and Spirit lakes, approximately six miles south of Aitkin.  The lake is 197 acres with 56% of the lake being less than 15 feet deep and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  Public access is limited to a small sand access and shoreline within a Minnesota Department of Transportation wayside area at the inlet from the Ripple River.  Boaters can also gain access via a private campground on the west side of the lake.  Development is moderate with 12.5 homes per shoreline mile.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and silt, though areas of detritus, muck, gravel, rubble, and boulders may be found as well.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 35 species present and is integral to maintaining good water quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.   <br> \n <br> \nHickory Lake has been regularly stocked with walleyes in alternate years since 1954.  Although the numbers and sizes have varied, alternate year fingerling stocking was most common.  In addition to stocked walleye, a spawning area on the Ripple River between Little Pine and Hickory Lake appears to be successful in producing fish.  The 2010 walleye catch of 1.3/gill net was similar to past catches on Hickory which average 1.1/gill net, and average when compared to other similar lakes.  Average length and weight were 20.7\" and 3.3 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was above average when compared to similar lakes at 12.7/gill net in 2010.  Past catches have ranged from 7.0 to 13.5/gill net with an average of 10.4/gill net.  Average length and weight were 17.6\" and 1.4 lbs with 13% measuring at least 24\", and several over 30\" in length observed in the gill net sample.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and tullibee are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Though the 2010 catch of 1.3/gill net was the highest to date, it is still low when compared to similar lakes; however, the slower growth of perch in Hickory Lake limits the efficiency of the gill nets because the perch are generally too small to be captured in most of the meshes of the nets.  The tullibee catch of 1.0/gill net also matches the highest catch to date and was average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length of these fish was 8.4\", and was the result of good recruitment in 2008 and 2009. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were caught in relatively low numbers at 8.8/trap net.  Black crappies were also caught in low numbers at 0.5/gill net and 0.3/trap net.  Past catches have typically been low, ranging up to 0.7/gill net and 0.8/trap net.  Half the crappies measured at least 8\" and 27% of bluegills measured at least 7.5\", and 1 was observed that was over 8\" in length. <br> \n</p>",
