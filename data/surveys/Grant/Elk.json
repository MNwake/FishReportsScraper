                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catches continue to be high (13.50 fish/net), but slightly less than recorded in the 1984 survey. Mean weight of the walleye has increased from 0.8 lbs. in 1984 to 1.0 lbs. in 1988. Walleye fry have been stocked in alternate years and apparently recruit to a catchable size. The 1986 year-class appears to have come from natural reproduction. Walleye growth rates are excellent, which is typical of a prairie lake. Yellow perch numbers are high (19.5 fish/net), but have decreased from previous surveys. Yellow perch are likely the primary prey of walleye. No northern pike were taken in gillnets and only three were sampled in trapnets. Low northern pike abundance is desirable towards maintaining the good walleye fishery. Bluegill and black crappie are available in sufficient numbers and sizes to contribute to the sport fishery. Carp and bullheads were netted, but didn't appear to be present in nuisance or undesirable numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elk Lake is a 190-acre basin located near the town of Hoffman in Grant County.  It is the most heavily used recreational lake in Grant County during summer months.  It draws people from many communities in the western part of the state where quality lakes are limited.  Boat traffic can be heavy on week-ends and a nuisance to anglers.  Water clarity is the major draw for most people.  Secchi disk measurements have averaged about 7 feet during summer months over the past five years.  The lake fully supports swimming and a popular public beach is located near the public access on the southeast side of the lake.  Most anglers that visit Elk Lake are targeting walleye.  Walleye were abundant in 2001.  Gill net catches averaged 17.0 fish per net.  Walleye grow rapidly in Elk Lake.  Two year old fish averaged  16.5 inches  in August.  Walleye fry are stocked in alternate years to sustain the walleye fishery.  However,  the age class distribution indicates that two-thirds of the fish captured in gill nets correspond to years of no stocking.  Elk Lake also supports a quality largemouth bass population.  Electrofishing  yielded 42.0 fish per hour.  One-third of the fish captured were 15 inches in length or greater.  Yellow perch are abundant and provide an additional angling opportunity.Northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie numbers are limited.  Bluegill and black crappie abundance has been limited since the 1980's.  Northern pike numbers were limited in the earliest recorded surveys.  Northern pike fry have been stocked in recent years to increase their numbers.  The success of these stockings is unclear at this time.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Total sportfish catches continued to decline. Those species with increased catch rates included white sucker, black, and brown bullhead. The total biomass of fish captured in gillnets increased in response to a greater catch rate of black bullhead. Walleye gillnet catch rate decreased from 13.50 fish/net in the 1988 survey to 7.00 fish/net in 1989; however, mean weight increased to 1.94 lbs. Size distribution was also improved. PSD increased from 22.0 to 68.0 percent. Growth rates and size distribution was also improved. PSD increased from 22.0 to 68.0 percent. Growth rates are excellent. Age 4 walleye averaged 16.6 inches in total length while age 5 averaged 19.1 inches in total length. Year class strength was highly correlated with stocking efforts. The 1987 and 1985 year classes were established from fry stockings and the 1984 year class was probably the result of a fingerling stockings. The 1986 year class was not represented and correspondingly no stocking occurred that year; however, the 1988 survey indicated a fairly strong 1986 year class. These fish are either present in elk lake and were not sampled and/or scales were not aged correctly in 1988. Northern pike catch rates continue to be very low. No northerns were sampled in the gillnets in 1988 or 1989. Three fish were captured in the trapnets in 1988 and only one in 1989 netting efforts. Historically, yellow perch gillnet catches had been high; however, gillnet catches dropped to 19.5 fish/gillnet in 1988 and continued to decline in 1989 to 4.75 yellow perch/gillnet. Yellow perch have a fast growth rate and are capable of attaining 7.0 inches in total length at age 3. Bluegill numbers are relatively low in comparison to other area lakes. Low catch rates and a PSD of 80.0 percent would suggest only limited natural reproduction or recruitment. Catch rates have decreased to 1.43 fish/trapnet. Catch rates approached 29.0 fish/trapnet in 1984. Crappie have not been well represented in this and past surveys; however, trend analyses may suggest some decrease in relative abundance. A white crappie was captured for the first time during the 1989 survey. The black bullhead population has increased.</p>",

Unstable water levels, loss ofsubmergent vegetation, and degraded water quality have coincided with a shift in fish communitystructure towards more tolerant and open-water species.Walleye catches averaged 2.3 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range of mean catch rates fromlakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (1.2 -5.3 fish/gillnet).  However gillnetcatches have declined over the past fifteen years, averaging 19.0, 13.5, 7.0, and 5.0 fish/net in 1984,1988, 1989, and 1992, respectively.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1997 was 3.3 pounds.  Fish rangedfrom 17.9 to 23.1 inches in total length.  Age-3 fish comprised 50% of the fish captured in gillnets. This year class corresponds to a year of no stocking.  The yellow perch population has exploded. Gillnet catches averaged 154.8 fish/net, compared to 12.8 fish/net in 1992.  Gillnet catches rangedfrom 4.8 to 47.4 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1984.  The normal range of mean catchrates from similar lakes is 3.7 - 28.4 fish/gillnet.  Most of the fish captured were between 5.0 and8.0 inches in total length.  Black bullhead catches averaged 77.7 fish/gillnet, similar to the catchrate of 63.8 fish/gillnet recorded in 1992.  Gillnet catches were lower in previous surveys; averaging20.5, 4.8, and 3.2 fish/net in 1989, 1988, and 1984, respectively.  Mean weight of fish captured in1997 was 0.4 pounds.  Centrarchid populations are limited.  Three black crappie were captured intrapnets.  Fish ranged from 8.5 - 9.3 inches in total length.  Seven largemouth bass ranging from 6.8to 7.6 inches in total length were also present in trapnet catches. Bluegill were not present intrapnet catches.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elk Lake is a 190-acre basin located near the town of Hoffman in Grant County.  It is the most heavily used recreational lake in Grant County during summer months.  Boat traffic can be extremely high, especially during weekend days, and is often considered a nuisance to some anglers.  The major draw for recreational boaters is good water clarity.  The long-term average for Secchi disk measurements exceeds 7.0 feet.  The lake fully supports swimming and a popular beach is located near the public access on the southeast shore.Most anglers that visit Elk Lake are targeting walleye.  Walleye abundance has substantially declined since the last survey in 2001.  However, the lake currently supports a low to moderately abundant population of larger fish.  Most fish captured in the 2005 survey exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  A high percentage of those fish also exceeded 20.0 inches.  Walleye grow very fast in Elk Lake with most fish exceeding 17.0 inches after just three growing seasons.  Natural reproduction sustains this fishery but supplemental fry stockings occur on an alternate year basis to augment natural reproduction.  The sunfish community (bass, bluegill, and crappie) has expanded greatly in recent years.  Anglers can expect an abundant largemouth bass population that is comprised mostly of smaller fish.  The 2002 year class comprised over 70% of the 2005 capture sample.  Size structure of the population will likely improve as this strong year class recruits to the fishery.  Bluegill and black crappie are moderately abundant but young fish dominate these two populations.  Consequently, size structure is relatively poor.  Northern pike and yellow perch numbers are currently limited.  Northern pike abundance has historically been low.  Fry stockings were completed in the late 1990s to improve pike numbers.  Recent survey data suggests these stocking efforts have been unsuccessful in bolstering pike abundance.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elk Lake is a 190-acre basin located near Hoffman in Grant County.  It is the most heavily used recreational lake in Grant County during summer months.  Boat traffic can be extremely high, especially during weekend days.  The major draw for recreational boaters is good water quality.  The long-term average for Secchi disk measurements exceeds 7.0 feet.  The lake fully supports swimming.  A city beach and campground are located near the public access on the southwest shore. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect good quality fishing opportunities on Elk Lake.  Walleye catches averaged 7.5 fish/gillnet.  Approximately 28% of sampled fish exceeded 20.0 inches in length.  Two percent of walleye captures exceeded 25.0 inches.  Walleye grow fast in Elk Lake.  Most reach 16.0 inches after three growing seasons.  Northern pike are not abundant.  The 2009 catch rate of 2.0 fish/gillnet was the highest recorded catch rate for Elk Lake.  Average length of captured pike was 25.0 inches.  The largest fish measured 31.9 inches.  Bluegill abundance has increased in response to better water clarity and expanded vegetated habitat.  Trapnet catches averaged 11.0 fish/net.  The population was dominated by age-3 and age-4 fish.  Average length of sampled fish was 6.2 inches.  No captures exceeded 8.0 inches.  Bluegill growth rates are good with age-4 fish averaging 5.5 inches in length.  Largemouth bass are abundant.  Average size was 14.9 inches in length and 1.9 pounds.  Five- and seven-year-old individuals comprised most captures.  Fishing quality, in terms of average size of bass, should continue to improve in coming years. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bluegill catches averaged 2.9 fish/trapnet in 1992 which is below the interquartile range of mean catch rates (6.5 to 47.2 fish/trapnet) for lakes within lake classification 33.  A long range goal of 10 - 15 fish/trapnet is stated in the lake management plan.  Trapnet catch rates averaged 28.9 fish/ net in 1984, but decreased to 2.8 fish/net and 1.4 fish/net in 1988 and 1989, respectively.  Most of the fish captured in 1992 were between 3.0 and 4.0 inches in total length.  No fish exceeded 6.0 inches in total length.  Scale samples were not collected therefore age and growth analysis is not possible.  Adult Bluegill were stocked in 1990 and 1991 at a rate of approximately 10 fish/surface acre in order to enhance Bluegill.  The catch rate recorded during the 1992 survey indicates that this was not an effective strategy.  Successful reproduction of Bluegill was documented in 1990 when shoreline seining averaged 91 young-of-the-year Bluegill per haul.  However Bluegill were not captured during shoreline seining in 1991 and 1992.  The loss of aquatic vegetation has resulted in a lack of suitable spawning habitat and escape cover which is likely limiting Bluegill abundance.  Daytime, ac electrofishing yielded eight Largemouth Bass in 0.75 hours which results in a catch rates of 10.7 fish/hour.  All of the bass captured exceeded 16.0 inches in total length.  Most of the bass were captured in one stand of hardstem bulrush that has become re-established.  The growth rate of Largemouth Bass in Elk Lake exceeds the mean growth rate of Largemouth Bass is other area lakes within lake class 33.  Age 5 fish averaged 15.1 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  The low catch rate and skewed size distribution indicates a lack of natural recruitment.  Fluctuating water levels and loss of aquatic vegetation may have limited spawning success for several years during the late 1980's.  Conditions for spawning may have improved in recent years.  Numerous young-of-the-year Largemouth Bass were captured during shoreline seining in 1991 and 1992, and five substock-size Largemouth Bass were captured in trapnets during the 1992 population assessment.  Northern Pike have not been captured in gillnets during the last three population assessments (1988, 1989, and 1992).  The Northern Pike population was previously sustained by stocking winter rescued fish from 1958 through 1980.  Catch rates averaged 3.5 fish/ gillnet and 3.0 fish/gillnet in 1973 and 1979, respectively.  Spawning habitat is limited.  The stocking of winter rescue Northern Pike is likely necessary to provide limited fishing opportunities.  Black Crappie catches averaged 1.1 fish/trapnet in 1992.  Catch have been highly variable in past surveys.  The normal range of mean catch rates for lake class 33 is 0.8 to 6.0 fish/trapnet.  Fourteen of fifteen fish captured were cohorts of the 1991 year class (age 1).  No young-of-the-year Black Crappie were collected during shoreline seining.  Walleye catches averaged 5.0 fish/ gillnet which exceeds the third quartile of mean catch rates from lakes within lake class 33.  This catch rate also meets the stated long range goal of 5-8 fish per gillnet stated in the lake management plan.  There has been a trend of decreasing Walleye catch rates since 1979.  Catch rates averaged 22.5 fish/net, 19.0 fish/net, 13.5 fish/net, and 7.0 fish/net in 1979, 1984, 1988, and 1989, respectively.  It is not surprising that a lake with the physical and biological characteristic of Elk Lake could not sustain the high catch rates recorded in earlier surveys.  The two latest catch rates are more desirable in terms of fish community balance.  Size distribution of Walleye captured in gillnets during the 1992 population assessment is indicative of a trophy Walleye fishery.  Mean weight of fish captured was 3.6 pounds and lengths ranged from 16.0 to 27.0 inches in total length.  Growth of Walleye in Elk Lake is excellent.  Age 4 fish averaged 17.7 inches in total length at time of annulus formation. Analysis of the age class distribution indicates that fry stockings have been successful in producing year classes.  Natural reproduction is also evident.  A notable number of age 0 Walleye captured in trapnets or gilled in the lead of trapnets during the 1992 population assessment. Yellow Perch catches averaged 12.8 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range of 2.0 to 24.5 fish/ gillnet for lake class 33.  Yellow Perch catch rates have declined steadily since 1979.  The decline may correlate with high Walleye densities and degraded environmental conditions.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1992 was 0.2 pounds.  PSD was calculated at 11.8%.  Young-of-the-year yellow perch were not captured during shoreline seining.  Carp were not captured in gillnets and trapnets, but were observed while electrofishing and collected in shoreline seining hauls.  User groups and residents have expressed concern over carp density.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elk Lake is a 207-acre lake located two miles north of Hoffman in Grant County. Average and maximum depth are 15 and 29 feet, respectively. Water clarity was 7.5 feet during the survey. City-owned beach and campground facilities are located on the south shore next to the public access. Because of this it is a popular recreational lake that can become busy during the summer.\n\nElk is primarily managed for its Walleye fishery and the Walleye abundance is high (14.7/gill net) when compared to similar lakes, or recent surveys. Analysis has shown that the Walleye population is primarily driven by natural reproduction. Most of the Walleye sampled were young, with lengths under 15 inches. However, growth is fast, with fish reaching 16.2 inches by age 3. Most fish should be harvestable size with one more year of growth. Average and maximum length were 16.0 and 27.5 inches, respectively. \n\nBluegill are currently very abundant (106.1/trap net), significantly higher than recent surveys, but so far this has not negatively affected growth. Even though most Bluegill were young, over 39% of fish sampled in trap nets exceeded 7 inches. Average and maximum length were 6.4 and 8.5 inches, respectively. If growth continues at this rate, Elk Lake should provide excellent fishing opportunity for Bluegills over the next several years\n\nElk Lake supports a healthy Largemouth Bass population in terms of both size and numbers. The bass catch rate (96.7/ hour) increased from the 2015 survey. In addition, the size structure continues to be impressive, with 75% of bass exceeding 15 inches. Average length was 15.3 inches and the largest bass sampled was 19.9 inches. \n\nYellow Perch abundance (5.8/gill net) was below the long term average (32.8/gill net), but this has not affected growth of predators that consume perch. Perch were not sampled at lengths that would be of interest to anglers, ranging from 5.7 to 8.1 inches. \n\nFew Black Crappie or Northern Pike were sampled, but neither species has been abundant in any recent survey. Other species sampled were Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elk Lake is a 207-acre lake located two miles north of Hoffman in Grant County.  Maximum depth is 29.0 feet.  Average depth is estimated at 15.0 feet.  It's a very popular recreational lake that fully supports fishing and swimming.  City-owned beach and campground facilities are located on the south shore next to the public access.  Water clarity is relatively good compared to other lakes in Grant County, with average transparency measurements approaching 7.0 feet during summer months.  The lake can become busy, particularly on weekends. <br> \n <br> \nPrimary fish management emphasis is directed at sustaining a Walleye fishery.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in even-numbered years to supplement the population.  Walleye catches during the 2015 survey averaged 4.7-fish/gill net.  Captures averaged 15.0 inches in length.  The largest Walleye measured during the survey was 26.1 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nElk Lake does not support many Northern Pike.  Only one capture was documented in 2015.  This fish measured 24.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass currently offer the best angling opportunities in Elk Lake.  Electrofishing catch rates in the spring of 2015 were 50/hour.  Age distribution of captures extended to age 12.  Due to fast growth, 57% of captures were 15.0 inches and larger.  The largest bass caught measured 18.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther sunfishes captured during the survey included Black Crappies, Bluegills, Green Sunfish, and Hybrid Sunfishes.  Fishing quality at time of the 2015 survey was degraded by the lack of older sunfishes.  Bluegill catches were good at 20.1-fish/trap net, but none of the captures exceeded age 4.  Most of the catch was comprised of two-year-old Bluegill.  One 8.5-inch Bluegill was measured, but average size of the population sample was 5.8 inches.  Black Crappie catches were modest and young.  Age distribution of the crappie catch did not extend beyond age 2.  Only one 9.0-inch crappie was measured.  Sunfishes grow fast in Elk Lake, so fishing quality should improve with additional recruitment and a broader age distribution.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches were good.  This important prey population supports good growth of predator gamefishes, but most perch are too small to contribute to the fishery.  Average size captured in gill nets was 6.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nVery few Black, Yellow, or Brown Bullheads were captured in 2015.  No Common Carp have been captured during the two most recent surveys.    <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
