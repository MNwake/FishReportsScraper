Also, pounds since the net catches are above the third quartile of the regional median. Also, pounds per net for these species was above average: northern pike, black bullhead, brown bullhead and pumpkinseed net catches indicate average size population since they fell between the first and third quartile of the regional median. Black crappie abundance was below average with catches below the first quartile of the regional median. Three gillnets were set in October 1949, and June of 1967, 1981 and 1986. Based on these net catches, northern pike populations have ranged from a low of 2.0/gillnet in 1968 to a high of 12.0/gillnet in 1981. 1986 had 5.0/gillnet. Walleye and yellow perch have never been present in the gill or trapnets, 23 were found seining in 1968. Northern pike aged (15 of 16) fish showed 3-7 age classes present. Age classes 3 and 4 contributed 80% of the northern pike. Age class 5 exhibited an above average growth rate while age classes 3, 6 and 7 exhibited average growth rates and age class 4 exhibited a slow growth rate compared to the statewide average growth rates.</p>",

With low development along the shoreline, it can offer a unique experience for those wishing to get away from some of the more highly used lakes and would be a great place for a canoe or small boat.  While the opportunity to catch some fish is there, size is a little small other than largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were the healthiest looking fish species in the lake, with a spring electrofishing catch rate of 135.7/hr.  Size was decent, with an average length of 12.6\" and 67 % measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were average (6.0/gill net), but size was lacking.  Average length was 19.2\" and only one fish over 24\" was captured during the 2016 survey. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were average for this type of lake for both black crappie (0.7/gill net) and bluegill (14.0/trap net).  Average length for black crappie was 7.0\", with 40% measuring 8\" or larger.  Average length for bluegill was 6.0\", with 27% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",
