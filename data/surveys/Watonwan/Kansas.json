                "narrative": "<p>Kansas is a 398 acre lake with a maximum depth of about 7.0 feet located near St. James in Watonwan County.  The lake is presently managed for walleye as the primary species while black crappie and yellow perch are managed secondarily.  Walleye catch rates were fairly low compared to past surveys we have conducted on Kansas Lake.  Only one walleye was sampled over 12 inches.  The lower catch rates may be attributed to a partial winterkill during the winter of 2000 and 2001.  It should be noted however that some 2 to 3 pound walleye were observed through the ice by area anglers during the winter of 2002.  The lake was stocked with fingerlings in the Fall of 2001.Yellow perch catch rates were good compared to lakes like Kansas.  Several yellow perch in the 10.5 to 11.0 inch range were sampled during the survey.  A local angler reported catching some yellow perch up to 12.0 inches during the winter of 2002.Black crappie catch rates were low compared to lakes like Kansas but similar to catches we have had in previous years.  Lengths of black crappie ranged from 7.6 to 9.5 inches with an average length of about 8.6 inches.Largemouth bass are not managed for in Kansas Lake, however a fair population exists in the lake.  Four largemouth bass were sampled during the survey and averaged about 1.8 pounds.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Kansas Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

Since 2018, Kansas Lake has been included in a research project that is evaluating the performance of two strains of Walleye, the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) and the Mississippi Strain (MIS).  However, during 2020, no stocking was done as no Walleye egg-take operations were conducted due to the start of the COVID pandemic causing a DNR close-contact work moratorium.  Walleye stocking, including the performance evaluation, was restarted in 2021. The total fry quota for Kansas Lake was 199,000, of which half were MIS and half were LMS.  The MIS Walleye come from northern Minnesota and until recently, were the primary strain stocked in Windom management area lakes.  The LMS originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Kansas Lake has areas of spawning habitat and has shown sporadic natural reproduction, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes.  To evaluate strain performance in 2021, 210 Walleye fingerlings were needed from Kansas Lake. Night and day electrofishing was used to collect the Walleye for the study.  Standard night electrofishing (2 hours) was conducted on 23 September 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nThe fingerling quota was not met with standard night electrofishing as only 101 fingerlings were captured during 2 hours of electrofishing (46.8 per hour).  Fingerlings ranged in length from 4.7 to 7.2 inches and averaged 5.5 inches.  The remainder of the quota (N=109) of Walleye fingerling were caught with a combination of day and night electrofishing during the following weeks in September and October.  Remaining consistent on the genetic return of Age 0 Walleye captured, 73% of the fish collected were LMS origin.  About 25% of the fish collected were MIS origin and another 2% natural reproduction.  The message is similar to other years data in that LMS Walleye may have a distinct advantage in our southern MN lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kansas Lake is a 398-acre, class 43 lake, located in Watonwan County, approximately 5 miles southwest of the City of St. James. Kansas Lake has a mean depth of 5.0 ft. and a maximum depth of 7.0 ft.  Kansas Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, and secondarily for Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Kansas Lake has been prone to winterkill. The most recent winterkill occurred during the winter of 2007-2008, but was only a partial kill. Winter of 2022-2023 was harsh and greater than 20 lakes in southern Minnesota lakes experienced some verified level of winterkill. Kansas Lake did not have any obvious signs of winterkill as no dead fish were found after ice-off and we had angler reports of catching Walleye until the end of February on the lake. Additionally, during winter 2022-2023 Kansas Lake never had dissolved oxygen levels observed less than the 2.0 ppm threshold where we see stress in fish. However, anglers were having difficulties catching Walleye on or after May fishing opener during the spring of 2023. Therefore, a quick daytime electrofishing assessment was conducted June 9, 2023 to see what species were present. <br> \n <br> \nNine species were sampled in daytime electrofishing. Those species were Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, Freshwater Drum, Northern Pike, Walleye, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. Adults of all species of fish but Walleye were observed during sampling. Walleye caught (N=57) only ranged in length from 6.6 to 8.4 inches. While it was a bit concerning to only see age-1 Walleye, it did not mean that adults were not present. Daytime sampling, especially in clear water, typically results in few adult Walleyes observed near shore. Additionally, the presence of adult Freshwater Drum which are very susceptible to low dissolved oxygen and will die during harsh winters were found alive. Evidence suggested that adult Walleye were present, even when they were not caught in daytime electrofishing. Later summer and fall reports of Walleye being caught by anglers further indicated their presence. Finally, a naturally reproduced year class of Walleye was observed during ice-angling by one of the DNR fisheries staff in Windom added further evidence of adult Walleye in Kansas Lake. Curiously, it was not determined why such few adult Walleye, if any, were caught during May and early June of 2023. Additional sampling will be conducted to determine the relative abundance of fish in Kansas Lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kansas Lake is a shallow prairie lake located four miles southwest of St. James.  Walleye and yellow perch have been the mainstay of the Kansas Lake fishery for many years.  The lake management plan indicates walleye as the primary species of management with yellow perch, black crappie, and black bullhead as secondary species. The walleye population continued to look good in 1997, exceeding the management goal.  Due to a strong 1995 natural year class, walleye numbers were similar to 1989 and 1993 surveys.  Almost 60% of the walleye sampled in 1997 resulted from natural reproduction.  Walleye numbers for the last three surveys have been higher than most lakes similar to Kansas Lake.  Walleye ranged from 10 to 23 inches and averaged 1.3 pounds.  Walleye angling should be good for the next couple years.  However, as with any fishing, if the fish have a lot of natural food it makes them more difficult to catch.Yellow perch populations often fluctuate from year to year.  Spring weather conditions, water levels, and the other species in the lake all affect the success of a given year class.  In 1997, yellow perch numbers were lower than in 1993 but similar to 1989.  Yellow perch ranged from 5 to 12 inches and averaged 8.1.  Even at a lower population level, yellow perch should provide decent fishing for the next few years.Kansas Lake continued to support a moderate population of black crappie.  Black crappie numbers were lower in 1997 than in 1993 but typically similar to other lakes like Kansas.  Black crappie ranged from 7.7 to 13.7 inches and averaged 9.3 inches.  The lake will require at least one  strong year class before black crappie fishing will be anything but fair.   Kansas Lake generally supports a low to moderate population of black bullhead.  However, in 1997 we sampled relatively few black bullhead.  Although black bullhead numbers were lower than in 1993, the fish were large, ranging from 6 to almost 14 inches.  To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Kansas Lake through watershed management.  Improved land use practices will help insure this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kansas is a 398 acre lake, has a maximum depth of 7 feet and is located just south and west of St. James in Watonwan County.  The lake has been aerated since 1984.  Kansas is managed primarily for walleye while northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie are managed secondarily.  Presently the lake is stocked every other year, once with walleye fry and the next time with walleye fingerlings.  The walleye gill net catch rate was similar to what we would expect in lakes like Kansas.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 15.1 to 27.7 inches and averaged 18.7 inches.  All the walleye sampled were from years when we stocked either walleye fry or fingerlings.  The highest number caught were from the year 2001 when walleye fingerlings were stocked. Northern pike fingerlings were stocked in 2003 and 2004 in an effort to try and re-establish the northern pike population.  All the northern pike sampled in the survey were two years of age, which coincides with the northern pike fingerlings stocked in 2003.  Lengths of northern pike caught in our trap nets ranged from 18.9 to 24.4 inches and averaged 20.3 inches.The yellow perch gill net catch rate of 24.3 perch per net was very good.  We would expect the catch rate to be anywhere from 2.6 to 25.0 for lakes similar to Kansas.  Length of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 7.1 to 12.5 inches and averaged 10.2 inches.  Five different ages of yellow perch were observed in the survey which indicates good natural reproduction or recruitment.  The black crappie catch rate was in the range we would expect for lakes similar to Kansas.  Lengths of black crappie sampled in our trap nets ranged from 4.6 to 11.1 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.  The majority of the population were one and two years of age in 2005.Another popular fish in the spring on Kansas is the black bullhead.  The catch rate was fairly low when compared to lakes similar to Kansas but the average size was big.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in our trap nets ranged from 5.4 to 14.5 inches and averaged 11.9 inches with an average weight of 1.1 pounds.  Twelve of the 19 black bullheads caught were over 12 inches or longer.Other fish caught in our nets included bigmouth buffalo, bluegills, largemouth bass, white suckers, carp, yellow bullheads, and green sunfish.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Kansas Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kansas Lake is managed primarily for walleye and it currently contains a good population.  Survey nets indicated that the walleye population is higher than most other lakes similar to Kansas Lake.  A population estimate was conducted in the spring and summer of 1993 and it was found that there were approximately nine walleyes per acre.  Walleyes ranged fromm 7 to 29 inches and averaged 1.4 pounds.     Secondary species for which Kansas Lake is managed for are yellow perch and black crappie.  According to the net catches, the yellow perch population in Kansas Lake was twice as high as other similar lakes.  Yellow perch ranged from 5 to nearly 14 inches.  Black crappie abundance was similar to that of lakes like Kansas Lake.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 4 to nearly 13 inches.     The yellow perch and black crappie populations are good examples of natural fluctuations in the abundance of a year class (especially in shallow, prairie lakes).  Based on the samples, the yellow perch population was primarily age-2 fish (68 percent), and the black crappie population was dominated by age-1 fish (88 percent).  It is not uncommon for a whole year class to be absent in a population.  In addition, it does not take very many adults to produce a strong year class when the habitat and spring weather conditions are right.     Bonus species that are present but are not specifically managed include: northern pike, bluegill, largemouth bass, and black bullhead.  Do not overlook the quality black bullhead population if you enjoy fishing bullheads.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 6 to nearly 14 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kansas is a 398-acre lake located southwest of St. James in Watonwan County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 7.0 feet and is a class 43 lake.  The lake is managed for walleye primarily while northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie are managed secondarily.  A partial winterkill was suspected during the winter of 2007-08.  A Winterkill Assessment during the spring of 2008 indicated that yellow perch survived the low oxygen levels fairly well.  The lake was stocked with walleye and northern pike fry and northern pike fingerlings during the spring of 2008.  Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, and adults were stocked into the lake in 2009.  Oxygen levels dropped to below 2 ppm again during the winter of 2009-10. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were high when compared to other lakes with similar morphology and chemical characteristics.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 9.8 to 19.2 inches and averaged 13.1 inches.  The majority of walleye sampled (88% of the walleye sampled) were age 2 and were likely the result of a fry stocking in 2008.  The rest of the fish were age 3 and 4 which were likely the result of fingerling stockings in 2006 and 2007.  The strong year class of 12 inch walleye is the primary reason for the high gill net catch rate in 2009.  It is hopeful that since the walleye are small, low oxygen levels during the winter of 2009-10 will have a minimal impact on the walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were very high when compared to other lakes similar to Kansas.  Lengths of yellow perch sampled in gill nets ranged from 6.0 to 12.1 inches with an average length of 10.0 inches.  Many of the perch caught in our gill nets were in the 9.5 to 11.0 inch range. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were also high when compared to lakes similar to Kansas.  Lengths of northern pike caught in our gill nets ranged from 15.9 to 27.1 inches with an average length of 19.8 inches.  There were three northern pike sampled in trap nets that were over 30 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were what we would expect for lakes similar to Kansas.  Lengths of black crappie caught in our trap nets ranged from 4.1 to 9.8 inches with an average length of 6.6 inches.  There appears to be two year classes of black crappie present in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThere are good numbers of black bullhead in Kansas for those who would like a meal of fresh bullhead.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in our trap nets ranged from 3.9 to 12.3 inches with an average length of 8.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during the assessment included bigmouth buffalo, common carp, yellow bullhead, and green sunfish.  <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Kansas Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kansas Lake is a 398 acre lake southwest of St. James, MN in Watonwan County.   Kansas Lake has a history of Walleye reproduction and has some good spawning habitat.  This history and habitat led to the inclusion of Kansas Lake in a Walleye genetic performance study.  Department of Natural Resource researchers are comparing the effectiveness of two genetic strains of Walleye.  Historically the Windom area had received \"northern strains\" of Walleye from northern Minnesota Walleye spawning runs.  This was a very cost effective way of stocking Walleye statewide. However, a \"southern strain\" of Walleye was identified as unique and Lake Sarah in Murray County is a source of this strain.  Lake Sarah has not been stocked since 1991 and has maintained excellent numbers of Walleye naturally. An egg take has been conducted on Lake Sarah to raise these fish since 2015.  The two strains were stocked equally into Kansas Lake to test for differences in contribution to the catch.  Electrofishing for fall fingerling Walleye was used in October 2018.  Fin clips of each fish sampled was collected and sent for DNA analysis and determination of strain.   <br> \n <br> \nSix 15 minute electrofishing stations were used during the night of October 1, 2018 to collect Walleye for DNA analysis.  Ninety-seven Walleye fingerling were sampled in 90 minutes of sampling for a total catch rate of 52.91 per hour of electrofishing.  Walleye ranged in length from 5.31 to 8.86 inches with a mean length of 7.80 inches.  Additionally, 92 more Walleye fingerling were sampled to add to the total number of fish submitted for genetic analysis.  Preliminary genetic samples indicate that the distribution is 4 southern strain to every 1 northern strain or naturally reproduced fish or 151 southern strain fish and 38 northern strain or naturally reproduced fish.  This indicates that the southern LMS strain may have a competitive advantage in Kansas Lake and may be better suited to survive.  However, we need to continue examining the contribution of each strain until they are old enough to be caught by anglers.  This will be the better indication of successful stocking, when fish can be caught and utilized by anglers.  Kansas Lake stocking will be monitored in this way each year, and with samples from older fish in later years, until the study expires in 2023.  Then a final determination of which strain to use will be made.  The ultimate outcome should result in additional Walleye available to anglers, with an added benefit that Kansas Lake Walleye may become self-sustaining like Lake Sarah. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kansas Lake is a 398-acre lake located in Watonwan County, approximately 5 miles southwest of the City of St. James.  Kansas Lake has a mean depth of 5.0 ft. and a maximum depth of 7.0 ft.  The watershed of Kansas Lake is dominated by agriculture, likely resulting in large influxes of nutrients, which cause severe algae blooms. Historically, Kansas Lake has been prone to winterkill. The most recent winterkill occurred during the winter of 2007-2008, but was only a partial kill.  Kansas Lake is managed primarily for walleye, and secondarily for northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie. Walleye fry have been stocked three out of four years beginning in 2010.  Northern pike fingerlings have also been stocked periodically, with the most recent stocking in 2017. A survey was conducted during the week of July 9, 2017 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate increased from 10.3 per gill net in 2013 to 12.3 per gill net in 2017 and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Five year classes of Walleye were sampled including fish from 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2008.  All of the year classes corresponded to fry stocking events except for the 2013 year class (age-4), which indicates that this was a naturally produced year class.  Additionally, the 2013 year class accounted for 50 percent of the aged fish, indicating that it is a strong year class in the population.  Lengths of Walleye in both gears ranged from 9.3 to 27.0 inches and averaged 15.3 inches.  The average length at age-1 was 9.3 inches, at age-2 was 12.2 inches, at age-3 was 14.8 inches, and at age-4 was 19.1 inches, which was relatively slow up to age-3, but fast thereafter.  It appears that growth of Walleye in the 2014 and 2015 year classes may have been suppressed by the abundant fast growing 2013 year class.  The current stocking regime appears to be effective. Kansas Lake has a stable Walleye population that should provide good angling.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate increased from 0.0 per gill net in 2013 to 1.7 per gill net in 2017, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Historically, Northern Pike catch rates have been around 2.0 per gill net except in 2009 when the catch rate was 10.7 per gill net. Northern Pike lengths from both gears ranged from 16.4 to 34.4 inches and averaged 26.7 inches.  While pike fishing likely won't be fast on Kansas Lake, the size of Northern Pike should be high quality.  Remember, starting in 2018 the new Northern Pike limit is 2 fish daily (2 possession limit) with all fish less than 24 inches needing to be released.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2017 was 29.0 per gill net, which is near the long term average of 29.5 per gill net, and exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Adult Yellow Perch were stocked in 2014 to jump start the population following the 2013 catch rate of 0.0 per gill net.  Two year classes are present, likely the Yellow perch that were stocked in 2014, and a year class that they produced.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.4 to 10.6 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Black Crappie catch rate was 1.0 per trap net, slightly higher than the 2013 catch rate of 0.4 per trap net, but below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  Three year classes of Black Crappie were present, ranging in length from 6.2 to 11.0 inches.  Black Crappie abundance is low, but enough are present to reproduce if the conditions are favorable.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead Catch rates remained low at 27.7 per gill net and 10.4 per trap net.  Black Bullhead lengths ranged from 7.9 to 12.8 inches and averaged 10.5 inches.  The Common Carp catch rate was 3.6 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net).  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, White Sucker, Freshwater Drum, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kansas Lake is a 398-acre shallow high nutrient lake located in Watonwan County, approximately 5 miles southwest of the City of St. James.  Kansas Lake has a mean depth of 5 feet and a maximum depth of 7 feet.  The watershed of Kansas Lake is dominated by row crop agriculture with many miles of pattern drain tile, likely resulting in large influxes of nitrogen and phosphorus, the latter of which may result in severe algae blooms at times. The Watershed to Lake Ratio is 30:1, which means there is 30 acres of upland drainage to 1 acre of surface water on Kanasas Lake.  Historically, Kansas Lake has been prone to partial winterkill. The most recent winterkill occurred during the winter of 2007-2008, but was not a complete kill.  Kansas Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, and secondarily for Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Black Crappie. Since 2018, Kansas Lake has been included in a DNR research project that is evaluating the performance of two strains of Walleye, the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) and the Mississippi Strain (MIS).  The MIS Walleye come from northern Minnesota and until recently, were the primary strain stocked in Windom management area lakes.  The LMS originated in the Cannon River system in east central Minnesota (a Mississippi River tributary), was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Sporadic natural reproduction occurs in Kansas Lake, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because some evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes. Northern pike have also been stocked as needed in Kansas Lake, with the most recent stocking of fingerling in 2017. A survey was conducted during the week of June 28, 2021 to monitor fish populations using 2 gill nets and 9 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers have never been higher on Kansas Lake.  Walleye increased from 12.3 per gill net during the last survey netting in 2017 to 53.5 per gill net in 2021 and was more than twice the long-term average of 22.5 per gill net for Kansas Lake.  The 2021 catch rate is the greatest on record since sampling began on Kansas Lake in 1984.  Seven consecutive ages (ages 1 thru 7) of Walleye were sampled.  Two of the age groups corresponded to non-stocked years, 2017 and 2020, which indicates that they were natural.  Those two year classes made up 15% of the Walleye in the sample of aged fish.  The largest contribution (70%) of fish to the aged sample came from years where LMS fish were stocked and they dominated the catch in 2018 and 2019.  To date, LMS fish appear to be winning the battle and may be the best suited strain to stock in Kansas Lake, with the hope that they will result in a naturally reproducing population.  Lengths of Walleye in gill nets and trap nets ranged from 11 to just under 24 inches and averaged nearly 18 inches.  Condition of Walleye was above average with plump fish present.  The current population is exceeding management expectations.  Future stocking, following the paired stocking study, will likely focus on LMS Walleye only in Kansas Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike numbers have remained almost identical from the last netting survey on Kansas Lake.  Northern Pike decreased slightly from 1.7 per gill net in 2017 to 1.5 per gill net in 2021, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net) and nearly in line with the long-term average of 1.8 per gill net.  Historically, Northern Pike have been just under 2 per gill net except in 2009 when the catch rate was 10.7 per gill net. Northern Pike lengths from gill nets and trap nets ranged from just over 22 inches to just under 30 inches.  Body condition of Northern Pike was high for all sizes of fish, suggesting more than adequate prey was found.  Angling for Northern Pike could be decent at times in Kanas Lake, although the total numbers of Northern Pike in Kansas Lake may be too low to target.  The current statewide regulation includes a provision for 2 Northern Pike above 24 inches for southern Minnesota.  This regulation may help to increase the size and abundance of Northern Pike caught by anglers in Kansas Lake.  Harvestable size fish are currently found within the population in Kansas Lake, and most likely will be caught by anglers targeting abundant Walleye.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2021 was 44.5 per gill net, which is above the long term average of 31.0 per gill net, and exceeds the expected range for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Adult Yellow Perch were stocked in 2014 to boost the population following 2013 when none were caught.  Based on the sizes of fish caught in the survey, several age groups were present with a strong number of young Yellow perch, most likely the offspring of Yellow Perch stocked in 2014.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.5 to just under 11 inches with an average of nearly 7.5 inches.  Body condition of Yellow Perch was fair with no obvious decline with increasing length.  Several very large year classes of Walleye appear to be competing with larger Yellow Perch for food, and the Walleye may currently have the upper hand advantage.  It is possible that the Yellow Perch population will decline during the next several years due to increased competition and direct predation by the record setting Walleye abundance.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2021 Black Crappie catch rate was 7.2 per trap net, much higher than the previous survey in 2017 when only 1 Black Crappie was caught per trap net.  Three or four year classes of Black Crappie were present, ranging in length from 4 inches to just under 12 inches with an average length of nearly 6.5 inches.  Black Crappie fishing could be good, if not excellent, with the most crappie ever observed in the gill net sample (55.5 per gill net) and the 3rd greatest trap net catch recorded since sampling began in 1984.  Black Crappie may outcompete Yellow Perch for limited food as they appear to have excellent body condition across all lengths sampled.  Continued growth will be the key to whether this population of crappie will become a nuisance or a benefit for local anglers.  MNDNR will monitor the impact that this abundance population may have on the fish community in Kansas Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead increased from 27.7 per gill net and 10.4 per trap net in 2017 to 109.5 per gill net and 20.0 per trap net in 2021.  Black Bullhead lengths ranged from just over 4 inches to 14 inches and averaged nearly 7.5 inches in the gill net sample and 11 inches in the trap net sample.  The Common Carp catch rate was 2.1 per trap net, which is within the expected range for similar lakes (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net).  However, the 2021 gill net catch rate for Common Carp was the 3rd greatest observed since 1984 with 18 per gill net, more than expected for similar lakes (1.0 to 13.75 per gill net).  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo (N=6), Bluegill (N=8), Freshwater Drum (N=183), Green Sunfish (N=2), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=5), White Sucker (N=2), and Yellow Bullhead (N=1). All of these species were caught at or below their expected ranges, except Freshwater Drum which were caught again in 2017 (1.78 per trap net) and 2021 after a brief absence (no Freshwater Drum in 2009 and 2013 surveys) due to a past winterkill.  Currently they have ballooned in abundance in gill nets (48.5 per net) and trap nets (9.44 per trap net).  We will continue to monitor the impact of Freshwater Drum on fish management, however at this point it appears that all species are doing well.   <br> \n</p>",

The assessment consisted of 32 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 82.7 (+/- 3.1) out of 100 possible. A score of 82.7 indicates the lakewide shoreline condition is Moderately High (80-85). Approximately 71 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 76.2 (+/- 3.5) indicating shoreline habitat quality of developed sites is Moderate (70-80), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 99.3 (+/- 0.7) with Excellent (92+) habitat quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nearshore fish community sampling (hereafter IBI sampling; seine, backpack electrofishing) was conducted July 1, 2021 to assess the reproductive capacity of the fish community and the overall health of the nearshore fish community in Kansas Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing and seining was conducted at 10, 100 foot long stations around the perimeter of Kansas Lake. The seine hauls captured 7 species of fish, including Johnny Darter (N=4), Bigmouth Buffalo (N=2; 1 adult and 1 young-of-the-year), Fathead Minnow (N=11), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=147), Walleye (N=9, all young-of-the-year), White Sucker (N=8), and Yellow Perch (N=542; 31 adults and 511 young-of-the-year).  Electrofishing captured 6 species of fish including Johnny Darter (N=6), Fathead Minnow (N=1), Green Sunfish (N=23), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=117), Yellow Bullhead (N=19), and Yellow Perch (N=1). Reproduction was evident for Johnny Darter, Bigmouth Buffalo, Fathead Minnow, Green Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  YOY Walleye were likely the result of fry stocking during the spring of 2021.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of Kansas Lake.  The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community.  The outcome of this sampling will, in part, help guide where and what watershed restoration efforts could be accomplished in the Watonwan River watershed over the next 10-15 years to improve water quality. The IBI score at Kansas Lake was 11, below the impairment threshold of 36. <br> \n</p>",
