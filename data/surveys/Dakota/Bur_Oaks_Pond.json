The northern basin is the deeper and larger of the two (10 acres and 7 feet deep). The land surrounding the lake is managed by the City of Eagan as Bur Oaks Park and has the typical park amenities. <br> \nThis population assessment represents the first electrofishing survey conducted on Bur Oaks Lake. Although no record of any fish stocking exists in the DNR files, the City of Eagan stocked fingerling Largemouth Bass in 2013 and 2014. The City of Eagan 2014 stocking event was in response to winter kill that occurred during the winter of 2013-2014. The intent of this survey was to evaluate the survival and success of the City Eagan's stocking program on Bur Oak Lake.  <br> \nDaytime electrofishing was conducted on 7/22/2015 in cooperation with the City of Eagan.  Catch rate and lengths were recorded for Largemouth Bass only. Largemouth Bass catch rate was 23.29/hour of on-time and a total of 7 Largemouth Bass were sampled.  Of the Largemouth Bass sampled, all fish were determined to be the result of stocking efforts the past 2 years. Lengths ranged from 2.2 to 3.7 inches.  Of the other gamefish present in Bur Oak, only a few were observed. Bullheads, Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds Sunfish were the most abundant fish seen and all were very small. A couple of small Northern Pike were also seen. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
