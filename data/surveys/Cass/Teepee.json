With the exception of 1965 when brook trout were stocked, rainbow trout have been only species stocked into Teepee Lake.  The 1995 Teepee Lake assessment occurred as a result of angler complaints of poor fishing.  A total of 14 rainbow trout were sampled in 1995.  These trout ranged in length from 6.85 to 15.7 inches and had an average length and weight of 9.1 inches and 0.34 pounds.

The trout population in Teepee Lake depends upon stocking because rainbow trout do not naturally reproduce in this lake.Only one rainbow trout was captured in 2003, which was a decrease when compared to the 2002 survey and most previous surveys.  Since 1998, Fisheries personnel have been sampling zooplankton, the tiny animals on which Teepee Lake rainbow trout feed.

There is a US Forest Service public access on the northeast shore of the lake.  Teepee Lake is one of five designated stream-trout lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area that is stocked annually with rainbow trout.  The trout population in Teepee Lake depends upon stocking because rainbow trout do not naturally reproduce in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-three rainbow trout were captured, and it met the long-range management goal for Teepee Lake.  The mean length was 11 inches and the lengths ranged from 9 to 16 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nSince 1998, Fisheries personnel have been sampling zooplankton, the tiny animals on which Teepee Lake rainbow trout feed.  The quantity of zooplankton available in Teepee Lake is relatively low and biologists are currently investigating the annual fluctuation in trout survival by examining the food supply and season of fish stocking. <br> \n</p>",

Teepee Lake is one of five designated stream-trout lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area that is stocked annually with rainbow trout.  The trout population in Teepee Lake depends upon stocking because rainbow trout do not naturally reproduce in this lake.Thirty-three rainbow trout was captured in 2004, which was an increase when compared to the 2003 survey.  However, these fish were from the 2003 stocking in which the lengths ranged from 6 to 9 inches.   Since 1998, Fisheries personnel have been sampling zooplankton, the tiny animals on which Teepee Lake rainbow trout feed.  The quantity of zooplankton available in Teepee Lake is relatively low and biologists are currently investigating the annual fluctuation in trout survival by examining the food supply.</p>",

There is a US Forest Service public access located on the north shore. Teepee Lake offers Rainbow Trout fishing in a remote, wilderness setting. The lake is entirely within the Chippewa National Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped. Teepee Lake is one of four designated stream trout lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area. Other stream trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Diamond, Hazel, and Perch Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout were initially stocked in Teepee Lake in 1984. Rainbow Trout do not reproduce in the lake and the population is supported entirely by stocking to provide a unique angling opportunity. Rainbow Trout stocking success is dependent on the absence of introduced species. The average length of Rainbow Trout sampled in 2023 was 12 inches, and lengths ranged from 10 to 16 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Teepee Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

Other trout lakes in the Walker fisheries area are Diamond (located 5 miles north and 3 miles east of Hackensack), Hazel (located 3.5 miles west of Longville), Perch (located 5 miles west of Backus) and  Willard (located 2 miles east and 2 miles north of Backus).  All trout in Teepee Lake are the result of stocking.  This lake has been stocked with rainbow trout each year since it was reclaimed in 1984.  For several years anglers have reported poor fishing success in Teepee Lake.Twenty trout, ranging from 6 to 15 inches, were sampled by DNR test nets in 1998.  Catch rates of trout in test nets have varied considerably from 1986 through 1998, however the 1998 rate (10 trout per test net) was near the average of the past eight surveys.  At various times throughout the summer, Teepee Lake was sampled for zooplankton (tiny animals that are important food for trout).  Low numbers of zooplankton were found.  Monitoring of the zooplankton and the trout populations will be done again in 1999.</p>",

There is a US Forest Service public access on the northeast shore of the lake. Teepee Lake offers good rainbow trout fishing in a remote, wilderness-like setting. The lake is totally within the Chippewa National Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped. Because of its small size, the lake is ideal for canoes or float tubes. Teepee Lake is one of five designated stream-trout lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area that are stocked annually with rainbow trout. The other designated stream-trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Diamond, Perch, Teepee and Willard Lakes. The trout population in Teepee Lake depends upon stocking because rainbow trout do not naturally reproduce in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2008, twenty-four rainbow trout were captured, which met the long-range management goal for Teepee Lake.  The mean length was 12 inches and the lengths ranged from 10 to 15 inches. Historically, rainbows greater than 15 inches in length have been sampled in several assessments.  <br> \n <br> \nSince 1998, Fisheries personnel have been sampling zooplankton, a significant food source for rainbow trout. The quantity of zooplankton available in Teepee Lake is relatively low and biologists are currently investigating the relationship of stocking rates and the size of trout stocked to the abundance of large zooplankton and trout survival in stream-trout lakes.   <br> \n</p>",
