                "narrative": "<p>Sugar Lake (DOW# 11-0026; lake class 27) is a 702-acre lake with 6.73  miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 44 feet located North-east of Remer, MN. There is a US Forest Service owned public access on the west shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Sugar Lake is in lake class 27; lakes in this class are generally large, deep, and regularly shaped. Other class 27 lakes include; Ada, Crooked, and Lower Sucker Lakes. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie and secondarily for Northern Pike, Bluegill, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are abundant with angling opportunities for both quantity and quality fish. Largemouth Bass averaged 11.6 inches long and bass up to 18 inches were sampled. Black Crappie are abundant and ranged in length from 4 to 11 inches, with an average length of 9 inches. Walleye numbers have increased and have exceeded the management goal of three fish per gillnet. Walleye mean length was 18.4 inches with fish up to 28 inches sampled. The lake was previously stocked with fingerlings but most recently with fry. Northern Pike are very abundant and ranged in length from 12 to 28 inches, with an average length of 18 inches.  Abundant Bluegill can also provide additional fishing opportunities to anglers with quality size fish present. In 2019, 27 percent of the trap net sample measured 7 inches of greater in length. Other fish species sampled include, Hybrid Sunfish, Yellow Perch, and Rock Bass. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified Sugar Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.

                "narrative": "<p>Status of the Fishery: <br> \nSugar Lake (DOW# 11-0026; Lake Class 27) is a 702-acre lake located near Remer, MN. There is a US Forest Service owned public access on the west shore. Sugar Lake has 6.73 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 44 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie and secondarily for Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Sugar Lake is in lake class 27; lakes in this class are generally large, deep, and regularly shaped <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake is a multi-species lake that supports moderate numbers of Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Walleye. Largemouth Bass of all sizes are present with fish up to 18 inches sampled. Most Black Crappie sampled were 9-10 inches, but crappie up to 14 inches were also captured. While Sugar Lake numbers of Northern Pike have traditionally been higher than similar local lakes, the majority are 17-22 inches. Pike up to 32 inches were sampled. Walleye numbers have increased compared to the previous 2 surveys but are still at the lower end of the averages compared to other area Class 27 lakes. Walleye growth is above average with over half of the Walleyes sampled larger than 20 inches, and fish up to 28 inches were caught. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bluegill, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently Curly-leaf pondweed is the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that has been identified in Sugar Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species of Sugar Lake (DOW# 11-0026; Lake Class 27) was conducted July 3, 2019 by Walker Area Fisheries Staff to aid in determining the Fish-based IBI (FIBI). Four-teen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.  Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Least Darter).  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with data collected during a gill net and trap net survey conducted the week of August 19, 2019 to calculate a FIBI score for the lake. The FIBI Tool-2 was used for scoring and resulted in an FIBI score of 59, which was above the impairment threshold of 45 and below the exceptional threshold of 64 for this tool.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sugar Lake (DOW # 11-0026) is a moderately developed lake located eight miles northeast of Remer, MN. The lake has a surface area of 711 acres and a maximum depth of 44 feet. There is a US Forest Service-owned public access at the southwest corner of the lake. Sugar Lake is a relatively fertile lake that often experiences dense summer algae blooms. Sugar Lake has curly-leaf pondweed, a harmful exotic species. Curly-leaf pondweed grows in thick beds, displacing native plant species and hampering water-based recreation. To prevent the spread of exotic species, anglers are reminded to carefully inspect boats and trailers and remove any plant fragments when leaving the lake. It is unlawful to transport exotic species like curly-leaf pondweed in Minnesota. Much of the shoreline is undeveloped and in public ownership.  The best angling opportunities in Sugar Lake are largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, and northern pike. Twelve largemouth bass were sampled from standard summer netting. The mean length of sampled largemouth bass was 14 inches and the lengths ranged from 10 to 18 inches. Black crappies are a popular species sought after by anglers in Sugar Lake, particularly in the winter. The quality of the fishery varies depending upon the number of fish 10 inches or greater in length available in any given year. From the 2009 assessment, 80 percent of the black crappies sampled were 8 inches or greater in length. Only one black crappie was 10 inches or greater in length. The average length of black crappies was 8 inches and the lengths ranged from 5 to 11 inches. Angling for larger crappies should improve in the next couple of years. Walleye are not abundant in Sugar Lake.  The walleye in the sample were large with an average length of 22 inches and the lengths ranged from 16.1 to 28.9 inches. Northern pike are very abundant with an average length of 20 inches with fish ranging in length up to 34 inches. Bluegills are moderately abundant. In 2009, only two percent of bluegills sampled were 8 inches or greater in length. However, over half of the sample in 2009 was 7 inches or greater in length, which indicates that good angling opportunities for bluegills will exist on Sugar Lake over the next few years. Yellow perch are not very abundant and they average 6 inches in length. No yellow perch were sampled greater than 8.5 inches in length. Other species sampled in 2009 were black bullhead, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Sugar Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future <br> \n.   <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water surface and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
