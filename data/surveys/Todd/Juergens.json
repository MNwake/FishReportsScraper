MEAN SIZE IS AVERAGE AT 1.91 POUNDS AND GROWTH RAT ES ARE NORMAL.  AGE GROUPS I THRU   VII WERE REPRE SENTED IN THE NET CATCH.  NO PULATION WAS NOTED SINCE THE 1985 SURVEY. THE WALLEYE NET CATCH CONSISTED OF THREE FISH IN COMPARISON TO THE SINGLE FISH CAPTURED IN 1985 .  THIS CATCH IS CONSIDERED NORMAL FOR THIS LAKE C LASS.  AVERAGE SIZE WAS LARGE AS THE FISH RANGED I N LENGTH FROM 14.9 TO 23.9 INCHES.  AGE GROUPS IV AND VI WERE FOUND &LIKELY RESULTED FROM NATURAL RE PRODUCTION IN THE SAUK RIVER SYSTEM.  NO WALLEYE HAVE BEEN STOCVKED IN THE LAKE. A HIGH POPULATION OF BLUEGILLS IS EVIDENT AND THEY ARE AVERAGE IN MEAN SIZE.  THE RECENT NET C ATCH WAS NEARLY FIVE TIMES  HIGHER THAN IN 1985 WH ILE THE MEAN WEIGHT DECLINED FROM 0.47 POUNDS IN 1 985 TO 0.22 POUNDS IN 1990.  THE MEDIAN LENGTH GRO UP ALSO CHANGED FROM 7.5-7.9 INCHES TO 6.0-6.4 IN THE RESPECTIVE YEARS.  FISH SMAPLED RANGED IN LENG TH FROM 3.0 TO 7.4 INCHES SUGGESTING THE PRESENCE OF SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES. THE BLACK CRAPPIE NET CATCH INCREASED NEARLY SEVEN TIMES THE NUMBER RECORDED IN 1985.  HOWEVER, THE POPULATION IS STILL CONSIDERED AVERAGE IN NUM BER.  MEAN SIZE IS IN THE NORMAL RANGE AT 0.24 POU NDS, WITH LENTGHS RANGING FROM 5.0 TO 8.4 INCHES. YELLOW PERCH NUMBERS ARE HIGH AND REMAIN VERY NEAR THE LEVELS FOUND IN 1985.  AVERAGE SIZE OF T HE FISH IS NORMAL AND NUMEROUS  AGE GROUPS ARE EVI DENCED BY THE WIDE RANGE OF LENGTHS FOUND IN THE S AMPLE (5.5 TO 11.4 INCHES). ONLY TWO LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE CAUGHT BY LAKE SURVEY GEAR.  THIS SPECIES IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO A SSESS USING THIS GEAR AND LOW CATCHES  MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF ABNORMALLY LOW POPULATIONS. PUMPKINSEED NUMBERS ARE HIGH AND THE NET CATC H HAS INCREASED SEVEN-FOLD SINCE 1985.  AVERAGE SI ZE OF THESE FISH IS NORMAL. WHITE SUCKER AND YELLOW BULLHEAD POPULATIONS ARE ALSO HIGH WITH BOTH SPECIES DISPLAYING A WIDE RANGE OF SIZES.  AVERAGE SIZE IS LARGE FOR BOTH SP ECIES. BOWFIN AND BLACK BULLHEAD ARE FOUND IN AVERAG E NUMBERS, WHILE COMMON CARP AND BROWN BULLHEAD OC CUR IN LOW NUMBERS.  HYBRID SUNFISH WERE ALSO PRES ENT IN THE NET CATCH.</p>",
