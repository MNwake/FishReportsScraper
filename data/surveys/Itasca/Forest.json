Physical, chemical, and fish population characteristics of the lake indicate it can best be managed as a northern pike, bass/ panfish lake with walleyes of secondary importance.  Age distribution, growth, and abundance of fish in the test net catches indicate that (1) populations of northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are probably at normal abundance for lakes of this type; (2) perch, crappies, pumpkinseeds and bullheads are above normal in abundance; (3) walleyes and rock bass are incidental species in the population; (4) reproduction of panfish is sporadic but adequate to maintain the population; and (5) growth of panfish is satisfactory.A good year-class of crappies should contribute appreciably to the angler's catch during the next two or three years, and strong year-classes of sunfish should also reach catchable size during this period.Management emphasis at present should be on northern pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Forest Lake is a small lake in the City of Grand Rapids.  The lake covers 38 acres and has a maximum depth of 31 feet.  There are no inlets, and a small outlet on the southwest end flows into the Mississippi River.  Forest Lake is a popular urban fishery with a public swimming beach on the east shore and a public fishing pier on the south shore.  Forest Lake is one of six lakes located within the city limits of Grand Rapids and therefore provides special opportunities for fisheries management.  The installation of the fishing pier has provided fishing opportunities for those without a boat.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Fisheries Lake Management Plan (LMP) was last revised in 2010.  Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike were considered primary management species.  A standard survey was conducted in August of 2019 to determine the status of the fish community.  This survey consisted of 3 gill nets and 5 trap nets.  Trap netting is difficult on Forest Lake due to steep near shore drop offs so trap net catches should be viewed with caution. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a typical rate for Forest Lake and for lakes with similar habitats.  The size structure was dominated by relatively small individuals and only a few individuals exceeded 8 inches.  Recruitment appeared inconsistent, as sampled fish belonged to a single year class.  Inconsistent recruitment of Black Crappie is a common life history trait for many populations, often resulting in \"boom and bust\" angling cycles.  Growth rates were average.  Given the current age and size structure, the popularity of the crappie fishery is likely limited due to the small average size and inconsistent recruitment.   <br> \n <br> \nLakes with similar habitats typically produce moderate numbers of Bluegill with moderate growth rates and size structure.  Trap net catches from Forest Lake have generally been low compared to similar lakes, but this is likely due to the poor conditions for trap net sampling and the time of year.   The 2019 trap net catch was within the typical range for lakes with similar habitats, but below average for Forest Lake.  Bluegills were generally small, as length ranged from 3.2 to 6 inches.  A lack of larger individuals may limit the popularity of the Bluegill fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are difficult to sample with nets.  Only three bass were sampled.  Boat electrofishing was planned but not conducted due to late ice out and poor spring weather conditions.  Previous electrofishing indicated good numbers and size distribution, suggesting good angling opportunities for this species. <br> \n <br> \nForest Lake typically produces moderate pike catches characterized by a favorable size structure and relatively fast growth.   Northern Pike were captured at a rate within the expected range for similar lakes and above average for Forest Lake.  Size structure remained favorable for anglers in 2019.  Pike averaged 24.6 inches and the largest individual neared 32 inches.  Growth was similar to past surveys and relatively fast, as individuals typically exceeded 25 inches by age-5.  Six year classes were present (age 3 to age 7).  Only 26% of the captured individuals were age-5 or older.  Anglers should be encouraged to release pike over 26 inches to help maintain the quality pike fishery of Forest Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have declined in Minnesota since the 1970s.  Forest Lake historically produced high Yellow Perch catches but numbers declined in the last two surveys.  The catch rate was typical for the lake class, but below average for Forest Lake.  Yellow Perch were generally too small to be of interest to anglers and no individuals over 8 inches were captured.  Yellow Perch have been an important prey species in Forest Lake and low perch numbers may limit Northern Pike production. <br> \n <br> \nOther sampled species include Bowfin, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Rock Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe exotic wetland plant, purple loosestrife, has been observed around the lake during past assessments.  This invasive species harms ecosystems and reduces biodiversity. Additional aquatic invasive species would likely have a negative impact on the fish community if they become established.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Forest Lake is managed primarily for walleye and panfish.  Walleye fingerlings were last stocked in 1995.     Walleye were sampled using gill nets, and the catch rate (1.6/set) was within the expected range for this type of lake.  Walleye did not show up in the test nets in the previous two surveys conducted in 1989 and 1983.  For the 1997 lake survey, the mean weight was 2.1 pounds, and the mean length was 18.0 inches, ranging from 12.3 to 21.8 inches.  Walleyes also were sampled in trap nets, and the catch rate (1.0/set) was within the expected range.  Trap net caught walleye had a mean length of 14.9 inches, ranging from 10.1 to 23.5 inches.  Growth rates for Forest Lake walleye were near the statewide mean for ages 2-6, and greater than (>115%) the statewide mean for age 1.     The northern pike gill net catch rate (1.8/set) was below the expected range.  The mean weight (3.9 pounds), however, exceeded the expected range by 1 pound.  The mean  length of gill net sampled pike was 24.9 inches, ranging from 19.6 to 31.3 inches.  Growth rates for pike exceeded the statewide mean for ages 1-4, and were near the mean for age 5.     Yellow perch sampled in gill nets had a catch rate (25.0/set) that exceeded the expected range.  The mean length was 6.3 inches, ranging from 5.2 to 8.9 inches.  The trap net catch rate for yellow perch (9.7/set) also exceeded the expected range.  The mean length was 6.2 inches, ranging from 5.0 to 8.3 inches.     The black crappie gill net catch rate (3.5/set) was within the expected range.  The mean length was 8.3 inches, ranging from 4.4 to 10.2 inches.  Trap net caught black crappies also had a catch rate (4.0/set) within the expected range, with a mean length of 7.6 inches.     Largemouth bass had a gill net catch rate (1.0/set) within the expected range.  The eight fish ranged in length from 5.1 to 11.5 inches.  The four trap net caught largemouth bass had a catch rate (0.4/set) just within the lower expected range.  Range in length for these bass wass from 4.8 to 8.3 inches.     The bluegill trap net catch rate (6.7/set) was within the expected range.  Mean length for these fish was 4.5 inches, ranging from 3.2 to 7.7 inches.     Pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled in trap nets and had a catch rate (3.6/set) within the expected range.  The mean length was 4.9 inches, ranging from 3.7 to 7.2 inches.     Other species sampled in test nets include: golden shiner, green and hybrid sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Forest Lake is a small lake in the City of Grand Rapids.  The lake covers 38 acres, of which 15 are littoral, and has a maximum depth of 31 feet.  There are no inlets, and a small outlet on the southwest end flows into the Mississippi River.  Forest Lake is a popular urban fishery with a public swimming beach on the east shore and a public fishing pier on the south shore.  Forest Lake is one of six lakes located within the city limits of Grand Rapids and therefore provides special opportunities for fisheries management.  The installation of the fishing pier has provided fishing opportunities for those without a boat.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most common fish captured in the gill net and the trap net samples.  The 2009 catch was by far the highest recorded for the lake.   The trap net catch was high compared to similar lakes and well above average for Forest Lake.  Bluegills were generally small as few individuals exceeded 8 inches.  Given the apparently high density, good angling opportunities may exist for high catches of small individuals but a lack of larger individuals may limit the popularity of the bluegill fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were the second most common fish in the gill net sample.  The catch rate was average compared to similar lakes but relatively low compared to past assessments of Forest Lake.  Forest Lake has historically produced high yellow perch catches and the 2009 catch was the lowest on record.  Yellow perch were generally too small to be of interest to anglers and no individuals over 8 inches were captured.  Yellow perch are an important prey species in Forest Lake and low yellow perch numbers may limit northern pike and walleye production. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured at an average rate compared to similar lakes.  Forest Lake typically produces moderate pike catches characterized by a favorable size structure.   The 2009 catch was average for Forest Lake and the size structure remained favorable for anglers as pike averaged 27.3 inches and the largest individual exceeded 32 inches.  Growth was average as individuals typically exceeded 25 inches by age-5.  Five year classes were present (age 3 to age 7) and 73% of the captured individuals were age-5 or older.  Anglers should be encouraged to release pike over 24 inches to help maintain the quality pike fishery of Forest Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were present in the sample and caught in average numbers compared to similar lakes.  Size structure was favorable for anglers pursuing large fish as walleye averaged 19.2 inches.  Growth was somewhat slow as individuals typically exceeded 15 inches by age-5.  Forest Lake does not typically produce large walleye catches.  Walleye are stocked in Forest Lake to provide additional angling opportunities.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie  were sampled at an average rate for the lake type.   The size structure was dominated by relatively small individuals and only a few individuals exceeded 8 inches.  Growth was generally slow with individuals exceeding 8 inches by age-5.  Only 17% of the captured individuals exceeded age five, as the 2006 year class made up 71% of the sample.  Recruitment appeared inconsistent.  Inconsistent recruitment of black crappie is a common life history trait for many populations, often resulting in \"boom and bust\" angling cycles.  Given the current age and size structure, the popularity of the crappie fishery is likely limited due to the small average size, but may improve as the 2006 year class matures.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled using boat electrofishing in June.  Bass were captured at a rate of 79 per hour, suggesting a fairly high population.  Size structure was balanced as largemouth bass averaged 13 inches and the largest individual exceeded 17 inches.  Growth was average with individuals typically exceeding 12 inches by age-5.  The population was dominated by older individuals, as 78% were five years old or older.  Given the apparent abundance and good size distribution, excellent angling opportunities should exist for this species. <br> \n <br> \nThe protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches results in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future.
