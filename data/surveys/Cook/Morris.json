The 1998 walleye catch was within the normal range for lakes of this class, with naturally-produced fish accounting for at least 50% of the total catch.  Some survivors of the original stockings (1986-1988) were also present.The northern pike catch was also within the normal range for lakes of this class.  The good catch was the result of a fairly strong 1995 year class.  Northern pike growth rates had been somewhat faster than average for the area, despite the apparent scarcity of forage for gamefish.Smallmouth bass were first reported from Morris Lake in 1994.  The 1998 catch consisted of a single, 13-year-old, 20-inch fish.The panfish community was limited to small numbers of small green and pumpkinseed sunfish.  No yellow perch were found in 1998, and none have been taken in gill nets in this lake since walleye were introduced.</p>",
