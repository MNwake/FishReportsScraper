                "narrative": "<p>Jointly managed by the MnDNR and the city of Eagan, Fish Lake is a 29-acre FiN (Fishing in the Neighborhood) lake located between Pilot Knob Road and Denmark Ave just east of Interstate 35-E.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch.  Fish Lake was stocked with channel catfish fingerlings from 1998 to 2000, and with yearlings from 2001 to 2003.  Stocking was discontinued due to no catfish being sampled in 2002 assessment and abundant northern pike population.   A public access exists and only electric trolling motors are permitted.  For more information about Fish Lake and other Eagan lakes, go to www.cityofeagan.com/live/page?aspmenu=2664.   <br> \n <br> \nFish Lake is known to have quality bass and pike populations.  Down from 28.0 pike/gill net in 2002, northern pike numbers (14.0/gill net) were still above average when compared to other Minnesota class 36 lakes.  Gill netted pike averaged 21.8 inches and 1.50 pounds.  The lone largemouth bass, sampled by gill net, was 17.8 inches and eight years old.  Inferences regarding bass populations should not be made based on gill and trap net data.  In order to effectively sample a largemouth bass population, spring electrofishing should be performed.    <br> \nPanfish were present in varying numbers.  Bluegill numbers (CPUE = 89.5/trap net) were up from the 2002 survey (5.7/trap net) and above average for class 36 lakes.  Of the 716 bluegills sampled using trap nets, approximately 88% were below 6.0 inches with only two fish exceeding 7.0 inches.  Black crappie were sampled in good numbers (26.0/gill net; 4.1/trap net) but lacked good size.  No crappies exceeded 8.0 inches.   Yellow perch, pumpkinseeds, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish were sampled in varying numbers.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads averaging nearly 9.0 inches were sampled in moderate numbers in both trap (2.8/net) and gill (22.5/net) nets.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 29 acre lake managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood Program and the City of Eagan. The lake has a boat access (electric motors only), a fishing pier, and shore fishing areas for anglers. The lake supports a diverse fish community and was previously stocked with Channel Catfish from 1998-2002. Catfish stocking was discontinued after the 2002 survey did not turn up any evidence of stocking success in this lake. Subsequent surveys in 2008 and 2013 also did not sample any Channel Catfish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance is low when compared to past surveys, but the fish sampled were of a quality size, averaging 26 inches long. The number of Northern Pike sampled has shown a steady decrease in each survey from a high of 28 per gillnet in 2002 to ten per gillnet in 2013. The average size and weight has shown the opposite trend though with larger fish showing up in each survey. This trend will need to be monitored for future management activities regarding this species, finding a balance between size and numbers of fish. One 7.1 inch long Largemouth Bass was sampled, the gear types used in this survey do not effectively sample this species so inferences cannot be made regarding the population size or fish quality at this time. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were small in length but, the numbers observed in this survey were within the normal range for this lake class, with no fish measuring over seven inches long. Black Crappie had the lowest catch rate on record, with only five fish sampled (85 fish sampled in 2008) and the largest measuring eight inches long. Small Black Crappie are typical in Fish Lake, with only three fish measuring over eight inches sampled in the past four surveys. The low abundance of Black Crappie observed in this survey is not alarming and may be due to the boom/bust nature of Black Crappie populations. Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Green Sunfish and Hybrid Sunfish were sampled in low numbers and of a small size during this survey. Yellow Perch were not sampled in the 2013 survey. <br> \n</p>",
