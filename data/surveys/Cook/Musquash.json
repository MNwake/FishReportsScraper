Although fish as old as five years were taken, most of the catch consisted of one or two-year-old fish from the 2007 or 2006 fingerling stockings.  Fish from the 2007 stocking were seven to nine inches long by July 2008, while fish from the 2006 stocking (identified by adipose fin clips) were 11 to 16 inches long.  Despite competition from a very large white sucker population, splake growth had been about average for this area.  Splake may have been able to maintain reasonable growth rates because of the presence of fairly high numbers of young-of-year white sucker and fathead minnows. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

THE 1988, 1989, AND 1990 YEAR CLASSES (ALL STOCKED) WERE REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE, WITH THE 1989 YEAR CLASS ACCOUNTING FOR 87% OF TEH FISH TAKEN.  GROWTH APPEARED TO BE ABOUT AVERAGE FOR COOK COUNTY.  NO BKT WERE COLLECTED; HOWEVER, IT IS RARE IN THIS AREA TO SAMPLE ANY BKT OLDER THAN AGE III, SO IT IS UNLIKELY THAT MANY FISH REMAIN FROM THE 1987 STOCKING.  WTS ABUNDANCE WAS VERY HIGH, AND FISH FROM 8 TO 18 IN WERE COLLECTED, WITH FISH DISTRIBUTED ABOUT EVENLY ACROSS THE ENTIRE RANGE. WTS ABUNDANCE HAS NEVER BEEN THIS HIGH IN THIS LAKE SINCE REGULAR ASSESSMENTS BEGAN IN 1973. IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THIS INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE COMES AFTER A TWO YEAR GAP IN SPT STOCKING (1986 AND 1987).  THE SECOND HIGHEST WTS CATCH (1979) ALSO FOLLOWED A GAP IN SPT STOCKING (1977 AND 1978).  HOPEFULLY, THE SPT POPULATION WILL AGAIN BE ABLE TO LIMIT WTS ABUNDANCE, AS IT APPARENTLY DID AFTER 1979.</p>",

The average size of fish collected was a little above average for this area.  Although current stocking rates have produced a fairly dense population, this does not appear to have resulted in slower growth.  Fish averaged 12.5 inches in length by the time they reached three years of age.  Musquash Lake has been heavily fished for many years; it is likely the lack of larger fish is due more to high exploitation than it is to poor growth.The white sucker catch in 2001 was high, as it has been in many assessments on this lake.  Although white sucker were abundant, their effect on splake growth or survival appeared to have been minimal.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Musquash Lake has been managed for stream trout since at least 1941, and is one of only a couple lakes in Minnesota to have been stocked with Grayling at one time.  This standard survey was the first of two scheduled in the 2009 lake management plan to determine whether goals for the Splake population could be met following a reduction in the annual stocking quota from 9,000 fingerlings to 6,000 fingerlings that began in 2011.  Goals for Splake in the 2009 plan were to maintain a minimum gill net catch of 10.0 fish/set, with at least three catchable-sized (over 10 inch) year classes present, and with average or better growth rates for two- and three-year-old fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Splake gill net catch was very high, and even though only two gill net sets were used in this survey, it is probably safe to say the catch goal from the 2009 plan was met.  Six stocked year classes contributed to the catch, five of which were catchable sized.  Splake as old as seven years were sampled; however, Splake growth rates were slow.  Fish reached a mean length of 10.9 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 12.8 inches.  Slow growth was no doubt due to heavy competition between Splake, and intense competition for invertebrate forage from a large White Sucker population. <br> \n <br> \nThe White Sucker gill net catch was extremely high in 2017, the highest ever seen in Musquash Lake (by a wide margin), and far exceeding the normal range for stream trout lakes in this area.  Even though some smaller White Sucker were present, most were too large to have been taken by any but the largest Splake in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nQuarter-inch mesh trap nets were used in this survey to assess forage that might have been provided by the lake's minnow community.  Minnows appeared to have been abundant; Fathead Minnow and Pearl Dace catches both far exceeded normal ranges for lakes in this area.  Such high minnow numbers should have supported good Splake growth; it may be that invertebrate forage is more important for good growth than minnow forage bases in lakes like Musquash. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
