Although only one gill net and three trap nets were set in this basin because of its small size, these conclusions were ascertained.  The species composition is similar between the two basins probably because fish can migrate freely between the basins via the culverts.  The most abundant species appear to be bluegills and black crappies.  Northern pike and walleyes appear to be present in lower abundance than in Long Lake proper during mid-summer months, probably due to lesser amount of suitable habitat with adequate dissolved oxygen levels.</p>",

Bluegill were sampled in trap nets at a rate that was within the expected range, but near the first quartile.  The bluegill sampled ranged in length from 5.7 to 9.3 inches, with a mean length of 7.3 inches.     Other species also caught in trap nets include: northern pike, rock bass, and yellow perch.     Little Long Lake is a very small lake.  Although the number of fish sampled are what one would expect to find in a lake of its type, there are not many \"keepers\" in the lake.  Catch and release fishing is a great way to ensure that anglers will continue to enjoy catching fish in Little Long Lake.</p>",
