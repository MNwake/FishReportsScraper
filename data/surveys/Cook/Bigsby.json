Despite the lake's shallow waters and muck bottom, it appears to support a naturally reproducing walleye population.  Growth of young walleye collected in 1998 had been relatively fast, probably due to the presence of an excellent yellow perch forage base.Northern pike were abundant, but small, as they have been in past assessments.  Few northern pike survived beyond four years of age.  Northern pike growth had been somewhat faster than average for the area.  Four-year-old fish collected in late June averaged 20.6 inches in length.Smallmouth bass were present.  Although only two fish were collected in 1998, both were over 12 inches in length.  Yellow perch were abundant, but generally small, with few fish larger than nine inches.</p>",
