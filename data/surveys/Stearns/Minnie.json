Other species include Bowfin, Black, Yellow and Brown Bullhead and Yellow Perch. Northern Pike abundance was near the lower quartile median catch rate of 2.7/gill net. Total lengths ranged from 12 to 26 inches and the average weight was 2.1 pounds. Age classes 1-4 and 7 were represented in the sample. Age 2 fish accounted for 36% of the catch. Growth was average. Bluegills were abundant, however, their average length was only 5.6 inches. The trap net catch was 41.7/ net which is above the local median. Age classes 2-8 were present and growth was slow at all ages. Hybrid sunfish were near the local median catch rate. Black Crappie numbers were slightly greater than the local median of 5.0/trap net. Crappies ranged in length from 4 to 10 inches. Age classes 1-7 were represented. Growth rates were calculated to be average early and slowing to below average at older ages. Only five Largemouth Bass were sampled during the survey. Lengths ranged from six to 13 inches. Age and growth analysis revealed year classes 2-4 with composite growth being average. Catch rates of other species were generally low: Bowfin (1.5/gill net), Black Bullhead (1.3/ trap net), Yellow Bullhead (1.7/ trap net), Brown Bullhead (1.3/ trap net) and Yellow Perch (0.5/ gill net). </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnie Lake is a small (25 acres) lake located about 3 miles southwest of the city of Avon.  It has a maximum depth of 59 ft and good water quality with a Secchi reading of 9 ft and dissolved oxygen down to 17 ft.  The aquatic plant community is diverse with 25 species of emergent/submersed plants being identified with some submersed plants growing to a maximum depth of 21 ft.  Cattails, coontail, muskgrass (Chara spp.), and yellow water lily were the only species whose abundance was rated as common.  No curled pondweed was found during the survey.   There is no public access on Minnie Lake and this is the first survey since 1987. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing on May 26, 2010.  Fifty-four largemouth bass were sampled in 42 minutes of electrofishing for a catch rate of 78/hr, which is two times the median average (36/hr) for lakes sampled during the day in the Montrose area.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 4 - 18 inches and averaged 9.5 inches and 0.8 lbs.  Anglers can expect good fishing for smaller size largemouth bass with and occasional fish pushing 18 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch of northern pike (7/gill net) was higher than the 1987 catch (3/gill net).  Northern pike sampled during the survey ranged from 17 - 31 inches and averaged 25 inches and 3 ? pounds.  Fifty-seven percent of the northern pike sampled were longer than 24 inches in length and 20% were longer than 30 inches.  Northern pike growth appears to be slightly faster than the statewide average with northern pike reaching 24 inches by age 4.  Northern pike are not abundant, but the average size is good.      <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch (2.3/trap net) was lower than 1987 (6.3/trap net), but the crappie were similar in size.  Black crappie sampled during the survey ranged from 5 - 10 inches and averaged eight inches and 0.3 pounds.  Growth of black crappie was similar to the statewide average taking 4 - 5 years to reach eight inches.  Based on catches, the crappie population does not appear to be very abundant. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch (8.8/trap net) was significantly lower than 1987 (41.7/trap net).  Bluegills sampled during the survey ranged from 3 to 7 inches and averaged five inches and 0.1 pound.  Growth of bluegill was similar to the statewide average taking five years to reach seven inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included: banded killifish, blackchin shiner, hybrid sunfish, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch.     <br> \n</p>",
