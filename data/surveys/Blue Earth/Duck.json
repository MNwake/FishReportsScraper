There is a good population of northern pike with fish up to 34 inches with most around 23 inches.  Largemouth bass are also present and provide some fishing opportunity</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Duck Lake is a 290-acre lake located on the north side of the city of Madison Lake in Blue Earth County. The lake has a maximum depth of 25 feet with approximately 80% less than 15 feet. A county-maintained public access is located on the south end of the lake near the county park. Most of the shoreline has been altered by residential development and high-quality nearshore habitat and diverse aquatic vegetation are scarce. Duck Lake has generally poor water clarity and frequent algal blooms caused by elevated nutrient levels. Duck Lake is primarily managed for Black Crappies, Bluegill, and Northern Pike and secondarily for Largemouth Bass. The management plan calls for an annual stocking of 60,000 Northern Pike fry into the adjacent wetland. A trap is deployed every spring between the lake and the wetland to collect Northern Pike for egg take needs. Duck Lake is designated as a Tier-1 lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program at a frequency of every 3 years.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). The 2022 survey was completed the week of June 13, 2022 using 6 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and 85 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 155 Black Crappies were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 25.8/net, indicating high numbers were present. Black Crappie catch rates varied from 3.0/net to 35.7/net with an average of 15.7/net from 1995 to 2022. Catch rates have climbed to an average of 23.7/net in the four most recent surveys after averaging just 5.2/net from 1995 to 2006. Black Crappie lengths in 2022 ranged from 4.2 to 9.4 inches with an average of 7.4 inches. Size structure was poor with less than half the sample over 8 inches and none over 10 inches. Black Crappies were also abundant in the trap nets with a total of 316 sampled for a catch rate of 35.2/net. The size structure was similar to the gill net sample except for the presence of 6 fish that exceeded 12 inches with the largest measuring a trophy length of 17.3 inches. The presence of an equally abundant White Crappie population suggests that these outlier fish may have been the result of hybridization between the two species. Black Crappie from both gears ranged from 1 to 9 years-old with 9 year-classes present. Two- to eight-year-old fish were well represented, indicating good consistent recruitment. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were also abundant in the 2022 survey with a total of 402 sampled with the trap nets for a catch rate of 44.7/net. Bluegill catch rates have varied from 23.0/net to 95.1/net with an average of 65.5/net since 1995. Bluegills ranged from 4.7 to 8.0 inches with an average of 7.0 inches. Almost all Bluegills were over 6 inches. Bluegills ranged from 2 to 9 years old with 7 year-classes present. Approximately 44% of Bluegills sampled were 7 years old and almost all were older than 3 years old. Bluegill growth was slow with an average length of 6.0 inches at year 4. The Bluegill population in Duck Lake has a history of high abundance, poor size structure, and slow growth. Efforts to improve size structure and growth should be considered. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in low numbers in 2022. A total of just 11 were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 1.8/net. This was the lowest catch rate on record since 1995 and continued a trend of declining Northern Pike catch rates since 2011. Northern Pike ranged from 20.6 to 35.9 inches with an average of 28.5 inches. Nine additional Northern Pike up to 37.8 inches were sampled with the trap nets. Northern Pike from both gears ranged from 2 to 9 years old with 7 year-classes present. The 7-year-old age group from 2015 was particularly abundant. Northern Pike growth was fast with an average length of 24.2 inches at year 3. The declining Northern Pike catch rates coupled with the lack of smaller, younger fish suggests that recruitment has been limited in recent years. Duck Lake is subject to southern zone Northern Pike regulations of 2 fish daily and a 24-inch minimum length limit. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 23 Largemouth Bass were sampled with standard boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 17.0/hour. Catch rates have varied from 9.0 to 28.3/hour with an average of 20.2/hour in four samples since 2000. Largemouth Bass ranged from 5.7 to 18.8 inches with an average of 12.5 inches and approximately 14% were over 15 inches. Largemouth Bass were 2 to 14 years old with 10 year-classes present and growth was moderate.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappies were abundant in Duck Lake and even outnumbered Black Crappies in the trap net sample. A total of 354 White Crappie ranging from 5.6 to 12.4 inches were caught for a catch rate of 39.3/net which more than doubled the previous high catch rate of 15.3/net in 2019. White Crappies are often present in Waterville Area lakes but are rarely considered anything more than a rare member of the fish community. Studies have shown that hybridization is common when both species occur in a water body and often the resulting offspring grow faster and can reach a larger size than pure Black Crappies or White Crappies. This may explain the presence of multiple fish over 15 inches in the 2022 sample when most fish from both species were small. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 21.3/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. The Yellow Perch were mostly small with a maximum of 8.0 inches and an average of just 6.5 inches. Surprisingly, most were older with approximately 76% over 3 years old and some up to 8 years old. Yellow Perch growth was slow with an average length of 6.4 inches at year 4. The increased Yellow Perch relative abundance was a good sign in 2022, especially coupled with low Northern Pike numbers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads were common in both gears (19.8/gillnet and 84.8/trap net). Trap net catch rates have varied wildly with lows of 0.1/net and 6.4/net and highs of 84.8/net and 79.5/net since 1995. Often, Black Bullheads recruit in high numbers following some disturbance such as a winterkill. No known winterkills were listed in the lake management plan so the high Black Bullhead numbers must have been the result of something else. Low Yellow Bullhead numbers also point to some sort of instability since they are often the dominant bullhead species in larger, healthier lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2022 include Bigmouth Buffalo (1.6/trap net), Bowfin (0.2/trap net), Common Carp (1.7/gill net), Freshwater Drum (20.2/gill net), Golden Shiner (0.3/gill net), Walleye (0.6/trap net), White Sucker (0.1/trap net), and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was poor with a secchi reading of 2.0 feet due to abundant algae. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 8.2 ppm and 71.2 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 0.3 ppm and 65.5 degrees Fahrenheit at 20 feet. A thermocline was detected at around 12 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Sky Wigen, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Duck Lake was conducted on June 14-15, 2022, by DNR Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations and a 15-foot seine was used at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Iowa Darter) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Iowa Darter, Blackchin Shiner, Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Duck Lake is adversely impacted by stressors, as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to a survey in 2019, but both scores are lower than the previous assessment for Duck Lake completed in 2015, when Duck Lake scored equal to the impairment threshold. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Mankato Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

Black and white crappie abundance appears to have increased in recent years.  Most crappies were less than 8 inches long but given the relatively young age distribution, good angling opportunities for this specie should continue.  Northern pike abundance appears to have declined to historical levels.  Size distribution remains good, however, with individuals up to 34 inches being sampled.  Largemouth bass were sampled in good numbers with fish up to 18.8 inches being captured, suggesting good angling opportunity for this species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> Duck Lake is a 282-acre eutrophic lake located in Blue Earth County near the City of Madison Lake.  Most of the shoreline and riparian zone around Duck Lake has been modified for residential development.  Duck Lake County Park is located on the south shore of Duck Lake and provides access for the public.  The sport fish community consists primarily of panfish including black crappies and bluegills.  The current management plan calls for annual stocking of northern pike beginning in 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nPrevious surveys have indicated a fish community dominated by panfish.  In 2006, trap net catch rates of bluegills averaged 63.3/trap net and in 2011 catch rates increased to 71.0/trap net.  Total length of bluegills captured in trap nets in 2011 ranged from 3.4 to 7.6 inches and averaged 6.6 inches. Approximately 90% of bluegills were less than 7.0 inches in total length.  Catch rates of black crappies increased substantially from 9.3/trap net in 2006 to 24.9/trap net in 2011.  Black crappies ranged in total length from 5.0 to 14.8 inches and averaged 8.5 inches.  Approximately 90% of black crappies captured were less than 10 inches in total length.  <br> \n <br> \nLikely a result of fry stockings, northern pike numbers (6.8/gill net) have increased since 2006 (3.5/gill net).  Size of northern pike was small, ranging in total length from 10.6 to 31.1 inches and averaging 21.2 inches.  Approximately 93% of northern pike captured were less than 24 inches in total length.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2011 (7.7/gill net) were below average compared to similar lakes and below 2006 perch numbers (11.3/gill net).  Yellow perch abundance has historically been low in this lake.  Yellow perch were small, with no fish being larger than 8.5 inches in total length.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers continued to decrease from previous assessments.  Relative abundance has decreased from 79.5/trap net in 2000 to 15.0/trap net in 2006 to 6.4/trap net in 2011.  Catch rates of yellow bullheads averaged 10.2/gill net and 8.6/trap net which is high relative to catch rates in similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nOne 19.9 inch largemouth bass was captured in a trap net.  One 17.7 inch walleye was sampled. Historical catch rates suggest that walleye have historically occurred in low abundance in Duck Lake. Additionally, one 16.7 inch sauger was collected.  This is the first time that a sauger has been sampled during an assessment on Duck Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater drum catch rates averaged 9.5/gill net in 2011 which is unchanged from the 2006 catch rate (9.8/gill net).  The 2011 catch rate is average for lakes similar to Duck Lake.  Bowfin, common carp, pumpkinseed, white crappie, and golden shiners were present but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Duck Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nDuck Lake is a 290 acre lake located in Blue Earth county on the north side of the city of Madison Lake. The maximum depth of the lake is 25 feet and most of the lake (231 acres) is classified as littoral area. A county-maintained public access is located on the south end of the lake near the county park. Most of the shoreline of Duck Lake has been altered with residential development, with a disturbed riparian zone surrounding most of the lake. Diverse aquatic vegetation, including white-stem pondweed, Northern watermilfoil, clasping-leaf pondweed, coontail, and white water lily, provides valuable habitat for fish. Duck Lake is classified in Lake Class 38 based on limnological variables and lake characteristics. Other lakes in this classification include Bass Lake (Faribault County), Rays Lake (Le Sueur County), and Greenleaf Lake (Le Sueur County). Duck Lake is managed primarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Northern Pike and secondarily for Largemouth Bass. The base stocking plan for Duck Lake includes stocking Northern Pike fry annually. Northern Pike fingerlings are also stocked annually as part of a DNR research project. <br> \n <br> \nDuck Lake was surveyed the week of June 13, 2016 by the MN DNR as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program. This survey included deploying 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. Duck Lake is scheduled to be surveyed again in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 5.7 fish/net, which is near the long-term average for Duck Lake (5.4 fish/net). Northern Pike were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 1.2 fish/net. The size structure of Northern Pike was very desirable. The total lengths of fish from both gear types ranged from 14.6 to 37.3 inches and averaged 25.2 inches. Most of the fish (71%) were 21.0 inches or longer. The average length at capture was 16.2 inches at age-1, 21.7 inches at age-2, 22.3 inches at age-3, 30.0 inches at age-4, 32.6 inches at age-5, and 34.9 inches at age-6. These fast growth rates are typical of most Northern Pike populations in southern Minnesota. Northern Pike fry will continue to be stocked annually into a drainable wetland adjacent to the lake. Fingerlings will be stocked directly into the lake annually or when available as part of an ongoing research study.  <br> \n <br> \nCrappie Species <br> \nDuck Lake is home to two species of Crappie, the Black Crappie and the White Crappie. The 2 species of crappies look similar, but certain characteristics can tell them apart. Black Crappies are generally darker overall and typically have 7 or 8 dorsal spines. White Crappies have silver sides with light black vertical barring and typically has 5 or 6 dorsal spines. Black Crappies are more widely distributed throughout Minnesota and are typically found in deeper, clearer waters than White Crappies. Black Crappies were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 35.7 fish/net, which was above the long-term average for Duck Lake (12.2 fish/net). Black Crappies were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 9.6 fish/net, which met the long-term average. The total lengths of Black Crappies from both gear types ranged from 4.5 to 12.7 inches and averaged 6.8 inches. Only 21% of the fish in the survey were 8.0 inches or greater, suggesting a poor size structure. The average length at capture of Black Crappie was 4.5 inches at age-1, 6.1 inches at age-2, 7.9 inches at age-3, 8.9 inches at age-4, and 9.0 inches at age-5.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappies were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 6.5 fish/net, which is slightly lower than the long-term lake average of 8.2 fish/net. This catch rate ranks between the lake class median (3.0 fish/net) and the third quartile (13.0 fish/net). White Crappies were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 0.4 fish/net. The average length of White Crappies was 7.8 inches and the largest fish was 12.9 inches. The average length at capture was 6.9 inches at age-2, 8.6 inches at age-3, 10.9 inches at age-5, 11.0 inches at age-6, and 12.9 inches at age-7. Like all panfish in Duck Lake, Black and White Crappie persist through natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nBluegills were sampled in 2016 at a rate of 66.0 fish/trap net, which was lower than the long-term average for Duck Lake (78.7 fish/net). However, this catch rate was near that of the previous 2 surveys (71.0 fish/net in 2011, 63.3 fish/net in 2006). Bluegills were also sampled in gill nets at a rate of 1.7 fish/net. Fish from both gear types averaged 7.2 inches and ranged from 2.3 to 8.4 inches. While large Bluegills were lacking in this survey, 81% of the total catch was 7.0 inches or longer. The average length at capture was 2.3 inches at age-1, 4.5 inches at age-2, 5.9 inches at age-3, 6.6 inches at age-4, 7.7 inches at age-7, 7.6 inches at age-8, and 7.8 inches at age-9. The Bluegill population is completely self-sustaining in Duck Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \nLargemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in traditional gears (gill and trap nets). As a result, targeted sampling using an electrofishing boat is required to assess the population. Due to time constraints, a targeted survey to assess the Largemouth Bass population was not completed in 2016 and was postponed for 2017. Only 3 Largemouth Bass were sampled in the 2016 netting survey (0.5 fish/gill net). The average length was 13.4 inches. The diverse aquatic vegetation of Duck Lake offer great Largemouth Bass habitat. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population in Duck Lake has historically maintained a low to moderate abundance. The 2016 Yellow Perch catch rate was 11.8 fish/gill net, which was near the long-term average for Duck Lake (9.9 fish/net). The size structure of Yellow Perch was small, with an average length of 7.2 inches. The largest individual that was sampled was 8.7 inches. Most of the sampled fish were young, as 65% were age-3 or younger. The oldest year class from the survey was age-7, which averaged only 8.4 inches. The average length at capture was 6.0 inches at age-2, 7.0 inches at age-3, 7.7 inches at age-4, and 7.9 inches at age-5. Yellow Perch are not stocked in Duck Lake. Although abundance was low and size structure was small, the presence of Yellow Perch in Duck Lake is important as they function as an important forage species for predators, like Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nYellow Bullheads were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 9.2 fish/net and in gill nets at a rate of 2.7 fish/net. The average length of Yellow Bullheads was 12.6 inches. Black Bullheads were also sampled (5.7 fish/gill net) and averaged 7.8 inches. A total of 98 Freshwater Drum, often referred to as sheepshead, were sampled in gill and trap nets and averaged 13.0 inches. Freshwater Drum are a native species that are fun to catch and respectable table fare. Other species sampled in low abundance were Bowfin, also referred to as dogfish, Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo, Smallmouth Buffalo, Walleye, Pumpkinseed, and Golden Shiner.  <br> \n <br> \nAngling Summary <br> \nWith high numbers of harvestable-sized Bluegills and Crappies, Duck Lake is a good option for targeting panfish and is a great lake to take children fishing. The large size structure and respectable numbers of Northern Pike make Duck Lake one of the better Pike angling lakes in the area. Although Largemouth Bass were not effectively sampled in this survey, anecdotal reports suggest bass anglers should pay attention to Duck Lake as well. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n   <br> \nKip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

THREE YEAR CLASSES WERE PRESENT IN WHITE AND BLACK POPULATIONS, WITH III YR OLDS DOMINATING BLACKS AND IV+ AGE CLASS FISH DOMINATING WHITE CRAPPIES. NORTHERN PIKE HAVE DECLINED FROM 3.25/NET IN 81 TO 1.50/NET IN 85. INCREASED SIZE WAS NOTED WITH II, III AND IV YEAR OLDS NOW DOMINATING, COMPARED TO A YOUNGER POPU- LATION IN 81 WITH A DOMINATE 1+ YR. CLASS. THE WALLEYE POPULATION IS RESPONDING TO DISCONTINUED STOCKING OF FINGERLINGS IN 81. WALLEYES DROPPED FROM 2.00/GILLNET IN 81 TO 1.50/GILLNET IN 85. WITH ONLY V AND VI AGE CLASS FISH SAMPLED.

YELLOW PERCH HAVE SHOWN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE FROM 40.00/NET IN 81 TO 4.33/NET IN 85, BUT GOOD NUMBERS OF YY PERCH WERE SAMPLED IN SHORELINE SEINING. A SIGNIFICANT BLACK BULLHEAD POPULATION HAS DEVELOPED, NOW AVGNG 48.50/TRAPNET AND 52.50/GILLNET; NO BLACK BULLHEAD WERE SAMPLED IN 81. FRESHWATER DRUM HAVE DECLINED</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Duck Lake is a 290-acre lake located in Blue Earth County on the north side of the city of Madison Lake. The maximum depth of the lake is 25 feet and most of the lake (231 acres) is less than 15 feet deep. A county-maintained public access is located on the south end of the lake near the county park. Most of the shoreline of Duck Lake has been altered by residential development. Diverse aquatic vegetation provides valuable habitat for fish. Duck Lake is managed primarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Northern Pike and secondarily for Largemouth Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nDuck Lake was surveyed the week of June 13, 2019 by the MN DNR as part of a standard survey. This standard survey included deploying 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Duck Lake is scheduled to be surveyed again in 2022. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 2.3 fish/net, which is below the long-term average for Duck Lake (5.0 fish/net). Northern Pike were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 1.2 fish/net. The size of Northern Pike was very desirable. Fish lengths from both gear types ranged from 18.7 to 42.0 inches and averaged 27.2 inches. The fast growth rates seen in Duck Lake are typical of most Northern Pike populations in southern Minnesota. Fingerlings (2 fish/littoral acre) were stocked directly into the lake in 2015 as part of an ongoing research study. These fish were marked with tags to track the age and growth of these fish. Four of these fish were captured in 2019; two during the Northern Pike egg take, and two during the survey period.  <br> \n <br> \nDuck Lake is located in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. In order to harvest a Northern Pike the fish must be over 24.0 inches in length.  The daily bag limit in this zone is 2 Northern Pike per day. <br> \n <br> \nDuck Lake is home to two species of crappie, the Black Crappie and the White Crappie. Black Crappie and White Crappie are similar in appearance, although the White Crappie are usually longer and Black Crappie appear rounded. The best way to identify the two species is to count the spines on the dorsal fin. White Crappie usually have 5 or 6 spines while Black Crappie usually have 7 or 8 spines. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 17.0 fish/net, which was above the long-term average for Duck Lake (12.8 fish/net). This catch rate was above average when compared to similar lakes. Black Crappies were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 8.4 fish/net, which met the long-term for Duck Lake. Total lengths of Black Crappies from both gear types ranged from 5.7 to 17.0 inches and averaged 9.0 inches. 78% of the fish in the survey were 8.0 inches or greater. Black Crappies ranged in age from 3 to 9 years with five year classes represented.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappies were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 0.7 fish/net, which is much lower than the long-term lake average of 7.3 fish/net. White Crappies were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 15.3 fish/net. The average length of White Crappies was 9.5 inches and the largest fish was 14.3 inches. Like all panfish in Duck Lake, Black and White Crappie persist through natural reproduction. <br> \n  <br> \nBluegills were sampled in 2019 at a rate of 23.0 fish/trap net, which was lower than the long-term average for Duck Lake (71.7 fish/net). This catch rate was the lowest catch rate on record for Duck Lake. However this catch rate was higher than the average for similar lakes. Bluegills were also sampled in gill nets at a rate of 1.7 fish/net. Fish from both gear types averaged 6.6 inches and ranged from 4.0 to 7.5 inches. Bluegill ages ranged from 2 to 5 years and included four year classes. The most abundant year class was 2015 (age-4). The Bluegill population is completely self-sustaining in Duck Lake. <br> \n   <br> \nLargemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in traditional gears (gill and trap nets). As a result, targeted sampling using an electrofishing boat is required to assess the population. Fish were sampled at a rate of 26.5 per hour. Largemouth Bass sampled by electrofishing ranged in size from 7.0 to 21.5 inches and averaged 12.7 inches in length. Largemouth Bass sampled were 2 to 7 years of age, all year classes from 2012 to 2019 were represented. The 2016 (age-3) year class was the most abundant. Growth of Largemouth Bass in Duck Lake appears to be moderate to fast.  The diverse aquatic vegetation of Duck Lake offers great Largemouth Bass habitat. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population in Duck Lake has historically maintained a low to moderate abundance. The 2019 Yellow Perch catch rate was 4.3 fish/gill net, which was the same as the historic low for Duck Lake.  The size structure of Yellow Perch was small, with an average length of 6.7 inches. The largest individual sampled was 7.3 inches. Three year classes were present; 2013 (age-6) to 2015 (age-4).  Yellow Perch are not stocked in Duck Lake. Although abundance was low and size structure was small, the presence of Yellow Perch in Duck Lake is important as they function as an important prey species for predators, like Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullheads were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 5.7 fish/net, which was above average for similar lakes. Yellow Bullheads were also sampled in gill nets (7.5 fish/net). The average length of Yellow Bullheads was 11.5 inches. Black Bullheads were also sampled (42.2 fish/gill net) and averaged 8.6 inches. A total of 84 Freshwater Drum, often referred to as sheepshead, were sampled in gill and trap nets and averaged 12.5 inches. Freshwater Drum are a native species that are fun to catch and respectable table fare. Other species sampled in low abundance were Bowfin, Common Carp, Walleye, and White Sucker. <br> \n  <br> \nWater quality measurements recorded in the 2019 survey included secchi depth, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. The secchi depth reading was 3.0 feet. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen readings throughout the water column ranged from 70.3 degrees Fahrenheit and 10.2 ppm at the surface to 62.1 degrees Fahrenheit and 0 ppm at 20.0 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, natural resources specialist <br> \n</p>",

The maximum depth of the lake is 25 feet and most of the lake (231 acres) is less than 15 feet deep. A county-maintained public access is located on the south end of the lake near the county park. Most of the shoreline of Duck Lake has been altered by residential development. Diverse aquatic vegetation provides valuable habitat for fish. Duck Lake is managed primarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Northern Pike and secondarily for Largemouth Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was conducted on 9 May 2017 by the MN DNR using day-time electrofishing to assess the Largemouth Bass population. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Results from this targeted survey should not be compared to results from standard surveys. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 89.2/hour compared to only 9.0/hour during the previous survey in 2000. The average length of Largemouth Bass sampled in 2017 was 8.9 inches and lengths ranged from 6.3 inches to 18.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor  <br> \n</p>",
