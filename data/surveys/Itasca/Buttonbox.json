                "narrative": "<p>This is the first assessment that sampled northern pike.  The northern pike population was relatively low and the gill net catch was at the low end of the expected range for lakes similar to Button Box.  The average length of northern pike sampled was 29.2 inches with the longest being 37.5 inches.  The average weight exceeded the expected range, and the population size structure appeared to be good.  Approximately 83% of the gill net sampled northern pike were over 24 inches.  Button Box is a small lake with a low population of northern pike, anglers are encouraged to release larger fish to help maintain the balance.  Six year classes have been identified through scale and bone analysis with fish up to age seven present, and growth rates exceeded the statewide average for all ages.   <br> \n <br> \nStandard net sampling gears tend to inadequately sample bass populations.  This was the first assessment in which electrofishing gear was used to sample the bass population.  Smallmouth bass were sampled at a rate of 37.4 fish per hour by electrofishing.  The longest smallmouth sampled was 16.8 inches and the average length was 8.7 inches.  The population size structure is average with a lot of medium sized fish sampled, consistent with previous assessments using nets.  Gill net sampled smallmouth bass were within the expected range, but below the previous assessment.  Five year classes were identified and growth rates were near the statewide average for ages one, two and four, and below the state average for ages three and five. <br> \n <br> \nThis was the first assessment largemouth bass were ever sampled.  Largemouth bass were sampled at a rate of 41.9 fish per hour of electrofishing.  The average length of largemouth bass sampled was 10.8 and the longest was 18.1 inches.  The size structure appears to be moderate with 30% of the sampled fish over 12 inches.  Largemouth bass were also sampled in trap nets a rate exceeding the expected range.  Nine year classes have been identified and growth rates were near the statewide average for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate was within the expected range for trap nets and above the previous assessment.  The population size structure was average with 38% of the fish sampled longer then seven inches.  The average length was 6.9 inches, but the longest bluegill sampled was 8.1 inches.  Six year classes were identified with fish up to age nine present, growth rates were similar to the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nThis was the first assessment black crappie were ever sampled.  Black crappie were sampled in trap nets at a rate similar to the expected range and below the expected range for gill nets.  The population size structure appeared to be modest and the average length sampled was 9.2 inches.  The longest black crappie sampled was 10.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and white sucker were both sampled in gill nets at a lower rate then the previous assessment, but still above the expected ranges.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 4.4-8.5 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches.  One golden shiner was the only other species sampled. <br> \n</p>",
