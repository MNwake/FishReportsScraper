                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nPerch Lake is a 175-acre, class 43 lake located in Martin County approximately 2.5 miles to the southwest of the City of Truman. Perch Lake is a shallow lake with a maximum depth of 5.0 feet. Perch Lake has a small drainage area as indicated by a watershed size to lake size ratio of 9:1. Despite the small drainage area, agricultural runoff still affects the water quality of Perch Lake which typically has highly turbid water.  Perch Lake is prone to low oxygen levels during the winter months resulting in frequent winterkills. Its susceptibility to winterkill is likely a result of its shallowness and topography surrounding the lake. Perch Lake is situated in a small depression that is surrounded by trees, which prevents snow from blowing off of the lake. Because of its susceptibility to winterkill, Perch Lake is managed for species that are more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels such as northern pike (primary management species) and yellow perch (secondary management species). In addition, it is also managed secondarily for black crappie, despite their susceptibility to winterkill, because of its history of producing occasional large crappies. Populations of game fish have been self-sustaining; however, northern pike fingerlings (2005, 2010), fry (2003, 2014), and adults (2014) have been stocked sporadically to supplement the existing population. A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 16, 2014 to monitor fish populations using nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nHistorical catch rates of northern pike in Perch Lake have ranged from 0.5 per trap net in 2002 to 5.7 per trap net in 1997. In 2014, northern pike were captured at a rate of 1.8 per trap net, an increase from 0.7 per trap net observed in the last survey done in 2008. Northern pike ranged in length from 18.1 to 31.5 inches and averaged 24.3 inches. Various northern pike stocking strategies have been tried in Perch Lake, but success has been limited. Fingerlings were stocked in 2005 and 2010; however, the stockings were not evaluated. Most recently in the spring of 2014, northern pike fry were stocked in the wetland directly south of Perch Lake that is periodically connected to the lake, with the idea that the northern pike fry could grow in the mostly vacant wetland (no other fish) and then move to the lake when conditions were favorable. It appears that this stocking was unsuccessful, as a nearshore survey conducted on July 22, 2014 did not capture any young-of-the-year (YOY) northern pike. In response, 200 adult northern pike were stocked in November 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nYellow perch were captured at a rate of 0.4 per trap net, similar to the catch rate observed in 2008 (0.7 per trap net). The 2014 yellow perch catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates for lakes similar to Perch Lake (0.3 to 3.8 per trap net). Gill nets typically sample yellow perch populations more effectively than trap nets, but gill nets were not used because of the shallowness of Perch Lake. Yellow perch ranged in length from 4.7 to 9.5 inches and averaged 6.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \nThe black crappie population in Perch Lake is highly variable as catch rates have ranged from 0.0 per trap net in 2014 to 24.0 per trap net in 2008. The 2014 catch rate of 0.0 per trap net is the lowest observed catch rate for Perch Lake, down from the all-time high catch rate observed in 2008 and lower than the expected range of catch rates (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net) for lakes similar to Perch Lake. The lack of crappies sampled indicates that a winterkill likely occurred since the 2008 survey. It is characteristic of crappie populations to be boom or bust, with the population often being comprised mostly of one strong year class.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nThe bullhead catch rate was the highest ever observed for Perch Lake at 113.4 per trap net, but was within the expected range of catch rates lakes similar to Perch Lake (11.5 to 132.6 per trap net). Prior to the 2014 survey, catch rates ranged from 22.1 per trap net in 1997 to 71.5 per trap net in 2002. This indicates that Perch Lake may have experienced a winterkill since the 2008 survey, as black bullheads tend to proliferate following winterkill. Black bullheads ranged from 4.3 to 11.9 inches, and averaged 8.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe common carp catch rate declined since the last survey from 6.7 per trap net in 2008 to 0.6 per trap net in 2014. Historically, catch rates have varied from 0.1 per trap net in 2002 to 6.7 per trap net in 2008. The 2014 catch rate was below the expected range of catch rates lakes similar to Perch Lake (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net).  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included white sucker (n=1), and yellow bullhead (n=2), both species that have been sampled in previous surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perch Lake near Truman, Minnesota covers 201 acres and has a maximum depth of 5 feet.  The lake has had a history of low oxygen  levels.  Because of shallowness and low oxygen levels, Perch Lake is managed for northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie which tend to tolerate these conditions.  Being connected to the Watonwan River via Perch Creek has allowed fish populations to reestablish themselves after winterkill with very little stocking.  The lake was last officially stocked in 1988 with yellow perch and black crappie adults.Northern pike are often the targeted species by anglers and spearers on Perch Lake.  A catch rate of 5.7 fish/trapnet indicates a moderately dense population was present.  Northern pike ranged from 11.5-35 inches.  These fish had an average length of 21 inches, and an average weight near 2? pounds.  Anglers should expect decent fishing for the next few years.Yellow perch numbers are considered above average and have increased since the 1992 survey.  Perch collected in trapnets ranged from 6-10 inches, with an average length just over 7? inches.  A good mix of lengths and ages along with some natural reproduction should provide consistent perch angling in future years.The catch rate for black crappie in trapnets was 4.9 fish/net which is down considerably from the catch rate of 21.9 fish/net in the previous survey.  Although the catch rate has fallen, a variety of sizes were sampled.  Lengths of black crappie captured in trapnets were about 5-13 inches, with an average just over 9? inches.  With continued growth some crappies over 2 pounds can be expected from Perch Lake.Black bullhead numbers were considered average compared to similar lakes in our area.  Black bullheads collected in trapnets were approximately 3-12 inches long with the average just under 8? inches.Yellow bullheads sampled in trapnets ranged from 5.5-13 inches in length with an average just under 8? inches.  Yellow bullhead numbers were more than three times the area average for lakes similar to Perch Lake.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, water quality of Perch Lake through watershed management.  Improved land use practices will help insure this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perch is a 175 acre lake located southwest of Truman in Martin County.  The lake has 2.6 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of five feet.  A widely used County Park is located on the east side of the lake.  The lake is presently managed for northern pike as the primary species while yellow perch and black crappie are managed secondarily.  A partial winterkill likely occurred during the winter of 2000-01.  Oxygen levels dropped to 0.7 ppm in early January.  We start seeing fish die when it gets down to 2.0 ppm.Our netting on Perch Lake indicated that the northern pike population appears to be down from previous years.  This could be due in part to the partial kill during the winter of 2000-01.  Lengths of northern pike caught ranged from 16.3 to 26.6 inches and averaged 19.4 inches.  Although our net catches were down, Outdoor News reported good angling success through the ice during the winter of 2002-03.The black crappie and yellow perch populations have also declined since our last survey in 1997.  This again is likely due to the partial winterkill during the winter of 2000-01.  Since Perch Lake hooks up with the Watonwan River, the fish population should come back on its own.  Northern pike fry were stocked during the Spring of 2002.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Perch Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perch Lake, near the town of Truman, in Martin County is a 175-acre lake.  Perch Lake has a maximum depth of  5 feet and is not aerated.  Perch Lake has been prone to lower dissolved oxygen during winter due to its shallowness and topography surrounding the lake.  The lake is situated in a small depression surrounded by trees, which facilitates snow to collect on the lake without blowing off.  As a result, the lake is managed for species that are more tolerant of lower dissolved oxygen.  It is managed primarily for northern pike and secondarily for yellow perch and black crappie.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 11, 2008 using trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance or numbers have not changed since the last survey in 2002.  Total lengths ranged from 15.0 to 26.3 inches and averaged 21.8 inches.  Northern pike have been stocked twice in Perch Lake since the last survey.  Northern pike fry were stocked in 2003 and fingerlings in 2005.  During the mid-summer heat, it is possible to catch some northerns in some cool water areas such as tile inlets or emergent vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nBased on our netting, black crappie have never been more abundant.  Total lengths ranged from 8.8 to 13.5 inches and averaged 9.6 inches.  Not only were black crappie abundant, sizes of the fish were excellent.  Although lake access can be difficult, an angler could have some good action with some keepers when targeting the emergent vegetation come spring.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch continue to remain low in numbers.  Their abundance has not changed from the previous survey in 2002.  If you are looking for panfish, you would have better luck targeting black crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were black bullhead, common carp, white crappie, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Ryan Doorenbos   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
