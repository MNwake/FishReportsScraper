                "narrative": "<p>Section 12 Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 4, which consists of 47 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, deep, bowl-shaped, and have soft and very clear water.  Section 12 Lake was thermally stratified on 07/21/2000 and had a surface temperature of 66 F.  It retained 5 ppm oxygen to a depth of about 28 ft where the temperature was 42 F, and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of about 32 ft, where the temperature was 41 F.Section 12 Lake was stocked with stream trout periodically from 1942 through 1979, and again in 1997.  It was poisoned with fintrol in 1975.  The inlet from Ojibway Lake has a filter barrier about ?  mile upstream of Section 12 Lake; this barrier is ineffective in preventing downstream fish movement from Ojibway Lake.  The outlet to Jasper Lake has a filter barrier where it leaves Section 12 Lake, and there are other barriers to fish movement downstream.  Shoal substrates are 45% boulder, 21% ledgerock, 17% gravel, 6% sand, 6% muck, and 5% rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 10 ft; the most common plants are milfoil, burreed, bushy pondweed, and Robbins pondweed.This fish population assessment consisted of four gillnet sets and seven trapnet sets.  Twelve previous investigations (fisheries lake surveys or fish population assessments) dating back to 1964 consisted of 2-6 gillnet sets. Trapnets (2-7 sets) were also used during seven of these previous investigations.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2000 of 25.9 fish/net was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was at the median for all investigations on this lake.  The total catch by weight of 42.7 lb/net was also in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was higher than the median catch of 21.9 lb/net for all investigations on this lake.  More large cisco, walleye, and white sucker were caught in the gillnets in 2000 than in most previous investigations.  Lake Class 4 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 2000 of 30.7 fish/net (8.8 lb/net) was higher than the median catch of 13.0 fish/net (3.9 lb/net) for all investigations on this lake.  More bluegill sunfish, largemouth bass, rock bass, and white sucker were caught in the trapnets in 2000 than in most previous investigations.Fish populations in 2000 were dominated by white sucker and cisco, followed by rock bass, walleye, largemouth bass, and bluegill sunfish.  None of the yearling brook trout stocked in 1997 were captured during this assessment.  Other species were present in low numbers.White sucker numbers in the gillnets in 2000 (8.5/net) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were at the median for all investigations on this lake.  Sucker numbers in the trapnets (5.4/net) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median of 2.1/net in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2000 averaged 17.5\" (2.3 lb) in the gillnets, which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class, and 12.7\" (0.9 lb) in the trapnets, which was in the second quartile for this lake class.Cisco numbers in 2000 (10.0/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 3.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes averaged 15.9\" (1.7 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 12.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest cisco was 17.7\".Rock bass were first observed in Section 12 Lake in the 1990 assessment.  Rock bass numbers in the trapnets in 2000 (9.7/net) and in the gillnets (3.2/net) were quite high, indicating this species is now one of the major species in this lake.  Rock bass sizes averaged 6.4\" in the trapnets and 6.0\" in the gillnets; the largest was 8.4\".Walleye fingerlings were introduced into Section 12 Lake in 1980 and have been stocked periodically since then.  Walleye numbers in 2000 (2.5/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median of 4.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake since walleye were introduced.  Walleye sizes in 2000 averaged 17.6\" (2.2 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 14.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye was 24.4\" and about 13 years old.  Walleye growth appeared to be faster than normal for area lakes and faster than in previous investigations, although walleye scales were difficult to read.Largemouth bass numbers have increased over time, especially in the trapnet catches, and their numbers in 2000 (3.1/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class.  Many small largemouth were observed in the shallows along the shoreline during this assessment.  Largemouth sizes averaged 6.8\" in the trapnets; the largest was 13.4\".  Most largemouth were age two, from the 1998 year class.  Largemouth growth was normal for area lakes.Bluegill numbers have increased over time and their numbers in 2000 (10.0/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class.  Bluegill sizes averaged 4.8\" (0.07 lb) which was in the first quartile for this lake class.  All except two bluegill were ages three, four, or five.  Bluegill growth was in the first quartile for area lakes, although bluegill scales were difficult to read.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Section 12 Lake is known locally as Camp 20 Lake, which is what it is called in the following discussion.Camp 20 Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 4, which consists of 47 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, deep, bowl-shaped, and have clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Camp 20 Lake ranks as oligotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.Camp 20 Lake was thermally stratified on 07/11/2005 with a surface temperature of 77 F and a bottom temperature of 41 F.  Good oxygen for fish (more than 5 ppm) was retained to a depth of 28 ft, where the temperature was 44 F, and adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 31 ft, where the temperature was 44 F.Camp 20 Lake was stocked with stream trout periodically from 1942 through 1979, and again in 1997 and 2002.  It was poisoned with fintrol (antimycin) in 1975 and filter barriers in the inlet (from Ojibway Lake) and the outlet (to Jasper Lake) were built in 1976.  The inlet barrier was ineffective in preventing downstream fish movement from Ojibway Lake.  Both barriers are in poor shape and not currently functioning as barriers to fish movement.  There are beaver dams and other fish barriers downstream of Camp 20 Lake.  Trout fishing pressure was low and success was poor, according to file records.Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Camp 20 Lake are mostly boulder, rubble, and ledge rock.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 8 ft.  Small-leaved milfoil, water shield, and several pondweeds (large-leaf, narrow-leaf, Robbin's) are the most common plants.Camp 20 Lake is completely surrounded by St. Louis County tax forfeited land.  The only development on the lake is a seasonal tent camp along the northeast shore operated by United Methodist Church and leased from the county.  Carry-down public access to Camp 20 Lake is off the road along the north shore of the lake; there is no boat ramp.Fish sampling in the 2005 fisheries lake survey was done with four standard survey gillnets, nine standard survey trapnets, and four small mesh (1/4\" bar mesh) trapnets used to catch young-of-year fish and minnows.  Thirteen previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1964, used 2-6 gillnets.  Eight of these previous investigations used 2-7 standard trapnets, and three of these previous investigations used 2-4 small mesh trapnets.Fish populations in 2005 were dominated by bluegill sunfish, smallmouth bass, and white sucker.  Bluegill numbers in early investigations through 1983 were very low.  Bluegill numbers increased after 1983, averaging 14.9/trapnet from 1986 through 2000.  Bluegill numbers in 2005 (5.3/trapnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class.  Bluegill sizes in 2005 averaged 4.8\" (0.07 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class and was lower than the average size of 5.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill in 2005 was 8.4\".  Most bluegill (26 of 48) were age four.  Bluegill growth was slower than normal (in the first quartile) by area standards.Smallmouth numbers in 2005 (0.5/gillnet, 1.8/trapnet) were in the second and third quartiles, respectively, for this lake class, and were similar to numbers in previous investigations on this lake.  Bass are \"net shy\" and difficult to catch in proportion to their population with standard sampling nets.  Little smallmouth are commonly observed along the shoreline of Camp 20 Lake, although few were captured in the small mesh trapnets.  Smallmouth sizes in 2005 averaged 9.0\" in the gillnets and 8.8\" in the trapnets, which was in the normal range for this lake class and similar to sizes in previous investigations on this lake.  The largest smallmouth was 14.1\".  Smallmouth growth was near the median by area standards.Walleye were not originally present in Camp 20 Lake, but walleye fingerlings have been stocked in even-numbered years since 1980.  Walleye stocking is based on the amount of littoral area in the lake (area where the depth is less than 15 ft).  Since Camp 20 Lake has a low proportion of littoral area, the number of fingerlings stocked was generally low, averaging about 300 for each stocking.  Walleye numbers in 2005 (1.0/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 3.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake since walleye were first stocked in 1980.  Walleye sizes in 2005 averaged 18.9\" (2.7 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 15.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye was 25.4\".  All walleye were from years stocked with fingerlings, indicating that natural reproduction of walleye is not successful in this lake.  Growth of age three and five walleye was somewhat slower than normal by area standards (in the second quartile), while growth of age seven walleye was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile).  Low numbers of largemouth bass are present in Camp 20 Lake.  The largest largemouth bass caught in 2005 was 15.9\".White sucker numbers in 2005 (7.3/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median sucker catch of 7.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.Cisco numbers in 2005 (1.3/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 3.1/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco numbers have generally declined and cisco sizes have increased since walleye stocking began in 1980, indicating that walleye are likely preying on small cisco.  Cisco sizes in 2005 averaged 17.4\" (2.1 lb), which is in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  The largest cisco was 19.1\".Some of the game fish examined in 2005 were infected with neascus.  A few of the bass also had bass tapeworm larvae in their viscera.  Neascus (black spot) and bass tapeworm are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

This scenic lake has a landscape with abundant pines and the shorelines are lined with white cedar. Other than a seasonal tent camp, the lake is undeveloped.  <br> \n <br> \nA public access can be found by driving E on CR 18 (Fernberg Rd) and turning rt on Old CR 18. The access is along the gravel road right-of-way near the NW shore. A canoe or small boat would be best suited for use. There are no official campsites located near the lake for overnight use. <br> \n <br> \nNine species of fish were sampled during the 2017 survey of Section 12 Lake. The total number of fish sampled were some of the lowest ever recorded on this lake. Large cisco or tullibee comprised 48% of the gill net catch, while small bluegill (58%) dominated the trap net catch. Low numbers of walleye and northern pike were recorded. Smallmouth bass, one largemouth bass and rock bass were also sampled in 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2017 (2.0/gill net) were slightly lower than the historic average (3.3/gill net) and slightly above average (1.4/gill net) compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average walleye sampled was 19.2 inches which is larger than historic average length of 15.8 inches and the largest walleye was 25.5 inches long. Walleye fingerlings are stocked during even numbered years on Section 12 Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2017 (6.1/trap net) were identical to the historic average for Section 12 Lake and similar to the average (6.5/trap net) when compared to other lakes in the area that are similar. The average bluegill sampled was 5.0 inches which is nearly identical to the historic average length of 5.1 inches. The largest bluegill sampled was 6.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCisco numbers in 2017 (3.5/gill net) were similar the the historic average (3.1/gill net) for this lake. The average cisco sampled was 14.8 inches which is larger than the historic average length of 13.2 inches. The largest cisco sampled in 2017 was 20.5 inches long. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Section 12 is entirely within the Superior National Forest with all of the shoreline under public ownership. There is a user developed carry-in access off the old Fernberg Road on the north end of the lake.  Based on physical and chemical characteristics, Section 12 is categorized in lake class 4.  Lakes in this class are typically small, deep, very soft and have clear water.  Section 12 is managed primarily for walleye and is stocked with fingerlings.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2010, walleye abundance was comparable to past assessments and other class 4 lakes. Walleye ranged in length from 12.0 inches to 24.4 inches with an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 2.1 pounds. Walleye fingerlings are stocked in even-numbered years.  All walleye sampled were aged to stocked years.  Walleye growth was above average.  After three years of growth, Section 12 walleye were 15.5 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2010, one northern pike was sampled for the first time since 1974. The pike was 26 inches long and age 7.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2010, bluegill abundance was the highest ever recorded on Section 12 and was comparable to other class 4 lakes.  Bluegill were generally small with only 11% of the bluegill sampled greater than 6 inches in length. Bluegill grew slowly in Section 12 reaching 3.8 inches in length after four years of growth.  Rock bass were sampled in moderate numbers with fish up to 7.5 inches long sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBoth smallmouth and largemouth bass exist in moderate numbers in Section 12.  Smallmouth bass are slightly more abundant than largemouth bass but generally both are small with the largest smallmouth bass sampled being 11 inches in length and the largest largemouth bass being13 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The physical and chemical characteristics of Section 12 Lake are very similar to the 44 lakes in Ecological Lake Class 4.  This lake class has high water quality, but is biologically unproductive.  Section 12 Lake stratifies thermally in the summer; at the time of the 1995 assessment there was good oxygen in the cool water layer between 17' (60 F) and 26' (45 F).  There was poor oxygen below 29'. The total number and weight of fish caught in this assessment (all species combined) was above average for this lake class.  The trapnets caught large numbers of small fish, mostly sunfish and bass.Fish populations in 1995 were dominated by white sucker, smallmouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and walleye.  Suckers were abundant and sucker sizes were large.  Smallmouth numbers were above average, but most were small, averaging only 8\".  Smallmouth growth was slow, with fish reaching nine inches at age five.  Smallmouth reproduction has been too good, producing a stunted population.Bluegill numbers are average, but sizes were small, averaging 5.5\"; the largest bluegill caught was 7.7\".  No bluegill were naturally produced during the cold summers of 1992 and 1993.  Bluegill growth was average, with fish reaching five inches at age five.  Walleye numbers were average.  Most walleye were from stocked years, indicating very poor (if any) natural reproduction.  Typical walleye spawning areas are absent in this lake.  Walleye growth was average.  Some good sized (over 20\") walleye were present.The splake captured during this assessment had migrated downstream from Ojibway Lake, where they had been stocked in 1991.  They were in good condition, averaging 2.8 lbs and 20\" long.  </p>",
