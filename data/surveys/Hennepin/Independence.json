                "narrative": "<p>Lake Independence (27-0176) is an 844-acre, class 24 lake located in western Hennepin County in the city of Maple Plain.  Baker Park Reserve (Three Rivers Park) borders the southeast portion of the lake and provides a two-lane concrete boat access.  Lake Independence offers a diverse sportfish community consisting of black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, muskellunge, pumpkinseed, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch.  Since 1999, management plan goals include stocking walleye at 2.0 lb/littoral acre (850 lb) in odd- numbered years while stocking 1000 muskellunge in alternate, even-numbered years.  In 2001 and 2003, walleye were purchased from and stocked by stocked by private vendors.  The purpose of this special assessment (12 gill nets) was to evaluate the effectiveness of present walleye stocking rate (2.0 lb/ littoral acre every other year) and to monitor contributions of the private vendor stockings to the walleye population.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Independence provides the metro area with quality bass, muskellunge, and pike fishing.  Although only two muskies (37.1 and 38.2 inches) were sampled during assessment, locals claim Indy is a great muskie fishery.  Pike were sampled in low numbers and great average size.  Sampled pike averaged approximately 28 inches and 5.2 pounds with the largest individual measuring over 36 inches.  Approximately 92 and 23% of sampled pike were over 25 and 30 inches, respectively.  Although gill nets and trap nets do not effectively sample largemouth bass, twenty-one largemouth bass averaging 9.1 inches were sampled in gill nets. <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye abundance increased from 5.3/gill net in 2004 to 8.2/gill net in 2006.  Although walleye numbers exceeded the upper quartile for class 24 lakes, 2006 catch rates still are well below the management plan goal of 15-25 walleyes/gill net.  Additionally, the 2004 and 2006 assessments are the only two assessments since 1989 where gill net catches were below 10.0 walleyes/gill net.  Average weight (1.9 lb) was average when compared to other regional class 24 lakes.  Gill netted walleye (N = 98) averaged 16.3 inches with the largest fish measuring 28.8 inches.  Average size is down due to a strong 2003 year class (age-3) averaging 16 inches at time of capture.  Although past surveys indicated that limited natural reproduction may be occurring, the 2006 sampled walleye population consisted of only stocked year classes.  Future assessments will further evaluate contributions of the stocked 2005 fingerlings to the overall walleye population.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies, bluegills, and yellow perch thrive in the productive waters of Lake Independence.  Bluegills (N = 220), averaging 4.3 inches, and black crappies (N = 243), averaging 5.9 inches, were sampled in gill nets.  Black crappie abundance (20.3/gill net) was above average when compared to local class 24 lakes.  In order to properly assess bluegill and black crappie populations, trap netting needs to be included in assessment.  Yellow perch numbers (22.4/gill net) are down from the two previous assessments (2000 and 2004; 50.5/gill net).  Average length was 6.2 inches with a maximum length of approximately 10.2 inches.  Although Lake Independence may not provide a viable perch fishery, the moderate to high-density perch population supports the fast-growing predators of Lake Independence.  A decrease in perch relative abundance may be due to an expanding walleye population.   <br> \n <br> \nTwo hybrid sunfish and 105 pumpkinseeds were sampled in gill nets.  Pumpkinseeds averaged approximately 4.6 inches while hybrid sunfish averaged 5.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSeven common carp and ten white suckers were sampled in average numbers for class 24 lakes.  Carp averaged approximately 24.8 inches while white suckers averaged 11.7 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Independence is an 832-acre lake located in western Hennepin County in the city of Maple Plain.  Baker Park Reserve (Three Rivers Park District) borders the southeast portion of the lake and provides a two-lane concrete boat access (subject to park hours and parking fee), as well as shore fishing, a swimming beach and recreation area.  Primarily managed for Walleye, Muskellunge, and Yellow Perch, Independence is a popular fishing destination.  Lake Independence is infested with Zebra mussels and Eurasian watermilfoil.   <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of Walleye were caught in the 2019 survey, though sampled at lower levels than recent previous surveys. Fish were of healthy sizes and conditions.  The average Walleye was 18.4 inches and 2.70 pounds, with the largest measuring 28.0 inches.  Fifty-three percent of the sample were 15 inches or longer, 38% were 20 inches or longer, and 16% were 25 inches or longer.  Regular stocking supports this population.   <br> \n <br> \nSampling for Muskellunge was not conducted in 2019; however, one 35.6 inch fish was incidentally caught in the summer survey.  The fish was three years old.  Lake Independence doesn't usually have high numbers of Northern Pike, and that was true again in the 2019 summer survey.  The fish were large, however, 70% of the catch exceeded 28 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile only one Yellow Perch exceeded 9 inches, their abundance marks the presence of a healthy forage base for stocked predator fish.  Average length and weight in 2019 were 7.6 inches and 0.2 pounds and 40% of the fish sampled were larger than 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie were caught in good numbers.  Black Crappie size was on the small side; only 3% of the crappie sampled were larger than 9 inches.  Fifty-two percent of the Bluegill were larger than 6 inches and 21% were larger than 7 inches.  The largest Bluegill sampled was 8.0 inches and the largest Black Crappie sampled was 10.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBoat electrofishing for Largemouth Bass was not conducted in 2019, however, the lake supports a healthy population of the fish.  Other species present in lower abundance during the 2019 survey include Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>BOWFIN, WHITE SUCKER, CARP, BLACK BULLHEAD, MUSKEL LUNGE, YELLOW PERCH, WHITE CRAPPIE, BLACK CRAPPIE AND HYBRID SUNFISH WERE FOUND AT NUMBERS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN. BROWN BULLHEAD, YELLOW BULLHEAD, NORTHERN PIKE, WALLEYE, PUMPKIN- SEED AND BLUEGILLS WERE SAMPLED AT LEVELS BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH PER NET. THE NUMBERS OF BOWFIN, WHITE SUCKER, AND ALL BULLHEAD SPECIES HAVE REMAINED STABLE SINCE 1974. BLACK BULLHEADS OF 8.0-8.4 INCHES WERE THE MOST ABUNDANT GROUP WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THAT FOUND IN 1979. BOTH WHITE AND BLACK CRAPPIES ARE MORE NUMEROUS THAN IN 1979 WHICH WAS HIGHER THAN THE 1974 NETTING. THE AVG SIZE OF BOTH SPECIES IS SMALL (7.0-7.4 IN. MEDIAN FOR WHITE CRAPPIE; BLACK CRAPPIE 6.0-6.4 IN MEDIAN), WHICH IS SMALLER THAN THE MEDIAN FOR EACH IN 1979. DURING THE SAME PERIOD FROM 1974 TO 1984 THE PUMPKINSEED, BLUEGILL, AND HYBRID SUNFISH NUMBERS HAVE SHOWN A DRAMATIC DECLINE. IN 1974 54.14 BLUEGILLS PER TRAPNET LIFT WERE SAMPLED. WHILE 8.88 WERE TAKEN IN 1979 AND 6.5 IN 1984. BLUEGILLS ARE PRIMARILY UNDER 6.5 INCHES SHOWING LITTLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION SHIFT SINCE 1979. A POSS- IBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE PANFISH POPUALTION SHIFT MAY BE THE HIGH ROUGHFISH POPUALTION (CARP AND BULLHEADS) AND THE RESULTANT DECREASE IN VEGETA- TION AND INCREASED TUBIDITY FAVORING CRAPPIE SUR-V VIVAL OVER BLUEGILLS. THE LOW LARGEMOUTH BASS ABUNDANCE MAY BE FOR SIMILAR REASONS. THE NUMBERS OF NORTHERN PIKE ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN 1979 AND GROWTH IS SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL. WALLEYE CATCH PER LIFT HAS DECLINED SINCE 1974, AND WALLEYE FRY STOCKED ANNUALLY SINCE 1979 HAVE NOT CONTRIBUTED TO THE POPULATION. THE ONLY WALLEYE SAMPLED WAS A 1977 YEAR CLASS FISH. MUSKELLUNGE HAVE BEEN STOCKD SINCE 1971 AND THE POPULATION HAS REMAINED RELA- TIVELY STABLE SINCE 1974. MUSKELLUNGE SAMPLED RANGED FROM 17.0 TO 29.9 INCHES AND REPRESENTED FOUR YEAR CLASSES OF STOCKED FISH. LEGAL FISH ARE BEING CAUGHT BY ANGLERS. GROWTH OF MUSKELLUNGE IS AVERAGE. THAT THE MUSKELLUNGE POPULATION IS DEVE- LOPED THROUGH STOCKING IS SUPPORTED BY THE 1979 NETTING WHERE MISSING YEAR CLASSES WERE NOTED FOR YEARS WITHOUT STOCKING.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Independence is an 844-acre lake located in western Hennepin County in the city of Maple Plain.  Baker Park Reserve (Three Rivers Park District) borders the southeast portion of the lake and provides a two-lane concrete boat access.  Lake Independence offers a diverse sportfish community consisting of black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, muskellunge, pumpkinseed, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch.  Since 1999, management plan goals include stocking walleye at 2.0 lb/littoral acre (850 lb) in odd-numbered years while stocking 1000 muskellunge in even-numbered years.  A population assessment was conducted, starting in late July 2010, to determine the species composition and abundance of fish in the lake.     <br> \n <br> \nWater quality in Lake Independence has been declining in recent years.  Three Rivers Park District has been monitoring the water quality and nutrient loading within the lake.  Watershed development and the numerous hobby farms within the watershed are suspected to be the source of nutrient input into Lake Independence.  Dissolved oxygen levels fell below 2 ppm at 16 ft in 2010, despite the lake's maximum depth of 58 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (5.1/gill net) is moderately high compared to other similar lakes in the state.  However, gill-net catch is below the long-term average (past 7 assessments) of 10.7/net, and is the lowest on record since 1984.  Average length and weight were 15.5 inches and 1.95 pounds, with the longest measuring 29.1 inches.  Thirty percent were 15 inches or longer, 25% were 20 inches or longer, and 16% were 25 inches or longer.  The walleye population is supported by the strong 2007 year class that comprised 50% of the catch.  The next strongest year class was in 2009 which comprised 18% of the catch.  These 1 and 3 year old fish dominated the sample and should grow into desirable sizes in next 2 to 3 years.  Walleye averaged 15 inches by age 4 and 21 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance is lower than some of the previous assessments; however, catch was still moderately high in gill nets (14.5/net) and moderate in trap nets (9.1/net) compared to other similar lakes in the state.  Mean length and weight of black crappie from both gear types was 7.8 inches and 0.24 pounds.  Thirty-four percent were 8 inches or longer and the longest measured 9.5 inches.  Ages ranged from 1 through 6.  The largest year class was 2004, which comprised 53% of the sample.  Black crappie averaged 8 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance is high (66.2/trap net) and size is moderate (mean = 0.17 pounds) compared with other similar lakes in the state.  Trap net catch is near the long-term average (49.5/net over previous 7 assessments), although is less than half that observed in the last assessment in 2007 (134.6/trap net). Mean length of bluegill in trap nets was 6.0 inches.  Sixty-nine percent were 6 inches or longer and the longest measured 7.1 inches.  Ages ranged from 2 to 6.  The largest year class was 2008, which comprised 42% of the sample.   <br> \nBluegill averaged 6 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has historically been low in Lake Independence, averaging 2.2/gill net over the previous 7 assessments.  In 2010, 1.3/gill net were sampled, which is considered low compared to other similar lakes in the state.  Alternatively, size structure is good.  Ninety-four percent were 21 inches or longer, 50% were 28 inches or longer, and 19% were 34 inches or longer.  Ages 2 through 9 were represented, with the 2007 year class (44%) being the most abundant.  Northern pike reached 21 inches by age 3 and 28 inches by age 4.   <br> \n <br> \nNine largemouth bass were collected during the assessment; however, passive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass.  The data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  Mean size was 12.3 inches and 1.2 pounds with the largest reaching 16.1 inches and 2.7 lbs.  Fifty-six percent were 12 inches and longer and 22% were 15 inches and longer.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are abundant.  Gill net catch was high (39.3/net) compared to other similar lakes in the state.  Yellow perch gill net catch has historically remained relatively stable.  Current yellow perch numbers are similar to the mean over the previous 7 assessments (40.2/gill net).  Mean length and weight were 6.9 inches and 0.14 pounds.  Ten percent were 8 inches or longer and the longest measured 9.1 inches.  Ages 2 through 6 were represented, with the 2007 year class (56%) being the most abundant.  Yellow perch reached 8 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nSpring ice-out trap netting is used to index adult muskellunge abundance but this was not conducted in this assessment, so the data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  However, 7 muskellunge were sampled ranging from 22.6 to 47.6 inches.  Lake Independence is a popular muskellunge fishery in the western metro area.   <br> \n <br> \nIn an assessment of the shallow, nearshore fish community, backpack electrofishing and seining were conducted at two different times throughout the summer.  The most abundant species observed were bluegill and bluntnose minnow.  Additionally, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, green sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, yellow perch, black crappie, hybrid sunfish, walleye, golden shiner, spotfin shiner, fathead minnow, Iowa darter, and Johnny darter were observed.  An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was estimated based on all fish sampled in this assessment.  The absence of sensitive species contributed to low IBI scores of 68.1 and 83.8, indicating water quality and habitat may be impaired.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance were common carp and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Independence is an 844-acre Class 24 lake located in western Hennepin County in the city of Maple Plain.  Baker Park Reserve (Three Rivers Park District) borders the southeast portion of the lake and provides a two-lane concrete boat access (subject to park hours and parking fee), as well as shore fishing, a swimming beach and recreation area. <br> \n <br> \nLake Independence is primarily managed for its Walleye, Muskellunge, and Yellow Perch fisheries.  At the time of this report, management planning includes stocking Walleye at a rate of 2 lb/littoral acre (850 lb) in odd-numbered years and 425 Leech Lake broodstock-strain Muskellunge (1 fish/ littoral acre) in even-numbered years. In 2016, the Standard Survey consisted of springtime night electrofishing of 6 sites on May 17, and 9 gill net sets and 11 trap net sets between July 20 and July 28.   <br> \n <br> \nWater quality in Lake Independence has been declining in recent years.  Three Rivers Park District has been monitoring water quality and nutrient loading within the lake.  Watershed development and the numerous hobby farms within the watershed are thought to be the primary sources of nutrient input.  During the July 2016 sampling, dissolved oxygen levels were below 2 ppm at 22 feet. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (5.6 fish/gill net) is high relative to other Class 24 lakes in the state, and also one of the better recent local values. Average length and weight were 17.7 inches and 2.23 pounds, with the longest measuring 26.2 inches.  Sixty-two percent of the sample were 15 inches or longer, 40% were 20 inches or longer, and 4% were 25 inches or longer.  The Walleye population is supported by the strong 2011 year class that comprised 54% of the catch.  2013 was next-strongest year class, forming 28% of the sample.  Walleye averaged 14 inches by age 3 and 20 inches by age 5. Numeric population was 2,704 fish, at the low end the range from surveys since 1989.  During that period, Walleye populations have been estimated at 2,474-12,817 fish, with low and high values from the 2010 and 1999 surveys, respectively. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance is high compared to other Class 24 lakes; the fish were caught at a rate of 35.9/gill net.  Mean length and weight of Black Crappie was 6.5 inches and 0.15 pounds.  Five percent were 8 inches or longer and the longest measured 9.3 inches.  The 2014 year class dominated the sample, comprising 95% of total catch.  Black Crappie averaged 6.3 inches by age 3, and 8.8 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance is high (66.3/trap net) and fish are of modest size (mean weight, 0.14 lb) compared with other Class 24 lakes in the state.  Mean length of Bluegill in trap nets was 5.5 inches.  Twenty-eight percent were 6 inches or longer and the longest measured 8.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has historically been low in Lake Independence, averaging 1.5/gill net over the previous 5 assessments (2001-2013).  In 2016, 5.2 fish per gill net were sampled, an above average catch rate for the Lake Class.  The fish were of quality size.  Ninety-eight percent were 21 inches or longer, and 60% were 28 inches or longer.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented.  The 2014 and 2011 year classes were most abundant, comprising 67% of the catch.  Northern Pike reached 23.4 inches by age 2 and 31.4 inches by age 6.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were highly abundant in 2016.  Caught at a rate of 101.56/net, mean length and weight were 6.6 inches and 0.13 pounds.  Only 1% were 8 inches or longer (PSD = 1) and the longest measured 8.3 inches.  All fish were age 2 or age 3; the 2014 year class (age 2) dominated the catch, comprising 80% of all perch sampled.  Yellow Perch are growing fast in Independence, attaining an average of 6.3 inches by age 2. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016, Largemouth Bass were caught at a rate of 62.2 fish per hour of on-time (electrofishing).  The fish averaged 8.6 inches and 0.39 pounds and the largest fish was 16.1 inches.  Fish ages 2 - 5 and age 11 were present in the sample.  Bass are growing at an average rate, reaching 9.1 inches by age 3 and 10.5 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nA Targeted Survey, consisting of 10 large-frame trap nets was conducted at ice-out to sample the Walleye and Muskellunge populations.  Two hundred-eighteen Walleye were captured, averaging 18.8 inches and 2.7 pounds.  By sampling fish during their spawning time, larger, sexually mature individuals are targeted and smaller, immature fish are absent from the sample.  This is evident in the 2016 sampling, as 87% of Walleye sampled exceeded 15 inches, 29% exceeded 20 inches, and 10% exceeded 25 inches.  The 2011 year class, age 5 Walleye were most abundant in the sample, comprising 51% of the catch.  The youngest Walleye appearing in the catch were age 3, indicating this as the age of sexual maturation.  Walleye ages 3 through 11 were captured.  Only 10 Muskellunge were caught during this sample period; however, Independence is known to offer a high quality Muskellunge fishery.  Angler reports indicate consistent success in catching large individuals.  Muskellunge sampled in 2016 trap nets ranged in size from 36.3 inches to 51.6 inches, with an average length and weight of 44.4 inches and 23.96 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in lower abundance during the 2016 survey include Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Independence (27-0176) is an 844-acre, class 24 lake located in western Hennepin County in the city of Maple Plain.  Baker Park Reserve (Three Rivers Park) borders the southeast portion of the lake and provides a two-lane concrete boat access.  Lake Independence offers a diverse sportfish community consisting of black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, muskellunge, pumpkinseed, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch.  Since 1999, management plan goals include stocking walleye at 2.0 lb/littoral acre (850 lb) in odd- numbered years while stocking 1000 muskellunge in even-numbered years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of this special assessment was to sample bluegill and crappie using trap nets only (12).  This survey is in complement to the 2006 special assessment, which only used gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2007 trap net catch was dominated by bluegills (12.27 lbs/net).  The bluegill (N=1,346) catch averaged 134.6 fish/net, and was more than double the upper quartile (62.5) for class 24 lakes.  This was the largest bluegill catch rate observed, dating back to 1948.  The next largest catch rate was 75.8 bluegills/net in 1998.  Bluegill mean length fell to 4.97 inches (range: 2.83-8.46), compared to 6.75 inches in 2004.  Size structure indices (PSD = 14; RSD-P = 0) revealed small individuals dominated the bluegill population.  Bluegill mean weight (0.09 lbs) fell below the lower quartile (0.13) for class 24 lakes, and dropped substantially from the mean weight in 2004 (0.23).  Condition of bluegills (relative weight: 90) in Lake Independence was fair to good, and decreased significantly with length (linear regression: df = 307; t = -12.38; P < 0.001) indicating a resource bottleneck for larger bluegills may be occurring.  The increase in bluegill catch rate and decreases in mean length and weight are likely due to the large number of 1 and 2 year old bluegills (906; 73%) sampled in 2007.  The 2004 assessment only sampled 1 fish in these age classes, and also few age 3 fish.  In 2004, these age classes would have originated from the 2001, 2002, and 2003 year-classes.  These year classes represented ages 4, 5, and 6 in 2007, which were sampled in considerably fewer numbers as compared the number of bluegills age 4, 5, and 6 sampled in 2004.  This indicates bluegill recruitment may have been weak in years prior to the 2004 assessment resulting in the missing 1, 2, and 3 year-old fish in that assessment and the under-representation of ages 4, 5, and 6 in 2007.  Bluegill growth was near average compared to other class 24 lakes in the West Metro management area, and bluegills reached 6 inches, on average, by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie relative abundance (22.2/trap net) was above the upper quartile for class 24 lakes, similar to the 2004 assessment.  Black crappie abundance appears to have increased since the assessment in 2001 when relative abundance was 6.18/net.  Mean length for sampled black crappie was 4.97 (range: 4.91-9.49), and size structure indices revealed a population comprised of small fish (PSD = 10; RSD-P = 0).  Mean weight of black crappie (0.15 lbs) fell in below the lower quartile for class 24 lakes (0.18) in 2007, and decreased from the mean weight in 2004 (0.27 lbs) and 2001 (0.24 lbs).  Black crappie condition was fair to good (relative weight: 91), but declined significantly with length (linear regression: df = 152; t = -12.95; P < 0.001).  Black crappie growth was average for class 24 lakes, and black crappie reached 8 inches by age 5.  The timing of this assessment may have been too late to adequately sample the black crappie population as this species tends to utilize offshore habitats by mid-June. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed sunfish were abundant in Lake Independence and relative abundance (13.4/trap net) was well above the upper quartile for class 24 lakes (4.24).  Mean weight of pumpkinseed sunfish (0.08 lbs) however, fell below the lower quartile (0.10) for class 24 lakes.  Pumpkinseed sunfish averaged 4.8 inches, and the majority (94%) of pumpkinseed sunfish were age 2 and 3. <br> \n <br> \nOther gamefish captured during this assessment include: hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, muskellunge, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch.   According to locals, Lake Independence has a reputation for a quality bass fishery.  Spring electrofishing should be added to future surveys to assess the bass population.  One smallmouth buffalo was captured during this assessment.  Previous spring ice-out trap net assessments have captured enough individuals to suggest this population is established and not just an unusual occurrence.  Lake Independence is connected to the Crow River via several small lakes and creeks; hence, it is possible smallmouth buffalo came to Lake Independence via these connections <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Independence is an 844-acre lake located in western Hennepin County in the city of Maple Plain.  Baker Park Reserve (Three Rivers Park District) borders the southeast portion of the lake and provides a two-lane concrete boat access (subject to park hours and parking fee) as well as shore fishing, a swimming beach and recreation area. The lake stratifies strongly in mid-summer, and dissolved oxygen levels below 15 feet can be low during this time. <br> \n <br> \nLake Independence is primarily managed for its Walleye, Muskellunge, and Yellow Perch fisheries.  Present management includes Walleye fingerling stocking in odd-numbered years and Leech Lake brood Muskellunge stocking in even-numbered years.  In 2013, a fisheries population assessment was made, consisting of 12 gill net sets during the last week of July, followed by 12 trap net sets during the first week of October.     <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (8.4/gill net) is high for this type of lake. Average length and weight were 16.6 inches and 1.99 pounds, with the longest measuring 29.0 inches.  Sixty-seven percent of sampled fish were 15 inches or longer, 30% were 20 inches or longer, and 2% were 25 inches or longer.  The strong 2009 year class formed 50% of the catch.  The next strongest year class was in 2011, which formed 35% of the catch.  Walleye averaged 19 inches by age 4 and 22 inches by age 6.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance is very high compared to similar lakes in the state, with a catch rate of 75.0 fish per gill net.  Mean length and weight of Black Crappie was 7.8 inches and 0.26 pounds.  Thirty-one percent were 8 inches or longer, and the longest fish measured 11.7 inches.  The 2010 year class (age 3) dominated the sample, comprising 94% of total catch.  Black Crappie averaged 7.6 inches by age 3 and 9.1 inches by age 8. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance is high (65.6 fish/trap net) and size is good (mean = 0.21 pounds) compared with similar lakes.  Mean length of Bluegill in trap nets was 6.5 inches.  Seventy-two percent were 6 inches or longer, and the longest fish measured 8.1 inches.  Ages ranged from 1 to 8.  The largest year class was 2010, which comprised 54% of the sample.  Bluegill averaged 6.9 inches at age 7.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has historically been low in Lake Independence, averaging 2.2/gill net over the previous 7 assessments.  In 2013, 2.2 /gill net were sampled, low relative to similar lakes.  Conversely, size structure is good.  Eighty-eight percent were 21 inches or longer, and 38% were 28 inches or longer.  Ages 2 through 5 were represented, with the 2010 year class (46%) being the most abundant.  Northern Pike reached 24 inches by age 3 and 28 inches by age 4.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are moderately abundant.  Gill net catch, 16.4/net was above the median of its Lake Class.  Yellow Perch gill net catch has declined in recent years; abundance this survey was well below the 2010 sample catch (39.3/net).  Mean length and weight were 7.2 inches and 0.17 pounds.  Eight percent were 8 inches or longer, and the longest measured 8.5 inches.  Ages 2 through 5 were represented, with the 2010 year class (75%) being the most abundant.  Yellow Perch reached 7.8 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nNine Largemouth Bass were collected during the assessment; however, net sampling under-represents the true abundance.  Mean size was 11.2 inches and 0.8 pounds with the largest reaching 14.1 inches and 1.7 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nSpring ice-out trap netting is used to index adult Muskellunge abundance but this was not conducted in this assessment, so this survey's data is likely not indicative of relative abundance.  Nine Muskellunge, with a size range of 15.9-50.0 inches, were sampled with survey nets.  Lake Independence is a popular Muskellunge fishery in the western metro area.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Independence is one of the premier Muskellunge and walleye fisheries in the region. Present populations for these species are very good and are providing some quality angling experiences for many anglers according to field observation and local media reports. Walleyes handled during this survey averaged 16.3 inches in length and 1.8 pounds per fish. The catch per net was the highest ever observed during standard surveys and assessments for this lake. The largest walleye handled measured 28.7 inches in length.Muskellunge up to 41.3 inches were captured in trap nets during this survey. Previous nettings have observed Muskellunge in excess of 30.0 pounds in the sample, with reports of even larger fish being caught by anglers. A quality northern pike population is also present with over 1/3 of the fish sampled being 30.0 inches or longer. The yellow perch population remains high in abundance and is able to support good growth in all game fish species sampled. Other forage species sampled included white sucker, golden shiner and three different species of bullhead. While bullhead abundance was low, the average size for all three species was in excess of 10 inches.Largemouth bass were also present in the sample, but no large individuals were observed. Bluegill were the most abundant of the panfish species sampled with some individuals measuring up to 8.6 inches in length. Almost 1/3 of all bluegill sampled were 7.0 inches or longer. Pumpkinseed sunfish are also abundant, but average a little smaller than the bluegill in total length. Black and white crappie are both present, with black crappies being the most abundant of the two species. Individuals up to 11.3 inches were captured and 1/4 of all crappies sampled measured 9.0 inches or longer.Bowfin and carp were also sampled during this survey. Individuals over 29 inches were captured for both species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Independence is an 844-acre, class 24 lake located in western Hennepin County in the city of Maple Plain.  Baker Park Reserve (Three Rivers Parks) borders the southeast portion of the lake and provides a two-lane concrete boat access.  Boasting one the metro's best all-around fisheries, Lake Independence offers a diverse sport fish community consisting of black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, muskellunge, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch.  Since 1999, management plan goals include stocking walleye at 2.0 lb/littoral acre (850 lb) in odd numbered years while stocking 1000 muskellunge in alternate years (even numbered years).  Lake Independence provides the metro area with quality bass, muskellunge, and pike fishing.  Exhibiting good size structure and numbers, the muskellunge population averaged approximately 39 inches and 14 pounds.  All fish were larger than 35 inches with two fish exceeding 40 inches.  The largest fish measured a respectable 47.8 inches.  Gill net catches revealed a pike population at its highest level since 1979.  Sampled pike averaged approximately 27 inches and 4.7 pounds with the largest individual measuring over 36 inches.  Approximately 71 and 24% of sampled pike were over 25 and 30 inches, respectively.  Although gill nets and trap nets do not effectively sample largemouth bass, one 18.5-inch largemouth bass was sampled in a trap net.  Although walleye catch rates were below 10 per gill net for the fist time in 20 years (5.4/gill net), gill net caught walleye averaged a respectable 20.6 inches and 3.8 pounds.  The largest walleye measured slightly over 28 inches.  Approximately 84 and 61% of sampled walleye were over 15 and 20 inches, respectively.   Future assessments will further evaluate contributions of the stocked 2003 fingerlings to the overall walleye population.  Additionally, good numbers of small perch may make catching Lake Independence walleyes very challenging.  Black crappies, bluegills, and yellow perch thrive in the productive waters of Lake Independence.  Of the 719 bluegills captured in both gill and trap nets, approximately 32 and 61% of sampled bluegill were above 7.0 and 6.5 inches, respectively.  Approximately 56 and 89% of the crappie sampled (total number = 847) were above 8.0 and 7.0 inches with the largest fish slightly less than 10.0 inches.  Yellow perch were sampled in identical numbers when compared to 2000 survey (approximately 50 perch / gill net).  Although Lake Independence may not provide a viable perch fishery, the plentiful perch population supports the fast-growing predators of Lake Independence.        Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were sampled in relatively low numbers.  Pumpkinseeds averaged approximately 5.5 in while hybrid sunfish averaged 5.9 in.      Bowfin, common carp, and yellow bullheads were captured in varying numbers.  Additionally, one smallmouth buffalo measuring 20.0 inches was sampled in a trap net.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Independence is an 832-acre lake located in western Hennepin County in the city of Maple Plain.  Baker Park Reserve (Three Rivers Park District) borders the southeast portion of the lake and provides a two-lane concrete boat access (subject to park hours and parking fee), as well as shore fishing, a swimming beach and recreation area.  Primarily managed for Walleye, Muskellunge, and Yellow Perch, Independence is a popular fishing destination.  The lake is infested with Zebra mussels and Eurasian watermilfoil.   <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of Walleye were caught in the 2022 survey, and the fish were of healthy size.  The average Walleye was 18.5 inches and 2.60 pounds, with the largest measuring 28.5 inches.  Seventy-three percent of the sample were 15 inches or longer, 33% were 20 inches or longer, and 12% were 25 inches or longer.  Regular stocking supports this population.   <br> \n <br> \nSampling for Muskellunge was not scheduled in 2022; however, one 40.9 inch fish was incidentally caught in the summer survey.  When the lake was last surveyed for Muskies in 2016, fish ranged between 36.6 and 51.6 inches, with an average size of 44.4 inches and 23.96 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile only 4% of the Yellow Perch catch exceeded 9 inches, their abundance marks the presence of a healthy forage base for stocked predator fish.  Average length and weight in 2022 were 7.3 inches and 0.19 pounds and 26% of the fish sampled were larger than 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Independence doesn't usually have high numbers of Northern Pike, and that was true again in the 2022 summer survey.  The fish were of good size, however, 91% of the catch exceeded 21 inches, and 27% of the catch exceeded 28 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie were caught in good numbers.  Sixteen percent of the sampled crappie exceeded 9 inches, and the largest fish was 11.3 inches.  Twenty-six percent of the Bluegill were larger than 6 inches and 10% were larger than 7 inches.  The largest Bluegill sampled was 8.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing for Largemouth Bass was not scheduled in 2022, however seven fish were incidentally sampled by trap net.  The fish ranged in length from 4.8 to 6.0 inches.  Standard electrofishing was last done in spring 2016.  At that time, 172 fish were sampled, ranging in length from 3.4 to 16.1 inches.  Average size of bass in 2016 was 8.6 inches and 0.39 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in lower abundance during the 2022 survey include Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Independence is one of the heaviest fished Muskellunge waters in Minnesota. An ice-out trap net assessment targeting Muskellunge was conducted during 1998 and the catch rate was found to 1.6 fish per net, thus indicating a very good population is present. The largest Muskellunge captured during this assessment was 49.1 inches in length and over 35 pounds. Black Crappies were the most abundant species sampled during the 1998 population assessment. The catch rate was the highest observed on Lake Independence since 1984 but the average size was only 6.5 inches in length. Bluegill were sampled in the highest abundance ever observed during DNR fisheries surveys. Recent strong years of production have resulted in an average size of only 5.7 inches in length. Approximately 40 percent of all Bluegill captured were 6 inches or longer in size. Largemouth Bass were sampled at similar levels to that observed in 1994. Walleye were sampled in good abundance as represented by a gill net catch rate of 12.3 fish per set. The average size of Walleye captured was 20.2 inches long and 3.2 pounds. Approximately 10 percent of all Walleye sampled during 1998 were found to be from an non-stocked year class (1994). Northern Pike abundance is up from that observed in 1994 and is the highest observed in this lake since 1979. The average Northern Pike captured was 25.6 inches long and 4.2 pounds. Yellow Perch catch rates are the highest ever observed and represent a tripling in abundance since the 1994 fisheries survey. The average length for Yellow Perch was 6.2 inches long, and only four individuals exceeded 8 inches in length. Bowfin were also observed in the highest trap net abundance ever recorded on Lake Independence.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Independence presently supports an excellent fishery for several species.  Black crappie were abundant in this survey,  and 1 in 3 exceed 8 inches.  Northern pike catch was typical of this type of lake, but the average size was an impressive 28 inches.  Almost 30 % of pike sampled were greater than 30 inches.  The abundance of walleye was high, as was the average size.  Sampled walleye averaged 3.4 pounds and 20 inches, and two-thirds of fish exceeded 20 inches.  Catching larger fish may be more difficult in Lake Independence due to a high perch population.  Perch averaged 6.7 inches, but only 1% were larger than 8 inches.  Bluegill were found in numbers typical of this type of lake, but only 8% were larger than 7 inches.  Previous surveys have found good numbers and large average size for largemouth bass and muskellunge, but sampling gear used in this survey was not effective at sampling those species.  Also found in the lake in low numbers are bowfin, carp, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and yellow bullhead.</p>",
