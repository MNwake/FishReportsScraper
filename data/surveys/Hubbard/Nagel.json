                "narrative": "<p>\tNagel Lake is located eleven miles south of Akeley in Hubbard County. Nagel has a surface area of 69 acres and a maximum depth of 65 feet. There is a state owned carry in access on the northeast shore of the lake. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Nagel Lake is in lake class 28. Class 28 lakes generally are small with a regularly shaped shoreline, and very clear and hard water. Other class 28 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Big Bass, Dinner, Emma, Gilmore, Indian, Newman, Thomas, and Williams. Due to its small size, Nagel Lake is very susceptible to over-harvest. Anglers must practice selective harvest if they want to improve or maintain the fishery. <br> \n\tNorthern Pike were sampled in average numbers compared to similar lakes, and past surveys of Nagel Lake. The average size was 18.6 inches and 1.5 pounds, with the largest just over 25 inches. <br> \n\tLargemouth Bass were sampled in numbers in line with previous years, and on the high end for similar lakes. Bass were an average size of 8.5 inches, with fish sampled up to 14.4 inches. <br> \n\tBluegills were abundant and higher than similar lakes. Fish were sampled from 2.8 to 8.2 inches, with most fish 3-7 inches. <br> \n\tCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Nagel Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

Shoal water soils are mainly sand with marl.Fishes taken by test nets in numbers which exceeded the statewide median catch per set were: northern pike, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, and bluegill.  Even though walleye fry have been stocked regularly since 1948, only one walleye was taken during the test netting.Shoreline development at this time includes two homes, three cabins, and six boats.  During the winter of 1962-63 there was on fish house on this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nagel Lake is located in southeastern Hubbard County, eleven miles south of Akeley.  Nagel Lake has a surface area of 69 acres and a maximum depth of 65 feet.  There is a carry-in public access located on the northeast shore of the lake.  Due to its small size, Nagel Lake is very susceptible to over-harvest.  Anglers must practice selective harvest if they want to improve or maintain the fishery in Nagel Lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Nagel Lake is in lake class 28.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Big Bass, Dinner, Emma, Gilmore, Indian, Newman, Thomas, and Williams.Nagel Lake provides fishing opportunities for largemouth bass, panfish, northern pike, and maybe an occasional walleye.  Good numbers of largemouth bass and bluegill were sampled.  Anglers will find bass in the 12-14 inch range and bluegill in the 6-8 inch range common.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers (1.0 crappie/trapnet), within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate levels.  Northern pike were sampled in low numbers, with the gillnet catch rate of 2.5 pike/net below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to high numbers.  Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes.  DNR permits were issued for private stockings of walleye fingerlings in 1998 and 2002.  Other species sampled included moderate numbers of hybrid sunfish and yellow bullhead, and low numbers of yellow perch, rock bass, and bowfin (dogfish). </p>",

Local residents may be stocking adult walleyes in Nagel Lake as one of the walleyes sampled was a tagged walleye from Big Sand Lake.  The average weight of 3.7 pounds is high with all walleyes sampled during 1993 exceeding 18.0 inches.  The northern pike gillnet catch was also much higher than any previous survey.  The northern pike average size was 19.3 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Black crappies were not sufficiently sampled with standard gear to analyze their abundance and size structure.  Bluegills are abundant  in Nagel Lake and their size structure is characteristic of a population with high reproductive success and slow growth rates.  The yellow perch are low in number as they have been for all surveys, with a large size structure.  Largemouth bass are present in good numbers however, their size structure is generally small.</p>",
