                "narrative": "<p>Venoah is a 77 acre lake with 69 (90%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  Venoah Lake is located two miles south of Carlton, MN.  Venoah Lake has no public access and is entirely surrounded by private land.  Development is limited to a \"treatment center\" set back from the lake and there is almost no disturbance along the shoreline.     Northern pike abundance of 8.5 per gillnet was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Northern pike were small with slow growth rates.  Mean length was 18.8 inches and length at age four was 19.6 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed a strong 1998 year class with all year classes from 1996 through 2000 represented.       Bluegill abundance of 4.1 per trapnet was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Bluegill size was good and growth was fast.  Mean length was 6.5 inches and length at age four was 6.0 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed a strong 1997 year class with all year classes from 1993 through 1999 represented.       A total of 16 largemouth were sampled by gillnet and trapnet.  Mean length of largemouth bass older than age one was 9.2 inches.       Other fish species sampled in Venoah lake include brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker and yellow perch.  Black crappie, which were sampled in a 1957 investigation, were not sampled in 2001.     Because there is no opportunity for the public to access Venoah Lake, fishing pressure is relatively low.  Future DNR fisheries management activities will also be limited by the lack of public access.</p>",
