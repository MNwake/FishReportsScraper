Public land is present on the northwest portion of the lake, however, there is no developed public access.  The fish community contains a natural walleye population along with sizeable bluegill, pumpkinseed, black crappie and northern pike.  Lake residents have placed signs along the shoreline to encourage catch and release fishing.     Walleye numbers were low in the 1997 survey, although several ages were sampled.  Average length was 15.9 inches with a range from 11.8 to 23.8 inches.  Northern pike numbers were also low with many different ages present.  Average pike length was 21.6 inches with a range from 13.3 to 31.7 inches.  One 19.1 inch largemouth bass was also sampled.     Bluegill, black crappie and pumpkinseed numbers were low to average with the mean length at 7.2, 9.3 and 5.8 inches respectively.  Bluegills over 1 pound were occasionaly seen in the 1997 investigation.  No yellow perch and only two white suckers were present in the rest of the 1997 fish catch.</p>",
