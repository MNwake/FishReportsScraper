                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike and bluegill continue to numerically dominate the Hay Lake fishery.  The quality of the northern pike population in Hay Lake is good compared to lakes with similar environmental characteristics. In 2004 there were 9.3 northern pike caught per gillnet lift and the mean total length was nearly 22 inches. There were 4 individuals sampled that were over 30 inches in length and almost 35% (15 of 42) were 24 inches or larger with the largest individual measuring 33.8 inches in total length. Northern pike were stocked on a regular basis between 1963 and 1980 however no increase in numbers was ever documented until the 1990's. Environmental factors likely contributed more to the increase in northern pike abundance than did stocking. The presence of yellow perch and relatively low angling pressure are also factors that contribute to the healthy status of the pike fishery.Despite slower than normal growth rates and high abundance for this lake type there are some quality bluegills found in this fishery. The longest individual sampled in 2004 was 8.7 inches and the mean length was 6.0 inches. Thirty five percent of all bluegills sampled were 6.5 inches or longer however only 1.3% were longer than 8 inches. Bluegill from the strong 1998 and 1999-year classes will continue to recruit into the 6-8 inch length group over the next few years and should provide some decent angling opportunities provided that fishing pressure does not dramatically increase.Black crappie abundance and recruitment has been variable over the years. Crappie growth is slower than normal and very few reach sizes that are acceptable to anglers. The mean size of crappie sampled in 2004 was slightly over 7 inches in total length. Both largemouth bass and walleye were stocked in Hay Lake prior to 1980 and neither species seems to have established a niche in this lake. No walleyes were caught in 2004 and only 4 have been caught in all previous investigations dating back to 1970.  Largemouth bass were not found in the 2004 survey but trace numbers may exist. Historically, stocking seems to have provided little benefit to the hay lake fishery and consequently has not been stocked with any species since 1980. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hay Lake has active fisheries for northern pike, bluegills and black crappies. Thenorthern pike population is doing well for this type of lake. Northern pike wererelatively abundant at 7.5 fish per gillnet set in 1994, the average length was 20.0inches in the gill nets, and lengths ranged up to 34.4 inches. Growth is slow, yet thereare a fair number of 24 inch or larger fish. Northern pike were stocked periodically from1963 to 1980 with fingerlings and yearlings. Northern pike abundance did not increaseuntil almost a decade after the stocking, and the increase was probably related toenvironmental influences rather than to stocking. Bluegills are reaching acceptable sizes, up to 8.3 inches, yet 86% are less than 6.0inches. The larger bluegills are at least 8 years old and probably have not been exposedto much angler harvest. Bluegills from the 1988 year class are now 6 to 7 inches long andwill likely replace the older fish in the next several years. Low angling pressure anddifficulty in catching larger bluegills through the dense vegetative cover may helpprotect the larger bluegills from overharvest. Given the slow growth of bluegills in HayLake, however, larger bluegills may be overharvested if angling pressure increases.The black crappie population has been variable over time. In this survey the blackcrappies in trap nets averaged 7.6 inches, and the largest fish was 10.9 inches long.Black crappies grow too slowly to reach sizes preferred by anglers. Largemouth bass werestocked in 1978 and 1980, yet have not been caught in the gill nets or trap nets in anysurvey to date. Young largemouth bass have been caught in seines. Bass are probably notabundant. Walleyes were stocked in 1969, 1973 and 1980, and only four have been caught inall surveys combined. No walleyes were caught in 1994. Stocking of various species hasapparently not benefited Hay Lake's fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hay Lake is located in northern Aitkin County, about four miles southeast of Jacobson.  Most of the land surrounding the lake is in public ownership with private property confined to the northern portion of the lake.  The abundant undeveloped shoreline helps foster a tranquil setting, which would appeal to anglers seeking a peaceful outing.  There is a public access associated with a state forest campground along the southeastern shore.  In addition to the standard fisheries survey, nearshore sampling was also completed in a special assessment to calculate the index of biotic integrity (IBI); basically a general measure of lake health. <br> \n   <br> \nHay Lake supports fisheries for popular species such as northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill.  The pike population has remained within the expected range for similar lakes in each of the last six surveys, dating back to 1976.   Pike growth rates were slow, but overall size was good with fish over 30\" captured in the survey.  The average size from gill nets was 23.2\" and 3.0 pounds, with 39% measuring greater than 24\".  The numbers of larger pike have been increasing in each of the last four surveys.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest of smaller pike in this population to preserve the quality nature of this fishery. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance decreased to 23.6/trap net and was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Growth was slow compared to other lakes in Aitkin County, and few fish exceeded 8\" in length.  The black crappie population displayed similar characteristics to the bluegill population with moderate abundance and very slow growth.  The size structure was poor and they averaged only 6.7\", with just three fish over 8\" captured in the survey.    <br> \n <br> \nThis was the first survey in which no yellow perch were sampled in trap nets or gill nets, athough some were observed in the shoreline backpack electrofishing assessment (part of IBI sampling).  Perch are an ecologically important species and act as both predators (for instance of young bluegill) and prey (especially for northern pike).  Another species observed in the electrofishing sample was golden shiner, which can also be an important food resource for northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nIt is important in a small lake like Hay, to maintain good coarse woody cover along shore.  Trees that fall into the water are an integral component of fish habitat.  When trees do fall into the water, please leave them be, or if they fall in an inconvenient location, just move them out of the way rather than removing them.  This coarse woody material has been found to be of great benefit to yellow perch and panfish, by providing cover, spawning habitat, as well as habitat for important invertebrate food resources. <br> \n</p>",

This survey was completed in addition to the standard population assessment conducted the week of July 1, 2013.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but three sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 15-foot seine was used at 3 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 7 sites.  Abundant emergent vegetation and soft sediments occurred around much of the lake and made sampling difficult.  Nearshore sampling captured relatively few species of fish including black crappie, bluegill, golden shiner, Johnny darter, largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch.  The preliminary IBI score (per Drake and Pereira, 2002) calculated from this survey, and using standard gill net and trap net data from the population assessment, was 71. <br> \n</p>",
