The previous assessment (2003) had collected one lake trout, a small, naturally produced fish. <br> \n <br> \nLake trout numbers were apparently low in Misquah Lake in 2013, but those fish that were present were fairly large.  Misquah Lake has never supported high numbers of lake trout, even when the species was stocked.  The 2013 gill net catch fell below the normal range for a lake of this class, but was similar to past catches seen in this lake.  Neither of the two lake trout taken could be accounted for in the stocking record, assuming age determinations were fairly accurate.  The oldest of the two fish was assigned an age of 15, while the youngest any stocked fish in this lake could have been was 24 years old.  The presence of such large lake trout was unusual; most small lakes of this type rarely produce fish larger than 20 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker and burbot had been taken in most past assessments of this lake, and both were present in 2013.  Minnow traps set in 2013 added bluntnose minnow and pearl dace to the list of fish species collected in this lake, and minnows appeared to have been fairly abundant.  Fathead minnows had been taken in minnows traps in this lake in 2003, and northern creek chub and northern redbelly dace were reportedly taken in minnow traps in 1978. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 11 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 42.7 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 4.0?C (39.2?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 8.8?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Lake Trout. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Lake Trout was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. Data collected in 1990 and 1999 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Lake Trout are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",
