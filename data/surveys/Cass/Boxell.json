                "narrative": "<p>Boxell Lake is a 60-acre lake located near Longville, MN that has 2.14 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 27 ft.  There is no public access on the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Boxell Lake is in Lake Class 36; lakes in this class are generally small with a very high percentage of shallow water area.   <br> \n <br> \nAbundance of northern pike in Boxell Lake compared favorably to other lakes in this class and fish up to 34 inches were sampled.  The number of black crappie collected in DNR test nets was at or above the number commonly found in this lake class.  Black crappie had an average length around 6 inches; however, fish from 9 to 12 inches were also found.  Largemouth bass numbers were good with an average length close to 11 inches and maximum length of 15 inches.   Both bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were commonly caught in DNR test nets.  Average length for these sunfish was between 5 and 6 inches, however fish up to 8 inches were found.  Abundance of yellow perch was similar to other lakes in this class.  Average size for this species was around 7 inches, and fish up to 9 inches were present.  Other species available for anglers include hybrid sunfish, walleye and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Boxell Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boxell Lake is a 60-acre lake with a maximum depth of 27 feet.  The lake is located one mile northwest of Longville.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classess based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Boxell Lake is in lake class 36.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Paquet, Mitten, Carnahan, and Ahamo Lakes.  Approximately 82% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Partial winterkills do occur periodically.  There is a user-developed access off of County Road 125 on the southwest corner of the lake.  Boxell Lake is a good fishing lake for northern pike, black crappie, and largemouth bass.Northern pike will give the angler plenty of action especially for 18 to 24 inch fish.  There is the opportunity to catch a northern pike over 30 inches.  Northern pike abundance is above what you would expect to find in lake class 36 lakes.  Boxell Lake northern pike have always been abundant.  In order for anglers to catch more large northern pike, selective harvest needs to be practiced; release all fish over 22 inches long.Black crappie are abundant in Boxell Lake.  Fish sampled ranged from 4.6 to 10.4 inches long with an average length and weight of 7 inches and 0.2 pound.  Historically there has always been an abundance of black crappie for the angler to catch.Bluegill were sampled in numbers for the first time in 1999.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3.1 to 9.9 inches with an average length of 5.3 inches.  There were five different year classes of bluegill found.  Growth was excellent.  A four year old bluegill was 7 inches long compared to the average for lake class 36 lakes of 4.9 inches.  To maintain this population of bluegill, anglers need to use some restraint is large bluegill are really biting.  Release the larger bluegill and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size bluegill have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.Another member of the sunfish family that is abundant in Boxell Lake is the pumpkinseed sunfish.  These fish are of quality size.Yellow perch are also abundant and provide food for the larger fish.Other species of fish sampled were largemouth bass and white sucker.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Boxell Lake and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Large fish can help maintain balance in the fish community.Because half of the shoreline on Boxell Lake is publicly owned, development on the lake has been minimal.  There are few stands of emergent vegetation such as bulrush, cattail, and wild rice.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boxell Lake is a 60-acre lake located near Longville, MN that has 2.14 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 27 ft.  There is user-developed access on the southwest shore of the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Boxell Lake is in Lake Class 36; lakes in this class are generally small with a very high percentage of shallow water area.   <br> \nAbundance of Northern Pike in Boxell Lake compared favorably to other lakes in this class. Average weight of northern pike found in the 2014 assessment was about 3 pounds, and fish up to 35 inches were sampled. The number of Black Crappie collected in DNR test nets was similar to the number commonly found in this lake class.  Black Crappie had an average length of almost 7 inches, and fish up to 11 inches were found.  Few Largemouth Bass were found, however sampled fish ranged from 5 to 17 inches. Bluegill caught in DNR test nets averaged about 6 inches, with fish up to 8 inches sampled. Pumpkinseeds are also available in the lake for sunfish anglers.  Abundance of Yellow Perch was similar to other lakes in this class.  Average size for this species was around 7 inches, and fish over 9 inches were present.   <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Boxell Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

THERE IS A POOR USER DEVELOPED ACCESS OFF A COUNTY GRAVEL ROAD.  ANGLERS PARK ALONG THE ROAD.NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE OF 4.50/GILLNET LIFT FELL BETWEEN THE MEDIAN AND THE FIRST QUARTILE FOR LAKE CLASS 36.  THE RATE FELL BELOW THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 6.2-37.0.  THE FISH RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 13 TO 31 INCHES, WITH A MODAL LENGTH GROUP OF 22.0 - 22.9 INCHES.  A GOOD VARIETY OF AGE GROUPS WERE PRESENT, WITH 1986 BEING THE STRONGEST.  GROWTH WAS GOOD AT ALL AGES. TWO WALLEYE WERE CAUGHT (19 AND 20 INCHES LONG).  BOTH FISH WERE MALE AND TEN YEARS OLD.  THE AGES CORRESPOND WITH THE LAST TIME (1981) THAT THE LAKE WAS STOCKED WITH WALLEYE.YELLOW PERCH WERE CAUGHT AT A RATE OF 28.5/GILLNET LIFT.  THE HISTORICAL NETTING SUMMARY SHOWS THAT THE YELLOW PERCH NUMBERS HAVE BEEN VERY STABLE SINCE 1978 (28.5 - 35.0).  THE 1991 RATE WAS EQUAL TO THE THIRD QUARTILE.  THE FISH RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 4.5 TO 10 INCHES, WITH A MODE OF 5.5 - 5.9 INCHES.NO BLUEGILL WERE CAUGHT.  THE ONLY TIME BLUEGILL WERE CAUGHT WAS IN 1978, WHERE ONLY ONE WAS CAPTURED.  PUMPKINSEED WERE CAUGHT AT A RATE OF 11.9/TRAPNET LIFT, WHICH WAS ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE. THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 3 TO 8 INCHES, WITH A MODE OF 6.0 - 6.4 INCHES.  GROWTH WAS GOOD, WITH AN AGE 3 FISH AVERAGING OVER 6 INCHES.THIS WAS ONLY THE SECOND SURVEY WHERE BLACK CRAPPIE WERE CAUGHT.  THE CATCH RATE IN 1991 (7.4/TRAPNET LIFT) WAS CONSIDERABLY GREATER THAN THE 1986 RATE (1.6/LIFT).  THE 1991 RATE WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE LAKE CLASS 36 MEDIAN (6.13/LIFT).  ONLY THE FIRST FOUR YEAR CLASSES WERE SAMPLED, BUT ALL YEARS WERE WELL REPRESENTED, SHOWING CONSISTENT RECRUITMENT.  GROWTH WAS GOOD.  FOUR LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE SAMPLED, SHOWING A WIDE RANGE IN LENGTHS (4.9 - 13.7 INCHES).  THESE FISH SHOWED MARGINALLY GOOD GROWTH.</p>",
