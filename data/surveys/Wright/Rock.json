Age classes 1-7 were caught, showing consistent reproduction. Average size is 3.6 pounds. Only two Largemouth Bass were captured; however, local residents claim to have good angling success. Bluegill (34.0/trap net) are abundant and had below average growth rates, most being five inches long and age 4. Black Crappie (1.5/trap net) were caught infrequently when compared to the local average of 4.0/trap net. The bulk of those captured were 6-7 inches long and age class 4. Present numbers of rough fish such as bowfin, black and yellow bullheads were average.</p>",
