                "narrative": "<p>Big Sandy Lake is located in northeastern Aitkin County approximately 9 miles north of McGregor. The lake is characterized as a large fertile walleye lake comprised of several habitat types. These include the open, windswept main basin, the deep cool eastern basin, Bill Horn Bay, the shallower and more isolated south basin, Webster Bay, and shallow bays containing dense rice beds on the south, east and northeast sides of the lake. The lake is currently managed for walleye, northern pike and black crappie. Walleyes are the most popular target for anglers, particularly in the main basin. The walleye in Big Sandy grow slowly and tend to be smaller on average than lakes with a faster growth rate. Past management has included a long history of various stocking strategies for walleye dating back to 1917.  No measurable changes in the walleye abundance were detected due to stocking, therefore stocking was discontinued in 1995. Furthermore, the strongest year class of walleyes ever produced was in 1994, which was a year when stocking did not occur. The mean length for walleyes caught in the survey gill nets was only 10.8 inches long and only six percent measured 18 inches or longer. The size distribution was similar to what was found in previous surveys and gillnet catch rates were virtually identical to what was observed in 2001 at 3.2 fish per net.  Survey data indicates that current catch rates are lower than what was documented through the 1990's when gill net catch rates ranged between 5.2 and 9.4 fish per net.  Five different age classes were represented in this survey with the 2002 and 2003 year classes being the strongest.  These fish will recruit to the sport fishery in the next couple of years.  The walleye population will continue to be monitored at regular intervals in the future.Northern pike are also an important game fish in Big Sandy Lake. The gillnet catch rate for northern pike is about average for this type of lake at 4.6 per net and has ranged between 4.0 and 5.9 per net since 1975.  The northern pike were also small, averaging just 17.8 inches, but ranging up to 26 inches in the survey gill nets. Despite the presence of a desirable yellow perch and tulibee population northern pike are small and seem to grow slow. Habitat segregation may explain some of this incongruity for example; yellow perch were mostly captured in the main basin, whereas northern pike were captured more often in the shallower, more vegetated areas of the lake.  Angler harvest may also be a factor contributing to the lack of large pike.The abundance of yellow perch was about average for this type of lake and has fluctuated over time.  The average size of perch was 8.0 inches and 30% were 9 inches or longer with some individuals reaching nearly 13.0 inches.The black crappie catch was up slightly from historical numbers and ranged in size from 7 to12 inches in length and averaged about 9 inches. The 2002 year class of crappies is strong and now are about 8 inches long.  Bluegill numbers also showed an increase in 2005 with a strong 1999 year class and reasonable recruitment from the 2000, 2001 and 2002 year classes. Although not particularly numerous the average size was good with a mean of 7.2 inches and 33% of the sample over 8 inches in length. The tulibee population experienced summer kill in the mid 1980's but has since rebounded to normal levels. Tulibee were caught at a rate of 9.8 per net in 2005 with an average size of 13.8 inches with some fish reaching nearly 20 inches.  Tulibee are a cold-water fish and provide quality forage for walleye and northern pike.  They have a low tolerance for warm water and are therefore are usually limited to the confines of Bill Horn Bay during the summer months. Anglers are encouraged to release large northern pike and walleye and also to protect habitat by practicing responsible shoreline management techniques.</p>",

This survey is intended to provide information on walleye recruitment and has been conducted annually since 2009.  The total sample time was 2.0 hours resulting in a YOY walleye catch rate of 490/hour (rates reported as run time), far exceeding the catch from previous surveys, which had ranged from 9 to 44/hour.  The extremely high catch may reflect a rate close to gear saturation.  It is possible that flooding, in 2012, improved habitat by removing fine sediments from spawning substrate in upstream tributaries resulting in increased survival of eggs in 2013.  YOY walleye ranged from 3.9 to 7.2\" and averaged 4.9\", which is considered small for the area, but similar to previous assessments on Big Sandy.  Insufficient scale samples were collected to differentiate age 1 from age 2 walleye, therefore catch rate of age 1 walleye cannot be reported for this survey from typical age analysis.  However, based on length frequency distributions, and based on the lack of overlap in sizes between ages 1, 2, and 3 walleye in the July gill net assessment, a reasonable approximation for the catch of age 1 fish would be about 30-40/hr.  This would be the second highest catch of age 1 walleye that has been observed, and corresponds to the previous high catch of age 0 fish in 2012.  Catch rate of walleye age 1 and older was 60.5/hour, within the range of previous surveys, which had ranged from 43.9 to 92.7 per hour.  </p>",

This survey is intended to provide information on Walleye recruitment and has been conducted annually since 2009.  The total sample time was 1.5 hours, resulting in a YOY Walleye catch rate of 60/hour (rates reported as run time).  This is the third highest catch rate since monitoring began. Catch rates from previous surveys have typically ranged from 9 to 138/hour with the exception of 2013, which had an extremely high catch of 490/hour.  Total lengths of YOY Walleye ranged from 3.9 inches to 6.8 inches and averaged 5.3 inches, which was comparable to previous assessments on Big Sandy (average length of 5.5 inches).  The catch rate for age 1 Walleye was 73 per hour, which is the second highest of what has been observed at Big Sandy Lake.  Overall, natural reproduction appears to be higher in years since the regulations were implemented (median YOY catch rate of 20/hr pre-reg vs 44/hr post-reg), suggesting a possible benefit of the regulation to Walleye reproduction.  Fall night electrofishing should continue as staff time permits to continue to evaluate natural reproduction and to determine whether the catch rate of either YOY or age 1 Walleye is a meaningful predictor of recruitment to harvestable size on this lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to Walleye, a sample of Yellow Perch was also collected as part of a statewide special research project to gain a better understanding of their population dynamics. The data can be accessed in Research Survey (RE 8/26/19). More information is available from the Research Unit. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Big Sandy walleye fishery is supported wholly by natural reproduction.  In past creel surveys (1988, 2001), it was characterized by having relatively high effort with about 2 lbs/acre of walleye yield.  The size distribution of the harvested fish peaked at only 12 inches.  In 2011, experimental walleye fishing regulations were adopted (14-18\" harvest slot, with 1 allowed over 26\") to attempt to improve the fishery at Big Sandy Lake, McGregor, Minnesota.  These changes were specifically designed to increase the angler catch of walleye from 14-18 inches; decrease the mortality rates for walleye ages 4 to 6; increase female walleye spawning stock biomass to 2 lbs/acre; and to improve female spawning stock age diversity to above 0.575.  This project was conducted to estimate total stock size, length and age distributions of the stock, and to estimate spawning stock biomass directly rather than from catchability models using experimental gill nets.  Standard population assessments using gill nets and trap nets were also conducted in July, 2016 (SD 07/25/2016), and a special targeted assessment using gill nets and electrofishing was also conducted in September 2016 (TS 09/28/2016).  Previous spring assessments had been conducted in 2000 and 2009, however no population estimates were derived. A concurrent creel survey on Big Sandy Lake (Study IV job 996) was also conducted to estimate angler effort and catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were marked with fin clips during spawning runs in the Sandy River and Big Sandy Lake.  Attempts were made to sample the Prairie River, but they were unsuccessful due to river conditions and timing.  Trap nets and electrofishing were used to sample the spawning fish, and then electrofishing, short term gill netting (nets set only for about 30 minutes), standard assessment gill nets set in August and September, and observations from a concurrent creel survey were used to sample the whole population to look for fin clips after the completion of spawning. <br> \n <br> \nThe population of walleye in Big Sandy Lake was estimated at approximately 21,000 fish (confidence limits of 16,000-30,000) or 3.2/acre, with about 8,000 (confidence limits of 6,000-13,000) that were between 14 and 18 inches at the beginning of the season.  A large number of walleye were observed between 12 and 14 inches, indicating good levels of sub-adults were ready to recruit to the fishery within the next two seasons. Female spawning stock biomass was estimated to be about 0.5 lbs/acre, which is still below the goal of the regulation of 2 lbs/acre.  However, the female spawning biomass should also increase in coming years as more fish survive to older ages.  Information from this survey as well as the creel survey and other assessments will be used for determining if changes to the regulation will be needed in the near future.  A public meeting regarding the regulation is scheduled for 2018. <br> \n</p>",

The TDO3 (temperature at 3 mg/l dissolved oxygen) was determined to be 19 degrees C, which is typical of historical profiles. While the water was warm at the surface, the overall oxy-thermal habitat was adequate from this depth to approximately 60 feet, providing ample volume for Tullibee survival. Comparing profiles collected since 2011, the least amount of available Tullibee habitat occurred in 2012, which likely represents a near-worst case scenario given the extreme weather conditions experienced. In 2020, there was a low spot in the curve (metalimnetic minium) between the depths of 22 and 36 feet, which was the lowest observed since 2012, yet stillabove the threshold for Tullibee survival. The lake provides \"fair\" habitat compared to other lakes in the Aitkin area that are monitored. Because the area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's Tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of coldwater habitat.</p>",

This survey is intended to provide information on Walleye recruitment and has been conducted annually since 2009. The total usable sample time was 1 hour and 45 minutes, resulting in a YOY Walleye catch rate of 57.7/hour (rates reported as run time). One station   was biased due to an algae bloom that affected visibility and was not included in the catch rate estimate.  Catch rates from previous surveys have ranged from 9 to 138/hour with the exception of 2013, which had an extremely high catch of 490/hour. Total lengths of YOY Walleye ranged from 4.6 inches to 7.4 inches and averaged 6.2 inches, which was larger when compared to previous assessments on Big Sandy (average length of 5.6 inches). In 2021, good growth of YOY Walleye was common, on a statewide scale. The catch rate for age 1 Walleye was 30.3 per hour and has a long-term average of 38.5/hour. Overall, natural reproduction appears to be higher in years since the regulations were implemented (median YOY catch rate of 20/hr pre-reg vs 44/hr post-reg), suggesting a possible benefit of the regulation to Walleye reproduction. Fall night electrofishing should continue as staff time permits to continue to evaluate natural reproduction and to determine whether the catch rate of either YOY or age 1 Walleye is a meaningful predictor of recruitment to harvestable size on this lake. It's important to note that only 1 netter was allowed to be used in 2020 due to restrictions stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic, and that may have affected catch rates. Two netters were allowed to be used again in 2021 and so are comparable with the entire time series. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to Walleye, a sample of Yellow Perch was also collected and distributed to the Fisheries Research Unit as part of an ongoing project to learn more about the population dynamics of species on a number of lakes throughout Minnesota. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sandy Lake is located about nine miles north of McGregor in northeastern Aitkin County.  It is a hard water walleye lake with 71 miles of shoreline, and a surface area of 6,526 acres, of which 47 percent is less than 15 feet in depth.  The lake has dark brown water with low water clarity (secchi depth about 4.5 feet).  The dark, coffee colored water is the result of tannins entering the lake through its two main inlets (Sandy and Prairie Rivers) that flow out of extensive wetland areas on their way to the lake. Big Sandy is a popular lake for angling as well as a variety of water oriented recreation. The lake is heavily developed with permanent and seasonal homes and cabins. There are several public accesses, a few private resorts, and the Army Corps of Engineers also operates a recreation area with a campground and access facilities.  Big Sandy Lake has a large watershed, which is covered primarily by forests and wetlands. The lake is subject to dramatic water level fluctuations under certain climatological conditions. There are special harvest regulations for walleye (14-18\" harvest slot, with one over 26\" allowed) and sunfish (bag limit of 5), which began in 2011. In addition to this standard population assessment, targeted surveys were conducted in the spring and fall, and a creel survey was conducted in the open water season to further evaluate the walleye fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate of 8.8 per gill net is the highest observed since 1999, and is the 3rd highest observed since 1947. The average size was still relatively small at 11.2 inches and 0.5 pounds, although the number of fish within the harvest slot has also been continually increasing from the low observed in 2005, to now the third highest observed in all surveys. Walleye ranged from age 1 to 9, with 8 year classes identified in the sample. The 2013 and 2015 year classes each appear to be very strong.  The 2013 year class should recruit into the harvestable stock starting by the fall of 2017, when they begin to grow past 14 inches.  Fall night electrofishing was also conducted in October to monitor juvenile walleye abundance, and has been since 2009. Young-of-the-year (YOY) catches were slightly lower than has been observed in recent years (27/hour), however catch rates of age 1 walleye (2015 year class) were very high (60/hour).  Overall, natural reproduction appears to be higher in the years since the regulations were implemented (median YOY catch rate of 11/hour pre-regulation vs 41/hour post-regulation), suggesting a possible benefit of the regulation is an improved spawning stock.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance decreased to 2 per gill net, which was similar to what was observed in 2010 (2.3 per gill net), and below the range expected for similar lakes. Size was similar to the last survey and averaged 19.8 inches and 1.9 pounds, with fish observed up to 26.4 inches. Anecdotal observations during the spring targeted survey indicated pike up to 43 inches were present, and anglers reported catching pike up to 36 inches in the creel survey conducted in 2016.  A trend to lower northern pike numbers will likely be beneficial for managing for walleye in Big Sandy Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catches were lower than in 2013, yet median for all past trap net surveys, and above expected ranges for similar lakes.   Sizes in trap nets ranged from 3.7 to 13.5 inches, and averaged 9.6 inches. Growth and size structure are among the best in the area. Age analyses indicated fish up to age 9 were present, and continued to reveal variable recruitment.  The 2012 and 2015 year classes were among the strongest previously observed. While the 2012 year class averaged over 10 inches, and is now available for anglers, the 2015 year class will need a few more years to grow into preferred sizes. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was also lower than the previous three surveys at 1.1 per trap net, although still above levels observed between 1956 and 1995 (average of 0.15 per trap net). Size and growth rates of bluegill are also among the best in the area with memorable sized fish present in the population. In 2016, fish up to 10 inches were observed. Age analysis revealed inconsistent recruitment with just the 2011 and 2014 year classes accounting for most of the catch.  The harvest regulation for bluegill (bag limit of 5) is intended to preserve the quality size structure found in this fishery. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee abundance appeared to have rebounded from the summer kill observed in 2012, and were once again available for angling or sport netting, as well as for forage for large walleye, northern pike and muskellunge (observed in previous survey).  Tullibee up to 18 inches long were observed, with the bulk of fish between 11 and 14 inches.  Each year class since 2012 was observed in the sample, indicating good reproduction and survival in recent years. Evaluation of the oxy-thermal conditions in Bell Horn Bay indicated habitat was adequate for tullibee from 10 to about 61 feet deep, and poor in deeper and shallower water.  This provided ample habitat for tullibee survival in mid-summer. Temperature-oxygen profiles collected in other basins had poor habitat for tullibee due to warm water and low oxygen concentrations, which is why tullibee were only observed in Bell Horn Bay in mid-summer.  Observations in the spring and fall targeted surveys indicated tullibee were making use of the remainder of the lake in the cooler conditions. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill net catch rate decreased to a level within the interquartile range for class 22 lakes at 11.9 per net.  This is in the lower range of what has been observed at Big Sandy. In addition to being an important forage species, yellow perch also provide an angling opportunity unique for the area.  Sizes ranged from 5.7 to 12 inches, and averaged 8.3 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish were sampled for the first time in our standard assessment nets at 0.4 fish per gill net. Sizes ranged from 18 to 23 inches long.  Anecdotal reports of catfish in Big Sandy were heard since 2013, which is just after the major flood event in 2012 that allowed movement of fish from the Mississippi River into the lake.  They were also observed in the spring and fall targeted surveys, the creel survey on Big Sandy, as well as the standard survey on Aitkin Lake, each in 2016.  It is likely that catfish will eventually become naturalized in Big Sandy, as well as connected waters, and should provide a new recreational experience for the area.   <br> \n</p>",

This survey is intended to provide information on Walleye recruitment and has been conducted annually since 2009. The total sample time was 2.0 hours, resulting in a YOY Walleye catch rate of 26.5/hour (rates reported as run time). Catch rates from previous surveys have ranged from 9 to 138/hour with the exception of 2013, which had an extremely high catch of 490/hour. Total lengths of YOY Walleye ranged from 4.1 inches to 7.1 inches and averaged 5.7 inches, which was comparable to previous assessments on Big Sandy (average length of 5.5 inches). The catch rate for age 1 Walleye was 21.5 per hour, and has a long term average of 39/hour.  Overall, natural reproduction appears to be higher in years since the regulations were implemented (median YOY catch rate of 20/hr pre-reg vs 44/hr post-reg), suggesting a possible benefit of the regulation to Walleye reproduction. Fall night electrofishing should continue as staff time permits to continue to evaluate natural reproduction and to determine whether the catch rate of either YOY or age 1 Walleye is a meaningful predictor of recruitment to harvestable size on this lake. It's important to note that only 1 netter was allowed to be used in 2020 due to restrictions stemming from the Covid-19 virus, and this may affect catch rates.  <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to Walleye, a sample of YOY Yellow Perch was also collected for length frequency information. Two areas of the lake were targeted, one east of the Libby Dam Recreation Area along the North shore of the lake and the other to the Northeast of Hillcrest resort near the public access. YOY Yellow Perch ranged from 1.7 to 2.6 inches with a mean size 2.1 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sandy Lake is located in northeastern Aitkin County approximately 9 miles north of McGregor.  At 6,526 acres, it is second only to Mille Lacs in size and popularity in the Aitkin area.  The lake is heavily developed with 18.1 homes/cabins per shoreline mile and 6 resorts/camps of various types and sizes as of 1995.  The Army Corps of Engineers also operates a campground/recreation area at the outlet on the northwest side of the lake. There are also multiple public accesses surrounding the east, west, and south sides.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is characterized as a fertile walleye lake comprised of several habitat types.  These include the open, windswept main basin; the deep cool eastern basin, Bill Horn Bay; the shallower and more isolated south basin, Webster Bay; and shallow bays containing dense rice beds on the south, east and northeast sides of the lake. The maximum depth is 84' and about 47% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Walleyes are the most popular target for anglers and it is managed essentially as a walleye lake.  Big Sandy has been deemed \"impaired\", due to high phosphorus levels, by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, and is undergoing watershed and water quality analysis via the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) study and plan for the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis special assessment was conducted primarily to evaluate the walleye population on Big Sandy.  Recent nettings and angler reports suggest both size and number of walleye are cause for concern.  In this assessment, standard gill nets were used in addition to spring trap netting and electrofishing to sample walleye.  Walleye were commonly stocked in Big Sandy prior to 1995.  Most were fry stockings, although the frequency varied from annual to every third year.  Relative success of stocked vs non-stocked year classes was similar, therefore walleye stocking was discontinued in 1996.  In the years shortly after the cessation of stocking, excellent year classes were produced, however recruitment in this decade appears to have been relatively poor. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2009, the walleye catch of 2.3/gill net was the lowest on record for Big Sandy Lake.  Past catches have averaged 5.8/gill net.  Average length and weight were 11.7\" and 0.6 lbs, compared to 10.9\" and 0.5 lbs in 2005.  Six different year classes were present in the gill nets with age 2-4 fish (2005-2007 year classes) accounting for 88% of the gill net catch.   Growth was relatively slow.  Spring sampling is geared to spawning fish, and resulted in observations of larger fish.  Average lengths for males were 15.0\" in trap nets and 14.0\" for those sampled by electrofishing.  Average lengths of females sampled by trap nets and electrofishing were 18.7\" and 15.7,\" respectively.  From other analyses it appears that relatively high angler exploitation may be limiting recruitment into the spawning stock, which has affected annual recruitment this decade. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was also relatively low at 2.8/gill net.  Past catches have ranged from 0.9 to 5.8/gill net with an average of 4.3/gill net.  Average length and weight were 20.0\" and 1.7 lbs with 10% measuring at least 24\".  Age 3-5 fish (2004-2006 year classes) were most abundant, accounting for 76% of all northern pike sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish and also provide additional opportunities for anglers.  Both were caught in numbers similar to past nettings in 2009, though the number of perch has generally been declining since 1990.  The average size of perch was 8.3\" and 30% were 9\" or longer.  Tullibee are a cold-water fish and are usually limited to the confines of Bill Horn Bay during the summer months. While they provide quality forage for northern pike and walleye, with fish averaging 12.2\" and individual fish measuring up to 19\", they also appear to be of interest to anglers.  Anecdotal reports indicate a relatively new winter angling fishery for tullibee appears to be developing on Big Sandy. <br> \n <br> \nAnother species of special interest is smallmouth bass.  Though only 2 fish were caught in gill nets, this marks the first time this species has been sampled in Big Sandy Lake and validates angler observations of a fishable population of fish. <br> \n <br> \nThis assessment did not target bluegills or crappies, though both are present in adequate numbers and provide a unique fishery for the area.  Anglers are encouraged to provide input regarding special regulations that have been proposed for bluegill (possession limit of 5 fish) as well as walleye (14\"-18\" harvest slot with 1 over 26\").  The target date is May 14, 2011 for implementation, pending public review.  Comments may be sent to aitkin.fisheries@state.mn.us.   <br> \n</p>",

The TDO3 (temperature at 3 mg/l dissolved oxygen) was determined to be 19 degrees C. While the water was warm at the surface to about 15 feet deep, the overall oxy-thermal habitat was adequate from this depth to approximately 50 feet, providing ample volume for Tullibee survival. Comparing profiles collected since 2011, the least amount of available Tullibee habitat occurred in 2012, which likely represents a near-worst case scenario given the extreme weather conditions experienced. The lake provides \"fair\" habitat compared to other lakes in Aitkin area that are monitored. Because the area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's Tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of coldwater habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sandy Lake is comprised of several habitat types.  These include the open, windswept main basin, the deep cool eastern basin called Bill Horn Bay, the shallower and more isolated south basin called Webster Bay and shallow bays containing dense rice beds in several smaller bays on the south, east and northeast sides of the lake. Walleyes are the most popular target for anglers, particularly in the main basin. The walleyes in Big Sandy grow slowly and tend to be small. This survey affirms that this trend is continuing. The mean length for walleyes caught in the survey gill nets was only 10.1 inches long and only two walleyes over 20 inches were caught. The size distribution is similar to what was found in previous surveys and in an angler survey conducted in 1988.  Northern pike are also an important gamefish in Big Sandy Lake. The gillnet catch rate for northern pike was about average for this type of lake. The northern pike were also small, averaging just 17.6 inches and ranging only up to 24.0 inches in the survey gill nets. The growth rates of larger northern pike are slower than normal, a fact which is not consistent with the apparent availability of a large yellow perch forage base.  Behavioral adaptations of the yellow perch probably explain this incongruity. Yellow perch were mostly captured in the main basin, whereas northern pike were captured more often in the shallower, more vegetated areas of the lake.  The abundance of yellow perch was about average for this type of lake, however the average size of the fish was 8.9 inches, which is well above average. Many of the perch were in the 10 and 11 inch range, a very nice size for this species.  Seventy-seven percent of the perch were affected with parasites. Anglers have avoided targeting yellow perch in the lake, probably because of the high incidence of internal parasites.  Yellow perch in the main basin of the lake are abundant enough to provide adequate fishing for experienced anglers who can tolerate imperfect perch filets.  Black crappies were caught at a relatively low rate, which is typical for this type of lake. The crappies were larger, ranging from 9.7 to 11.6 inches long. No small crappies were caught, indicating the population may be low for a few years. Only a few sunfish were caught in the trap nets in this survey. Big Sandy Lake's dense wild rice and muck or sand habitat and exposure to wind and waves are not conducive to sunfish reproduction and survival.  Tulibees (cisco) were caught with regularity in Bill Horn Bay in this survey. They are growing rapidly and reached lengths up to 17.4 inches in this survey. Most of the tulibees were in the 10 to 13 inch range. The tulibee population had apparently experienced a major die-off in the mid to late 1980's and have rebounded in 1995.</p>",

The TDO3 (temperature at 3 mg/l dissolved oxygen) was determined to be 19 C. While the water was warm at the surface to about 13 feet deep, the overall oxy-thermal habitat was adequate from that depth to 66 feet, providing ample volume for tullibee survival. Comparing profiles collected since 2011, the least amount of available tullibee habitat occurred in 2012, which likely represents a near-worst case scenario given the extreme weather conditions experienced. The lake provides \"fair\" habitat compared to other lakes in Aitkin area that are monitored. Because the area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of cold-water habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Big Sandy Walleye fishery is supported wholly by natural reproduction. In past creel surveys (1988, 2001), it was characterized by having relatively high effort with about 2 lbs/acre of Walleye yield with the size distribution of harvested fish peaking at only 12 inches. In 2011, experimental Walleye fishing regulations were adopted (14-18 inch harvest slot, with 1 allowed over 26 inches) to attempt to improve the fishery at Big Sandy Lake, McGregor, Minnesota. In the two creel surveys since the regulation has been adopted yield has decrease to 0.5 lbs/acre and the average size harvested fish increased to 15 inches. An evaluation of the Walleye population in Big Sandy Lake and connected waters was conducted in the spring of 2021. The project was conducted to estimate total stock size, length and age distribution of the stock and estimate spawning stock biomass to aid in a concurrent acoustic telemetry Walleye movement study. Standard population assessments using gill nets and trap nets were also conducted in July, 2021 (SD 07/12/2021). Previous spring assessments had been conducted in 2000, 2009, and 2016; however only the 2016 (TS 04/04/2016) survey had population estimates. A concurrent creel survey on Big Sandy Lake (Berg 2023) was also conducted to estimate angler effort and catch and whether they were in favor or against the current Walleye regulations. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were tagged with individually numbered t-bar tags during spawning runs in the Sandy River (upstream and below Libby Dam) and Big Sandy Lake. Attempts were made to sample the Prairie River, but they were unsuccessful due to river conditions and timing. Trap nets and electrofishing were used to sample and tag the spawning fish. Electrofishing, short term gill nets (nets set only for about 30 minutes), and a standard gill net survey in July were used to sample the whole population for tagged fish. A concurrent creel survey also looked for tags. All of the recapture events looking for tags occurred after the completion of spawning. <br> \n <br> \nThe population of Walleye 12 inches and larger in Big Sandy Lake was estimated at approximately 32,000 fish (confidence limits of 26,000-42,000) or 5.1/acre, with about 10,500 (confidence limits of 7,500-16,500) that were between 14 and 18 inches at the beginning of the season.In comparison to the 2016 survey there were more fish overall in 2021 (32,000 to 21,000) but essentially identical numbers of harvestable fish (10,500). A large number of Walleye were observed between 12 and 14 inches, indicating good levels of sub-adults were ready to recruit to the fishery within the next two seasons. Female spawning stock biomass was estimated to be between about 0.5 lbs/acre and 1 lbs/acre, which was still below the goal of the regulation of 2 lbs/acre. Information from this survey as well as the creel survey and other assessments will be used for determining if changes to the regulation will be needed in the near future. A spring assessment will be conducted again in 2022 and 2023.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sandy Lake is located about nine miles north of McGregor in northeastern Aitkin County. It is a hard water Walleye lake with 57 miles of shoreline, and a surface area of 6,526 acres, of which 47 percent is less than 15 feet in depth. The lake has dark brown water with low water clarity (average secchi depth about 4.5 feet during survey period). The dark, coffee colored water is the result of tannins entering the lake through its two main inlets (Sandy and Prairie Rivers) that flow out of extensive wetland areas on their way to the lake. Big Sandy is a popular lake for angling as well as a variety of water oriented recreation. The lake is heavily developed with permanent and seasonal homes and cabins. There are several public accesses, a few private resorts, and the Army Corps of Engineers operates a recreation area with a campground and access facilities. Big Sandy Lake has a large watershed, which is covered primarily by forests and wetlands. The lake is subject to dramatic water level fluctuations under certain climatological conditions. The primary management is for Walleye, with Black Crappie and Northern Pike listed as secondary management species. There are special harvest regulations for Walleye (14-18 inch harvest slot, with one over 26 inches allowed) and Sunfish (daily bag limit of 5), which began in 2011. A standard survey was conducted the week of 7/11/2022. There is an ongoing study on the Walleye population and movement within the Big Sandy watershed; if you encounter a tagged fish please report it to mndnr.gov/fishtags or call the Aitkin area fisheries office.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate of 5.7 per gill net is within the expected range for the lake class, and is just below the long term average of 6.6 per gill net. The average size was still relatively small at 11.5 inches and 0.6 pounds, although the number of fish within the harvest slot has continued to increase. Walleye ranged from age 1 to 9, with all 9 year classes identified in the sample. The 2018 year class (age 4) is the most abundant in the sample followed by the 2019 and 2021 year classes.   <br> \n <br> \nFall night electrofishing was also conducted in lake September to monitor juvenile Walleye abundance (see Targeted Assessment 9/28/2021), and has been since 2009. Overall, natural reproduction appears to be higher in the years since the regulations were implemented suggesting a possible benefit of the regulation of an improved spawning stock.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance remained similar to 2021 at 4 per gill net, which is near the long term average and within the range expected for similar lakes. The size structure was also similar to past surveys, with an average length of 18.5 inches and 1.4 pounds, and fish up to 37.8 inches observed. Anglers should be aware of the current Northern Pike regulations in Minnesota which encourage the harvest of smaller fish. The regulations can be found at www.dnr.state.mn.us/pike/index.html. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was a little lower than 2021 at 1/net in the trap net assessment and continued to remain at a level lower than what was observed when Walleye were at a lower abundance. Eight different year classes from ages 1-16 were found showing consistent but low level recruitment. The 2020 year class was the most abundant year class in the sample.  The size in trap nets averaged 8.7 inches and fish up to 13.5 inches were sampled. Growth and size structure are among the best in the area.  <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill catch rates increased in 2022, to 4 per trap net, which is within the expected range for similar lakes. Sizes ranged from 3.6 to 10.5 inches and averaged 7.5 inches. Size and growth rates of Bluegill are also among the best in the area with memorable sized fish present in the population. The harvest regulation for Bluegill (daily limit of 5) is intended to preserve the quality size structure found in this fishery. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee have been sampled in above average numbers for the four previous surveys, nearly double the rate of what is expected for similar lakes. They are an important forage species for larger predators and are available to be harvested via angling or sport netting. Catch rates, in 2022, were 7.3 per gill net. Following a major die off in 2012, due to a lack of adequate cool-water habitat from excessing flooding, Tullibee numbers dropped to 0.12 per gill net in 2013. Due to their resiliency and high reproductive rates they appear to be more abundant now than prior to the 2012 flood event. Sizes ranged from 8.6 to 16.6 inches, and averaged 12.6 inches. Typically, dissolved oxygen and thermal conditions in Bill Horn Bay are adequate for Tullibee survival in mid-summer and these habitat indices are monitored annually. Observations in the spring and fall during other past surveys indicated Tullibee make use of the remainder of the lake in cooler conditions. In 2022, conditions for Tullibee appeared good from 19 to 54 feet. Maintaining good stewardship within the watershed is key to maintaining viable Tullibee populations in Big Sandy as well as other waters in Minnesota. This is especially important in an era of warming climatic conditions. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish increased substantially from 0.13/gill net in 2021 to 6.7/net in 2022. These fish likely immigrated from the Mississippi River in spring 2022 during a flood period when there was little difference in elevation between the Mississippi River and the Big Sandy pool.  We first began to receive anecdotal reports of Channel Catfish in 2013, just after a major flood event in 2012. During that summer flood water levels in both the Mississippi River and Big Sandy Lake were similar allowing movement of fish past the dam from the river into the lake. Channel Catfish were first sampled in 2016 and have been found in low numbers in each survey since. It is likely they are becoming naturalized to Big Sandy Lake and potentially the Sandy, Prairie and Tamarack Rivers and connected waters.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile no Smallmouth Bass were observed in the 2022 survey they have been found regularly in low numbers in past fish and creel surveys. Past creel survey reports indicated small numbers were already present in 1988 and 2001. Popularity for Smallmouth Bass fishing has been increasing likely coinciding with an increase in abundance. Angling early season is typically better when they are closer to near-shore structure areas before they disperse throughout the lake during the summer.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sandy Lake is located about nine miles north of McGregor in northeastern Aitkin County.  It is a popular lake for angling as well as a variety of water oriented recreation.  The lake is heavily developed with permanent and seasonal homes and cabins.   There are several public accesses, a few private resorts, and the Army Corps of Engineers also operates a recreation area with a campground and access facilities.  There are special harvest regulations for walleye (14-18\" harvest slot, with one over 26\" allowed) and bluegill (bag limit of 5), which began in 2011.  In addition to this standard population assessment, nearshore sampling using seining and backpack electrofishing was also conducted to develop an index of biological integrity (IBI); basically a fish index of lake health.  <br> \n <br> \nBig Sandy Lake has a large watershed, which is covered primarily by forests and wetlands.  The lake is subject to dramatic water level fluctuations under certain climatologic conditions, with severe flooding occurring on an infrequent but regular basis.  The most recent significant flooding event took place in 2012, when the area received unusually large rainfall events in late May and June resulting in approximately 20 inches of precipitation in this short period.  While conditions appeared dismal for fish during and after the flooding, results from the 2013 population assessment indicate several species appeared to have benefited from the conditions. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch of 4.7 per gill net remained similar to the 2010 survey.  Average size increased from 10.7\" and 0.5 pounds in 2010 compared to 12.2\" and 0.7 pounds in 2013.  Fish ranged from age 1 to age 10 with 8 year classes identified in the sample.  Fall night electrofishing was conducted in October to monitor young of the year walleye abundance.  Results indicate 2013 had by far the highest young of the year catch rate of all previous electrofishing surveys dating back to 2009 and among the highest observed anywhere.  This high index of reproduction illustrates the importance of good habitat and adequate spawning stock. The harvest regulation for walleye (14-18\" harvest slot, with one over 26\" allowed) is intended to reduce mortality on small fish, increase female spawning stock and age diversity, and improve angler catch of fish greater than 14\".  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch rate increased to 4.5 per gill net, which is within the expected range for similar lakes, and similar to the historic catch rate from twelve previous surveys of Big Sandy Lake.  Pike ranged from age 1 to age 8 with each year class represented indicating annual recruitment.  Size was similar to the last survey and averaged 20.9\" and 2.1 pounds, with 22% measuring at least 24\", up to 33.4\".   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catches were above the expected range for similar lakes and above historic averages for this lake in both gill nets and trap nets.  Size and growth are among the best in the area with memorable size fish present.  Age analysis revealed variable recruitment with strong year classes identified for 2006 and 2010, while 2007 and 2009 were absent.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance appeared similar to the previous two surveys dating to 2005 (3.75 per trap net).  While this level of abundance is low compared to similar lakes, all five surveys prior to 2005 had trap net catch rates of only 0-0.3 per trap net.  Size and growth of bluegill are also among the best in the area with memorable sized fish present in the population.  Age analysis revealed inconsistent recruitment with strong 2006 and 2007 year classes accounting for most of the catch, and weak 2008 and 2009 year classes nearly absent.  The harvest regulation for bluegill (bag limit of 5) is intended to preserve the quality size structure found in this fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibee, a coldwater species, is the one species that declined dramatically as a result of poor temperature and oxygen levels that persisted for several weeks in 2012, as a result of the flood.  Some tullibee were captured during the 2013 assessment, suggesting enough survival to reestablish the population, although it may be a few years before anglers would be able to take advantage of them again.  On the other hand, yellow perch were captured in high numbers compared to the previous survey.  In addition to being an important forage species, yellow perch also provide a unique angling opportunity for the area.  Sizes ranged from 4.6 to 11.9\", and averaged 8.6\" with a good number of fish over 10\".   <br> \n <br> \nWhile not numerous, smallmouth bass were once again observed in the gill net assessment.  In addition, young smallmouth bass and largemouth bass were also observed in the near-shore seining and electrofishing assessments.  Both species have been observed at low levels in Big Sandy Lake for many years, and offer alternative angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nThe single muskellunge captured during this survey likely migrated from the Mississippi River, which has been stocked annually for several years.  Water levels during the 2012 flood were nearly equal between the Mississippi River and Big Sandy Lake, allowing for movement that normally is impeded by high discharge flow rates at the Corps of Engineers dam. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted beginning 9/28/2016 using gill nets (GN) and boat electrofishing (EF). The primary objectives of this assessment were to examine the maturity of female walleye, and to continue to index natural recruitment/reproduction of walleye with EF. <br> \n <br> \nThe standard gill net assessment at Big Sandy has been conducted in July since 1956, and identification of maturity during that period is difficult.  By September, mature females typically have developed eggs and are readily identifiable.  Increasing FSSB and improving the adult female age diversity is a goal of the experimental walleye regulation that was implemented in 2011.  An intermediate review of the regulation is planned for 2018, and these assessments are in preparation for that review.  In addition to standard fisheries assessment information, all walleye were closely examined for clipped dorsal spines to add another method of recapture for the spring targeted assessment (Big Sandy Targeted Survey 04/04/2016).   <br> \n <br> \nOverall gill net catch rates for walleye, northern pike, white sucker, short-head redhorse, and yellow perch were significantly lower in this September survey than in July, while those for tullibee and black crappie were significantly higher.  Environmental conditions about the lake were much different in September, and catch patterns reflected that.  Tullibee were only captured in two nets set in Bell Horn Bay in July, whereas they were captured in 10 of the 15 sets in September, in most areas of the lake. This type of behavioral migration from a much smaller habitat opens up significant food resources to the tullibee, and also makes them more available to predators like larger walleye and northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough the total catch of walleye was less in the fall, this appeared to be primarily due to fewer smaller walleye being observed in the gill net sample.  The total number of walleye between 14 and 17.9 inches was slightly higher in the fall assessment than in the summer.  This is likely due to the growth of walleye and the recruitment of the 2012 year class into the harvestable slot. The age distributions of the fall and summer assessments were similar except that proportionately fewer age 1 walleyes were observed in the fall assessment.  <br> \n <br> \nThe mean size of spawning females in the spring assessments was estimated at about 2.0 lbs, which was similar to what was observed in the summer survey (1.9 lbs), but was quite different from that observed in the fall gill netting (1.0 lbs).  The lack of larger females in the fall suggest that they may not be very susceptible to our netting during that time frame.  Given the good water conditions (cool with good oxygen and typically dark water), even in shallow water, they may have been more spread out into shallower bays or even up the Prairie or Sandy Rivers, thereby making them less susceptible in the standard gill net assessment locations.  <br> \n <br> \nEstimates of female spawning stock were similar among the spring mark/recapture assessment, the summer gill net survey, and this fall gill net survey. <br> \n <br> \nFall night electrofishing was conducted on 10/10/2016 to monitor natural reproduction, specifically the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) and yearling (age 1) walleye. Fall electrofishing has been conducted annually since 2009. The total sample time of electrofishing effort was 1.23 hours and resulted in a YOY walleye catch rate of 26.8/hour. Catch rates from previous surveys have ranged from 9 to 129/hour with the exception of 2013, which had an extremely high catch of 490/hour. YOY walleye ranged from 5.4 inches to 7.7 inches and averaged 6.5 inches, which is slightly larger compared to previous seven electrofishing assessments on Big Sandy (average length of 5.4 inches). The catch rate for age 1 walleye was 64.2 per hour, which is the second highest observed at Big Sandy Lake.  Overall, natural reproduction appears to be higher in years since the regulations were implemented (median YOY catch rate of 11/hr pre-reg vs 41/hr post-reg), suggesting a possible benefit of the regulation.  Fall night electrofishing should continue as staff time permits to continue to evaluate natural reproduction and to determine whether the catch rate of either YOY or age 1 walleye is a meaningful predictor of recruitment to harvestable size on this lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sandy Lake is located about nine miles north of McGregor in northeastern Aitkin County.  It is a hard water walleye lake with 71 miles of shoreline, and a surface area of 6,526 acres, of which 47 percent is less than 15 feet in depth.  The lake has dark brown water with low water clarity (secchi depth about 4.5 feet).  The dark, coffee colored water is the result of tannins entering the lake through its two main inlets (Sandy and Prairie Rivers) that flow out of extensive wetland areas on their way to the lake.  Big Sandy is a popular lake for angling as well as a variety of water oriented recreation.  The lake is heavily developed with permanent and seasonal homes and cabins.  There are several public accesses, a few private resorts, and the Army Corps of Engineers also operates a recreation area with a campground and access facilities.  Big Sandy Lake has a large watershed, which is covered primarily by forests and wetlands.  The lake is subject to dramatic water level fluctuations under certain climatological conditions.  There are special harvest regulations for Walleye (14-18\" harvest slot, with one over 26\" allowed) and sunfish (bag limit of 5), which began in 2011.  A standard survey was conducted the week of 7/9/2018.  Originally, the intent of the survey was to assess the Walleye population for regulation review purposes with gill nets only.  The trap net component was added too since there were staff available to do so.  The primary management is for Walleye, with Black Crappie and Northern Pike listed as secondary management species.  \n\nThe Walleye catch rate of 7.9 per gill net is the second highest observed since 1999, and is above the long term average of 6.7 per gill net.  The average size was still relatively small at 10.9 inches and 0.5 pounds, although the number of fish within the harvest slot has been increasing.  Walleye ranged from age 1 to 5, with 5 year classes identified in the sample.  The 2015 and 2016 year classes each appear to be the most abundant in the sample; although at over 1/net, the 2013 year class (age 5) was captured at a rate higher than any other year class of age 5 Walleye we have previously observed.  Fall night electrofishing was also conducted in October to monitor juvenile Walleye abundance, and has been since 2009.  Overall, natural reproduction appears to be higher in the years since the regulations were implemented suggesting a possible benefit of the regulation is an improved spawning stock.  \n\nNorthern Pike abundance increased to 2.8 per gill net, which was similar to what was observed in 2016 (2.0 per gill net), and below the range expected for similar lakes.  Size was similar to the last survey and averaged 20.3 inches and 2.1 pounds, with fish observed up to 33.5 inches.  A trend to lower Northern Pike numbers will likely be beneficial for managing for Walleye in Big Sandy Lake.\n\nWhile Black Crappie abundance has declined the previous two surveys in both gill nets and trap nets they are still above expected ranges for similar lakes.  Sizes in trap nets ranged from 7.0 to 12.6\" and averaged 9.5\".  Growth and size structure are among the best in the area. \n \nBluegill catch rates increased significantly in 2018, to 6.3/trap net which is the highest catch in survey history although still in the expected range for similar lakes.  Sizes ranged from 5.7\" to 10.1\" and averaged 7.5\". Size and growth rates of Bluegill are also among the best in the area with memorable sized fish present in the population.  The harvest regulation for Bluegill (bag limit of 5) is intended to preserve the quality size structure found in this fishery.\n\nTullibee are once again available for angling or sport netting, as well as for forage for large predators. Catch rates increased substantially in 2018 to 12.4/net.  Following a major die off in 2012, which was due to flooding, their numbers had dropped to 0.12/net in 2013, but due to their resiliency and high reproductive rates appear to be more abundant now than even prior to the 2012 flood event. Sizes ranged from 6.3\" to 16.7\", and averaged 12.2\".  This is the second highest gill net catch rate in survey history and represents the highest since 2001.  Typically dissolved oxygen and thermal conditions in Bell Horn Bay are adequate for Tullibee survival in mid-summer and these habitat indices are monitored annually.  Observations in the spring and fall during other past surveys indicated Tullibee make use of the remainder of the lake in cooler conditions.  In 2018, conditions for Tullibee appeared good from 15 to 50 feet.  Maintaining good stewardship within the watershed is key to maintaining viable Tullibee populations in Big Sandy as well as other waters in Minnesota.  This is especially important in an era of warming climatic conditions.\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sandy Lake is located about nine miles north of McGregor in northeastern Aitkin County. It is a hard water Walleye lake with 57 miles of shoreline, and a surface area of 6,526 acres, of which 47 percent is less than 15 feet in depth. The lake has dark brown water with low water clarity (secchi depth about 4.5 feet). The dark, coffee colored water is the result of tannins entering the lake through its two main inlets (Sandy and Prairie Rivers) that flow out of extensive wetland areas on their way to the lake. Big Sandy is a popular lake for angling as well as a variety of water oriented recreation. The lake is heavily developed with permanent and seasonal homes and cabins. There are several public accesses, a few private resorts, and the Army Corps of Engineers also operates a recreation area with a campground and access facilities. Big Sandy Lake has a large watershed, which is covered primarily by forests and wetlands. The lake is subject to dramatic water level fluctuations under certain climatological conditions. The primary management is for Walleye, with Black Crappie and Northern Pike listed as secondary management species. There are special harvest regulations for Walleye (14-18 inch harvest slot, with one over 26 inches allowed) and Sunfish (bag limit of 5), which began in 2011. A standard survey was conducted the week of 7/12/2021. There is an ongoing study on the Walleye population and movement within the Big Sandy watershed; if you encounter a tagged fish please report it to mndnr.gov/fishtags or call the Aitkin area fisheries office.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate of 5.3 per gill net is within the expected range for the lake class, and is just below the long term average of 6.6 per gill net. The average size was still relatively small at 11.2 inches and 0.5 pounds, although the number of fish within the harvest slot has been increasing. Walleye ranged from age 1 to 11, with 8 year classes identified in the sample. The 2018 year class (age 3) is the most abundant in the sample followed by the 2016, 2019 and 2020 year classes. The number of age 5 Walleye have been at historically high levels the last 3 surveys (2018, 2020, and 2021) indicating the regulation has allowed fish to reach older ages. Fall night electrofishing was also conducted in lake September to monitor juvenile Walleye abundance (see Targeted Assessment 9/28/2021), and has been since 2009. Overall, natural reproduction appears to be higher in the years since the regulations were implemented suggesting a possible benefit of the regulation is an improved spawning stock.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance increased to 4 per gill net, which was similar to what was observed in 2020 (3.7 per gill net), and within the range expected for similar lakes and at the long-term average of 4 per gill net a survey. The size structure was smaller compared to the last survey and averaged 17.7 inches and 1.2 pounds, with fish up to 26.5 inches observed. Anglers should be aware of the current Northern Pike regulations in Minnesota which encourage the harvest of smaller fish. The regulations can be found at www.dnr.state.mn.us/pike/index.html. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was similar to the 2018 survey and is above expected ranges for similar lakes. Nine different year classes from ages 1-11 were found showing consistent recruitment. The size in trap nets averaged an impressive 11 inches and fish up to 13.7 inches were sampled. Growth and size structure are among the best in the area.  <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill catch rates decreased in 2021, to 1.3 per trap net, which is slightly below the expected range for similar lakes, but yet comparable to surveys since 2005. Sizes ranged from 3.2 to 9.8 inches and averaged 8.4 inches. Size and growth rates of Bluegill are also among the best in the area with memorable sized fish present in the population. The harvest regulation for Bluegill (bag limit of 5) is intended to preserve the quality size structure found in this fishery. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee have been sampled in above average numbers for the three previous surveys, nearly double the rate of what is expected for similar lakes. They are an important forage species for larger predators and are available to be harvested via angling or sport netting. Catch rates, in 2021, were 10.8 per gill net, which was similar to the 2018 and 2020 surveys of 12.4 and 8.5 per gill net, respectively. Following a major die off in 2012, due to a lack of adequate cool-water habitat from excessing flooding, Tullibee numbers dropped to 0.12 per gill net in 2013. Due to their resiliency and high reproductive rates they appear to be more abundant now than prior to the 2012 flood event. Sizes ranged from 6.3 to 17.2 inches, and averaged 12.6 inches. Typically, dissolved oxygen and thermal conditions in Bill Horn Bay are adequate for Tullibee survival in mid-summer and these habitat indices are monitored annually. Observations in the spring and fall during other past surveys indicated Tullibee make use of the remainder of the lake in cooler conditions. In 2021, conditions for Tullibee appeared good from 21 to 50 feet. Maintaining good stewardship within the watershed is key to maintaining viable Tullibee populations in Big Sandy as well as other waters in Minnesota. This is especially important in an era of warming climatic conditions. <br> \n <br> \nAnecdotal reports of Channel Catfish first began in 2013, just after a major flood event in 2012. During the summer flood water levels in both the Mississippi River and Big Sandy Lake were similar allowing movement of fish past the dam from the river into the lake. Channel Catfish were first sampled in 2016 and have been found in low numbers in each survey since. It is likely they are becoming naturalized to Big Sandy Lake and potentially the Sandy, Prairie and Tamarack Rivers.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile Smallmouth Bass were first observed in the 2009 standard survey and have been found in low numbers in subsequent surveys, past creel survey reports indicated small numbers were already present in 1988 and 2001. Popularity for Smallmouth Bass fishing has been increasing likely coinciding with an increase in abundance. Angling early season is typically better when they are closer to near-shore structure areas before they disperse throughout the lake during the summer.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sandy Lake is located about nine miles north of McGregor in northeastern Aitkin County. It is a hard water Walleye lake with 57 miles of shoreline, and a surface area of 6,526 acres, of which 47 percent is less than 15 feet in depth. The lake has dark brown water with low water clarity (average secchi depth is about 4.5 feet during the survey period). The dark, coffee colored water is the result of tannins entering the lake through its two main inlets (Sandy and Prairie Rivers), each of which flow out of extensive wetland areas on their way to the lake. Big Sandy is a popular lake for angling as well as a variety of water oriented recreation. The lake is heavily developed with permanent and seasonal homes and cabins. There are several public accesses, a few private resorts, and the Army Corps of Engineers operates a dam at the outlet including a recreation area with campground and access facilities. Big Sandy Lake has a large watershed, which is covered primarily by forests and wetlands. The lake is subject to dramatic water level fluctuations under certain climatological conditions. The primary management is for Walleye, with Black Crappie and Northern Pike listed as secondary management species. There are special harvest regulations for Walleye (14-18 inch harvest slot, with one over 26 inches allowed) and Sunfish (daily bag limit of 5), which began in 2011. A targeted survey was conducted the week of July 10, 2023, specifically to assess the Walleye population. There is an ongoing study of the Walleye population and movement within the Big Sandy watershed; if you encounter a tagged fish please report it to mndnr.gov/fishtags or call the Aitkin area fisheries office.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate of 6.1 per gill net was within the expected range for the lake class, and near the long term average of 6.6 per gill net. Walleye ranged in length from 6.3 to 18.9 inches long. The average size was still relatively small at 11.9 inches and 0.6 pounds, although this has been increasing slowly. Additionally, the number of fish within the harvest slot (14-18 inches) has continued to increase and is the highest that we have observed since 1999. Walleye ranged from age 1 to 12, with 10 year classes identified in the sample, with the strong 2018 and 2021 year classes accounting for more than 60% of the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nFall night electrofishing was also conducted each year since 2009, to monitor juvenile Walleye abundance (see Targeted Assessment Oct 10, 2023). Overall, natural reproduction appears to be higher in the years since the regulations were implemented suggesting a possible benefit of the regulation of an improved spawning stock.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance remained similar to 2022 at 3.7 per gill net, which is near the long term average and within the range expected for similar lakes. The size structure was also similar to past surveys, with an average length of 19.5 inches and 1.9 pounds, and with fish up to 36.5 inches observed in the sample. Anglers should be aware of the current Northern Pike regulations in Minnesota which encourage the harvest of smaller fish. The regulations can be found at www.dnr.state.mn.us/pike/index.html. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee numbers remained high in 2023.  They are an important forage species for larger predators and are available to be harvested via angling (typically in winter) or sport netting. They have been sampled in above average numbers for the four previous surveys, nearly double the rate of what is expected for similar lakes. The catch rate in 2023 was 10.5 per gill net. Following a major die off in 2012 that was due to a lack of adequate cool-water habitat from the excessive flooding, Tullibee numbers dropped to 0.12 per gill net in 2013. Due to their resiliency and high reproductive rates, they appear to be more abundant now than prior to the 2012 flood event. Sizes ranged from 8.0 to 17.7 inches, and averaged 11.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTypically, dissolved oxygen and thermal conditions in Bill Horn Bay are adequate for Tullibee survival in mid-summer and this habitat is monitored annually. In summer 2023, conditions for Tullibee appeared good from about 6 feet deep to the bottom, in Bill Horn Bay (especially good from 22 to 60 feet), where Tullibee migrate each year in the late spring. This deep and cold bay acts as a refuge for Tullibee in the warm summer months. When temperatures cool in the fall, Tullibee again leave Bill Horn Bay and make use of the remaining areas of the lake. Maintaining good stewardship within the Prairie River watershed is key to maintaining viable Tullibee populations in Big Sandy. This is especially important in an era of more variable climatic conditions. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish abundance in the gill nets was similar to 2022 and remained quite high relative to past surveys.  Size structure remained large with fish captured between 15.1 and 29.5 inches long. The large influx of fish was not likely due to recruitment of juveniles, but rather from immigration from the Mississippi River, which has had periods of upstream connectivity each of the last three years.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance appeared low in 2023, with a gill net catch rate of 2.3 per net. This was the lowest number of Perch that we have observed in all past gill net surveys.  While Perch abundance does vary tremendously, we will be watching very closely because they are an important food component for many of the predators in Big Sandy Lake. Size structure remained good, with fish from 5.3 to 11.2 inches observed in the gill net sample. <br> \n <br> \nOne Smallmouth Bass was observed in the 2023 survey. They have been found regularly in low numbers in past fish and creel surveys. Past creel survey reports indicated small numbers were already present in 1988 and 2001. Popularity for Smallmouth Bass fishing has been increasing, likely coinciding with an increase in abundance. Angling in the early season is typically better when they are closer to near-shore structure areas before they disperse throughout the lake during the summer. <br> \n</p>",

This is the second sampling of this nature, intended to provide information on walleye recruitment.  The total sample time was 2.1 hours resulting in a young-of-the-year (YOY) catch rate of 9.1/hr.  YOY fish accounted for 15% of the total catch and ranged in size from 5.5\" to 6.8\" with a mean length of 6.2\".  The catch rate of walleye age 1 and older was 50.0/hr with fish ranging from 7.0\" to 15.0\".  Of these, 38 were age 1 with a catch rate of 18.1/hr.  This is only the second fall sample on Big Sandy, but the catches in these first two years suggest electrofishing may provide useful data on walleye recruitment and should be continued annually as time and staff limitations permit.</p>",

This survey was intended to provide information on walleye recruitment and has been conducted annually since 2009.  The total sample time was 1.9 hours resulting in a young-of-the-year (YOY) catch rate of 8.4/hr.  YOY fish accounted for 11% of the total catch and ranged in size from 4.0\" to 6.5\" with a mean length of 5.0\".  The catch rate of walleye age-1 and older was 67.3/hr with fish ranging from 7.1\" to 16.6\".  Of these, 65 were age-2 with a catch rate of 33.9/hr.  Although this is only the third year of fall electrofishing on Big Sandy, useful data on walleye recruitment has been collected.  The great strength of the 2009 year-class can be tracked through each of the surveys.  In addition, while sample size is small, more walleye over 14\" were observed in this survey than in the previous two (5/hr vs 1.5-2/hr in previous surveys). Annual fall electrofishing should be continued, as time and staff limitations permit, to monitor walleye recruitment in Big Sandy Lake. </p>",

This survey was intended to provide information on walleye recruitment and has been conducted annually since 2009.  Extreme weather conditions were experienced in 2012.  The lake became ice-free on March 26, the earliest date since 1930, when records were first kept.  Above average temperatures occurred in every month from January to September.  Unusually large rainfall events in late May and June resulted in approximately 22 inches of precipitation, compared to the 7.5 inches during average years (see SA dated 8/9/2012 for more information on this).  By the time of this survey, conditions for sampling were good, with normal water levels, water temperatures around 60 degrees, and winds below 10 mph.  The lack of wild rice, due to the extreme water fluctuations in May and June, was noticeable on a few of the runs and made for better visibility in these areas.   <br> \n <br> \nThe total sample time was 1.73 hours resulting in a young-of-the-year (YOY) catch rate of 44.4/hr, the highest catch to date. YOY fish accounted for 50% of the total catch and ranged in size from 4.8\" to 7.2\" with a mean length of 6.3\".  Age class frequency distribution reflects age analysis focused on differentiating age-1 from YOY only.  The catch rate of age-1 walleye was 11.0/hr and the catch rate for walleye age-2 and older was 32.9/hr, with fish up to 24.4\" sampled.  Despite the extreme weather experienced in 2012, the walleye population in Big Sandy Lake appears to have persisted quite well.  In fact, YOY walleye were the most abundant and the largest of any fall electrofishing survey to date.  Annual fall electrofishing should be continued, as time and staff limitations permit, to monitor walleye recruitment in Big Sandy Lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to walleye, other species were noted during fall electrofishing.  Northern pike were seen in fair numbers and a wide variety of sizes.  A fair number of black crappie were also observed, although the number of young of the year fish appeared to be substantially less than the previous two years.  Yellow perch, white suckers, and redhorse were observed in typical numbers.  In addition, two adult smallmouth bass were seen during sampling, but not collected.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile the condition of the lake this summer appeared dismal, the lake started with a healthy native fish community that was resilient enough to survive this year's unprecedented weather.  Future fish surveys will help us better understand how the unique weather of 2012 affected the fish community. <br> \n</p>",

This survey was completed in addition to the standard population assessment conducted the week of July 7, 2013.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (24 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 24 stations, but three sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample 2 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 15 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 8 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured four sensitive species; burbot, Iowa darter, logperch, and mottled sculpin.  Other non-game fish species sampled include golden shiner, Johnny darter, spottail shiner and tadpole madtom.  The preliminary IBI score (per Drake and Pereira, 2002) calculated from this survey, and using standard gill net and trap net data from the population assessment, was 109.  This value was similar to the previous score of 106 calculated using the same methods in 2011. <br> \n</p>",

This survey is intended to provide information on walleye recruitment and has been conducted annually since 2009. The total sample time was 1.5 hours resulting in a YOY walleye catch rate of 129/hour (rates reported as run time). Catch rates from previous surveys have ranged from 9 to 44/hour with the exception of 2013, which had an extremely high catch of 490/hour. The 2015 catch rate of 129/hr is the second highest on record.  YOY walleye ranged from 4.2\" to 7.3\" and averaged 5.6\", which is considered small for the area, but slightly larger compared to previous assessments on Big Sandy. Age 1 walleye were captured at a rate of 23/hour and ranged from 7.4 to 9.1\". Catch rates for age 1 walleye have ranged from 3 to 89/hour (2013 year class). Fall night electrofishing should continue as staff time permits to evaluate whether the catch rate of either YOY or age 1 walleye is a meaningful predictor of recruitment to harvestable size on this lake, and to monitor natural recruitment in this system.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sandy Lake is located about nine miles north of McGregor in northeastern Aitkin County. It is a hard water Walleye lake with 71 miles of shoreline, numerous bays and islands and a surface area of 6,526 acres, of which 47 percent is less than 15 feet deep. The lake has dark brown water with low water clarity (secchi depth about 4.5 feet). The dark, coffee colored water is the result of tannins entering the lake through its two main inlets (Sandy and Prairie Rivers) that flow out of extensive wetland areas on their way to the lake. Big Sandy is a popular lake for angling as well as a variety of water oriented recreation. The lake is heavily developed with permanent and seasonal homes and cabins. There are several public accesses, a few private resorts, and the Army Corps of Engineers operates a recreation area with campgrounds and access facilities.  Big Sandy Lake has a large watershed, which is covered primarily by forests and wetlands. The lake is subject to dramatic water level fluctuations under certain climatological conditions. The primary management is for Walleye, with Black Crappie and Northern Pike listed as secondary management species.  There are special harvest regulations for Walleye (14-18\" harvest slot, with one over 26\" allowed) and sunfish (bag limit of 5), which began in 2011. A targeted survey of the fish community was conducted the week of 7/7/2020. Logistical difficulties due to the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in only gill nets being used in this survey.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate in the gill net (8.4/net) was similar to what was observed in that last two surveys and appears to have stabilized at a higher level than was observed in the early 2000's. The average size was still relatively small at 11.1inches and 0.5 pounds, although the number of fish within the harvest slot has been increasing to some degree. Eleven year classes of Walleye were observed from 1 to 18 years old. The 2015, 2017, and 2018 year classes were the most common and along with the 2014 and 2013 year classes, were each captured at higher than average rates. The 2015 year class broke the record catch at age 5 set by the 2013 year class two years earlier, indicating another strong year class was set to mature and contribute to the spawning stock. Fall night electrofishing was also conducted in October to monitor juvenile Walleye abundance (see Targeted Assessment 10/02/2020), and has been since 2009. Overall, natural reproduction appears to be higher in the years since the regulations were implemented suggesting a possible benefit of the regulation is an improved spawning stock.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance in 2020 (3.7/gill net) changed little since 2018 (2.8/gill net) and was near the long-term median of 4/gill net. The size averaged 20.2 inches and 2.3 pounds. Some pike can grow to quality sizes in the lake as we routinely sample fish in the mid-30 inch range (to 35.5 inches in 2020); approximately 15 percent were longer than 26 inches in this sample. Lower Northern Pike numbers are beneficial for managing for Walleye in Big Sandy Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers have declined the last three surveys but are still within the normal range for the lake type. Though sample size was small, the size structure remained strong with a mean length of 10.5 inches and a maximum length of 13.4 inches. Keep in mind trap nets were not used and they do typically sample crappies better on this lake than do gillnets. Growth and size structure are among the best in the area.  <br> \n  <br> \nTullibee are once again available for angling or sport netting, as well as for forage for large predators. Tullibee catch rates dropped off from a recent high of 12.4/net in 2018, to 8.5/net in 2020.  Fish to 18.2 inches were sampled. Typically dissolved oxygen and thermal conditions in Bill Horn Bay are adequate for Tullibee survival in mid-summer and these habitat indices are monitored annually. Observations in the spring and fall during other past surveys indicated Tullibee make use of the remainder of the lake in cooler conditions. Maintaining good stewardship within the watershed is key to maintaining viable Tullibee populations in Big Sandy as well as other waters in Minnesota. This is especially important in an era of warming climatic conditions. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catches showed a significant decrease from 11.3/gill net in 2018, to 7/gill net in 2020, which is the second lowest catch recorded in survey history and right at the lower end of the typical range of catch rates for similar lakes. In addition to being an important forage species, Yellow Perch can at times provide an angling opportunity unique for the area. Sizes ranged from 5.2 to 11.0 inches and averaged 8.4 inches. Perch numbers can vary quite a bit and will likely rebound when favorable environmental conditions present themselves. <br> \n <br> \nAnecdotal reports of Channel Catfish were heard beginning in 2013, which was just after a major flood event in 2012. During that summer flood, water levels in both the Mississippi River and Big Sandy were similar, thereby allowing some movement of fish past the dam from the river into Big Sandy. Those water level conditions are rare. Channel Catfish were sampled for the first time in our standard gill nets at 0.4 fish/gill net in 2016, and one Channel Catfish was caught in a trap net in 2018. In 2020, Channel Catfish showed an increase in abundance to 0.9/gill net. It is likely that they are becoming naturalized to Big Sandy Lake, as well as the Sandy, Prairie, and Tamarack Rivers.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass were first observed in survey nets in 2009, and have increased steadily to a level (0.4/gill net) that is within the interquartile range for class 22 lakes. This is a similar trend to several other lakes in the Aitkin area with Smallmouth Bass populations. <br> \n</p>",

This survey is intended to provide information on Walleye recruitment and has been conducted annually since 2009.  <br> \n <br> \nThe total sample time was 2 hours, resulting in a YOY Walleye catch rate of 122/hour (rates reported as run time). All 8 standard stations were able to be used in the CPUE calculation. Catch rates from previous surveys have ranged from 9 to 138/hour with the exception of 2013, which had an extremely high catch of 490/hour.  <br> \n <br> \nTotal lengths of YOY Walleye ranged from 4 inches to 6.8 inches and averaged 5.7 inches, which was similar to previous assessments on Big Sandy (2009-2022 average length of 5.6 inches).  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate for age 1 Walleye was 25 per hour and has a long-term average of 38/hour. Overall, natural reproduction appears to be higher in years since the regulations were implemented (median YOY catch rate of 20/hr pre-reg vs 44/hr post-reg), suggesting a possible benefit of the regulation to Walleye reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nFall night electrofishing should continue as staff time permits to continue to evaluate natural reproduction and to determine whether the catch rate of either YOY or age 1 Walleye is a meaningful predictor of recruitment to harvestable size on this lake. It's important to note that only 1 netter was allowed to be used in 2020 due to protocol restrictions stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic, which may have affected catch rates slightly. Two netters have been used again, to be directly comparable with the entire time series.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sandy Lake is located in northeastern Aitkin County approximately 9 miles north of McGregor.  At 6,526 acres, it is second only to Mille Lacs in size and popularity in the Aitkin area.  The lake is heavily developed with 936 homes/cabins around the lake and several resorts/campgrounds.  The Army Corps of Engineers also operates a campground/recreation area at the outlet on the northwest side of the lake. There are also multiple public accesses surrounding the east, west, and south sides.  Special regulations for walleye (14-18\" harvest slot with 1 over 26\") and bluegill (bag of 5 fish) will begin on May 14, 2011. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is characterized as a fertile walleye lake comprised of several habitat types.  These include the open, windswept main basin; the deep cool eastern basin, Bill Horn Bay; the shallower and more isolated south basin, Webster Bay; and shallow bays containing dense rice beds on the south, east and northeast sides of the lake. The maximum depth is 84' and about 47% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Walleyes are the most popular target for anglers and it is managed essentially as a walleye lake.  Big Sandy has been deemed \"impaired\", due to high phosphorus levels, by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, and is undergoing watershed and water quality analysis via the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) study and plan for the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were commonly stocked in Big Sandy prior to 1995.  Most were fry stockings, although the frequency varied from annual to every third year.  Relative success of stocked vs non-stocked year classes was similar, therefore walleye stocking was discontinued in 1996.  In the years shortly after the cessation of stocking, excellent year classes were produced, however recruitment in this decade appears to have been relatively poor. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch increased from 2.3/gill net in 2009 to 4.3/gill net in 2010.  Past catches have averaged 5.5/gill net.  Average length and weight were 10.7\" and 0.5 lbs in 2010, compared to 11.7\" and 0.6 lbs in 2009.  The increase in relative abundance and smaller average size are largely due to a strong 2008 year class (age 2) that accounted for 38% of the walleyes sampled. Historically 25% to 72% of all walleyes sampled by gill net were less than 12\" with the average near 50%.  In 2010, 77% were less than 12\", again, due primarily to the presence of the 2008 year class.  Six additional year classes were present in the gill nets with 89% being ages 1-4 (2006-2009).  Recent analyses of this young age structure suggest that relatively high angler exploitation may be limiting recruitment into the spawning stock, which has affected annual recruitment this decade.  Growth of Big Sandy walleyes is typically slow, though they are in good condition. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was also relatively low at 2.3/gill net.  Past catches have ranged from 0.9 to 5.8/gill net with an average of 5.3/gill net.  Average length and weight were 20.6\" and 2.2 lbs with 14% measuring at least 24\".  Age 2-4 fish (2006-2008 year classes) were most abundant, accounting for 69% of all northern pike sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish and also provide additional opportunities for anglers.  Yellow perch catches have been declining since 1990, falling to 5.1/gill net in 2010.  The average size of perch was 8.2\" and 26% were 9\" or longer.  Tullibee are a cold-water fish and are usually limited to the confines of Bill Horn Bay during the summer months. While they provide quality forage for northern pike and walleye, with fish averaging 11.8\" and individual fish measuring nearly 17\", they also appear to be of interest to anglers.  Anecdotal reports indicate a relatively new winter angling fishery for tullibee appears to be developing on Big Sandy. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were sampled for the first time in Big Sandy in 2009, though none were sampled in 2010.  Although only 2 fish were caught (0.13/gill net), it corroborates angler observations of an emerging smallmouth bass population.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance has never been high on Big Sandy, ranging from 0-4.5/trap net.  The 2010 catch of 3.0/trap net is low compared to similar lakes, even though it is the second highest catch to date.  Black crappies were caught in good numbers in 2010 and both species had a good size structure, providing a unique fishery for the area. The crappie fishery in recent years has been the mainstay of the fishery while walleye abundance was low.  As walleye increase in numbers, crappies will be expected to decrease, while still maintaining good size structure and catchable population levels.  Anecdotal observations of young of year crappie in the fall electrofishing survey suggest that 2010 year class may be very strong. <br> \n <br> \nNote: Special regulations for walleye (14-18\" harvest slot with 1 over 26\") and sunfish (bag of 5 fish) will begin on May 14, 2011. <br> \n</p>",

The total sample time was 2.0 hours resulting in a YOY walleye catch rate of 39/hour (rates reported as run time). Catch rates from previous surveys had ranged from 9 to 44/hour with the exception of 2013, which had an extremely high catch of 490/hour. YOY walleye ranged from 4.1 to 6.0\" and averaged 4.8\", which is considered small for the area, but similar to previous assessments on Big Sandy. Age 1 walleye were captured at a rate of 89/hour and ranged from 6.2 to 9.1\". This represents the highest age 1 catch to date, which has ranged from 3 to 56/hour, and corresponds to the extremely high YOY catch from 2013. Fall night electrofishing should continue as staff time permits to evaluate whether the catch rate of either YOY or age 1 walleye is a meaningful predictor of recruitment to harvestable size on this lake, and to monitor natural recruitment in this system.  </p>",

This survey is intended to provide information on walleye recruitment and has been conducted annually since 2009. The total sample time was 1.6 hours resulting in a YOY walleye catch rate of 44.2/hour (rates reported as run time). Catch rates from previous surveys have ranged from 9 to 129/hour with the exception of 2013, which had an extremely high catch of 490/hour. Total lengths of YOY walleye ranged from 4.3 inches to 6.6 inches and averaged 4.9 inches, which is slightly smaller compared to previous assessments on Big Sandy (average length of 5.4 inches). The catch rate for age 1 walleye was 48.1 per hour, which is the third highest observed at Big Sandy Lake, although slightly down from 64.2/hour in 2016. Overall, natural reproduction appears to be higher in years since the regulations were implemented (median YOY catch rate of 11/hr pre-reg vs 41/hr post-reg), suggesting a possible benefit of the regulation to walleye reproduction. Fall night electrofishing should continue as staff time permits to continue to evaluate natural reproduction and to determine whether the catch rate of either YOY or age 1 walleye is a meaningful predictor of recruitment to harvestable size on this lake.</p>",

This survey is intended to provide information on Walleye recruitment and has been conducted annually since 2009.  The total sample time was 1.5 hours resulting in a YOY Walleye catch rate of 138.7/hour (rates reported as run time).  This is the second highest catch rate since monitoring began. Catch rates from previous surveys have typically ranged from 9 to 129/hour with the exception of 2013, which had an extremely high catch of 490/hour.  Total lengths of YOY Walleye ranged from 4.4 inches to 7.9 inches and averaged 6.4 inches, which was larger compared to previous assessments on Big Sandy (average length of 5.5 inches).  The catch rate for age 1 Walleye was 16 per hour, which is on the lower end of what has been observed at Big Sandy Lake since 2012.  Overall, natural reproduction appears to be higher in years since the regulations were implemented (median YOY catch rate of 11/hr pre-reg vs 44/hr post-reg), suggesting a possible benefit of the regulation to Walleye reproduction.  Fall night electrofishing should continue as staff time permits to continue to evaluate natural reproduction and to determine whether the catch rate of either YOY or age 1 Walleye is a meaningful predictor of recruitment to harvestable size on this lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to Walleye, a sample of Yellow Perch was also collected as part of a special research project.   Yellow Perch ranged in length from 1.9 - 11.3 inches and were caught at a rate of 20.7/hr for young-of-the-year (YOY) and 116.7/hr for age 1 and older fish.  Sex determination was made and scales and otoliths were collected from a certain number of fish per length category.  Age analysis revealed 75% percent of the sample were YOY with individuals up to 9 years old.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Big Sandy Walleye fishery is supported wholly by natural reproduction. In past creel surveys (1988, 2001), it was characterized by having relatively high effort with about 2 lbs/acre of Walleye yield and with the size distribution of harvested fish peaking at only 12 inches. In 2011, experimental Walleye fishing regulations were adopted (14-18 inch harvest slot, with 1 allowed over 26 inches) to attempt to improve the fishery at Big Sandy Lake, McGregor, Minnesota. In the most recent creel survey (2022), yield increased to 1.2 lbs/acre which is over double the yield of the previous two creel surveys (2016 and 2021) of 0.5 lbs/acre. The average size of fish harvested was 15 inches in the three creel surveys post regulation, a slight increase from the 13 inch average harvested size pre-regulation. An evaluation of the Walleye population in Big Sandy Lake and connected waters was conducted in the springs of 2021 and 2022. The project was conducted to estimate total stock size, length and age distribution of the stock and estimate spawning stock biomass to aid in a concurrent acoustic telemetry Walleye movement study. Standard population assessments using gill nets and trap nets were also conducted the week of July 11, 2022.  Previous spring assessments had also been conducted in 2000, 2009, 2016 and 2022. A concurrent creel survey on Big Sandy Lake was also conducted to estimate angler effort and catch and anglers' opinions of the current Walleye regulations. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were tagged with individually numbered t-bar tags during spawning runs in the Sandy River (upstream and below Libby Dam) and Big Sandy Lake. Attempts were made to sample the Prairie River, but they were unsuccessful due to river conditions and timing. Trap nets and electrofishing were used to sample and tag the spawning fish. Electrofishing, short-term gill nets (nets typically set for less than 30 minutes), and a standard gill net survey in July were used to sample the whole population for tagged fish. The concurrent creel survey was also used to examine fish for tags. All of the recapture events looking for tags occurred after the completion of spawning. <br> \n <br> \nThe population of Walleye 300mm (about 12 inches) and larger in Big Sandy Lake was estimated at approximately 64,000 fish (confidence limits of 53,000-82,000) or 9.8/acre, with about 24,000 (confidence limits of 18,500-34,000) that were between 14 and 18 inches at the beginning of the season. In comparison to the 2021 survey, both the overall population (64,000 from 32,000) and harvestable population (24,000 from 10,500) had doubled in size, largely due to strong 2015 and 2018 year classes entering each of these size classs (over 12 inches and 14 inches). A large number of Walleye were observed between 12 and 14 inches, indicating good levels of sub-adults were ready to recruit to the fishery within the next two seasons. Female spawning stock biomass estimates appeared to have recovered since the regulations had been implemented in 2011 and management goals had been met.  <br> \n <br> \nThe last of the annual assessments for this project is planned for 2023, before returning to a more normal monitoring schedule of standard surveys on a 3 year rotation.  <br> \n</p>",
