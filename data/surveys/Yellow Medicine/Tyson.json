                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment was conducted during mid July of 2007 in Tyson Lake. Tyson is a small (147 acres), shallow (8 feet maximum depth), periodically aerated, and productive lake located in Yellow Medicine County. Residential development is limited to one farm site on the south shore. Nutrient runoff into Tyson is from agricultural row crops. Tyson Lake is connected to a shallow wetland along the east shore. Water clarity was poor during July of 2007 (0.5 feet). Blue-green algae blooms are common and intense in Tyson Lake. A partial summerkill of primarily black bullhead, fathead minnows, and orangespotted sunfish occurred in July of 2002. Submergent vegetation is limited to primarily sago pondweed, water moss, and filamentous algae, especially in the near shore areas. Emergent vegetation consists mainly of bulrush and cattail species scattered throughout the shoreline areas. Tyson Lake is managed for walleye as primary species with yellow perch and bluegill as secondary species. Walleye fry are generally stocked into Tyson every other year. If a fry stocking is a failure, then the lake will generally be stocked again with fry the following spring. Walleye fingerling stocking is contingent upon two successive walleye fry stocking failures in Tyson Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2007 (1.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and below the Tyson historical average (5.53 fish/gillnet). The 2007 yellow perch average size was small (0.11 pounds and 5.91 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.42 pounds from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates in Tyson were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-2. The 2005 yellow perch year class comprised 92% of the 2007 yellow perch assessment catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2007 (0.11 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and below the Tyson historical average (3.44 fish/trapnet). Adult bluegill (2,037 fish, 291 pounds) were stocked in Tyson during July of 2004. <br> \n <br> \nGreen sunfish numbers were low to moderate in 2007 (0.22 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and below the Tyson historical average (1.04 fish/trapnet). The 2007 green sunfish average size was large (0.22 pounds and 6.30 inches) from trapnets. Orangespotted sunfish numbers were low in 2007 (0.11 fish/trapnet) and below the Tyson historical average (6.24 fish/trapnet).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low to moderate in the 2007 gillnets (4.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. However, walleye numbers were high in the 2007 trapnets (9.67 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rates are 1.77 fish/gillnet and 2.04 fish/trapnet for Tyson. The 2007 walleye average size was small from gillnets (0.76 pounds and 11.52 inches) and trapnets (0.41 pounds and 9.85 inches). The walleye historical average weights are 1.77 pounds from gillnets and 1.70 pounds from trapnets. Walleye growth rates for Tyson were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-2, and above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 3-5. The 2005 walleye year class comprised 98% of the 2007 walleye catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Tyson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate a 2007 spring walleye fry stocking (114,545 fry). There were no young of year \"YOY\" walleye captured in the 2007 fall electrofishing survey. There were moderate YOY walleye numbers (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.49 inches average length) captured in 2005. The Tyson Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 63.60 YOY/hour and 6.25 inches respectively. The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 71.24 YOY/hour from lakes fry stocked and lakes with natural reproduction. Walleye fry have been stocked into Tyson during 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2007. The highest Tyson YOY walleye catch rate occurred during a 1998 fry stocked year (264.00 YOY/hour, 6.01 inches average length). <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were abundant in 2007 (298.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and above the historical average (187.43 fish/gillnet). The 2007 black bullhead average size was small to moderate (0.18 pounds and 7.11 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.32 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Tyson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the Wood Lake Sportsman\u0019s Club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Tyson fishery will be sampled in the 2008 fall for YOY walleye. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment was conducted during mid-June of 2012 in Tyson Lake. Tyson is a small (147 acres), shallow (8 feet maximum depth), periodically aerated, and productive lake located in Yellow Medicine County. Residential development is limited to one farm site on the south shore. Water levels were normal to high during the 2012 assessment, but 1-2 feet below normal by fall due to drought conditions. Nutrient runoff into Tyson is from agricultural row crops. Tyson Lake is connected to a shallow wetland along the east shore. Water clarity was fair during June of 2012 (3.0 feet). Blue-green algae blooms are common and intense in Tyson Lake. A light algae bloom was present during the 2012 assessment. A partial summerkill of primarily black bullhead, fathead minnows, and orangespotted sunfish occurred in July of 2002. Submergent vegetation is limited to primarily sago pondweed, water moss, and filamentous algae, especially in the near shore areas. Sago pondweed was abundant in Tyson during 2012. Emergent vegetation consists mainly of bulrush and cattail species scattered throughout the shoreline areas. Tyson Lake is managed for walleye as primary species. Walleye fry are generally stocked into Tyson every other year. If a fry stocking is a failure, then the lake will generally be stocked again with fry the following spring. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2012 (0.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges of Tyson and similar lakes. Yellow perch abundance in the 2012 trapnets was also low (0.50 fish/trapnet). The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 4.69 fish/gillnet for Tyson. The 2012 yellow perch size was small to moderate (0.17 pounds and 6.86 inches) from gillnets and trapnets combined. The yellow perch historical average length is 8.15 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were not captured in 2012 trapnets or gillnets. The bluegill historical catch rate is 2.87 fish/trapnet for Tyson. Adult bluegill (2,037 fish, 291 pounds) were last stocked in Tyson during July of 2004. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low in 2012 (0.25 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 0.08 fish/trapnet for Tyson. The 2012 black crappie average size was large (0.84 pounds and 11.40 inches) from trapnets. Black crappie growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The black crappie captured in the 2012 assessment were from the 2009 and 2007 year classes. <br> \n <br> \nGreen sunfish numbers were low in 2012 (0.38 fish/trapnet). The green sunfish historical average catch rate is 0.93 fish/trapnet for Tyson. The 2012 green sunfish average size was moderate (0.17 pounds and 5.75 inches) from trapnets. Orangespotted sunfish abundance was also low in 2012 (0.25 fish/trapnet) and below the Tyson historical average catch rate (5.25 fish/trapnet). Hybrid sunfish abundance was also low in 2012 (0.13 fish/trapnet), but similar to the historical average (0.09 fish/trapnet).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2012 gillnets (40.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Tyson and similar lakes. Walleye numbers were also abundant in 2012 trapnets (7.25 fish/trapnet). The walleye historical average catch rates are 8.22 fish/gillnet and 2.91 fish/trapnet for Tyson. The 2012 walleye average size was small to moderate (1.04 pounds and 12.01 inches) from gillnets. The 2012 walleye average size was small (0.40 pounds and 9.72 inches) from trapnets. The walleye historical average weights are 1.53 pounds from gillnets and 1.26 pounds from trapnets. The 2012 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was high (13.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2012 gillnets. The 2012 catch rate of preferred size (20.00 inches) and larger walleye was moderate (3.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2012 gillnets. Walleye growth rates for Tyson were near the upper end of Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5, but below the normal ranges for ages 6-7. The 2011 and 2008 walleye year classes (fry stocked) comprised 61% and 25% respectively of the 2012 walleye catch. Individual walleye captured from the 2008 year class appeared in robust condition. Walleye natural reproduction in Tyson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing survey was last conducted in 2011 to evaluate a spring walleye fry stocking (147,044 fry). There were moderate to low numbers of young of year \"YOY\" walleye (30.00 YOY/hour, 5.59 inches average length) captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Low numbers of YOY walleye (6.00 YOY/hour, 7.95 inches average length) were captured in 2010. The highest Tyson YOY walleye catch rate (378.46 YOY/hour, 4.92 inches average length) occurred in 2008. The Tyson Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 91.56 YOY/hour and 6.19 inches respectively. The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 81.31 YOY/hour from lakes fry stocked and lakes with natural reproduction. Walleye yearlings and adults were last stocked in Tyson during 2003 (434 pounds and 1,304 fish). Walleye fry have been stocked into Tyson during 1998, 2000, 2002-2003, 2005, 2007-08 and 2010-2011.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were abundant in 2012 (320.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges of Tyson and similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 209.53 fish/gillnet for Tyson. The 2012 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.32 pounds and 8.00 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.32 pounds from gillnets. Moderate numbers (48.25 fish/trapnet) of large black bullhead (0.56 pounds and 8.98 inches average size) were captured in the 2012 trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Tyson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the Wood Lake Sportsman's Club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Tyson fishery will be sampled in the fall of 2013 for YOY walleye. <br> \n</p>",

THE INITIAL LAKE SURVEY IN 1987 INDICATED THE FISHERY CONSISTED OF BLB AND MINNOW SPP.  MINNOW DEALERS TRAPPED TYSON EXTENSIVELY PRIOR TO THE STOCKING OF GAMEFISH.  BLG (307 LBS, RATE= 11 TO THE LB.) AND LMB (91 LBS, RATE=2.6 TO THE LB.) WERE STOCKED IN 1990 AND NOP (168  LBS, RATE=1 TO THE IB.) IN 1991.  YEP (586 LBS, RATE=6 TO THE IB.) WERE STOCKED IN 1987.  THE 1992 NOP GILLNET CATCH INDEX (1.00 PER GN, 4.27 LBS PER GN) WAS BELOW AVERAGE FOR NUMBERS, BUT AVERAGE FOR POUNDS COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 43 INDEX.  THE NOP TRAPNET CATCH INDEX (1.11 PER TN, 4.21 LBS PER TN) WAS AVERAGE FOR NUMBERS, BUT ABOVE AVERAGE FOR POUNDS COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 43 INDEX.  THE PSD (100) WAS ABOVE THE RANGE (30-60) FOR A BALANCED POPULATION.  THE RSD-P WAS 0. THE NOP MEAN WEIGHT WAS 4.27 LBS CAUGHT FROM GILLNETS AND 3.79 LBS TRAPNETS.  GROWTH RATES APPEAR BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-3 AND AVERAGE FOR AGE 4. THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE OR NO NOP NATURAL REPRODUCTION IN TYSON LAKE.  ALL FISH SAMPLED ARE PROBABLY FROM THE JUNE 1991 STOCKING.  THE 1992 BLG TRAPNET INDEX (17.11 PER TN, 2.63 LBS PER TN) WAS AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 43 INDEX.  THE BLG PSD (3) WAS BELOW THE RANGE (40-60) FOR A BALANCED POPULATION.  THE RSD-P WAS 1.  THE BLG MEAN WEIGHT CAUGHT FROM TRAPNETS WAS 0.15 LBS.  THE 1992 SUN- FISH SPP.  YOY INDEX (0.5 PER SEINE HAUL) WAS BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (148.0 PER SEINE HAUL).  BLG GROWTH RATES WERE BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGES 3-4, AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-2 AND 5-6, ABOVE AVERAGE FOR AGE 7.  THE 1989 AND 1987 YEAR CLASSES APPEAR STRONG, HOWEVER, THESE YEAR CLASSES WERE PROBABLY FROM THE JUNE 1990 STOCKING OF STUNTED GEORGE LAKE BLGS.  ONLY 1 LMB WAS CAPTURED DURING SPRING ELECTROFISHING IN 1992.  LMB WERE NOT CAPTURED IN THE GILLNETS OR TRAPNETS IN 1992. THE 1992 YEP GILLNFET CATCH INDEX (10.33 PER GN, 6.86 LBS PER GN) WAS AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 43 INDEX.  THE YEP PSD (97) WAS ABOVE THE RANGE (30-50) FOR A BALANCED POPULATION WHICH INDICATES A LACK OF NATURAL REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN TYSON LAKE.  YOY YEP WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE 1992 SEINE HAULS.  THE RSD-P WAS 18.  THE MEAN WEIGHT OF YEP CAUGHT IN GILLNETS WAS 0.66 LBS. GROWTH RATES APPEAR AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-3 AND ABOVE AVERAGE FOR AGES 4-8.  THE STRONG 1987 YEAR CLASS CORRESPONDS TO THE INITIAL NOV 1987 STOCKING OF YEP.  THE 1992 BLB CATCH INDEX (233.33 PER GN, 43.18 LBS PER GN; 210.33 PER TN, 45.99 LBS PER TN) WAS ABOVE AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 43 INDEX AND ABOVE THE 1987 SURVEY (102.00 PER GN, 26.17 LBS PER GN; 27.75 PER TN, 9.69 LBS PER TN).  THE 1992 BLB MEAN WEIGHTS (GN=0.19 LBS TN=0.22 LBS) WERE BELOW THE 1987 SURVEY MEAN WEIGHTS (GN=0.26 LBS, TN=0.35 LBS). THE BLB PSD WAS 6. THE RSD-P WAS 1.

A fall night electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye was conducted on Tyson during late August of 2017. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nTyson is a small (147 acres), shallow (8 feet maximum depth), periodically aerated, and productive lake located in Yellow Medicine County. Residential development is limited to one farm site on the south shore. Nutrient runoff into Tyson is from agricultural row crops. Tyson Lake is connected to a shallow wetland along the east shore. Water clarity was fair during June of 2017 (3.2 feet). Blue-green algae blooms are common and intense in Tyson Lake. An intense blue-green algae bloom was present during the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. Common Carp are not present in Tyson. A partial summerkill of primarily Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnows, and Orangespotted Sunfish occurred in July of 2002. Submergent vegetation is limited to primarily sago pondweed, water moss, and filamentous algae, especially in the near shore areas. Emergent vegetation consists mainly of bulrush and cattail species scattered throughout the shoreline areas. Shoalwater substrates are mostly silt and sand. Tyson is managed primarily for Walleye and Yellow Perch. There are good fishing opportunities for Walleye and large sized Yellow Perch based on the 2017 survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were moderately abundant in 2017 (112.00 fish/gillnet, 73.56 fish/trapnet). The Black Bullhead historical average catch rates are 195.60 fish/gillnet and 88.13 fish/trapnet for Tyson. The 2017 Black Bullhead average size was moderate (0.32 pounds and 8.25 inches). <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2017 (1.00 fish/trapnet), but above the historical average catch rate (0.21 fish/trapnet) for Tyson. The 2017 Black Crappie average size was large (0.75 pounds and 10.98 inches). Black Crappie growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The Black Crappie captured in the 2017 survey were from 2012, 2013 and 2014 year classes. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were not captured in 2017 survey. The Bluegill historical catch rate is 2.46 fish/trapnet for Tyson. Adult Bluegill (2,037 fish, 291 pounds) were last stocked in Tyson during July of 2004. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were moderately abundant in 2017 (18.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. Yellow Perch abundance in the previous 2012 survey was low (0.50 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 6.60 fish/gillnet for Tyson. The 2017 Yellow Perch size was large (0.68 pounds and 11.14 inches) from gillnets and trapnets combined. Yellow Perch growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2013 Yellow Perch year class comprised 94% of the 2017 Yellow Perch assessment catch. Yellow Perch adults were last stocked in April of 2017 (1,050 fish, 0.14 pounds average size). It is unknown the extent the last stocking had on the present Yellow Perch population in Tyson. The 2013-14 Yellow Perch year classes responded positively in similar nearby lakes following partial winterkills. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Tyson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous surveys and historical data review. Walleye fry have been recently stocked (140,000 to 290,000 fish) into Tyson during 2010-2011, 2013-2014 and 2017. Walleye yearlings and adults were last stocked in Tyson during 2003 (434 pounds and 1,304 fish). There were abundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" Walleye (125.46 YOY/hour, 5.03 inches average length) captured in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (126.00 YOY/hour, 5.67 inches average length) were also captured in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were moderately abundant in 2017 summer survey (10.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 8.48 fish/gillnet for Tyson. The 2017 Walleye average size was moderate (0.97 pounds and 14.10 inches). Walleye growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3, but within the normal ranges for ages 4-6. The 2014 Walleye year classes (fry stocked) comprised 79% of the 2017 Walleye catch. <br> \n  <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Tyson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the Wood Lake Sportsman's Club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Tyson fishery will be sampled for all fish species in 2022 and in the fall of 2019 for YOY Walleye. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment was conducted during mid June of 2005 in Tyson Lake. Tyson is a small (147 acres), shallow (8 feet maximum depth), periodically aerated, and productive lake located in Yellow Medicine County. Residential development is limited to one farm site on the south shore. Nutrient runoff into Tyson is from agricultural row crops. Tyson Lake is connected to a shallow wetland along the east shore. Blue-green algae blooms are common and intense in Tyson Lake. The water clarity (secchi=2.5 feet) was poor during the 2005 summer. A partial summerkill of primarily black bullhead, fathead minnows, and orangespotted sunfish occurred in July of 2002. Submergent vegetation is limited to sago pondweed, water moss, and filamentous algae, especially in the near shore areas. Emergent vegetation consists mainly of bulrush and cattail species scattered throughout the shoreline areas. Tyson Lake is managed primarily for walleye, yellow perch, and bluegill. Walleye fry are generally stocked into Tyson every other year. If a fry stocking is a failure, then the lake will generally be stocked again with fry the following spring. Walleye fingerling stocking is contingent upon two successive walleye fry stocking failures in Tyson Lake. Yellow perch numbers were low in 2005 (3.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 6.67 fish/gillnet for Tyson. The 2005 yellow perch average size was large (0.56 pounds and 9.8 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.52 pounds from gillnets. The 2005 catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches) and larger yellow perch was high (3.00 fish/gillnet) for Tyson. Yellow perch growth rates in Tyson were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2001 yellow perch year class comprised 100% of the 2005 yellow perch assessment catch. The largest yellow perch captured was 10.9 inches from the 2005 assessment.Bluegill were not present in the 2005 Tyson assessment. The bluegill historical catch rate is 4.28 fish/trapnet for Tyson. Adult bluegill (2,037 fish, 291 pounds) were stocked in Tyson during July of 2004.Green sunfish numbers were moderate in 2005 (0.89 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The green sunfish historical average catch rate is 1.25 fish/trapnet. The 2005 green sunfish average size was small to moderate (0.17 pounds and 5.5 inches) from trapnets. Orangespotted sunfish numbers were abundant in 2005 (15.78 fish/trapnet) compared to the Tyson historical average (7.78 fish/trapnet). The 2005 orangespotted sunfish average length was small (3.6 inches) from trapnets. Walleye numbers were low in 2005 (1.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 1.21 fish/gillnet for Tyson. The 2005 walleye average size was moderate (2.14 pounds and 17.4 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 2.17 pounds from gillnets. The 2005 catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches) and larger walleye was low to moderate (1.50 fish/gillnet) in the 2005 assessment. Walleye growth rates for Tyson were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2001 walleye year class (yearlings stocked in 2002, adults stocked in 2003) comprised 100% of the 2005 walleye assessment catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Tyson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. The largest walleye captured was 18.8 inches from the 2005 assessment.A fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate a 2005 spring walleye fry stocking (112,135 fry). There were moderate young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.5 inches average length) captured in 2005. The Tyson Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 79.50 YOY/hour and 6.3 inches respectively. The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 68.66 YOY/hour from lakes fry stocked and lakes with natural reproduction. Walleye fry have been stocked into Tyson during 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2005. The highest Tyson YOY walleye catch rate occurred during a 1998 fry stocked year (264.00 YOY/hour, 6.0 inches average length).Black bullhead numbers were moderate in 2005 (73.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 159.79 fish/gillnet for Tyson. The 2005 black bullhead average size was moderate to large (0.63 pounds and 9.3 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.36 pounds from gillnets.Current fish management activities on Tyson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the Wood Lake Sportsman's Club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Tyson fishery will be sampled in the 2007 summer for all fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Tyson Lake was conducted during mid July of 2002. Tyson is a small (147 acres), shallow (8 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Yellow Medicine County. An aeration system (pump and baffle) was installed and first operated during the 1988-89 winter to prevent winterkill of gamefish. A significant winterkill occurred during the 1996-97 winter due to heavy snowfall and problems with the aeration system operation. A spring test netting in 1997 indicated only black bullhead, orangespotted sunfish, and fathead minnows surviving the winterkill. Gamefish (yellow perch, bluegill, walleye) were restocked following the 1996-97 winterkill. The present aeration system consists of one to two surface aerators. High nutrient runoff inflows are common into Tyson during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. Nutrient levels were high in Tyson during 2002. Water levels in 2002 summer were normal, but above normal during the late 1990's and 2000. Submergent vegetation species were limited to sago pondweed, filamentous algae, and water moss. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, cane, cattails) densities were common adjacent to shoreline areas. Water clarity was poor during the 2002 survey. A partial summerkill of fathead minnows, black bullhead, and orangespotted sunfish occurred along the north shore on 7-18-2002 due to low oxygen conditions caused by decaying blue-green algae. Intense blue-green algae blooms were present in Tyson during the 2002 summer. Residential development is limited to one farm site along the Tyson shoreline. Yellow perch numbers were moderate in 2002 (13.3 fish/gillnet). The yellow perch average size was large (0.35 lbs. and 8.6 inches from gillnets) in 2002. The catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches) and larger yellow perch was high (7.7 fish/gillnet) in 2002. The largest yellow perch captured was 12.4 inches in the 2002 resurvey. Yellow perch growth rates were above the normal ranges for ages 1-5 in Tyson compared to area lakes. About 88% of the yellow perch captured in the 2002 resurvey were hatched in 1999.Bluegill were not captured in 2002 resurvey (0.0 fish/trapnet). Low numbers of bluegill (0.4 fish/trapnet, average weight=0.22 lbs.) were captured in a special netting assessment during June of 1999 in Tyson. Bluegill were last stocked (518 adults) in the early summer of 1997. Walleye numbers were low in 2002 (3.3 fish/gillnet), but the highest recorded value for Tyson. The walleye historical catch rate is 1.1 fish/gillnet for Tyson. The 2002 walleye average size was moderate to large (2.20 lbs. and 18.1 inches from gillnets). Walleye growth rates were generally within the normal ranges in Tyson compared to area lakes. The largest walleye captured was 19.0 inches in the 2002 resurvey. All of the walleye captured in gillnets and trapnets during the 2002 resurvey were from a successful 1998 fry stocked year class. Walleye natural reproduction in Tyson is generally absent or rare based on previous fall and summer surveys. Tyson was stocked with 112,540 walleye fry in the spring of 2002.The 2002 walleye fry stocking was a failure based on results of the 2002 fall electrofishing survey (0.0 YOY/hour). There were two YOY walleye captured in the shoreline seine hauls during mid August of 2002, but these fish were extremely small (2.5 inches average length). Prolonged cold and cloudy weather during May and early June of 2002 limited forage (zooplankton) production, which contributed to poor walleye fry survival in most area lakes.Low numbers of black crappie were captured in the trapnets (0.2 fish/trapnet) during the 2002 Tyson resurvey. The black crappie average size was large (12.5 inches). No black crappie stockings by the DNR have occurred in Tyson. These fish were probably stocked in Tyson by local anglers.Black bullhead numbers were abundant in 2002 (230.3 fish/gillnet). The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 188.6 fish/gillnet in Tyson. The 2002 black bullhead average size was moderate to large (8.4 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined). The largest black bullhead captured was 12.6 inches in the 2002 resurvey.Less desirable sunfish species captured in 2002 resurvey included orangespotted sunfish (15.3 fish/trapnet) and green sunfish (4.1 fish/trapnet). The 2002 orangespotted sunfish and green sunfish average lengths were small (3.6 inches and 4.3 inches respectively). These sunfish species rarely reach acceptable harvest size (>6 inches) for anglers. Current fish management activities on Tyson include assisting the Wood Lake Sportsman's Club in the operation of the aeration system, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking walleye fry every other year. The Tyson Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2006 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Tyson during September 13, 2023 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to fry stocking/natural reproduction. One station was sampled for 10 minutes at dusk. The water temperature was 70 F. Water clarity was poor (6 inches) with a moderate blue-green algae bloom. We observed abundant numbers of Yellow Perch (4-6 inches), five Yellow Bullhead and four adult Walleye. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nTyson is a small (147 acres), shallow (8 feet maximum depth), periodically aerated, and productive lake located in Yellow Medicine County. Blue-green algae blooms are common and intense in Tyson Lake. Common Carp are not present in Tyson. A partial summerkill of primarily Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnows, and Orangespotted Sunfish occurred in July of 2002. Winterkill rarely occurs on Tyson Lake unlike nearby Wood Lake. Adequate oxygen levels (> 3 ppm) were maintained by the aeration system during the 2022-23 winter which had extreme snow events. No winterkill occurred in Tyson or nearby Wood unlike many other southern Minnesota lakes. Submergent vegetation present during 2022 included sago pondweed, coontail and northern milfoil especially in the near shore areas. Emergent vegetation consists mainly of bulrush and cattail species scattered throughout the shoreline areas. Shoalwater substrates are mostly silt and sand.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction has been generally insignificant based on previous surveys for Tyson. The Walleye population is due mostly to fry stockings (50,000 to 287,000 fish per stocking) in Tyson. Walleye fry have been recently stocked into Tyson during 2010-2011, 2013-2014, 2017, 2021-23. Approximately 50,800 Walleye fry were stocked in 2023. Walleye yearlings and adults were stocked in Tyson during 2003 (434 pounds, 1,304 fish), 2020 (250 pounds, 301 fish) and 2021 (100 pounds, 49 adults). Walleye fry are currently scheduled annually for stocking of Tyson. <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye numbers were abundant (365.99 YOY/hour, 7.46 inches) in the 2023 fall night electrofishing survey. Low numbers of yearling Walleye (6.00 fish/hour, 12.01 inches) were also captured in 2023. There were abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (125.46 YOY/hour, 5.03 inches average length) captured in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (126.00 YOY/hour, 5.67 inches average length) were also captured in 2014. The highest Tyson YOY Walleye catch rate (378.46 YOY/hour, 4.92 inches average length) occurred in 2008. The Tyson Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 113.33 YOY/hour and 6.04 inches respectively.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2022 gillnets (16.00 fish/gillnet) was above the Walleye historical average catch rates of 9.42 fish/gillnet for Tyson. The 2022 Walleye average weight and length were 2.50 pounds and 18.25 inches from gillnets. The 2022 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches plus) Walleye was 14.00 fish/gillnet. Walleye growth rates within the Spicer Area normal ranges for Tyson. The 2017 Walleye year class (fry stocked) comprised 29% of the 2022 Walleye catch.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Tyson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the Southwestern Prairie Outdoors Club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Tyson fishery will be sampled for all fish species in 2027 and periodically in the fall during fry stocked years for YOY Walleye. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted during mid-June of 2022 on Tyson Lake. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nTyson is a small (147 acres), shallow (8 feet maximum depth), periodically aerated, and productive lake located in Yellow Medicine County. Residential development is limited to one farm site on the south shore. Nutrient runoff into Tyson is from agricultural row crops. Tyson Lake is connected to a shallow wetland along the east shore. Water levels were low in 2022. Water clarity was good during June of 2022 (6.0 feet). Blue-green algae blooms are common and intense in Tyson Lake. Common Carp are not present in Tyson. A partial summerkill of primarily Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnows, and Orangespotted Sunfish occurred in July of 2002. Winterkill rarely occurs on Tyson Lake unlike nearby Wood Lake. Adequate oxygen levels (> 3 ppm) were maintained by aeration system during the 2022-23 winter which had extreme snow events. No winterkill occurred in Tyson or nearby Wood unlike many other southern Minnesota lakes. Submergent vegetation present during 2022 included sago pondweed, coontail and northern milfoil especially in the near shore areas. Emergent vegetation consists mainly of bulrush and cattail species scattered throughout the shoreline areas. Shoalwater substrates are mostly silt and sand. Tyson is managed primarily for Walleye and Yellow Perch. Shore angling occurs at the public access dock and along the highway road right away next to the culverts at the west end of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were abundant (172.00 fish/gillnet and 82.89 fish/trapnet) in 2022 survey nets and comparable to historical average catch rates (192.65 fish/gillnet and 87.47 fish/trapnet) for Tyson. Black Bullhead average size was moderate (0.43 pounds and 8.8 inches) from gillnets. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.33 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was low (0.78 fish/trapnet) in 2022. Black Crappie historical average catch rate is 0.28 fish/trapnet. The Black Crappie gillnet catch rate was also low (2.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The 2022 Black Crappie average size was moderate (0.62 pounds and 10.1 inches) from trapnets. The largest Black Crappie captured was 11.4 inches in 2022. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were abundant (10.44 fish/trapnet) in the 2022 compared to the historical average (3.46 fish/trapnet). Bluegill were not captured in 2017 trapnets or gillnets. The 2022 Bluegill average size was small (0.07 pounds, 4.4 inches) from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches plus) Bluegill was low (0.22 fish/trapnet). The largest Bluegill captured was 8.7 inches in 2022. Adult Bluegill (2,037 fish, 291 pounds) were last stocked by the DNR in Tyson during July of 2004. Adult Bluegill were purchased by the Southwestern Prairie Outdoors Club (formerly Wood Lake Sportsman's Club) and stocked during mid-June of 2020 (3,000 fish, 300 pounds) and 2021 (2,000 fish, 200 pounds) by a private aqua culturist into Tyson Lake. <br> \n <br> \nGreen Sunfish abundance was low (1.33 fish/trapnet) in 2022. The historical average catch rate is 0.88 fish/trapnet for Tyson. The 2022 Green Sunfish average size was small (0.07 pounds and 4.4 inches) from trapnets. Orangespotted Sunfish were abundant and small sized in 2022 trapnets (14.00 fish/trapnet, 3.3 inches). Orangespotted Sunfish historical average catch rate is 5.68 fish/trapnet. Hybrid Sunfish were also abundant and small sized in 2022 (9.11 fish/trapnet, 4.4 inches) compared to the historical average (1.21 fish/trapnet). The largest Hybrid Sunfish was 7.8 inches in the 2022 survey. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were abundant (79.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022 compared to the historical average catch rate of 15.65 fish/gillnet for Tyson. The 2022 Yellow Perch average size was moderate (0.25 pounds and 8.0 inches) from gillnets. The historical average length is 8.0 inches from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches plus) Yellow Perch was high (35.00 fish/gillnet). The largest Yellow Perch captured was 11.3 inches in 2022. Yellow Perch growth rates were excellent for ages 1-4. The 2020 and 2021 Yellow Perch year classes comprised 42% and 38% respectively of the 2022 Yellow Perch survey catch. Yellow Perch adults were stocked in April of 2017 (1,050 fish, 150 pounds). It is unknown the extent the last stocking had on the present Yellow Perch population in Tyson. The 2013-14 Yellow Perch year classes responded positively in similar nearby lakes following partial winterkills. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction has been generally insignificant based on previous surveys and analysis for Tyson. The Walleye population is due mostly to fry stockings (83,000 to 287,000 fish per stocking) in Tyson. Walleye fry have been recently stocked into Tyson during 2010-2011, 2013-2014, 2017, 2021-22. Approximately 83,000 Walleye fry were stocked in 2022. Walleye yearlings and adults were stocked in Tyson during 2003 (434 pounds, 1,304 fish), 2020 (250 pounds, 301 fish) and 2021 (100 pounds, 49 adults). <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing survey was last conducted in 2017 to evaluate a spring Walleye fry stocking (169,772 fry). There were abundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" Walleye (125.46 YOY/hour, 5.0 inches average length) captured in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (126.00 YOY/hour, 5.7 inches average length) were also captured in 2014. The highest Tyson YOY Walleye catch rate (378.46 YOY/hour, 4.9 inches average length) occurred in 2008. The Tyson Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 90.36 YOY/hour and 5.9 inches respectively.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were abundant in (16.00 fish/gillnet) 2022 gillnets. Walleye historical average catch rate is 9.42 fish/gillnet for Tyson. The 2022 Walleye average sizes were moderate for gillnets (2.50 pounds and 18.3 inches) and trapnets (2.57 pounds and 18.4 inches). The Walleye historical average weights are 1.60 pounds from gillnets and 1.49 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches plus) Walleye was high (14.00 fish/gillnet). The catch rate of preferred size (20.0 inches plus) Walleye was also high (5.00 fish/gillnet). The largest Walleye captured was 25.20 inches in 2022. Walleye growth rates were good for ages 1-8. The 2017 Walleye year class (fry stocked) comprised 29% of the 2022 Walleye catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Tyson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Tyson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the Southwestern Prairie Outdoors Club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Tyson fishery will be sampled for all fish species in 2027 and in the fall of 2023 for YOY Walleye. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
