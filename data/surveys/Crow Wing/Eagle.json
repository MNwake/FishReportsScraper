Average size was 22.9\" with 25% of the fish above the 22-26\" protected slot.  Voluntary catch and release of these larger northern pike will help maintain a balanced population.  With 50% of the fish below the slot, there are plenty of smaller fish for harvesting. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes have not been stocked in Eagle Lake since 2003 due to low survival.  Three Walleyes were sampled in this survey, ranging in length from 13.6\" to 15.6\".  These fish may have arrived through the Daggett Brook since Walleyes are stocked upstream in Mitchell Lake, and also downstream in the Whitefish Chain.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by a night electrofishing survey at a rate of 57.8/hour.  Average size was nice at 14.1\".  With fish ranging from 6.8\" to 19.1\".  Largemouth Bass over 15\" accounted for 40% of the catch.  One 17.8\" Smallmouth Bass was also sampled. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers looked like they could offer some decent fishing.  Black Crappie numbers were above average (7.1/gill net) for this type of lake.  Average length was 7.9\", with 58% measuring 8\" or longer.  Bluegill numbers were average (16.2/trap net).  Average size was that great at 5.6\" and 16% measuring 7\" or greater. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Eagle Lake, but they are located in the local area.  Before and after launching, lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

Two profiles were collected due to the size and complexity of the lake (i.e., Water Quality Station 1 and 2).  Based on the average of the two profiles, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 13 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 18.9 feet in Water Quality Station 1 (WQ 1), and 15.8 feet in WQ 2, both of which were within the thermocline at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L in WQ 1 (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 14.0?C (57.2?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>             <br> \nEagle is a 358 acre lake located six miles north of Fifty Lakes in Crow Wing County. The lake is 36 feet deep and about 53% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth. Water clarity is above average for this area.  Residential development is moderate, with the west shore of the main basin remaining almost development free.  A diverse aquatic plant community is present, providing important habitat for fish and other aquatic species, as well as helping to maintain water quality and providing enhanced stability to the lake's shoreline zone.  <br> \n Walleyes were stocked with some regularity in the past, but historically the survival rate has been low and past surveys have indicated a very low population of walleyes present.  Stocking was discontinued after the 2000 stocking.  No walleyes were sampled in 2003 survey, and only two fish were observed in the 2009 survey.  Northern pike catch rate of 6.8/gill net in 2009 is comparable to catch rates in the past for this lake.  They ranged in size from 15.5 to 35.2 inches, and averaged 22.0 inches in 2009.  <br> \n Smallmouth and largemouth bass were both sampled in of 2009. Smallmouth bass were observed in low numbers, with only one fish present in the gill nets and two by spring electro fishing for bass.  This is similar to past surveys with only a few smallmouth bass captured.  Largemouth bass numbers captured by netting were considered to be average for this lake class. Spring electro fishing catch rate for largemouth bass was high at 86.2 fish per hour. Bass that were captured by electro fishing ranged from 5.2-18.8 inches and averaged 12.9 inches, with 60% at least 12 inches or more in length.  <br> \nBluegills were observed in moderate numbers with an average size of 5.2 inches and 19% were 7.0 inches or greater. Black crappies were most abundant in the gill net sample. Size ranged from 4.6-9.3 inches. Crappie growth rate was good. The catch rate observed was low and may not indicate the real status of the crappie population present, for this species at times is hard to net.  This lake has a history of good crappie fishing for moderate size fish. <br> \nTullibees were present in all of the past surveys, but were absent in 2009. This follows a common trend of tullibee catch rates declining in many lakes in recent years. The warmer summers this last ten years has had an effect on populations.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 358 acre lake located six miles north of Fifty Lakes in Crow Wing County.  The lake reaches depth of 36 feet, with 53% 15 feet deep or less.  Water clarity was good with an average Secchi disk reading of 11.8 feet.  A public access is located on the southeast shore of the eastern basin.  Large beds of bulrush and water lilies surround parts of the lakeshore.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes have not been stocked in Eagle Lake since 2003 due to low survival.  Four walleyes were sampled in this survey.  These fish may have arrived through the Daggett Brook.  Since walleyes are stocked upstream in Mitchell Lake, and also downstream in the Whitefish Chain.  The walleyes sampled were nice size, with an average length of 22.4\".  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured in above average numbers at 9.2/ gillnet.  Average size was 22.3\" and 2.5lbs.  Northern pike measuring at least 24\" in length made up 22% of the catch, with fish up to 37.6\" sampled.  Voluntary catch and release of these larger northern pike will help maintain a balanced population.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 43.3/hr of run time.  Average size was nice at 14.9\".  Largemouth bass over 15\" accounted for 49% of the catch.  In addition one smallmouth bass was also sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were caught in average numbers in both gillnets and trapnets.  Some decent crappies are available to anglers, with 72% being at least 8\" in length.  Bluegills were also sampled in average numbers in trapnets, with bluegills at least 7\" in length accounting for 48% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Eagle Lake, but they are located in the local area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 350 acre lake, with a maximum depth of 36', located six miles north of Fifty Lakes in Crow Wing County.  Eagle is in the Pine River Watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on August 22-23, 2022, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 3 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 2 stations.  Soft bottom and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at the other 5 sampling sites.  Twenty one species were sampled, including 10 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass and Smallmouth Bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on June 21-24, 2021, to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle is a 358 acre lake located six miles north of Fifty Lakes in Crow Wing County.  The lake is 36 feet deep and about 53% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Water clarity is above average for this area.  Residential development is moderate (10 homes/cabins per shoreline mile in 1995), and scattered around much of the shoreline.  A diverse aquatic plant community is present, providing important habitat for fish and other aquatic species, as well as helping to maintain water quality and providing enhanced stability to the lake's shoreline zone.Eagle Lake also has a fairly diverse fish population.  Walleyes have been stocked with some regularity in the past, most recently as spring fry stockings.  Walleyes were not sampled in 2003.  Northern pike numbers have been increasing over the past three nettings.  The 2003 catch was high (13.0/gill net) compared to similar type lakes, and at an all-time high for Eagle Lake.  Size averaged 22 inches and 2.6 pounds and growth was good.Both smallmouth and largemouth bass were sampled in 2003.  Smallmouth bass had been absent from the catch since the 1985 netting.  Abundance was \"average\" compared to similar type lakes.  Largemouth bass were also sampled in numbers considered to be \"average\" for this lake class.  Spring electrofishing was done for the first time in 2003 to sample bass.  The catch rate for largemouth bass was 121.5 fish per hour of electrofishing, among the highest catch rates for the management area.  Bass ranged from 5.7-18.9 inches and averaged 11.5 inches.  Roughly 45% of the catch was 12 inches or more in length.  Growth bordered on slow.The bluegill catch was in the \"average\" category and nearly triple the 1995 catch rate.  Size ranged from 3.0-7.8 inches and roughly 14% were at least 7.0 inches long.  The growth rate was good.  Black crappies were most abundant in the gill net sample.  Size ranged from 5.1-9.8 inches and 38% were at least 8 inches long.  Crappie growths good.Yellow perch and tullibees are important forage species for gamefish in Eagle Lake.
