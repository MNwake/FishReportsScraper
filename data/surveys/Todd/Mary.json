                "narrative": "<p>Mary Lake is a long, narrow, lightly developed lake on the Todd and Stearns County line.  The lake has a rapid dropoff around most of the shore except the south end which is shallow and weedy.  Water clarity was excellent for the middle of July with a secchi disk reading of 16 feet.  Mary Lake receives heavy fishing pressure for panfish and walleye.     Two of Mary Lake's fish population displayed some negative changes since the 1994 survey.  Northern pike abundance increased while yellow perch abundance went down.  Pike abundance has reached a record high for the lake which could have a negative impact on several of the other fish populations.  Along with the increased numbers, the quality of the pike has shown a declined.  The number of northern pike over 24 inches in length stayed the same but made up less of the sample in 2000 than in 1994.  Average size of the pike seen in the summer survey was about 22 inches or 2 1/2 pounds.     Walleye numbers in 2000 were comparable to those seen in 1994 with a varity of sizes available to anglers.  Fish sampled in the survey ranged from 12 to 28 inches in length with an average size of 19 inches or 3 pounds.  Anglers reported good walleye fishing in June prior to the survey.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in Mary Lake every other year to supplement the natural reproduction that occurs.     Mary Lake has an abundant largemouth bass population.  While the average size seen in the spring electrofishing was only 10 inches, quality bass up to almost 21 inches were documented.  A strong year class, 1997, could provide good fishing in the future.  With the lake's abundant shoreline, the lake appears well suited to this species.     While abundance of yellow perch remains within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes, numbers have declined significantly since 1994.  The perch decline may have resulted from the increased norther pike population.  Perch can be an important food fish for many of the fish species in Mary Lake, especially walleye and northern pike.  Yellow perch can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.     Bluegills are a much sought after species on Mary Lake.  Despite their high abundance, quality fish can be found due to good growth.  The majority of the bluegills observed were medium size, between 5 1/2 and 6 inches in length.  Bluegills up to 8 1/2 inches were observed in a spring assessment targetting panfish.     Most of the black crappies seen in the 2000 sampling efforts were between 9 and 10 inches in length.  Crappies just over 10 inches were the largest size observed in the surveys.  Mary Lake had a reputation of producing catches of quality crappies in the past though our efforts failed to sample large fish.       Other species available to anglers include black bullheads, bowfin or dogfish, brown bullheads, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, white suckers, and yellow bullheads.  Quality bullheads can be found in both the brown and yellow bullhead populations with fish exceeding 11 inches in length available in both species.       Neascus or black spot was common on the yellow perch.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested.     Even though northern pike have increased in abundance, quality fish still appear to be available in most of the species.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest northern pike under 24 inches in length and release the bigger ones to achieve a more balanced fish community in the lake.  Keeping small pike can also reduce predation on the yellow perch, largemouth bass, and juvenile walleye.  Protecting the water of Mary Lake should be a high priorty of landowners around the lake.  The lake is in an agricultural watershed and livestock are allowed down to the lake.  Buffer strips and fencing of livestock should be promoted to reduce nutrient run-off into the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mary Lake (DOW# 77-0019-00; Lake Class 34) is a 129 acre lake located near Upsala, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the northeast shore. Mary Lake has 4.52 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 58 feet. Lake is in Lake Class 34; lakes in this class are generally have a high amount of water less than 15 feet deep, turbid, and are a very irregular shape. <br> \n <br> \nMary Lake is a unique lake in the Little Falls area. Growth of almost all species is faster than a majority of lakes. This was not reflected in the maximum size of fish sampled, however this can change quickly with fast growth. Northern Pike have the greatest trophy potential in Mary Lake. A quarter of the pike caught were larger than 24 inches, with pike up to 32 inches. A large year class of Black Crappie were observed. While currently they are small, they should provide a good fishery fairly soon. In addition to pike and crappie, Largemouth Bass and Bluegill are important species to the Mary Lake fishery. Numbers of both are fairly high, but anglers will have to work to find larger fish.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Walleye, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Fish harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS) can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Mary Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Panfish are an important component of Mary Lake's fish community and highly sought by anglers.  A panfish assessment was conducted in late-May targeting bluegill and black crappie.  Six lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice.   One of the nets was moved to a new location after the first lift in an attempt to improve the catch.  All fish were identified and most were measured.  Scales were taken from bluegill and crappie for age and growth data.  Similar panfish assessments were also conducted in 2006 and 2000.  A scheduled population assessment using only gill nets was conducted in early-July of 2012. <br> \n      A total of 361 bluegill were netted in the 2012 panfish assessment which was considerably fewer than the 1,122 caught in 2006 and the 1,497 in 2000, although the 2000 assessment had 18 net lifts.  Bluegill in the 2012 assessment ranged from 3.2 to 8.2 inches in length with a mean length of 6 inches.  The 2012 assessment had the highest portion of fish over both seven and eight inches of the three assessments with 23% (n=84) exceeding seven inches and 3% (n=11) more than eight inches.  Results from 2012 met the lake management goal of having at least 15% of the spring bluegill catch more than seven inches in length.   <br> \n     Ages 2 through 6 were represented in the 2012 panfish assessment.   All age groups displayed fast growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  The majority of the fish were from either the 2009 (39%) or 2008 year class (30%).   <br> \n      In the 2006 panfish assessment, the bluegill measured from 3.2 to 8.2 inches with a mean length of 5.8 inches.  Thirteen percent (n=144) were more than seven inches with 0.2% exceeding eight inches in length.  The 2000 assessment captured bluegill between 2.9 and 8.5 inches in length with a mean length of 6 inches.  Fish exceeding seven inches comprised 13% (n=190) of the catch with 1% (n=18) more than eight inches in length. <br> \n       Bluegill were also sampled in the 2012 summer gill nets.  Eighty-eight bluegill were netted that ranged from 3.7 to 8.2 inches in length.  Mean length for the catch was 6.1 inches and modal length 7 - 7.5 inches.  Thirty percent (n=26) of the fish were more than seven inches in length with only one individual (1%) exceeding eight inches.  <br> \n      The black crappie spring trap net catch was the same in both 2012 and 2006 at 74 fish.  The 2000 assessment captured 47 crappie and the size structure was more desirable.  In 2000, crappie up to 10.4 inches were caught and mean length was 9.2 inches.  The majority of the fish (81%; n=38) were more than nine inches in length with 6% (n=3) exceeding ten inches.   While the 2006 assessment also measured crappie up to 10.4 inches, the mean length was only 6.4 inches.  Fish over nine inches accounted for 9% (n=9) of the sample with 3% (n=2) more than ten inches.  In the 2012 spring assessment, the largest crappie was 9.8 inches, but the mean length was slightly up from 2006 at 7.3 inches.  Small fish dominated the catch with only 3% (n=2) exceeding nine inches and an absence of crappie over ten inches.  Results from the last two crappie catches have fallen far short of the lake management goal of having at least 50% of the spring trap net catch exceed nine inches. <br> \n        Ages 2 through 5 were represented in the 2012 panfish assessment.  All age groups showed normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  A dominant year class from 2009 accounted for 72% of the sample and the low mean size; length frequency dominated by sub nine inch fish.  <br> \n        Five crappie were caught in the 2012 summer gill nets and all of the fish were less than nine inches in length.  The 0.8/GN catch rate was equal to the 25% quartile level for lake class 34. <br> \n        Also sampled in the 2012 panfish assessment were eight walleye between 21 and 29 inches in length, one 26-inch northern pike, and four largemouth bass ranging from 5 to 18.6 inches.   Other fish species caught included bowfin, brown bullhead, common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Carp and green sunfish were not sampled in the 2012 summer gill nets while white sucker were one species caught in the summer gill nets and not in the spring trap nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Mary Lake is a long, narrow, lightly developed lake on the Todd and Stearns County line.  The lake has a rapid drop-off around most of the shore except for the south end which is shallow and weedy.  Water clarity was excellent for early July with a secchi disk reading of 14.5 feet.   Submergent vegetation was found to grow to a depth of 14 feet with coontail being the most common specie.  Filamentous algae was also common on the submerged vegetation.  Sand and marl were the most common shoal water substrates.  Mary Lake receives heavy fishing pressure for panfish and walleye.  The fisheries management focus is on walleye, northern pike, and bluegill.\n    Several species in the fish community showed some significant changes from the last survey in 2000.  Despite regular stocking, walleye abundance appears to be its lowest level since the stocking program began on the lake.  All of the walleye caught in the survey were over 20 inches in length which is good for an angler who catches one but could indicate that juvenile walleye survival is poor.  However, a spring assessment conducted for panfish did catch some walleye between 10 and  13 inches in length suggesting some survival from stocking.  Northern pike abundance also went down since the last survey which may have a beneficial effect on the entire fish community.  Having lower pike numbers decreases predation on the yellow perch and juvenile largemouth bass and walleye.  The size structure of the pike population also showed an improvement from the last survey with more of the pike in the survey being over 24 inches than under.  \n     Yellow perch numbers showed significant decreases in the last two surveys and appear to be at their lowest abundance ever in the lake.  It is desirable to have an abundant perch population as perch can be an important prey species for both northern pike and walleye.  They have also been found to be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population of fast growing, quality individuals.  \n     Largemouth bass abundance appears normal when compared to similar type lakes.  While all of the bass caught in the summer survey were under 14 inches in length, previous surveys have documented bass up to 21 inches indicating that the lake can produce trophy size fish.  Bluegills are a much sought after species on the lake so a spring assessment was conducted to evaluate the adult population.  Average size seen in the assessment was almost 6 inches which was better than most lakes.  A fair number of the bluegills exceeded 7 inches with some up to 8 inches measured.  Black crappies provide more of a winter fishery on the lake.  The size structure of the crappie catch from the spring assessment was not that impressive.  While there were a couple of crappies over 10 inches in length, most of the fish were under 6 inches which should provide good fishing in a couple of years.\nMary Lake also supports populations of pumpkinseeds and hybrid sunfish.\n     Other species available to anglers include bowfin or dogfish and white suckers.  The spring assessment also caught some brown and yellow bullheads.\n     Protecting and improving the water quality of Mary Lake should be a priority of the landowners around the lake.  The lake lies in an agricultural watershed and livestock are allowed down to the lake.  Buffer strips along the lakeshore and inlets as well as fencing out the livestock should be promoted to reduce nutrient run-off into the lake.  The Minnesota Control Agency and Todd County Planning and Zoning Office in Long Prairie have good websites which provide information for shoreline property owners.\n\nMPCA - \"Guide to Lake Protection & Management\"\n   www.pca.state.mn.us/water/lakeprotection.html\n\nTodd County - \"Information for Shoreline Property Owners\"\n   www.co.todd.mn.us/PlanningZoning/planning.htm</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mary Lake is a 129 acre bass/panfish lake located near Upsala, MN.    A five (5) fish bag limit on sunfish is scheduled for implementation on March 1, 2021 as Mary Lake has been selected for participation in the statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  The lower bag limit is intended to reduce the harvest of sunfish while improving the sizes of sunfish available to anglers.  The goal is to have the lake produce more 7 to 9 inch sunfish which are most desired by anglers.  Evaluations of lakes that have had similar reduced bag limits for several years have shown that most respond favorably and produce larger sunfish.  Daytime electrofishing was performed on June 16, 2020 to provide pre-regulation data on the Bluegill size structure.  Spring trap netting is the preferred method for evaluating Bluegill populations, however electrofishing was employed due to staff/time shortages resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.  Future evaluations relating to the 5 sunfish bag limit will incorporate trap netting to provide proper comparisons. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing appeared to be an efficient sampling method with 201 fish captured in just over an hour of on-time.  Bluegill appeared to be concentrated in spawning areas but some were also dispersed.  The catch was dominated by fish in the 6.0-6.99 inch range which comprised 79% of the sample.  Quality size Bluegill were poorly represented with the largest individual measuring 7.3 inches and only 6% of the fish exceeding 7 inches.  No aging structures were collected as otoliths were extracted from trap netted Bluegill in 2017.  Mary Lake Bluegills displayed good growth with 5 year old fish averaging 7.45 inches.  Previous spring trap net surveys were conducted in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2017.  Trap nets have provided large sample sizes often in excess of 1000 fish and individuals exceeding 8 inches were present in all efforts though 9 inch fish have not been observed.  Bluegill exceeding 7 inches made up 13-23% of past spring trap net samples. <br> \n <br> \nWhile fishing for sunfish it is best to limit your take of the large individuals, especially the males.  The large males exhibit the best growth rates and also inhibit smaller and slower growing males from spawning.  Studies have shown that it is important for sunfish to use their resources for growth instead of reproduction at younger ages and smaller sizes.  Male Bluegill can usually be discerned from females by their brighter coloration and darker orange bellies. <br> \n <br> \nSmall Black Crappie were noticeably abundant during the electrofishing effort and a subsample was collected to document the sizes present.  A total of 19 crappie were measured with 16 of the fish in the 6-7.5 inch range possibly indicative of a large year class.  The largest crappie sampled was just under 10 inches.  Three juvenile Walleye were netted and measured ranging in length from 5.7-6.1 inches suggesting they were cohorts from a recent fingerling stocking in 2019.  A handful of additional yearling Walleye were observed but not captured.  Largemouth Bass were observed in good numbers but not netted as they were not a target species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in Mary Lake has undergone several positive changessince the last assessment in 1989.  The 1994 lake survey suggested an excellentbalance between predators and prey lending to normal to fast growth rates andexcellent size structure for most species.     Yellow perch abundance has increased significantly and provides anexcellent prey base for healthy northern pike and largemouth bass populations. Perch also prey on young sunfish helping to limit sunfish numbers and deterstunting.     Northern pike numbers increased significantly but still remain within thenormal range for lakes similar to Mary.  It is important that pike abundance notexceed the normal range or prey populations could decline and lead to stuntingof predatory gamefish.  Northerns appear to have responded to the increasedyellow perch prey base with excellent growth rates and size structure.  Anglersseeking quality sized northerns should have a satisfying experience on MaryLake.     The largemouth bass population appears to be high in Mary Lake.  Anglersencountered on the lake reported high catch rates with quality fish caught on aregular basis.  With its abundant shoreline, the lake appears well suited tothis species.     The walleye catch declined significantly since 1989, suggesting stockingsuccess has been inconsistent.  Walleyes from non-stocked years accounted forhalf the gillnet sample.  Angler reports claim good walleye fishing has occurredin the past.  The present fish community structure is conducive to good survivalof natural and stocked walleye fingerlings.     Bluegill numbers are high on Mary Lake.  Many anglers seeking sunfish wereobserved during the survey.  Examination of their catch revealed mainly smallfish.  This was surprising since a substantial proportion of the lake surveysample exceeded 7 inches in length.  Anglers should probably target largersunfish in deeper water.     Mary Lake also has a reputation for producing excellent catches of qualityblack crappies.  The north end of the lake reportedly provides anglingopportunities in spring.  The survey sampled individuals to 11 inches.     Mary Lake is an excellent choice for anglers seeking quality sized northernpike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.  High prey abundance helpsto maintain this situation.  Future management will focus on sustaining ahealthy balance between predator and prey populations.  Minimizing the impactsof land use practices (agriculture, livestock pasturing) within the lakeswatershed will also be important in maintaining desirable water quality andhabitat conditions.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Trap netting was performed May 19-21 to provide pre-regulation data on the Bluegill size structure.   A 5 fish bag limit on sunfish was implemented on March 1, 2021, as Mary Lake was selected for participation in the statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  Information collected during this survey is considered pre-regulation data due to the short time period since the inception of the reduced bag limit. Spring trap netting is the preferred method for evaluating panfish populations and has been conducted on the lake four previous times since 2000.  Several future evaluations relating to the 5 sunfish bag limit are planned over the 10 year evaluation period and will incorporate spring trap netting to provide proper comparisons. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting in 2021 captured 493 Bluegill.   Bluegill in 2021 ranged from 3.4 - 8.35 inches and mean length was 6.03 inches.  Fish over 7 inches comprised 39% of the catch and fish greater than 8 inches made up just 0.2% of the sample.  Fish 8 inches or longer have never made up more than 3% of spring samples and Bluegill 9 inches or greater have not been observed in any spring trap net efforts.  Bluegill grow well in Mary Lake reaching 7.5 inches by Age 5 but few fish appear to exceed six years of age.  The objective of the reduced sunfish bag limit is to curtail harvest of sunfish so that more reach greater ages and larger sizes.   Bluegill size structure goals developed for the Quality Sunfish Initiative aim for at least 35% of the sample to exceed 7 inches, 10% to exceed 8 inches and 2% over 9 inches.   Whether voluntary or required due to the reduced bag limit, release of larger sunfish, especially fish over 8 inches will be important if the lake is to realize its potential in reaching management goals.  Additional criteria that may be used to measure success of the reduced sunfish bag limit include: mean size, catch rate of fish over 8 inches, and mean length of top 10% of fish.  When combining the five pre-regulation spring trap net surveys mean size is 5.85 inches, mean catch rate of fish over 8 inches is 1/net, and mean length of the top 10% is 7.60 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap nets produced a large catch of Black Crappie totaling 803 fish.  Small crappie dominated the sample, as a strong year class was generated in 2015.  The 2021 Black Crappie ranged from 4.8 to 10.8 inches in length and mean length was 6.99 inches.  Fish 10 inches or longer have never comprised a major portion of the spring catches.  Only 1 crappie over 10 inches was measured in 2021 and fish over 11 inches have never been observed in spring trap nets.  Aging in 2021 showed the 2015 year class continued to comprise a significant proportion of the population.  The 2015 year class exhibited poor growth attaining a mean length of 7.22 inches at Age 6.  The currently poor growth is a new factor as all previous information suggested normal growth rates in the past.  The slow growth is likely due to the exceptionally high abundance.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest crappie from Mary Lake to reduce the population and improve growth.  The crappie bag limit remains at 10 fish.  Recruitment has been sporadic recently as Ages 2 and 6 made up the entire catch with the exception of a single Age 10 individual.   <br> \n     <br> \nFour Northern Pike were caught, three of which exceeded 29 inches and the largest measuring 33.2 inches.  Some Yellow Perch in excess of 8 inches were also observed and may be of interest to anglers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey using six gill nets and nine standard trap nets was completed on Mary Lake during the week of July 3, 2023. Two targeted trap nets were set in mid-May to assess impacts from a suspected winterkill. Catch results confirmed the occurrence of a partial but significant winterkill. Species captured included bullheads (mostly Black), Black Crappie (many), Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Bowfin. Large numbers of dead sunfish, carp, bass, Walleye, and crappie were observed. The evidence suggests that the fish kill likely eliminated (Walleye) and severely depressed bass and sunfish populations. Electrofishing earlier in the spring indicated the presence of live Largemouth Bass and Bluegill though in small numbers. Walleye fingerlings were stocked in the fall of 2023. Conditions may be ideal for Walleye fingerling survival due to reduced pike abundance and competition from other fish species. <br> \n <br> \nMary Lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Northern Pike and secondarily for Walleye, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass. Gill netting captured a total of six species with Black Bullheads and Northern Pike the most common species captured. Other species captured included Black Crappie, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets caught a total of eight species, the most common of which were Bluegills. Although numbers were lower they were still within the range we'd expect to see in a lake like Mary. Mary Lake was selected for inclusion in the statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative (QSI) which attempts to protect and/or enhance the quality of sunfish fisheries. While uncommon for Mary Lake, the recent winterkill unfortunately set back progress at achieving a better Bluegill fishery.  Growth rates are very good though, and we expect the fishery to rebound quickly. Species other than Bluegill that were caught in trap nets included Bowfin, Green Sunfish, Hybrid sunfish, and Pumpkinseed.   <br> \n <br> \nMary Lake's fishery prior to the 2023 winterkill can be characterized as supporting an abundance of small pike and a low-density Walleye population as evidenced by the 2017 survey. Pike over 30 inches continue to reside in Mary Lake. Black Crappie and Bluegill were abundant, with Bluegill showing high rates of growth but only small to average size-quality. Crappie growth rates were poor presumably due to a high density population. Hopefully crappie growth rates improve with the lowered abundance resulting from the winterkill. The Largemouth Bass population was considered good with multiple year classes present. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    A special trapnet assessment was conducted on Mary Lake in early June to evaluate the panfish population which provides an important fishery on the lake.  A lake survey was conducted on the lake in early July using only gillnets to assess the gamefish population.  Six lake survey trapnets were used in the panfish assessment over a three day period for a total of 11 lifts.  One of the nets was tampered with on the last day and not counted.  All of the gamefish and black crappies were measured while a subsample of the bluegills was measured due to the large sample size.  The other fish species were identified and counted.  Scales were taken from the crappies and bluegills for age and growth data.  <br> \n     The spring trapnetting was very efficient at catching bluegills.  A total of 1,122 bluegills were sampled over the netting period in 2006 for catch rate of 102/trapnet.  The fish ranged in size from 3.2 - 8.2 inches in length a modal length of 6 - 6.5 inches, mean length of 5.8 inches, and 14% (n=152) of the fish exceeding 7 inches in length.  The lake management  goal is to have a spring trapnet catch where at least 15% of the bluegills caught exceed 7 inches in length.  A similar special assessment was conducted during the same time period in 2000 with similar results.  Almost 1500 bluegills were sampled in the assessment producing a catch rate of 83/trapnet.  The fish measured from 2.9 - 8.5 inches in length.  Modal length for the catch was 5 - 5.5 inches which was smaller than in 2006 but the mean size was 6 inches and 13% (n=190) of the catch were more than 7 inches in length.  Trapnets were used in the 2000 summer lake survey.  The nets caught 945 bluegills for a catch rate of 105/set which was more than twice the upper quartile level of 43.3/TN for the lake class.  Fish in the sample measured between 3 and 8 inches in length.  Modal length for the subsample was 6 - 6.5 inches, mean length 5.5 inches, and 6% more than 7 inches in length.  Ages 3 - 11 were represented in the 2006 spring assessment with all of the age groups displaying normal growth.  Year class strengths suggest consistent recruitment. <br> \n     Seventy-four (74) black crappies were caught in the 2006 panfish assessment.  The fish measured from 3.6 - 10.4 inches in length with only 9% (n=7) of the crappies exceeding inches which was far below the lake managaement goal of 75% of the spring crappie catch more than 9 inches in length.  Modal length for the 2006 sample was 5.5 - 6 inches with a mean length of 6.4 inches which was the result of a strong 2004 year class.  Ages 1 thru 6 were represented in the 2006 assessment.  The 2000 panfish assessment suggested a different size structure in the crappie population at that time and was more desirable.  While the biggest crappie measured was only 10.4 inches, 81% (n=38) of the fish were over 9 inches in length.  Modal length for the catch was 9 - 9.5 inches and mean length was 9.2 inches.  Ages 1 - 6 were represented in the 2006 spring assessment with Age 1 crappies displaying fast growth with the remaining age groups showing normal growth.  The 2004 year class dominated the catch, comprising 44% of the sample with the 2003 year class accounting for 24%. <br> \n      Other fish species that were caught in the 2006 panfish assessment included 6 walleye between 10 and 28 inches, 2 northern pike between 18 and 21 inches, 10 largemouth bass from 5 to 18 inches in length, bowfin, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Panfish in Mary Lake provide an important fishery in the area and spring trapnetting has proven to be an effective method of evaluating the populations in the lake. <br> \n   An Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table was used to compare growth rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Mary Lake is a long, narrow, lightly developed lake on the Todd and Stearns County line.  Fishing structure includes a rapid drop-off around most of the shore, weed lines, lots of woody cover, and a shallow, weedy bay on the south end.   Mary Lake receives heavy fishing pressure for panfish and walleye and more recently bowfishing for carp.  The fisheries management focus is on walleye, northern pike, and bluegill. <br> \n    Walleye abundance appears normal when compared to similar type lakes.  While most of the walleye caught in the survey were over 20 inches in length, smaller ones between 10 and 12 inches were captured in the spring electrofishing.     Northern pike abundance has increased since the last survey in 2006 which may have a detrimental effect on the entire fish community.  Having lower pike numbers decreases predation on the yellow perch and juvenile largemouth bass and walleye.  Even though numbers have gone up, the average size was good at just under three pounds or 22 inches.     <br> \n     Yellow perch numbers went up slightly after showing declines in the last two surveys.   Having higher perch numbers is desirable as they can be an important prey species for both northern pike and walleye.  Perch have also been found to be instrumental in helping maintain a well-balanced, bluegill population of fast growing, quality size individuals.   <br> \n     Mary Lake has an abundant largemouth bass population that is dominated by small fish.  Average length in the spring electrofishing catch was 8 inches due a strong year class produced in 2010.  The lake can produce trophy size bass though as fish up to 19 inches were also observed in the electrofishing.  Bluegills are a much sought after species on the lake so a spring assessment was conducted to evaluate the adult population.  Average size observed in the assessment was 6 inches which was better than most lakes.  A fair number of the bluegills exceeded 7 inches with some up to almost 9 inches measured.  Black crappies provide more of a winter fishery on the lake.  The size structure of the crappie catch from the spring assessment was not that impressive.  While there were a couple of crappies over 9 inches in length observed, most of the fish were between 7 and 8 which could provide good fishing by next year.   Mary Lake also supports populations of pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n     Other species available to anglers include bowfin or dogfish and white suckers.  All three bullhead species, black, brown, and yellow are present in the lake.  Brown bullheads were only caught in the spring panfish assessment.  Some quality size bullhead up to 13 inches in length were observed in the yellow bullhead catch. <br> \n     Protecting and improving the water quality of Mary Lake should be a priority of the landowners around the lake.  The lake lies in an agricultural watershed and livestock use the lake directly for watering.  Buffer strips along the lakeshore and inlets as well as fencing out the livestock should be promoted to reduce nutrient run-off into the lake.   <br> \n</p>",
