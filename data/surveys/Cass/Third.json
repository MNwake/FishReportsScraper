Growth was good at all ages.  Three walleye were caught for a rate of 1.50/lift.  They were all larger fish (17, 22, and 23 inches).  The fish between Third and Long Lake (adjoining lake) that were aged showed good growth.Bluegill abundance was 20.75/trapnet lift.  They ranged in length from 3 to 8 inches, with a modal length group of 7.0-7.4 inches.  The PSD=52, with an RSD-7=27.  The growth was slow for all ages.  There were a significant number of hybrid sunfish which were some of the largest sunfish in the survey.The catch rate for black crappie was 2.00/trapnet lift, where they ranged in length from 5 to 10.5 inches, with a mode of 8.0-8.4 inches.  The growth was good the first year, then slow after that.Two largemouth bass were caught (6 and 7.5 inches).  Growth was slow.No stocking has occured in the last 10 years.</p>",
