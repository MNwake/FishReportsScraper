                "narrative": "<p>Range Lake is located approximately 10 miles N of Ely in the BWCAW. Aquatic vegetation is common around the periphery of the lake especially on the south and west sides. A distinctive high ridge characterizes the north side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe most common access is by portage from the end of the Cloquet Line, an abandoned railroad grade that runs north from the city of Winton. There is one designated USFS campsite located on the north side. <br> \n <br> \nSeven species of fish were sampled using gill nets during the 2015 survey. Yellow perch, northern pike, largemouth bass and black crappie were sampled in numbers slightly above average compared to other similar lakes in the area. Lower numbers of bluegill, white sucker and walleye were also sampled. It is likely that the panfish population is larger than the gill net results indicated, particularly bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2015 (10.0/gill net) were slightly below the long term average for all surveys on this lake. Perch averaged 5.8 inches and the largest perch sampled was 8.1 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in 2015 (5.8/gill net) is similar compared to past surveys on this lake. Pike lengths averaged 22.3 inches and the largest pike sampled was a respectable 32.7 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance in 2015 (2.3/gill net) was higher than the long term average for this lake. Largemouth averaged 14.1 inches long and about 6 years old. The largest bass sampled was 18.1 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in 2015 (5.5/gill net) were slightly below the long term average for this lake. Crappie lengths averaged 7.2 inches and the largest crappie sampled was 10.4 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 2015 (3.3/gill net) was slightly higher than the long term average for this lake. Bluegill averaged 6.6 inches long and about 5 years old. The largest bluegill sampled was 9.0 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOne 20.6 inch walleye was sampled. Nine white sucker from 15.4 inches to 19.7 inches long were also sampled. <br> \n <br> \n </p>",
