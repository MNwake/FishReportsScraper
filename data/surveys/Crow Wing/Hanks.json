                "narrative": "<p>Hanks is a 161 acre lake which is located about six miles northwest of Garrison.  It is a hardwater lake with good fertility and good water clarity for the area.  About 30% of the lake is shallower than fifteen feet.  Shallow water soils are primarily sand, gravel and rubble sized rock.  The aquatic plants which are present provide important spawning habitat for bass and panfish species as well as feeding areas and protection from predators.Northern pike was the most abundant gamefish in 1994 and was present in \"high\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  Northern pike were aged 2-4 and most were age 3.  Growth was good and average size was 2.0 lbs., an improvement over previous nettings.  Excellent northern pike spawning habitat is present in Rice Lake, which is connected to Portage Lake, immediately upstream from Hanks in the lake chain.  Other game species in the lake included largemouth bass and walleyes, both of which were caught in \"low\" numbers in 1994.Bluegills were caught in \"average\" numbers in '94 but were found in \"high\" numbers in previous nettings.  Bluegills were aged 3-7 in '94 and were slow growing.  About 6% were 7.0 inches or more in length.  Pumpkinseeds were found in \"low\" numbers.  Rock bass were caught in \"high\" numbers and black crappies in \"average\" numbers.As in previous nettings, yellow perch abundance was \"low.\"  Tullibees, however, continued to be caught in \"high\" numbers.  The catch of bowfin (dogfish) remained \"high.\"  White suckers, brown bullheads and yellow bullheads were found in \"average\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanks Lake is a 161 acre lake located 5 miles northwest of Garrison in Crow Wing County.  The lake reaches depths of 45', with areas 15' or less making up 30% of the lake.  Water clarity is good with a secchi disk reading of 13'.  Hanks can be reached through a channel from Crooked Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch of 13.5/net was high when compared to similar lakes.  Most northern pike were on the small side with an average length of 19.8\".  A few larger northern pike were present, with 20% at least 24\" in length.  Voluntary catch and release of these few larger fish can help create a more balanced population.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has been attempted in the past but return has been poor and thus walleyes are not currently stocked by the DNR into Hanks.   However, walleyes have been stocked three times since 2008 by the lake association under a DNR permit.  The walleye gillnet catch of 0.3/net was below average when compared to similar lakes.  Average size was nice at 23.0\".  High northern pike and low yellow perch numbers limit successful walleye management. <br> \n <br> \nTulibee (cisco) were sampled in extremely high numbers at 42.8/gillnet.  Average length was 11.0\".  Tulibee (cisco) are an important forage fish for larger northern pike and walleyes.  They can also provide a unique fishing opportunity.   Most fishing for tulibee (cisco) is done through the ice.  <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Hanks Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanks Lake is a 161 acre lake located 5 miles northwest of Garrison in Crow Wing County.  The lake reaches depths of 45', with areas 15' or less making up 30% of the lake.  Water clarity is good with a secchi disk reading of 14'.  Hanks can be reached through a channel from Crooked Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch of 12.3/net was high when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 21.4\", with 16% in the protected 22-26\" slot.  Northern Pike at least 26\" in length made up 24% of the catch.  Voluntary catch and release of these few larger fish can help create a more balanced population.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has been attempted in the past, but return has been poor and thus Walleyes are not currently stocked by the DNR into Hanks.   However, Walleyes are stocked by the lake association under a DNR permit.  The Walleye gill net catch of 1.0/net was below average when compared to similar lakes.  The average length of 27.0\" was impressive, with fish up to 30.9\" sampled.  High Northern Pike and low Yellow Perch numbers limit successful walleye management. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by spring electrofishing at a rate of 160.0/hr run time. Average length was 11.9\", with 44% at least 12\" in length.  Largemouth Bass were sampled in average numbers in gill nets at 0.5/net.  Average length was 13.3\".   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in average numbers in trap nets (2.0/net).  Average length was 8.7\" with 67% at least 8\" in length.  Fish up to 12.9\" were sampled.  Bluegills were sampled in average number at 16.7/trap net.  Average length was 6.2\", with 25% at least 7\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (cisco) were sampled in extremely high numbers at 28.2/gill net.  Average length was 11.4\".  Tullibee (cisco) are an important forage fish for larger Northern Pike and Walleyes.  They can also provide a unique fishing opportunity.   Most fishing for Tullibee (cisco) is done through the ice.  <br> \n <br> \nEurasian Watermilfoil has been discovered in Hanks Lake.  Before and after launching, lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanks Lake is part of the Crooked-Hanks-Portage Chain located in eastern Crow Wing County, approximately 5 miles northwest of Garrison. Access is possible through a channel from Crooked Lake.  Hanks Lake is 45 feet deep, with 30% of the lake less than 15 feet deep.  Water clarity is good with a secchi depth reading of 15 feet. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch was above average at 14.2/gillnet. Northern pike tended to be on the small side with an average of 18.6\" and 1.6 lbs.  There were a few larger individuals present with 8% 24\" or larger and fish up to 35.2 inches.  Growth was normal compared to area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were stocked as fingerlings into the Portage-Crooked-Hanks Chain in 2008 and 2010 by the lake association.  The walleye catch of 0.8/gill net was below average.  The walleyes captured were quite large with an average of 23.7\" and 4.9 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trap net catch of 48.1/net was above average.  Average length was 6.6\", with 38% over 7\" in length.  The black crappie trap net catch of 2.6/net was average for this lake class.  Average length was 8.9\", with 80% of all black crappies captured over 8\" in length.   <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey at a run time rate of 144.0/hr.  Average length was 12.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and tullibee (cisco) are important prey species for walleye and northern pike.  The yellow perch gill net catch of 0.8/net was below the average for this lake class.  In all surveys conducted on Hanks Lake the yellow perch gill net catch has never been over 1.0/net.  The tullibee gill net catch of 17.0/net was well above average.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured in the survey included rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, black bullhead, brown bullhead, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed.  Additional species sampled nearshore during IBI backpack electrofishing and seining included Iowa darter, Johnny darter, bluntnose minnow, banded killifish, blacknose shiner, and tadpole madtom. <br> \n</p>",

These species catch rates exceed the third quartile of the Brainerd area median for similar lakes of less than 230 acres and possessing a total alkalinity of greater than 89 and a maximum depth less than 40.2 feet. Northern pike, brown bullhead and largemouth bass exhibited average populations with net catches between the first and third quartile of the area median for similar lake types. Black crappie, yellow perch and walleye net catches indicate a below average population with catch rates below the first quartile of the area median. Northern cisco population remained high as in previous surveys with a length-frequency range of 6.0 to 16.9 inches and a mean size of 0.75 pounds. The northern pike population has significantly decreased from the previous three survey of 1986, 1984, and 1980. The median size of northern pike was 18.9 inches long and weighed 1.6 pounds. Age classes 3, 4 and 5 were represented in the nets with age classes 3 and 4 comprising 92% of the fish. The growth rate was average in comparison to the statewide average. The yellow perch population history of being almost non-existent in the nets continued. The low perch population emphasizes continued overpopulation of northern pike in the lake chain. The walleye population remained low in 1987.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Hanks Lake was conducted on July 10-11, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine. Nearshore sampling captured nineteen species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Hanks Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Hanks Lake fully supported aquatic life use based on the FIBI. The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bowfin, northern cisco, northern pike, yellow bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed and bluegill net catches indicate above average populations. The catch rates for these species exceed the third quartile of the Brainerd area median for similar lakes of less than 230 acres and a total alkalinity of greater than 89 and a maximum depth of less than 40.2 feet. Largemouth bass, yellow perch and walleye and brown bullhead exhibited average populations with net catches between the first and third quartile of the area median for similar lake types. The yellow perch and walleye populations are taken from trap net catches because there were no gill net catches. Black crappie net catches indicate a below average population with catch rates well below the first quartile of the area median. The northern cisco population stayed high, as in previous surveys, with a length-frequency range of 6.0 to 16.9 inches. The northern pike population increased over the 1987 survey, but was still less than the 1980, 1984 and 1986 surveys. The length-frequency ranged from 13.0 to 23.9 inches with a mean weight of 0.56 lbs. The growth rate was slow in comparison to statewide averages. The yellow perch population still remains almost nonexistent as indicated in the net catches (gill nets 0.0 and trap nets 0.67). The low perch population is a by-product of the overpopulation of northern pike. The walleye population remained low in 1988 (0.0 in the gill nets and 0.33 in the trap nets).</p>",
