                "narrative": "<p>Walleye abundance, indexed with assessment nets, increased in 1993 and 1996.  Although index values were above the median value for lakes of similar type, they are still below historic highs.  Walleye fingerlings stocked in 1990, 1991 and 1993 were not well represented in the distribution of walleye aged in 1996.  The age distribution was dominated (60%) by the 1994 year class.  A base of information on spawning walleye utilizing Apple Creek, and the abundance and size of young-of-the-year walleye associated with shallow areas in the fall is being developed.  Although it is too early to draw conclusions from these efforts, it is hoped that they will be continued.     Results of 1988, 1993 nad 1996 sampling indicate declines in abundance for bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow perch.  Declining trends in panfish abundance may be attributed to:  A moderation after increased vegetative cover triggered population explosions in the late 1970's;  A decline caused by cool climatalogical conditions in the early 1990's;  Or some as-of-yet not understood variable.  Understanding fluctuations in panfish abundance will help the DNR to predict whether current declines are short or long term.     Quality of the Bassett Lake fishery has improved between 1988 and 1996.  Abundance of walleye has increased while abundance of panfish has declined.  Walleye angling opportunity should improve as the strong 1994 year class begins to enter the creel in 1997, while size structure of panfish populations indicate excellent angling opportunities for bluegill and yellow perch.</p>",

While catch rates are still at the median quartile values for this lake class, the percentage of catchable sized fish has also decreased.  The age distribution was dominated by the 1996 year class, which made up 55 percent of the walleye catch but few (12 %) individuals from the well documented strong 1994 year class were sampled.  Northern pike, yellow perch, and bluegill have all declined markedly over the past three assessments.       Bassett Lake still has good populations of walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, and bluegill.  All of these species have catch rates at or above their respective median quartile values for this lake class but the consistent declines in catch rates for all of the above species is troubling.  This may be an artifact of sampling techniques or conditions (high water in 1999), or may be an early indication of increases in angling pressure.</p>",

Walleye is the primary species of management for Bassett Lake and are stocked intermittently on a contingency basis utilizing annual fall Walleye young-of-year (YOY) electrofishing data.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked the year following two consecutive years of YOY electrofishing catch rates below 5 per hour on-time.  Walleye were last stocked into Bassett Lake in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 2.2 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The 2016 represents a historic low catch rate for Walleye in Bassett Lake (previous range, 5.8-28.3).  Walleye average length was large at 18.4 inches.  About 20% of the Walleye gillnet catch exceeded 23 inches in length.  <br> \n    <br> \nBlack Crappie population density was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Black Crappie average length was small at 6.1 inches.  Bluegill population density was above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Bluegill average length was small at 5.6 inches.  Over 92% of the Bluegill captured were less than seven inches in length.  Yellow Perch are very abundant but small in Bassett Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 1.9 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 20.0 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

Walleye is the primary species of management for Bassett Lake and are stocked intermittently on a contingency basis utilizing annual fall Walleye young-of-year (YOY) electrofishing data.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked immediately following three consecutive non-stocked years of YOY electrofishing catch rates below 5 per hour on-time.  Walleye were last stocked into Bassett Lake in 2021. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 8.1 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.    Walleye average length was large at 16.3 inches.  About 83% of the Walleye gillnet catch were between 13 to 18 inches in length. The 2016 and 2019 year-classes look strong. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie population density was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Black Crappie average length was small at 6.4 inches.  Bluegill population density was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Bluegill average length was small at 5.7 inches.  Over 80% of the Bluegill captured were less than seven inches in length.  Largemouth Bass abundance has increased and is above average when compared to similar Minnesota Lakes. Largemouth Bass average length was 13.8 inches with some just over 17 inches. Yellow Perch are very abundant but small in Bassett Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 6.8 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 20.6 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bassett is a 442 acre lake with 196 (44%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 20 feet.  The lake is located 6 miles north of Brimson, Minnesota off Highway #16 and has a Township administered, concrete, back-in access.  Bassett Lake has been actively managed for walleye by stocking one pound of fingerlings per littoral acre every other year from 2001 through 2005.  Stocked walleye fingerlings were marked with a pectoral fin clip. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 7.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye gillnet catch rates from five investigations since 1988 have ranged from 7.0 to 9.3 per lift.  Mean size was 17.5 inches and growth had increased since the last investigation from slow to average.  All year-classes from 1997 through 2004 were represented with strong year-classes in 2001 and 2002.  59% of the total walleye sampled by gillnets were aged to years that walleye were stocked.   <br> \n <br> \nThe pectoral fin of stocked walleye were clipped to help identify them during future investigations.  Volunteers from the Bassett Lake Association completed the task of clipping the walleye in 2001, 2003 and 2005.  Three hundred and ninety nine of the clipped walleye stocked in 2003 were yearlings born in 2002.  A total of 16,520 walleye were clipped.  Of the 34 walleye aged to years that fingerlings were clipped, only 3 (9%) had identifiable clips.  More specifically, 33%, 6% and 7% of the three, four and five year old walleye had a pectoral fin clip.  A total of 14 walleye were sampled during the 2006 fall electrofishing assessment.  None of the sampled walleye were young-of-the-year (YOY) and two were age one, which correlates to a year that 12,700 (7,370 clipped) fingerlings were stocked.  No pectoral fin clips were documented during the fall electrofishing assessment. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 2.9 per gillnet  lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 21.7 inches and growth was average.  The 2003 year-class was strong and no fish older than age five were sampled.  Naturally reproduced YOY northern pike were documented during shoreline seining. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled for the first time in Bassett Lake during the 2006 investigation.  Largemouth bass were documented in samples collected by gillnet, trapnet, shoreline seine and fall electrofishing.  A total of 30 bass were collected during fall electrofishing.  Mean length of sampled bass was 7.8 inches and they were all one year old, with very fast growth. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 2.3 per lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 8.4 inches was large and growth was fast.  The  2003 year-class was strong and no fish older than age five were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBoth yellow perch and bluegill had become much more abundant since the last investigation.  both populations had small average size, slow growth and low fishing potential. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include black bullhead, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, central mudminnow, emerald shiner, pumpkindseed sunfish and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate type and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic vegetation was high with a total of 33 species or species groups identified along 20 transects.  Flatstem pondweed, which was present in 95% of the transects, was the most abundant species identified.  Bushy pondweed, clasping-leaf pondweed, large-leaf pondweed, softstem bulrush, sweetgale, variable-leaf pondweed and white-stem pondweed were present in at least 65% of the transects and had abundance ratings of common.  The most common substrate types were sand and rubble, which were present in 95% and 75% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Bassett is a slightly alkaline, moderately soft-water lake with moderate fertility. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n </p>",

A contingency based Walleye stocking program was initiated in 2012 utilizing annual fall Walleye young-of-the-year (YOY) electrofishing data.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked the year following two consecutive years of YOY electrofishing catch rates below 5 per hour on-time (last stocked in 2019).  Collection of these data is important as an early indicator of Walleye year-class strength for Bassett Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nOne YOY Walleye was captured during the 2021 investigation.  The catch rate of 1.2 per hour of electrofishing was below the contingency threshold, and will trigger a Walleye stocking event for Bassett Lake in 2022.  Catch rates from previous investigations ranged from 0.0 to 57.2 per hour.  Prior mean lengths ranged from 4.8 to 7.2 inches.  Mean length at the end of the first growing season has been strongly correlated to survival to age-1.  The low abundance of YOY Walleye captured suggests a below average naturally reproduced year-class for 2021 is likely.   <br> \n <br> \nZero age-1 Walleye were sampled during the investigation for an electrofishing catch rate of 0.0 per hour.  Catch rates of age-1 Walleye from previous investigations ranged from 0.0 to 50.9 per hour.  Prior average lengths of age-1 Walleye have ranged from 7.4 to 9.9 inches.  The below average abundance of age-1 Walleye captured suggests a poor 2020 Walleye year-class is likely.</p>",

Collection of these data is important as an early indicator of Walleye year-class strength for Bassett Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nOne YOY Walleye was captured during the 2020 investigation.  The catch rate of 1.4 per hour of electrofishing was below the contingency threshold.  Catch rates from previous investigations ranged from 0.0 to 57.2 per hour.  Prior mean lengths ranged from 4.8 to 7.2 inches.  Mean length at the end of the first growing season has been strongly correlated to survival to age-1.  The low abundance of YOY Walleye captured suggests a below average naturally reproduced year-class for 2020 is likely.   <br> \n <br> \nNineteen age-1 Walleye were sampled during the investigation for an electrofishing catch rate of 27.4 per hour.  Catch rates of age-1 Walleye from previous investigations ranged from 0.0 to 50.9 per hour.  Prior average lengths of age-1 Walleye have ranged from 7.4 to 9.9 inches.  The above average abundance of age-1 Walleye captured suggests the establishment of a stocked year-class for 2019 is likely.  </p>",

Bassett Lake YOY and age-one Walleye have been indexed annually with night electrofishing from 1994 through 2017, with the exception of 2001.  A contingency based Walleye stocking program was initiated in 2012 utilizing annual fall Walleye young-of-the-year (YOY) electrofishing data.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked the year following two consecutive years of YOY electrofishing catch rates below 5 per hour on-time (last stocked in 2016).  Collection of these data is important as an early indicator of Walleye year-class strength for Bassett Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nOne YOY Walleye that was 4.4 inches long was captured during the 2018 investigation.  The catch rate was 1.7 per hour of electrofishing and was below the contingency threshold for the second consecutive year, meaning fingerling Walleye stocking will occur during fall, 2019.  Catch rates from previous investigations ranged from 0.0 to 57.2 per hour.  Prior mean lengths have ranged from 4.8 to 6.7 inches.  Mean length at the end of the first growing season has been strongly correlated to survival to age-1.  The low abundance and small size of the YOY Walleye captured suggests a below average naturally reproduced year-class for 2018 is likely.   <br> \n <br> \nThirty-nine age-1 or older Walleye were sampled during the investigation for an electrofishing catch rate of 67.6 per hour.  Otoliths were collected from a subsample of the catch and all were age-2, corresponding to a year when very small fingerling Walleye were stocked into Bassett Lake.  Some of the unaged fish may have been from natural reproduction so age-1 catch rates cannot be reliably calculated.  However, the frequency of extremely small age-2 fish collected suggests that the survival of small fingerlings stocked in 2016 may have been adequate enough to improve year-class strength.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Recruitment of walleye to DNR testnetting gear has declined since 1983.  Possible causes of the decline include increased panfish abundance, increased angler harvest or failure of natural reproduction.  Walleye stocking strategy for Bassett Lake shifted from fry to fingerling 1990 to eliminate negative impacts predation by panfish may have had on stocked walleye fry.  Natural reproduction checks will be conducted in 1994, 1995 and 1996 to quantify recruitment of naturally produced walleye to fingerling size.  Spawning activity will be monitored on Apple Creek beginning in 1994 to evaluate its potential as a spawning area for walleye from Bassett Lake.  These efforts, coupled with fish population assessments in 1996 and 1999 will help DNR personnel to evaluate changes in the fish community within Bassett Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bassett is a 442-acre lake with 196 (44%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 20 feet.  The lake is located 6 miles north of Brimson, Minnesota off Highway #16 and has a township administered, concrete back-in access.  Bassett Lake has been actively managed for walleye by stocking one pound of fingerlings per littoral acre every other year from 2001 through 2011.  Stocked walleye fingerlings were marked with a pectoral fin clip in 2001, 2003 and 2005.  Bassett was last surveyed in 2006.  Bassett was assessed in 2011 to help evaluate the walleye fingerling stocking program as well as update information on other fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 5.8 per gillnet lift was down from 2006 (7.0) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye gillnet catch rates from six investigations since 1988 have ranged from 5.8 to 9.3 per lift.  Mean size was 14.4 inches and growth has decreased since the last investigation from average to slow.  Age analysis revealed sporadic recruitment with several missing year-classes from 1998 through 2009.  Ninety-two percent of the total walleye sampled by gillnets were aged to years that walleye were stocked.  However, zero clipped walleye were recaptured from the stocking events in 2001, 2003 and 2005 indicating low contribution of stocked fish to the overall walleye fishery from those year-classes.  The 2006 resurvey documented a 9% contribution of clipped walleye to those year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 5.6 per gillnet  lift was up from 2006 (2.9) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 21.2 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2010 were represented, except 2004.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 14.3 per trapnet lift was down from 2006 (44.7) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 6.3 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year classes from 2002 through 2008 were represented, with a strong 2005 year-class.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 2.0 per lift was down from 2006 (2.3) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 5.0 inches was small but not enough individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth.  Age analysis revealed sporadic recruitment with only three year-classes present from 2005 through 2010. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled for the first time in Bassett Lake during the 2006 investigation.  As a result, a spring electrofishing assessment targeting largemouth bass was conducted in 2011.  A total of 15 largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 22.5 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass average length was 13.1 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2004 through 2010 were represented in the sample except 2007 and 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 29.2 per gillnet lift was down from 2006 (120.2) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 6.1 inches and growth was average compared other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2008 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include black bullhead, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, creek chub, mottled sculpin, rock bass, white sucker, hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nBassett Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2011.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.   <br> \n</p>",
