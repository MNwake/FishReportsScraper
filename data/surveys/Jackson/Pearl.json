                "narrative": "<p>Pearl is a 155 acre lake with a maximum depth of six feet located near Loon lake in Jackson County.  The lake is presently managed for northern pike as the primary species while walleye, yellow perch, and black crappie are managed secondarily.  The lake may have suffered a partial winterkill during the winter of 2000 and 2001.  In years of normal to high flow, fish can move between Pearl and Loon.  Oxygen levels dropped very low in December of 2000.  The fish population was assessed during the week of 06/25/2001 with 12 trapnets.  Gillnets were not used due to the shallowness of the lake.  Northern pike abundance was low compared to lakes similar to Pearl.  Some nice pike were sampled, however, with lengths that ranged from 20.6 to 34.7 inches and averaged 25.9 inches.Walleye abundance was low compared to lakes similar to Pearl.  This may be due to the low oxygen readings in December of 2000.  Walleye sampled during the assessment were nice with lengths ranging from 15.8 to 24.3 inches and averaging 17.8 inches.  The walleye population sampled during the assessment likely was the result of natural reproduction in Loon during the Spring of 1998.Yellow perch abundance was low compared to lakes similar to Pearl.  Yellow perch abundance was also low in Loon.  Yellow perch numbers typically fluctuate in many of the lakes in Southern Minnesota.  If the numbers of yellow perch do not recover, additional stocking may be necessary.Black crappie abundance was high compared to lakes similar to Pearl.  Lengths of black crappie ranged from 4.9 to 11.5 inches and averaged 9.1 inches.  There were several black crappie sampled in the 9.5 to 10.5 inch range.Bluegill abundance was low compared to lakes similar to Pearl.  A fishable population does exist and lengths ranged from 5.1 to 8.0 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.Black bullhead abundance was average compared to lakes similar to Pearl.  Lengths of black bullhead ranged from 8.9 to 13.0 inches and averaged 10.9 inches.Other fish species sampled during the assessment included bigmouth buffalo, common carp, channel catfish, freshwater drum, hybrid sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Pearl through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake is a 117-acre lake located in Jackson County approximately 9 miles southwest of the City of Jackson, near the Iowa-Minnesota border. Pearl Lake is shallow with an average depth of 4.0 ft. and a maximum depth of 6.0 ft.  Pearl Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for Black Crappie and Yellow Perch. Stocking is minimal because of the lakes connection to Loon Lake, as it is believed that enough immigration of fish occurs from Loon Lake to Pearl Lake to sustain fish populations, as evidenced from historical catch rates and stocking histories. Walleye are also present in Pearl Lake, but are not managed because of the lakes connection to Loon Lake, a managed Walleye lake. A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 8, 2019 to monitor fish populations using one gill net and 11 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 Northern Pike catch rate was 1.0 per gill net, which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Northern Pike catch rates have been very low for decades in Pearl Lake (0.0 to 1.0 per net), likely because recent stockings have been limited to 2014 and 2016, due to unsuccessful production of fingerlings.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 17.0 to 28.4 inches and averaged 24.6 inches.  Pearl Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the new Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike longer than 24 inches can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates have historically been stable in Pearl Lake, varying from 26.0 per gill net in 1993 to 37.0 per gill net in 1988.  The trend continued in 2019 as the Yellow Perch catch rate was 26.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net).  Total lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 7.6 to 11.2 inches and averaged 8.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have varied from 2.3 per trap net in 2013 to 20.4 per trap net in 2001 and have averaged 10.0 per trap net since 1988.  In 2019, the Black Crappie catch rate was 16.4 per trap net, exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (0.7 to 15.3 per trap net).  Size structure of the Black Crappie population was balanced, as a wide range of lengths were sampled (4.8 to 13.4 inches, mean length of 8.7 inches).  At least four different ages of Black Crappie were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough not managed for Walleye, Pearl Lake has historically had Walleye present (because of its direct connection to Loon Lake, which is stocked with Walleye), as catch rates have varied from 6.0 per gill net in 2013 to 23.5 per gill net in 1988.  In 2019, the Walleye catch rate was 31.0 per gill net, which was the highest catch rate ever observed in Pearl Lake and greatly exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net).  Walleye lengths ranged from 12.7 to 23.0 inches and averaged 16.0 inches.  A hot Walleye bite was reported during the early ice fishing season in December of 2019.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate was 76.0 per gill net in 2019, similar to the 2013 catch rate of 79.0 per gill net, and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in Minnesota (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net).  Total lengths of Black Bullheads ranged from 7.5 to 10.9 inches and averaged 9.0 inches.  The Bigmouth Buffalo catch rate was 10.0 per gill net and 5.0 per trap net, with lengths ranging from 8.4 to 29.0 inches with an average of 20.1 inches.  Other species sampled include Channel Catfish, Common Carp, White Sucker, Bluegill, Freshwater Drum, Largemouth bass, and Shortnose Gar. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake is 155 acres with a maximum depth of six feet and is a designated class 43 lake.  The lake is located in Jackson County near the Iowa border.  Pearl is uptsream from Loon Lake and is connected in years of normal water levels.  Good northern pike spawning habitat is located upstream from Pearl, which is managed for northern pike as the primary species with walleye and yellow perch as secondary species.The northern pike population would be considered normal to high compared to other lakes in our area.  Lengths of northern pike ranged from 18.6 to almost 30 inches.  The average weight of northern pike sampled in our survey was 2.2 pounds.The walleye population would be considered average for lakes similar to Pearl.  Lengths of walleye sampled in our survey ranged from 11.6 to almost 21 inches and averaged about 16.5 inches.  The average weight of walleye in Pearl, from our 1997 survey, was just over 1.5 pounds.  It is likely walleye move back and forth from Loon to Pearl in years water levels are adequate.Pearl has a very good black crappie population compared to similar lakes.  The crappie population has increased since our survey in 1993.  Lengths of black crappie ranged from 4 to 12.7 inches and averaged about 9 inches.  The average weight of black crappie sampled in our nets was 0.4 pounds.The black bullhead is a very popular fish in this part of the country.  The black bullhead population is doing very well in Pearl.  Lengths of black bullhead ranged from 7.4 to 12 inches and averaged about 10 inches.  The average weight of black bullhead in 1997 was 0.5 pounds.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Pearl Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",
