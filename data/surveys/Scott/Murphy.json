                "narrative": "<p>Murphy Lake is a 70 acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet.  The lake is located entirely within the Murphy-Hanrehan Park Preserve.   Murphy Lake provides quality recreational opportunities.  Three Rivers manages the preserve to provide fishing, wildlife observation and trails for runners and bicyclists.  Water quality in Murphy Lake is good, compared to other West Metro lakes.  Boaters should also keep in mind that new state laws require the drain plug be removed while traveling on public roadways.    <br> \n <br> \nThe predator community in Murphy Lake is simple and natural.  Only largemouth bass are present.  In the 2011 population assessment largemouth bass abundance decreased compared to past surveys, but remains high for lakes similar to Murphy.  Average length was 10.3 inches.  Standard lake survey gear does not consistently provide an accurate estimate of largemouth bass abundance.    <br> \n <br> \nFive species of panfish are present in Murphy Lake.  Black crappie abundance is average.  Very few large fish were sampled.  Average length was 6.5 inches.  Bluegill abundance increased to an all-time high for this lake.  Average weight decreased slightly.  Only a little less than 5% of sampled bluegill were greater than 6 inches.  Pumpkinseed were sampled at an average abundance.  Hybrid sunfish were also sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nRough fish are present in low numbers.  Black bullhead abundance was the lowest ever recorded for Murphy Lake.  One white sucker was captured in 2011, the first time this species has been sampled in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie and bluegill populations in Murphy Lake are stunted.  In the Metro area, stunting in size is likely due to overpopulation and size selective harvest by anglers.  Overpopulation reduces the amount of food available to all fish, reducing growth rates.  Harvest of larger (keeper size) fish by anglers reduces the number of quality fish in a lake.  Harvesting large fish also removes the spawning stock and reduces the biological incentive to grow large.  Larger fish compete for spawning habitat and food more effectively.  Thus, fish have more incentive to grow large if large fish are present in a lake.  Harvesting smaller fish preserves spawning stock and increases the biological incentive to grow large which promotes big fish genetics.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Murphy is a 45-acre lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet.  The lake is located south of the town of Savage, in Scott County.  Murphy-Hanrehan Park Reserve surrounds Murphy Lake, and the lake's complex shoreline is natural and undeveloped.  Murphy Lake holds a simple fish community, composed of bass and panfish.  A public boat access is located on the northwest shore of the lake.  A Standard Survey was completed during the spring and summer of 2022.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were abundant in the 2022 survey, and the fish were of good size.  Fish ranged in length from 6.5 to 19.0 inches, and average size was 12.6 inches and 1.23 pounds.  Sixty-three percent of the sampled fish exceeded 12 inches.  With an abundance of quality-sized fish, Murphy offers a strong bass fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were moderately abundant during the 2022 survey, and size tended to be small.  Bluegill ranged in length from 2.1 to 7.4 inches, with an average size of 4.5 inches and 0.07 pounds.  Only 9% of the trap netted fish were larger than 6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in low abundance, but a few larger fish were present.  Fish ranged in length from 5.6 to 10.4 inches, with an average size of 8.9 inches and 0.39 pounds.  While not many fish were sampled, 83% of the fish exceeded 9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that were sampled in low abundance include hybrid sunfish and Pumpkinseed.   <br> \n</p>",

Black crappies were found in moderate abundance. Their average length sampled was approximately 7.0 inches. Bluegills were somewhat abundant, but only average 4.9 inches in length. Yellow perch were found to be both abundant and rather large. The average length of yellow perch sampled was 8.4 inches. Perch up to 10.6 inches were sampled. This has been a boom and bust lake, meaning it has occasionally winterkilled in the past. Since the winter of 1996-97 the surviving fish have had litte competition for prey which allows them to grow rapidly. The quality of the fishing should improve on this lake in the near future.</p>",

Bluegills are still abundant but size is not large.  Most bluegills are 6 inches long and 0.2 lb.  Black Crappies are present but average only 7.7 inches long and 0.2 lb.   Pumpkinseed sunfish are abundant, but are only 4-5 inches long with a mean weight of 0.1 lb.  Black bullhead abundance is down from previous surveys but size is similar to the 1999 survey (7 inches and 0.13 lb.).Largemouth bass is the only and most abundant predator in Murphy Lake.  The abundance of these fish in trap nets (3 fish per net) was greater than the 75% quartile for class 38 lakes.  These fish average only 8 inches long and 0.3 lb., but bass as long as 13 inches long were sampled.  Like the other species in the lake, largemouth bass will provide good fishing in the next few years.   </p>",
