MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.22, WHILE LENGTH RANGED FROM 4.5 TO 8.9 INCHES, WITH A MODAL LENGTH IN THE 5.5-5.9 INCH RANGE.  AGE AND GROWTH RATES OF BLC WERE NOT CALCULATED, AS 120 POUNDS OF BLC ADULTS, (3/LB), WERE STOCKED PRIOR TO THE SURVEY.  THE BLG CPUE OF 15.33 PER TRAP NET FALLS WITH THE FOURTH QUARTILE OF ALL WINDOM AREA LAKES THAT CONTAIN BLG AND IS OVER SEVEN TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  THE MEAN WEIGHT OF THE BLG WAS 0.13 LBS.  ALL WERE AGE THREE AND AGE FOUR FISH, RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 4.5-6.4 INCHES.  THE YEP CPUE OF 5.0/GILL NET FALLS WITHIN THE FIRST QUARTILE (BOTTOM 25%) OF ALL WINDOM AREA LAKES THAT CONTAIN YEP.  THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 5.5-7.4 INCHES AND HAD A MEAN WEIGHT OF 0.18.  ALL WERE AGE THREE FISH. GROWTH RATES FOR BOTH BLG AND YEP APPROXIMATE STATE AVERAGES, BUT ARE SOMEWHAT BELOW LOCAL GROWTH RATES. THE BLB CPUE OF 78.0/TRAP NET IS VERY NEAR THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 77.50.  THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 4.5-9.9 INCHES WITH MODAL LENGTH IN THE 5.0- 5.4 INCH RANGE.  THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.11 POUNDS. THE WTS CPUE OF 18.0 PER GILL NET WAS NINE TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  THEY RANGED FROM 12.0-14.9 INCHES IN LENGTH AND HAD A MEAN WEIGHT OF SLIGHTLY OVER ONE POUND.  OTHER SPECIES PRESENT INCLUDED HSF (1.67/TRAP NET), GSF, (1.67/TRAP NET), AND OSS, (0.33/TRAP NET).</p>",
