Of 17 aged brook trout, 7 were identified as naturally reproduced and 10 were identified as stocked.  The presence or absence of a distinct stocking check on the scale was the feature used to distinguish between natural and stocked fish.  Mean length of sampled northern pike was 14.8 inches with an age distribution of 28 and 3 for ages I and II.  The single sampled white sucker was 11.1 inches long.</p>",
