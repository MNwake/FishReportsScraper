                "narrative": "<p>A special fish assessment was conducted on June 10th, 2008 at Riverpointe Pond in Watertown, MN.  Riverpointe was formed from gravel pits that collected water to create the pond, which gives it its unique class 33 identification in Carver County.  This 5.77-acre pond has been managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2007 and is regularly stocked with bluegill sunfish, largemouth bass and channel catfish.  Riverpointe Pond is conveniently located alongside the South Fork of the Crow River and was first surveyed in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nSpecies that are present in Riverpointe Pond and are of interest to anglers include bluegill sunfish, largemouth bass, channel catfish and black bullhead.  Bluegill abundance was below average for this lake class and had a mean length of 7.42 inches.  The most abundant species sampled was black bullhead, which averaged 9.40 inches in length and weighed an average of 0.49 pounds.  One northern pike was captured during the survey and measured 33.54 inches in length and weighed 12.62 pounds.  Other species sampled during this survey were hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nRiverpointe Pond is surrounded by a city park that the City of Watertown is continuing to improve by adding more walking paths, a fishing pier, picnic tables and gazebo.  <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at: www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A DNR Fisheries Standard Survey was conducted on July 22nd, 2015, at Riverpointe Pond in Watertown, MN (Carver County).  Riverpointe was formed from abandoned gravel pits that collected water; water body formation in this way results in the unique Class 33 categorization for a locality characterized by fertile, soft-bottomed lakes.  This 5.7-acre pond has been managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2007 and is regularly stocked with Bluegill sunfish, Largemouth Bass and Channel Catfish.  Riverpointe Pond is conveniently located alongside the South Fork of the Crow River and was first surveyed in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nSpecies that are present in Riverpointe Pond and are of interest to anglers include Bluegill sunfish, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Channel Catfish and Black Bullhead.  Bluegill abundance was below average for this lake class and had a mean length of 7.3 inches. Black Crappie abundance was also below average for this Lake Class and had a mean length of 7.8 inches. The most abundant species sampled was Black Bullhead, which averaged 7.6 inches in length and weighed an average of 0.24 pounds.  Nine Northern Pike were captured during the survey and ranged from 19.3-29.1 inches in length and averaged 3.14 pounds. Other fishes sampled in low abundances were Channel Catfish and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nRiverpointe Pond is surrounded by a city park that the City of Watertown is continuing to improve by adding more walking paths, a fishing pier, picnic tables and gazebo.  <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at: www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin. <br> \n</p>",
