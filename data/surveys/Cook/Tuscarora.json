Although it was lower than the catch observed in 1989, it was similar to the catch seen in 1974.  Several lake trout year classes, all naturally produced, were included in the catch, and lake trout growth had been slightly slower than average.  Four-year-old lake trout averaged 13.1 inches in length when taken in late August.  Lake trout collected in 1999 ranged from 10.0 to 21.2 inches in length, and were fairly evenly distributed over that range.  Tuscarora Lake has a reputation for producing good numbers of generally small lake trout, and that reputation was confirmed in this survey.A few northern pike were also collected in 1999.  The catch, though low in number, was still within the normal range for lakes of this class, and it included some larger fish.  Fair numbers of yellow perch were also present, but all were too small to have been of much interest to anglers.  Yellow perch were providing forage for northern pike, lake trout, and each other.Walleye and smallmouth bass have never been found in this lake.  They are not native to this area, and have not yet spread to this system.</p>",
