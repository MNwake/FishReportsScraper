Most of the walleye taken were three years of age, and could have been produced by stocking.  Fish from unstocked years were also taken, but no other year class, stocked or unstocked, appeared to have been strong.  Walleye growth rates had been average for the area.The northern pike catch was also about average, and it was similar to past catches in this lake.  However, northern pike collected were unusually small for a lake of this class, apparently due to a lack of fish more than three years of age.  Northern pike growth rates had been fairly fast by area standards.Forage was provided by white sucker and yellow perch.  Catches for both species were within the normal range for lakes of this class in 2001.  Most of the white sucker collected were too large to serve as forage for any but the largest of the northern pike found.  There was no evidence to suggest that the introduction of walleye in this lake had reduced yellow perch abundance.A few pumpkinseed sunfish were taken in 2001, but they were too small to have been of interest to anglers.  The largest taken was 4.0 inches in length.  A single smallmouth bass was also collected - the first time that species was found in this lake.  Their abundance is unknown, since gill nets do not do a good job of sampling smallmouth bass.</p>",
