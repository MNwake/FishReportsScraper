                "narrative": "<p>Finn Pond is a small, shallow 4.1 acre lake that flows into Arrowhead Creek.  Natural reproduction maintains a small population of Brook Trout consisting primarily of small size fish.  These fish may use Finn Pond seasonally throughout the year and move between the lake and the creek depending on the water temperature.  Sampling techniques in 2013 assessment sampled a single Brook Trout of 7.8 inches.  Also sampled were numerous White Sucker, Creek Chub, Brook Stickleback, and Finescale Dace.  Previous fish population assessments captured Brook Trout ranging from 5 to 10 inches in the lake.  Muck was \"common\" shoreline substrates, with sand rated \"rare\".  Vegetation was found to a depth of 3.5 feet in the lake.  A total of 23 species/groups of aquatic vegetation were identified with common bladderwort, floating pondweed, and yellow waterlily being the most \"common\" and found over much of the lake surface. <br> \n   <br> \nAccess is available from a short carry-in trail down a steep slope, off USFS Rd. #369.  Despite the short distance from a gravel road, Finn Pond is seldom fished due to the size and low abundance of the Brook Trout.  There was no evidence, at the time of the survey in 2013 of anglers traveling to or recently fishing Finn Pond. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Finn Pond is little more than its name suggests. It is quite small (4.3 acres) and has a maximum depth of 4.5 feet. The median depth is 3 feet. A tributary of Arrowhead Creek serves both as the inlet and outlet to this small impoundment. A beaver dam about 100 feet long which holds a head of water near 2.5 feet is located on the outlet at or very near the lake. Water of the pond is moderately soft and aquatic vegetation in the form of sedges, waterlilies, bladderwort, and pondweeds is of scattered growth. Soil of the pond bottom is muck except for a tiny area of muck over sand and gravel near the beaver dam. A shoreline marsh comprised mostly of sedges surrounds the entire pond. The brown bog-stained water permitted a Secchi disc to be seen to a depth of 4.5 feet (maximum pond depth).Trapnetting revealed that White Sucker and Creek Chub are present. Minnow traps caught White Sucker, Common Shiner, Creek Chub, Northern Redbelly Dace, Pearl Dace, and Finescale Dace. Indications are that a moderate to dense White Sucker population exists. No gillnetting or shoreline seining was attempted.The Trappers Lake Road is near the west lake shore and from the road there is an unmarked trail which extends for about 200 feet. There are no designated public access, cabins, or boats. Some anglers were observed in the area throughout the summer but none were seen during the time of the lake survey.It is known that trout have occasionally been caught in past years in Finn Pond.</p>",
