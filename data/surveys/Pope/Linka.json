                "narrative": "<p>The total biomass of gamefish captured in the 1990 netting survey was very low in comparison to previous assessments.  Walleye catches decreased from 7.0 fish/gillnet night in 1985 to 1.5 fish/gillnet night in 1990.  The 1985 sample was comprised mostly of small, age 1 fish. Walleye captured in 1990 were larger fish measuring over 17.0 inches and averaging 3.15 lbs.  Age composition of the captured sample indicates stocking efforts are limited in success.  Two fish were the result of the 1987 fingerling stocking.  Cohorts of the 1988 fingerling stocking and the 1985 fry stocking were not represented in the survey.  Natural reproduction, error in aging, or a more likely explanation, the stocking of yearling fish in 1984, may explain the presence of the one seven year old fish captured. Spring electrofishing effort yielded 48.8 largemouth bass per hour.  Size structure of the largemouth bass population is desirable from a fishing quality view point.  PSD values and RSD-P values were calculated at 88.5% and of 32.8%, respectively.  A high PSD value may signal irregular recruitment.  Greater density and a greater proportion of smaller fish may be more desirable to exert effective biological control over sunfish populations.  Growth of largemouth bass is average with age four fish averaging 12.3 inches in length. Bluegill are over-abundant.  Catch rates exceeded 50 fish/trapnet.  Size structure, condition, and growth of Bluegill is indicative of a stunted population.  Trend information suggests a continue increase in abundance accompanied with a shift in size structure towards smaller individuals.  PSD of the captured sample was calculated at 15.5%.  No preferred-size (8.0 in. And larger) fish were captured in the 1990 survey. Physical condition of stock-size bluegill (3.0- 5.9 inches) is poor.  Age four fish averaged only 4.7 inches in length at time of annulus formation. Older, less abundant Bluegill exhibited better growth and improved physical condition. Relative weight values of the 23 quality-size (6.0-7.9) fish in the sample averaged 114. An abundance of aquatic vegetation is likely limiting the efficiency of predation on small Bluegill. Northern Pike abundance is low with a CPUE of 1.75 fish/gillnet.  The mean weight of Northern Pike collected was 4.0lbs the apparent low relative abundance of Northern Pike is considered a significant management concern.  This population comprised 40-60 percent of the total biomass of fish captured in 1977 and 1980 surveys.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Linka is a 175 acre, moderately productive basin located in southern Pope County.  Maximum depth of the lake is 50.0 feet. Average depth is estimated at 22.0 feet.  Water clarity is very good.  Transparency measurements average 14.0 feet throughout the summer.  The lake supports a robust and diverse aquatic plant community which offers high-quality fish habitat for sunfishes and Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nA fisheries survey was completed on June 10-13, 2017.  A combination of six gill nets and nine trap nets were used to sample the fish community.  Due to an increased effectiveness of springtime electrofishing sampling for Largemouth Bass, the bass population was surveyed in May.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches were low (1.7/gill net), even though fingerlings are stocked.  Walleye captures tended to be large fish averaging 20.7 inches and 3.9 pounds.  Northern Pike abundance remained at a desirable level (5.8/gill net).  Average length was 24.4 inches.  The largest pike capture measured 29.9 inches.  Bluegill are moderately abundant.  Age distribution of Bluegill catches extended to age 8, but most captures (76%) were young (ages 2 or 3).  Consequently, average size was low (5.1 inches).  Growth was rapid and did allow some individuals to exceed 8.0 inches.  Black Crappies are present, but poor and irregular reproductive success or survival in recent years has reduced abundance, age and size distribution, and fishing opportunities for this species.  Yellow Perch are moderately abundant, but few grow large enough to attain a harvestable size.  Average size of Yellow Perch captured was 6.0 inches.  Survey catch statistics described a high-quality Largemouth Bass fishery.  Due to high recruitment in recent years, average size was low (7.6 inches), but large fish are present.  Over twenty percent of all bass captured during the electrofishing survey exceeded 16.0 inches.  The largest bass measured 20.1 inches.  Fishing quality may decline in the coming years as larger, older individuals drop out of the population, but cohorts of a strong 2015 year class will provide some fishing opportunities.     <br> \n <br> \nLake Linka is not currently known to be infested with any aquatic invasive species.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to this or other lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe public access is located on the east shore off Lake Linka Road.  This access is shallow and launching larger boats during low water levels can be problematic. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Linka is a 175 acre, moderately productive basin located in southern Pope County. Maximum depth of the lake is 50 feet. Average depth is estimated at 22 feet. Water clarity is very good. Transparency measurements average 14.0 feet throughout the summer with occasional decreases due to weather events. The lake supports a robust and diverse aquatic plant community which offers high-quality fish habitat for sunfishes, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike. The public access is located on the east shore off Lake Linka Road. This access is shallow and launching larger boats during low water levels can be problematic. <br> \n <br> \nA standard fisheries survey was completed in July of 2023 to evaluate abundance and size distribution of gamefish populations. Walleye catches remain low (1.3/gill net). Walleye captures tended to be large fish averaging 19.9 inches and 3.1 pounds. Regular Walleye fingerling stockings were discontinued by the MN DNR in 2017 due to extremely poor survival of stocked fingerlings. The current stocking regime prescribes surplus stockings of larger Walleye, when available, to maintain a limited fishery. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance remained at a desirable level (6.8/gill net). Average length was 26.5 inches. The largest pike capture measured 34.1 inches. Anglers are reminded that new pike zone regulations were implemented in 2018. Lake Linka is located in the North-Central Zone. Anglers can now keep up to 10 pike but not more than two can be over 26 inches in length. All pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released. Harvesting smaller pike will help shift the population back towards larger individuals and reduce the number of predators for young Walleye and other gamefish. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are abundant in Lake Linka. Electrofishing catch rates of Largemouth Bass were the second highest on record. Largemouth Bass growth is moderate and on average it takes four years for bass to reach 12.0 inches. Size structure of the electrofishing catch described a quality fishery. Fifty-Five percent of the bass were over 12.0 inches and the largest bass observed from all sampling types was 20.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates (21.8 fish/trap net) were similar to the historic average for Lake Linka. Age distribution of Bluegill catches extended to age 6, but 70% of the captures were young (age 2 or 3). Consequently, average size was low (5.2 inches). Growth was rapid and did allow some individuals to exceed 8.0 inches. Black Crappies are present at low density and offer minimal fishing opportunity for this species. Adult Yellow Perch numbers were low during the 2023 survey. Yellow Perch are preferred prey of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. Other fishes caught during the 2023 survey include Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, White Sucker, and multiple species of bullheads. <br> \n <br> \nLake Linka is not currently known to be infested with any aquatic invasive species, and lake users should take extra precautions to keep it that way. Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to this or other lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Linka is a small basin with a relatively small watershed area.  Water quality parameters arewithin the typical range for minimally impacted lakes and approximate the 90th percentile for all lakeswithin the North Central Hardwood Forests ecoregion.  Extensive beds of submergent vegetation arepresent throughout the littoral zone.  Emergent vegetation is limited to a few stands of hardstembulrush and common cattail along the shoreline.  Northern pike catches averaged 7.5 fish/gillnet, similar to the catch rate of 7.0 fish/gillnet recordedin 1992.  Gillnet catches ranged from 1.3 to 14.5 fish/net in previous surveys.  The normal range ofmean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics is 3.5 - 10.5fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1996 was 2.6 pounds.  Northern pike fingerlings andyearlings were stocked in 1992; and adult fish were stocked in 1994.  In addition, Griffin Pond hasbeen used as a northern pike spawning area since 1993.  These measures were taken to increase northernpike abundance after survey catch rates declined following the blockage of the natural spawning run toGriffin Pond in 1981.  Northern pike catches have increased since 1990; however specific contributionsfrom each stocking strategy, if any, is unknown.  Night, DC electrofishing yielded 11.0 catchable sizelargemouth bass per hour.  Fish ranged between 13 and 19 inches in total length.  Mean weight of fishcaptured was 2.4 pounds.  Bluegill catches decreased from 87.1 fish/trapnet in 1992 to 13.4fish/trapnet in 1996.  Trapnet catches ranged from 31.8 to 87.1 fish/net in previous surveys.  Thetypical range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 6.1 - 46.6 fish/trapnet.  Approximately 40% ofthe fish captured were 6 inches in length or greater, however few exceeded 8 inches.  Walleye catchesdecreased from 11.3 fish/gillnet in 1992 to 1.2 fish/gillnet in 1996.  Gillnet catches averaged 1.5fish/net in 1990 and 1980; and 7.0 fish/net in 1985.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similarlakes is 1.3 - 5.0 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1996 was 2.7 pounds.  Fish rangedfrom 14.4 to 18.9 inches in total length.  Walleye are managed as a \"bonus\" fishery in Lake Linka. Walleye fingerling stocking was discontinued after 1990 and alternate year fry stocking began in 1994. Fingerling stocking prior to 1990 had been mostly ineffective, however the last stocking in 1990 mayhave been the most successful.  Age-2 fish comprised 52% of the fish captured in the 1992 lake survey. Natural reproduction is evident from the age class distribution of fish captured in 1996 and was alsoevident in past surveys.  Yellow perch catches averaged 4.8 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have rangedfrom 0.0 to 11.0 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1980.  Most of the fish captured werebetween 5.0 and 8.0 inches in total length.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Linka is a 197-acre lake located in southern Pope County.  A state-owned public access is located on the east side of the lake.  The access is shallow making it difficult to launch and load larger boats.  Maximum depth is 50 feet.  Water quality is very good.  Long-term monitoring statistics describe an average summer water transparency in excess of 10.0 feet.  The basin supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Habitat attributes are characteristic of \"bass-panfish\" lakes. <br> \n <br> \nCatch information from the 2011 fish community assessment is sufficiently divergent from prior survey findings to suggest some environmental factor may have reduced fish movements and vulnerability to capture in standardized gear.  If staffing and the programmed work load permit, a repeat survey will be completed in 2012 to validate accuracy of survey statistics.  In the interim, 2011 catch data is considered an under-estimate of true gamefish abundance. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers have decline since the last survey, but catches were well within the range of normal.  Reproductive success was very good in 2009, thus most of the population was made up of two-year-old fish.  Average size was small (4.6 inches and 0.09 pounds).    There were a few older fish captured.  These 8.0 inch and larger bluegill made up four percent of the population sample.  The largest bluegill captured measured 9.0 inches.  It takes four years for a bluegill to reach 6.0 inches in length.  Fishing should be good in the future when two-year-old bluegill in the 2011 population sample reach a harvestable size.  <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth bass catches also declined.  Electrofishing catch rates decreased from 75.7 fish/hour in 2006 to 21.6 fish/hour in 2011.  The decline can be attributed to poor spawning success or poor survival of young fish since 2005.  With few young fish being added to the population, length distribution of the population sample was skewed towards older, larger individuals.  Mean length of bass captures was 13.8 inches.  Bass grow fast in probable response to limited competition within the population.  Age structure of the 2011 population sample extended out to age 10.  There is potential to catch a 20.0 inch bass. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike stocking was suspended in 1998 to increase potential returns from walleye stocking.  Abundance has gradually declined, but average gillnet catches in 2011 continued to be within the range of expected catches for similar lakes.   Most captures were young fish, thus average size of the population sample was only 22.3 inches in total length.  Mean weight of captured pike was 2.5 pounds.  The largest capture was 29.3 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nWalleye abundance remains low despite alternate year stocking.  Only five walleye were captured during the 2011 survey.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catches were common to 1980 and 1985 survey catches.  No black crappie have been captured during the last two surveys.  There have been no fish kill events specific to crappie, thus it would be unreasonable to assume black crappie no longer exist in the lake.  Crappie is not very vulnerable to capture during mid-summer due to a preference to occupy deeper, cooler water.  A special netting assessment conducted in spring months may be necessary to increase catches and better describe population attributes. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Linka is a 197-acre lake located in southern Pope County. A state-owned public access is located on the east side of the lake.  Maximum depth is 50 ft.  Water quality is very good.  Long-term monitoring statistics describe an average summer water transparency in excess of 10.0 ft.   The basin supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Habitat attributes are characteristic of  \"bass-panfish\" lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nTrue to Lake Linka's ecological classification, largemouth bass are abundant.  Bluegill sunfish are excessively abundant.  Trapnet catches in 2006 exceeded expected catches for similar lakes.   Survey statistics suggest that fishing quality and success can be inconsistent from year to year.  Age determinations of largemouth bass and bluegill captures depicted significant inconsistencies in annual reproductive success or recruitment of age groups to a harvestable size.   Recruitment variability is compounded by below-average growth rates and size-selective harvest of larger individuals in the population.  Dependent upon population density, it can take seven years for a bluegill to growth to 6.0 inches in length.  Natural and angling mortality claim many sunfishes before they grow to preferred harvest sizes.  Few bluegill live beyond age-6.  An 8.0-inch bluegill is rare in survey catches.  Largemouth bass captured in 2006 averaged 10.5 inches in length, but in response to light harvest pressures, 15.0 - 18.0 inch bass are fairly common. <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to other sunfishes, black crappie catches have fluctuated greatly among surveys in response to annual recruitment inconsistency.  Population abundance appeared higher in surveys conducted in the 1980s.  Average trapnet catches in more recent surveys has not exceeded 1.0 fish/net.  None were caught in the 2006 survey.   Lack of crappie in 2006 survey catches does not imply that the crappie population has been lost.  Abnormally high water temperatures likely resulted in crappie suspending in deeper water rather than occupying the shoreline where trapnets are located. <br> \n <br> \nSurvey statistics describe a healthy northern pike population that should provide quality fishing.  Mean length and weight of northern pike in the 2006 capture sample were 25.0 inches and 3.7 lbs, respectively.  Growth of young pike is above average, but slows markedly after five years of age.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye don't tend to be abundant in small, bass-panfish lakes.  Stockings are programmed on an alternate year frequency if efforts to sustain a viable fishery.  Stocking is supplemental to limited natural recruitment or immigration from the East Branch of the Chippewa River.  Survey catches in 2006 were within the range of normal for similar lakes.  Anglers can anticipate a relatively low catch rate, but fishing quality in terms of average size caught will be good.  In contrast to other predators such as largemouth bass and northern pike, walleye grow very fast in Linka Lake.   Older walleye captured during the 2006 survey averaged 17.1 inches in length at age-3.  Average weight of walleye captured was 1.7 lbs.    <br> \n <br> \nBased on abundance and growth statistics, the fish community is marginally out-of-balance from a predator/ prey perspective.  Anglers can play an important role in restoring community stability and improving fishing quality by employing smart harvest strategies.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small- to medium-size largemouth bass and bluegill.  Release larger gamefish.  Walleye abundance appears inversely related to that of northern pike.  Catch and keep more 25.0 inch and smaller northern pike. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Linka.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nThirteen species were collected during this survey.  Two species (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter) were considered \"intolerant\" and two species (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Linka.</p>",

Walleye numbers have increased from 1.50 fish/gillnet in 1980 to 7.00 in this survey. This is due to a 1984 fingerling stocking that was somewhat successful. Northern Pike numbers have decreased from 14.50 fish/gillnet in 1980 to only 1.25 fish/gillnet in this survey. Yellow Perch numbers have remained constant and should provide adequate forage for the predators present..</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mean total weight of fish captured in gillnets increased from 15.4 pounds per net in 1990 to 45.6 pounds per net in 1992.  Higher catch rates for Northern Pike and Walleye accounted for the increase in total weight captured per gillnet.  Northern Pike catches increased from an average of 1.8 fish/gillnet in 1990 to 7.0 fish/gillnet in 1992.  The catch recorded in 1992 is within the interquartile range of mean catch rates for lake classification 31 and meets the long range goal of 6-10 fish/net defined in the lake management plan.  The mean weight of fish captured was 2.9 pounds.  PSD, RSD-P, and RSD-M were estimated at 60.8%, 3.6%, and 7.2%; respectively.  Growth of Northern Pike in Lake Linka is greater than the mean growth rate reported in area lakes within lake class 31.  Adult Northern Pike were stocked at a rate of 2.5 pounds per surface acre in 1991 (490 fish).  This stocking may have contributed to the increase in the catch rate of Northern Pike.  Eight hundred Northern Pike fingerlings (113 pounds) and 350 Northern Pike yearlings (117 pounds) were stocked in 1992.  Unfortunately none of these stocked fish were marked, therefore it is difficult to determine the specific contribution of the recent stocking on Northern Pike density.  Bluegill are over-abundant and exhibit characteristics of a stunted population.  Results from the 1990 population assessment indicated an expanding Bluegill population with a concurrent shift in size structure towards small individuals.  This trend has continued into 1992.  Catch rates increased from 51.9 fish/ trapnet in 1990 to 87.1 fish/trapnet in 1992. PSD decreased from 15.5% to 7.4% during the same time period.  The catch rate recorded in 1992 exceeds the third quartile of mean catch rates for lakes within lake class 31.  Bluegill growth is poor in Lake Linka.  Age 5 fish average only 5.5 inches at time of annulus formation.  The abundant submergent vegetation coverage in the littoral zone is likely providing excessive escape cover for the small Bluegill and reducing predator feeding efficiency.  Walleye CPUE increased from 1.5 fish/ gillnet in 1990 to 11.5 fish/gillnet in 1992.  The catch rate observed in 1992 is the highest recorded on Linka Lake and is above the third quartile of mean catch rates from lake class 31. PSD and RSD-P were measured at 37.7% and 20.0%, respectively.  Mean weight of Walleye captured in gillnets was 1.5 pounds.  Age 2 (1990 year class) fish comprised 52% (24/46) of the fish in the eight year classes represented in the catch. Fingerlings were stocked at a rate of 1lb/ littoral acre in 1990.  There is some evidence of natural recruitment in Linka Lake, however the practice of stocking carry over fish (age i+) makes evaluation of natural reproduction difficult.  Yep were not captured in gillnets during the 1990 population assessment.  A moderate fish kill involving yep was reported in June of 1990 prior to the assessment.  Catch rates in 1992 averaged 6.8 fish/gillnet.  Age 4 and 5 fish comprised 80% of the fish captured.  Cohorts of these age classes were likely too small to be captured in experimental gillnets during the 1990 survey.  Growth of yep is slow.  Age 4 fish averaged only 4.0 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  This poor growth results in a size structure dominated by small individuals.  This is illustrated by a PSD of 7.7% and a mean weight of 0.1 pounds.  One Black Crappie was captured in trapnets which results in a catch rate of 0.13 fish/net.  A catch rate of 0.75 fish/net was recorded in 1990.  Trapnets may not be an effective gear for capturing Black Crappie during mid- summer, however catch rates averaged 6.0 fish/net and 7.5 fish/net in 1980 and 1985, respectively. The normal range of catch rates for lake class 31 is 0.6 - 3.2 fish/net.  Largemouth Bass were not collected in experimental nets during the 1992 population assessment.  Daytime electrofishing in 1990 yielded 48.8 bass/hour with a size structure dominated by quality-and preferred-size fish.  PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 88.5% and 32.8%, respectively.  These high values may be indicative of poor recruitment during the late 1980's.  Carp, White Sucker, Black Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish were also collected during the population assessment, however catch rates were below 1.0 fish/net for each species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Linka is a relatively small lake located in southern Pope County.  The maximum depth of this lake is relatively deep but almost 40% of the basin has a depth less than 15 feet.  Water clarity is usually high.  Clear water accompanied with a shallow basin promotes the growth of aquatic vegetation, which is abundant in Lake Linka.  Lake Linka often stratifies during summer months, which results in deeper waters being void of oxygen.  This lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass and sunfish with northern pike and walleye being species of secondary management importance.  Largemouth bass are not abundant but the size of fish caught should be favorable, with the average fish weighing approximately 1.4 pounds.  Despite the high vegetation abundance, natural reproduction of largemouth bass appears to be minimal but has likely increased in recent years.  Bluegill are moderately abundant but most fish are small.  The majority of bluegill collected in trap nets were between 3 and 6 inches in length.  Anglers targeting northern pike can expect moderate numbers of mostly smaller individuals.  Only 4% of northern pike collected in gill nets exceeded 28 inches in length.  Walleyes are not overly abundant in Lake Linka but the mean length of fish collected in gill nets was over 16 inches.  Yellow perch are also present but small fish dominate the population size structure.    </p>",
