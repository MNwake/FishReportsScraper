                "narrative": "<p>Picket Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 17, which consists of 99 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, are bowl-shaped, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Picket Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it has a more irregular shoreline shape. Picket Lake does not stratify thermally in midsummer, and retains good oxygen to the bottom.  The inlet, from Nels Lake, flows through a bog and has a rocky watercourse which may limit fish movement.  The outlet to Mudro Lake has no barriers to fish movement.  Bottom substrates in Picket Lake are dominated by boulder.  Pondweeds, watershield, bulrush, and burreed are the most common aquatic plants, which grow to a depth of 6 ft.  Six biological surveys and fish assessments have been conducted on Picket Lake, dating back to 1975.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1997 of 21.0 fish/net (22.3 lb/net) was in the normal range for this lake class and was very close to the long term average catch of 20.9 fish/net (19.6 lb/net) in all gillnet assessments on this lake.  Lake class 17 is one of the more productive, in terms of fish numbers and biomass, in northeast Minnesota.  Fish populations in 1997 were dominated by white sucker and walleye.White sucker numbers in 1997 (8.3/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were near the long term average catch of 7.1/gillnet in this lake.  Lakes in Lake Class 17 have very high sucker numbers.Walleye numbers in 1997 (4.7/gillnet) were average for this lake class, and were higher than the long term average catch of 2.8/gillnet in this lake.  Although the walleye in the 1997 gillnet catch averaged only 10\", the largest was 23\".  Most walleye in 1997 were ages 1-3.  Walleye growth (10\" at age three, 15\" at age six) was slower than normal for the area.Northern pike numbers in 1997 (2.3/gillnet) were lower than normal for this lake class, and were similar to the long term average catch of 2.4/gillnet in this lake.  Pike sizes were small, averaging only 18\"; the largest (caught in a trapnet) was 29\".  Pike growth (17\" at age four) was slower than normal. Yellow perch numbers in 1997 (5.3/gillnet) were normal for this lake class, and were near the long term average catch of 7.7/gillnet in this lake.  Perch sizes averaged 6\"; the largest was 9\".  Perch growth (5\" at age three) was normal.Low numbers of bluegill sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, and smallmouth bass were also captured in the 1997 assessment.  These species were also present in low numbers in most previous assessments.  Some large (9\") bluegill were present in 1997.  Fish examined in 1997 had very few parasites or diseases.</p>",

A popular BWCAW entry point is located at the outlet to Mudro Lake on the east end of the lake. Picket Lake itself receives little use and there is one designated campsite on the north side of the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nA gravel boat ramp is located on the east end of the lake for public access. A carry down access is also located nearby. Yet another access option occurs to the west from Nels Lake. There are two portages found along the creek. The first is 185 rods in length and the second is a shorter 20 rod carry. <br> \n <br> \nTen species of fish were sampled during the 2014 populations assessment. Bluegill were the only species sampled in good numbers. Walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass and white sucker were sampled in low numbers. Yellow perch, pumpkinseed, rock bass, golden shiner and shorthead redhorse were also sampled in low relative abundances. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2014 (16.2/trap net) were higher than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. Bluegill sizes averaged 5.4 inches which is smaller than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. The largest bluegill sampled was 8.8 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2014 (1.3/gill net) were lower than past assessments on this lake. The average walleye sampled was 17.3 inches long and about 7 years old. The largest walleye sampled came from a trap net and was 21.7 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2014 (1.0/gill net) were lower than average for this lake. Pike sizes averaged 20.6 inches long which is slightly larger than in past surveys. The largest pike sampled came from a trap net and was 34.2 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nFour largemouth bass were sampled in the trap nets. Largemouth sizes averaged 9.8 inches long and the largest was 15.9 inches long. Four different year classes were represented from 2 to 9 years of age.</p>",
