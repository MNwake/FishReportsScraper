The area around Crystal Lake is currently being redeveloped, changing from a primarily agricultural area to a residential area with a city park. The City of Prior Lake operates an aerator throughout the winter months to reduce the potentials or impacts of winterkill. The Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program has stocked Crystal Lake since 2007 with adult Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nDuring the summer 2016 survey, Bluegill was the most abundant species sampled. Lengths of Bluegills ranged from 3.0-8.0 inches with an average length of 5.9 inches. Black Crappie was the second-most abundant species sampled. Black Crappie abundance was above the median for this lake type. The average length of trapnet-caught Black Crappie was 7.8 inches; the length range was 4.7-9.7 inches. Nine Northern Pike were captured with a single gill net. Total length of Northern Pike ranged from 15.2-31.9 inches with an average length of 19.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during the survey were Black Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Largemouth Bass, and Pumpkinseed.  <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at: www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crystal Lake is a 32-acre lake located in the city of Prior Lake.  Crystal Lake was first surveyed in 1976, and has been surveyed twice subsequently.  Dissolved oxygen measurements indicate that Crystal Lake experiences a partial or complete winterkill during some years.  The area around Crystal Lake is currently being redeveloped, and is changing from a primary agricultural area to a residential and city park area.  Currently, there is no shorefishing access to the lake.  Black and brown bullheads are the predominant species in Crystal Lake.  Both black and brown bullheads were sampled in above average abundance.  The lengths of black bullheads ranged from 3.9 to 10.6 inches, averaging 6.0 inches.  The lengths of brown bullheads ranged from 4.7 to 10.8 inches, averaging 7.9 inches.  Golden shiners were sampled in small numbers.  One snapping turtle and 57 painted turtles were also sampled.  The fish community sampled during the 2004 survey varied little from either previous survey.  Crystal Lake has been a bullhead-dominated system since first surveyed.  The DNR Fishing in the Neighborhood Program (FiN) and the city of Prior Lake are interested in expanding fishing and aquatic education opportunities at Crystal Lake.  Future management activities may include stocking of panfish and/or game fish species and providing access for anglers.For more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at: Fishing in the Neighborhood: Minnesota DNR (www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crystal Lake is a 32-acre, class 36 lake located in the City of Prior Lake.  The area around Crystal Lake is currently being redeveloped, and is changing from a primary agricultural area to a residential and city park.  Recently the City of Prior Lake has installed an aerator, fishing pier and a walking path around the majority of the lake.  The Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program has stocked Crystal Lake since 2007 with bluegill, largemouth bass and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the 2009 survey of Crystal Lake, northern pike captured ranged in length from 23.2 to 25.8 inches in length.  The average length of northern pike captured was 24.3 inches.  Bluegill abundance was above the median level for this lake type.  The average length of bluegill caught during this survey was 5.2 inches in length.  Their range in total length was 3.7 to 8.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough trap netting is not as effective as electrofishing in sampling largemouth bass, trap net abundance during this survey was well above the median for class 36 lakes.  Average length of largemouth bass was 8.0 inches, with a range in length from 5.6 to 14.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in during the survey were black bullhead, brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish.  One-hundred and six painted turtles were captured as well as five snapping turtles. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at:  www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin. <br> \n</p>",
