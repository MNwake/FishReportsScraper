                "narrative": "<p>Dunn's Lake is a small lake (142 acres) in Meeker County with a maximum depth of 20 feet.  Dunn's Lake has a history of infrequent winterkill.  The last winterkill was recorded during the winter of 1992-93.  This was only a partial kill and most of the dead fish observed were carp and crappies.  This lake also experiences extensive algal blooms during summer months.  These algal blooms may be the result of excessive nutrients entering the lake from the surrounding watershed.  Lake Richardson, which is directly connected to Dunn's, has also experienced an increase in summer algal blooms.  During the summer of 1993, DNR fisheries personnel used trapnets, gillnets and seines to assess the current fish population in Dunn's Lake.  Gamefish species sampled were northern pike, bluegill, white crappie, black crappie, yellow perch and walleye.  Other species included common carp, white sucker, black bullhead and yellow bullhead.       The most abundant gamefish sampled during this years survey were white crappie, black crappie and yellow perch.  Catch rates for non-game fish, such as black bullhead and common carp, were within the normal range for lakes with similar physical characteristics.  The catch rate for carp at 0.33/gillnet was the lowest recorded in the last three surveys, which date back to 1982.  The low number of carp is likely the result of the partial winterkill that occurred during the previous winter.       The catch rate for white crappie (41.2/trapnet) was well above average, but below the 145.8/trapnet rate observed in 1991.   Ages 1 through 6 were represented in the sample of white crappie, with age 2 white crappies being the most abundant (47%).  White crappie ranged in length from 6.6 to 10.8 inches, with an average length of 8.1 inches.  The small average size may not be attractive to anglers at this time, but the large 1991 year class may provide some quality fishing in the next two years.     Black crappie were not as abundant as white crappie.  This may be due to the white crappies ability to better tolerate the turbidity of Dunn's Lake.  Black crappie were sampled at a rate of 15.4/trapnet which is in the normal range for lakes in this class.  The observed catch rate was also similar to the catch rates observed in 1986 (22.5) and 1991 (11.3) population assessments.  The age distribution of black crappie was similar to that of white crappie.  Ages 1 through 6 were represented, except for age 3.  The 1991 year class (age 2) represented 77% of the aged sample.  The average size of black crappie was 7.0 inches and ranged from 3.9 to 10.7 inches.     The bluegill catch rate of 7.1/trapnet was in the normal range, but just slightly above the average of 6.25/trapnet.  The age class distribution was dominated by age 2 and age 3 bluegill.   Although year classes from 1987 to 1989 were represented, they were low in number.  The low number of fish in these year classes may have been the result of poor reproduction during the drought years in the late 1980's.  The average size of bluegill was small at 6.4 inches, but considering the majority of these fish were only 2 to 3 years old, it appears that growth rates of bluegill are good.       Only one walleye was sampled during this years survey for a catch rate of 0.17/gillnet.  With the exception of 1986 and 1988, walleye were stocked every year from 1982 to 1991.  Fry stocking was conducted from 1982 until 1985, and fingerling or yearlings were stocked in 1987, and 1989-91.  Gillnet catch rates of walleye have not shown any appreciable benefits from this stocking effort.  The highest gillnet catch rate for the last 11 years was observed in 1986.  In 1986 the catch rate of walleye in gillnets was 1.2, which is below the lake class median of 3.0.       Northern pike numbers remain low in Dunn's Lake.  The gillnet catch rate during this survey (0.17) was well below average for lakes of this type.  Northern pike fingerlings were stocked extensively from 1973 to 1978.  From 1979 to present stocking has consisted of adults and fingerlings.  Gillnet catch rates have shown very little effects from these stocking efforts.  The potential for adequate natural reproduction in this lake is minimal at best.  The is very little suitable spawning habitat within the lake, and nearly all connections to wetland areas have been severed.  A drop-structure at the lake outlet prohibits any movement of northern pike into the lake from downstream portions of the watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Dunns Lake in 2008 to evaluate the lake's physical, chemical, biological characteristics.  A total of 12 different species of fish were sampled, plus hybrid sunfish.  The Dunns Lake Aquatic Management Area, on the southeast side of the lake, offers fishing opportunities for shore anglers and wader fishermen.  Dunns Lake has a history of partial winterkills with the latest recorded event occurring during the 1992-1993 winter. <br> \n <br> \nDunn's lakeshed (5,584 acres) was dominated by row crop agriculture.  The lakeshed to lake ratio was 39:1.  Roughly 1/2 of the shoreline remained undeveloped, with forest being the dominant cover type.  Aquatic vegetation was sparse and there was little diversity (5 varieties).  The only submergent species found, in early July, was filamentous algae.  Sand was the only shoalwater substrate classified as abundant.  Dissolved oxygen dropped below 2 mg/l at 12 foot on 6/24/08.  Water clarity was poor, with a secchi disk reading of 1.5 feet in late June.  Water chemistry results further indicated a degraded lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 0 walleye for a catch rate of 0.0/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2003 catch rate was also 0.0/net.  A total of 1 walleye was trap netted, with that fish measuring 11.7 in length.  The fish was from the 2006 year-class.  The latest stocking regime (1 pound of fingerlings every-other-year) was initiated in 2004.  Thus far, the stocking efforts do not appear to have been highly successful.  Possible explanations for the poor population were inadequate forage and predation from northern pike and largemouth bass.  Gill netting in 2013 will be used to further evaluate fingerling walleye stocking efforts at Dunns Lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 18 northern pike for a catch rate of 3.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate tied the all-time high catch rate from 1980 (3.0/net).  The 2003 catch rate was 2.8/net.  Northern pike were 15.5 to 31.8 inches long averaging 26.1 inches.  Northern pike were 1 to 5 years old with 4 year-classes present. Dunns has a history of producing low numbers of larger sized northern pike and this was again the case in 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 10 yellow perch for a catch rate of 1.6/net, which was within the normal range for lakes of this type.  The 2003 catch rate was 33.7/net.  Yellow perch were 5.3 to 6.1 inches long averaging 5.7 inches.  Yellow perch were 2 to 4 years old with 3 year-classes present.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 14 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 10.4/hr of electrofisher on-time.  The 2006 catch rate was 13.9/hr.  Catch rates (n=5) from 1991 to 2008 ranged from 1.0 to 47.2/hr, averaging 21.8/hr.  Largemouth bass were 8.5 to 18.3 inches long averaging 11.8 inches.  Largemouth bass were 2 to 6 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Age 2 fish accounted for 57% of the electrofishing sample.  The mean length at third annulus formation was 11.8 inches.  The low number of fish captured indicated a fair largemouth bass population.  A lack of aquatic vegetation is likely limiting largemouth bass recruitment at Dunns Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 26 carp for a catch rate of 4.3/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2003 catch rate was 10.8/net.  Carp were 18.0 to 22.5 inches long with a mean of 19.8.  The trap net catch rate was 0.9/net. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 20 black bullhead for a catch rate of 3.3/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  A total of 6 black bullhead were trap netted for a catch rate of 0.7/net.  Trap nets sampled 3 yellow bullhead for a catch rate of 0.3/net.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 782 black crappie for a catch rate of 86.9/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 trap net catch rate was the highest ever measured at Dunns Lake.  The 2003 catch rate was 6.6/net.  Black crappie were 6.2 to 8.7 inches long averaging 7.1 inches.  Gill nets sampled 298 black crappie for a catch rate of 49.7/net, with fish lengths ranging from 4.1 to 8.2 inches.  Black crappie were 1 to 4 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Most of the black crappie appeared to be from the 2005 year-class.  Growth was slow.  Black crappie, being so abundant, should provide plenty of action for anglers fishing Dunns Lake. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 1,308 white crappie for a catch rate of 145.3/net, which was above the normal range for lakes of this type.  The 2008 trap net catch rate was the second highest ever measured at Dunns Lake.  The 2003 catch rate was 5.6/net.  White crappie were 6.1 to 11.0 inches long averaging 7.7 inches.  Gill nets sampled 28 white crappie for a catch rate of 4.7/net, with fish lengths ranging from 6.3 to 9.3 inches.  White crappie were 2 to 4 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Approximately 83% of the trap netted fish were from the 2006 (age 2) year-class.  On average, white crappie grew faster than black crappie did for every year-class (ages1-4).  White crappie should provide anglers good action in the near future. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 95 bluegill for a catch rate of 10.6/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2003 catch rate was 4.7/net.  Bluegill were 4.1 to 7.95 inches long averaging 6.3 inches.  Bluegill were 2 to 6 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Growth was fairly fast.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining sampled young-of-the-year: bluegill (2), largemouth bass (16), northern pike (3), and yellow perch (5).  Johnny darter (8) and bluntnose minnow (175) were also seined.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Dunns Lake in Meeker County beginging on 6/23/03 to evaluate the fish population.  Spring night-time electrofishing (EF), targeting largemouth bass, was conducted on 5/12/03.  Dunns Lake is a 142 acre lake with a maximum depth of 20 feet.  The public access is located on the north side of the lake.  An aquatic management area, with shore fishing opportunities, was aquired in 2003 and is located on the southeast shore.  Intense algae blooms are common on Dunns Lake.  Water clarity was 1.2' during the week of netting.  The lake is primarily managed for northern pike and white crappie.Net catches in 2003 indicated that there were fair numbers of northern pike (2.8/net) at Dunns Lake, including several large inidividuals.  The 2003 gill net catch rate was the second highest on record, dating back to when the lake was first sampled in 1951.  Pike were 13.7-39.7 inches long averaging 21.0 inches.  The white crappie catch rate (5.9/net) was similar to the lakes historical average (4.2/net) and in the high range when compared to similar lakes across the state.  White crappie were 9.2-11.0 inches long averaging 9.9 inches.  Three year classes of white crappie were sampled in 2003.  Black crappie were sampled in similar in numbers (6.6/net) to white crappie.  Black crappie were 6.6-13.0 inches long, averaging 8.7 inches.  A total of seven differnet age classes of black crappie were estimated from the 2003 catch.  Low numbers of bluegill were sampled (4.7/net) when compared to similar lakes across the state, but many of those fish were nice sized.  Approximately 38% of the fish sampled were 7 inches or longer.  The longest bluegill sampled in trap nets was 8.3 inches.  The EF assessment, targeting largemouth bass, caught 74 fish (115.6/hour).  That catch rate indicates that there were high numbers of bass at Dunns Lake when compared to other lakes in Meeker and McLeod County area.  Bass were 4.4-18.3 inches long and averaged 9.6 inches.  Age 2 fish made up 74% of the sample.  Approximately 20% of the fish caught were 12 inches or longer.  The 2003 carp catch rate was high (7.3/net) when compared to similar lakes throughout Minnesota, but much lower than the lakes 1999 catch rate (26.8/net).  Moderate numbers (17.2/net) of black bullhead were sampled in 2003.   Overall, the fish population looks fair to good.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Dunns Lake on June 18, 2018, to monitor the lake's fish population and to do a preliminary evaluation of the Walleye stocking regime.  Dunns is a class 30 lake (Schupp's Lake Classification System)  and net catches were compared to similar lakes around the state.  The 2013 lake management plan (LMP) listed Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and White Crappie as primary management species, while Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye were ranked as secondary species at Dunns.  In 2018, a total of 10 species were sampled in the gill nets (GN), trap nets (TN), and by spring night-time electrofishing (EF), targeting Largemouth Bass.  The dissolved oxygen concentration fell below 2.0 mg/l at 13 feet, indicating a lack of suitable oxygenated habitat below this depth on this date.  Water clarity was poor with a secchi disk reading of 2.0 feet.  The cause for the reduced visibility was due to an algae bloom.  Only Walleye were aged for this survey.  There is a DNR aquatic management area (AMA) property on the southeast side of the lake with shore/wading fishing access for anglers.  No formal aquatic plant survey was done in 2018, but Curlyleaf Pondweed, a non-native submergent aquatic plant, was found around most of the shoreline (light to abundant in density).  Dunns Lake has a history of occasional winterkill with the last documented kill occurring in 1993.  Winter dissolved oxygen levels were low in 2013, but a significant kill did not occur.  Minor spring fish kills mostly affecting Black Crappie were documented in 2017 and 2018. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (33) of Walleye for a catch rate of 5.5/net, which was above the lake's normal range and the highest ever recorded at Dunns Lake.  The LMP's long range Walleye goal (>1.5/GN) was met.  The 2012 GN catch rate was 0.8/net.  Historic catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=14), under various stocking regimes or no stocking were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 5.5/net with an average of 1.2.  In 2018, Walleye were 16.3 to 24.9 inches long with an average of 18.1.  All GN sampled Walleye were 16 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Walleye were age-3 to age-10 with 4 year classes being present.  Age-4 fish, a fingerling stocked year, were the most abundant, accounting for 88% of the GN aged fish.  The 2014 year class would be considered strong.  All other year classes were weak.  Age classes from non-stocked year classes accounted for none of the 33 (100%) Walleye that were aged, possibly indicating that natural reproduction and immigration from the North Fork of the Crow River was not significant at Dunns.  Connected Richardson Lake was stocked in the same years with the same year classes (fingerlings or yearlings) of fish from 2004 thru 2016.  From 1992 to 2003, Walleye were not stocked into Dunns Lake and the GN catch rate in 1999 was 0.0/net, demonstrating that stocking is necessary to produce a fishery at Dunns.  An every other year fingerling stocking regime (85 pounds) began in 2004 and produced a GN catch rate of 0.0/net in 2008 and 0.9/net in 2012.  The stocking regime changed to 170 pounds every other year in 2010. Analysis of walleye stocking strategy is ongoing.  A spring yearling stocking in 2016 (1,627 fish) only produced 2 fish in the 2018 GN catch.  A fingerling shortage in 2018 forced personnel to stock yearlings (269 pounds) that year (with a few fingerlings and adults mixed in).  In 2018, growth was moderate when compared to other lakes statewide.   <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Northern Pike (17) for a catch rate of 2.8/net, which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2013 LMP's long range goal (>2.5) was met.  The 2012 GN catch rate was much higher (11.3/net).  Historical catch rates (n=14) from 1951 to 2018 were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 11.3/net with an average of 1.9, indicating low recruitment most years.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2018, gill netted Northern Pike were 16.7 to 32.5 inches long with an average of 22.7.  Northern Pike were last stocked into Dunns Lake in 1992.  A small wet meadow is adjacent to the north side of the AMA and is believed to provide some spawning habitat during years when water levels are high enough.  Northern Pike were not aged, but size distribution data indicated that multiple year classes were present, although recruitment would probably be classified as sporadic.  New Northern Pike zone regulations went into effect in the spring of 2018.  Dunns is in the north central regulation zone, which has a 10 fish bag limit, where all fish from 22 to 26 inches in length have to be immediately released and only two harvested fish can be over 26 inches long.  Darkhouse spearers are allowed to have one fish in the protected slot limit. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers (404) of Black Crappie in 2018 for a catch rate of 44.9/net, which was above the lake's normal range and the second highest on record at Dunns.  The 2008 catch rate was even higher at 86.9/net.  The 2013 LMP's long range goal (>5.0/TN) was met in 2018.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=15) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 86.9/net with an average of 20.2.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 3.7 to 15.6 inches long with an average of 6.5.  Approximately 20% of the TN catch was 9 inches or longer, indicating modest size structure.  Gill nets also sampled high numbers of Black Crappie (759) for a catch rate of 126.5/net, which was above the lake's normal range and the highest ever recorded at Dunns.  The 2012 GN catch rate was 17.7/net.  Gill net catch rates from 1974 to 2018 (n=13) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 126.5/net with an average of 21.6.  Gill netted Black Crappie were 4.0 to 11.5 inches long with an average of 5.9.  Black Crappie were not aged, but size distributions indicated adequate recruitment.    <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers of Bluegill (427) for a catch rate of 47.4/net which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2018 TN catch rate was the second highest on record at Dunns.  The 2013 LMP's long range goal for Bluegill (>6.5) was met.  The 2008 TN catch rate was 10.6/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=15) were variable, ranging from 1.0 to 66.0/net, with an average of 19.5.  In 2018, TN Bluegill were 3.4 to 9.1 inches long with an average of 6.6.  Approximately 41% of the TN catch was 7 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Bluegill were not aged, but size distribution data indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Although no formal aquatic plant survey was done in 2018, a possible increase in submergent vegetation (Curlyleaf Pondweed) could be providing the habitat needed for increased Bluegill recruitment at Dunns Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass sampled moderate numbers (57) of fish for a catch rate of 39.2/hour, which was the second highest ever recorded at Dunns.  The 2013 LMP's long range goal (>10/hour) was met.  The 2008 EF catch rate was 10.4/hour.  Historic catch rates from 1991 to 2018 (n=6) were variable, ranging from 1.0 to 47.2/hour with an average of 24.7.  Largemouth Bass were 10.6 to 19.4 inches long with an average of 14.9.  Approximately 84% of the EF sample was 13 inches or longer, indicating that a quality population was present.  Largemouth Bass were not aged, but size distributions indicated that multiple age classes were present.  Recruitment would not be considered consistent.  Possible increases in the abundance of Curlyleaf Pondweed may be providing some additional habitat needed for better recruitment of Largemouth Bass at Dunns Lake.        <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (62) of Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 10.3/net which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was 7.2/GN.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=14) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 48.0/net with an average of 13.2.  Gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.2 to 9.1 inches long with an average of 7.1.  Only two Yellow Perch were 9 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure as far as anglers were concerned.  However, Yellow Perch were likely an important forage item for Walleye, Northern Pike, and other fish species.     <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (9) of White Crappie in 2018 for a catch rate of 1.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was much higher at 145.3/net.  The 2013 LMP's long range goal (>1.5/TN) was not met in 2018.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=15) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 265.2/net with an average of 46.5.  In 2018, TN White Crappie were 8.7 to 12.3 inches long with an average of 11.4.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers of White Crappie (3) for a catch rate of 0.5/net, which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2012 GN catch rate was 1.2/net.  Gill net catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=14) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 11.0/net with an average of 3.9.  Gill netted White Crappie were 8.7 to 12.4 inches long with an average of 10.1.  White Crappie were not aged, but size distributions and catch rates indicated inconsistent recruitment.  <br> \n  <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (13) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 1.4/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 TN catch rate was 0.9/net.  Historic TN catch rates (n=15) from 1951 to 2018 were variable, ranging from 0.8 to 26.8/net with an average of 5.1.  In 2018, TN Common Carp were 15.1 to 28.9 inches long with an average of 21.4.  Gill nets sampled low to moderate numbers of Common Carp (18) for a catch rate of 3.0/net, which was also with the lake's normal range.  Historic GN catch rates from 1974 to 2018 (n=13) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 69.5/net with an average of 16.7.  Gill netted Common Carp were 14.8 to 28.3 inches long with an average of 21.9.  High numbers of Common Carp over the years have likely had significant negative impacts on submergent aquatic plant densities at Dunns Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (2) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the lake's normal range and was the third lowest catch on record.  The 2012 catch rate was similar at 0.2/net.  Historic GN catch rates from 1974 to 2018 (n=13) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 245.0/net with an average of 40.3.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 8.4 and 10.2 inches long with an average of 9.3.  Trap nets also sampled low numbers (2) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.2/net which was below the lake's normal range.  Historic TN catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=15) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 569.6/net with an average of 48.6.  Trap netted Black Bullhead were 6.2 and 13.1 inches long with an average of 9.7.  Black Bullhead catch rates have not been high since 1999 (76.5/GN).   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included; White Sucker (0.8/GN) and Yellow Bullhead (0.4/TN). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dunns Lake, Meekeer county, is a 142-acre lake with a maximum depth of 20 feet.  Twelve species of fish were sampled during the resurvey conducted the week of June 26, 1999.  The survey included gill nets, trap nets, seining, and electrofishing techniques to collect data.  White crappie and bluegill are the primary species managed for in this body of water, while northern pike, black crappie, and largemouth bass are listed as secondary species in lake management plan. During the 1999 resurvey, Hutchinson area personnel set six standard gill nets and nine trap nets.  The most abundant species caught by each gear were black bullhead, carp, and black crappie in the gill nets and white crappie, black bullhead, and carp in the trap nets.Trap nets caught 2,387 white crappie, for a catch rate of 265.2 fish per lift.  This is the highest catch rate ever recorded.  However, only 14% of the fish were 8 inches or larger.  Average length of white crappie was 7.0 inches.Trap nets caught 42 bluegill, giving a catch rate of 4.7 per set.  They ranged in size from 4.9 to 8.3 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  Trap nets sampled 175 black crappie, for a catch rate of 19.4 per set.  Fish ranged in length from 5.4 to 9.0 inches and had an average length of 7.1 inches.  Good numbers of black crappie are present.Gill nets sampled 6 northern pike, for a catch rate of 1.0 per gill net lift.  Pike ranged in length from 22.5 to 32.1 inches in length and displayed an average length of 24.6 inches.  Northern pike have never been abundant in this lake.Spring night-time electrofishing for largemouth bass produced 52 fish, for a catch rate of 36.3 bass per hour of electrofisher on-time.  Bass ranged in length from 4.8 to 15.9 inches in length and displayed an average length of 8.8 inches.</p>",

Moderate numbers of black bullhead (37.0/trapnet) and white crappie (11.0/gillnet and 17.8/trapnet) were netted.   Low numbers of yellow perch (1.0/gillnet), common shiner (6.5/trapnet), and yellow bullhead (1.5/trapnet) were also netted. <br> \n</p>",

No Walleye or Northern Pike were caught.  Largemouth Bass appear to be in general of older age classes exhibiting normal growth rate and without disease.  No Black Crappie were caught.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed are of age class III and both exhibit good growth rate.  Spawning areas are good for Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Crappie, and Largemouth Bass.  Spawning area for Northern Pike is limited and poor for Walleye.  There is a high population of Perch.  Bullhead are also very plentiful. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
