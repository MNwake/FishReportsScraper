                "narrative": "<p>Acorn Lake's fishes include most of the species popular with anglers in central Minnesota lakes.  Northern pike, walleye, bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch and several species not typically sought by anglers are part of the fish community.  Of these, only walleyes require stocking in order to sustain a fishery in this lake.  The others listed above have ample spawning habitat and conditions to maintain their populations in Acorn Lake.Bluegill catches are once again quite high (41.8 per trap net) after near-historic lows during the past two surveys in the 1990's.  Bluegills are not particularly fast growing in Acorn and it takes about seven years to produce a seven inch fish.  The majority of bluegills sampled in 2003 were five and six year old fish averaging 6.1 inches in length.There is an excellent forage base of yellow perch in the lake.  Northern pike and walleye show good growth rates.  In 2003, the average sampled pike weighed just under three pounds and the average walleye weighed just over three pounds.As a relatively small lake, Acorn is vulnerable to overfishing.  Anglers can help maintain a balanced and healthy fish community by releasing a portion of medium and larger fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Acorn is a 154-acre lake located two miles northwest of Frazee, MN.  With a couple of exceptions, shoreline dwellings are limited to the southern half of the lake due to the presence of steep banks along the railroad tracks on the northeast shore and along the U.S. 10 roadway on the northwest shore.  Several cold-water springs enter the lake along the west shore and the outlet typically flows year-round.  Acorn Lake is moderately productive with floating-leaved vegetation growing throughout much of the lake's nearshore area.  On 06/20/2023 a survey was completed in Acorn Lake to assess the fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance in 2023 was above average at seven fish per gill net.  Lengths of sampled fish ranged from 15 to 31 inches and averaged 25 inches.  Sixty-six percent of the Northern Pike that were measured in 2023 were 24 inches or longer. This is almost double the historical average of thirty-four percent. <br> \nGill nets captured an average of four Walleye per net in 2023, which is near the historical average for Acorn Lake.  Walleyes averaged 17 inches in length and ranged from 10 to 26 inches.  Forty-two percent of the Walleye measured in gill nets were longer than 20 inches.  Walleye grew rather slow, reaching an average length of 14 inches in four years. <br> \nGill net catches of Yellow Perch in Acorn Lake have historically been high, averaging 140 fish per net from 10 surveys dating back to 1955.  In 2023, gill nets captured an average of 115 perch per net.  Perch averaged seven inches in length and ranged in size from 6 to 10 inches.  Just over ten percent of the gill net sampled Yellow Perch were 8.0 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was below average in 2023, with trap nets catching 28 fish per net.  The average length of sampled Bluegills was six inches and Bluegills up to 9 inches were observed.  The percent of Bluegills over eight inches in length was only five percent.  <br> \n <br> \nFor both trap and gill nets, 11 Largemouth Bass, and 23 Black Crappie were captured. The length of Largemouth Bass ranged from six to 18 inches and averaged 12 inches.  Black Crappie had an average length of 10 inches with fish up to 13 inches being measured. Other fish species captured were Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Green Sunfish, Bowfin, White Suckers, and Brown and Yellow Bullheads.  Cisco have not been sampled since 1983.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Acorn Lake is a small but relatively deep northern pike/bass/panfish lake with a growing walleye population that is maintained by stocking.  The lake once held large numbers of cisco (tullibee) but none have been taken in mid-summer test netting since 1983.  The cause of the cisco decline is not known but it is clear that this species requires good oxygen and cool water temperatures.  Acorn Lake's cooler, deeper waters (below the thermocline) appeared to have little oxygen in recent surveys.  However, a low black to yellow bullhead ratio in the lake was generally regarded as an indicator of fairly good water quality.Largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie were present in average numbers compared to other similar lakes.  Both crappie and bass were considered fast growers in Acorn Lake.  Bluegills grew at an average rate, slightly faster than they did when they were more abundant in the 1980s.Net catches of northern pike and walleye were higher in 1998 than in any of five previous assessments since 1955.  There is still a good forage base in the form of abundant yellow perch and growth rates are faster-than-normal for northern pike and about average for walleye.  The average walleye caught in test nets weighed nearly three pounds.  While this bodes well for angling, it must be recognized that a lake as small as Acorn is vulnerable to overfishing.  Individual anglers can help maintain a healthy fish community by releasing a portion of the \"keepers\" they might normally have eaten.Also, fish habitat includes both quantity and quality of water, bottom substrate, and fish cover such as vegetation.  While Acorn Lake currently has abundant vegetation and relatively light shoreline development, landowners can help maintain the integrity of the lake and its fish community by protecting stands of emergent and floatingleaf vegetation and by preventing erosion and nutrient input on their own properties.  A shoreline buffer zone of native plants, for instance, will slow both erosion and nutrient input.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of nearshore fish species was conducted on July 20, 2016 by IBI Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but 1 station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 2 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 7 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 1 station.  Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including 4 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Mottled Sculpin) and 2 that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead and Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2013 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for Acorn Lake is near the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Acorn Lake is located in the Ottertail River Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Acorn is a 154-acre lake located two miles northwest of Frazee, MN.  With a couple of exceptions, shoreline dwellings are limited to the southern half of the lake due to the presence of steep banks along the railroad tracks on the northeast shore and along the U.S. 10 roadway on the northwest shore.  Several coldwater springs enter the lake along the west shore and the outlet typically flows year round.  Acorn Lake is moderately productive with floating-leaved vegetation growing throughout much of the lake's nearshore area. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance in 2018 was above average at 7.8 fish per gill net.  Lengths of sampled fish ranged from 14.3 to 26.5 inches and averaged 22.5 inches.  Thirty-five percent of the Northern Pike that were measured were 24 inches or longer.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets captured an average of 4.0 Walleye per net in 2018, which is near the  historical average of 3.5 fish per net.  Walleyes averaged 20.4 inches in length and ranged from 12.0 to 25.7 inches.  Sixty-five percent of the Walleye measured in gill nets were longer than 20 inches.  Walleye grew rather slow, reaching an average length of 12.9 inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nGill net catches of Yellow Perch in Acorn Lake have been high with a historical average of 140.3 fish per net.  In 2018, gill nets captured an average of 206.2 perch per net.  Perch averaged eight inches in length and ranged in size from five to 11 inches.  Forty four percent of the gill net sampled Yellow Perch were 8.0 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was below average in 2018, with trap nets catching 29.2 fish per net.  The average length of sampled Bluegills was 6.5 inches and Bluegills ranged from 3.1 to 9.7 inches.  The percent of Bluegills over 8.0 inches long was the highest ever recorded in 2018, and one nine inch fish was found to be 17 years old.    <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing found Largemouth Bass abundance to be low, with only 7.6 bass captured per hour of shocking.  The mean length of the 11 sampled Largemouth Bass was 13.5 inches, with the largest fish being just over 18 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured were Bowfin, White Suckers, and Brown and Yellow Bullheads.  Cisco have not been sampled since 1983.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Acorn Lake was conducted on June 12-13, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish and Blackchin Shiner) and three species that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Acorn Lake is adversely impacted by stressors, as indicated by an FIBI score just below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to the previous assessment which determined Acorn Lake was vulnerable to impairment based on the FIBI. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Ottertail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Acorn Lake's fishes include most of the species popular with anglers in central Minnesota lakes.  Northern Pike, Walleye, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and several species not typically sought by anglers are part of the fish community.  Of these, only Walleyes require stocking in order to sustain a fishery in this lake.  The others listed above have ample spawning habitat and conditions to maintain their populations in Acorn Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches remained higher than the lake's historical average after near-historic lows during the 1990's.  Bluegills are not particularly fast growing in Acorn and it takes about eight years to produce a seven inch fish.  The majority of Bluegills sampled in 2013 were relatively old (older than age five), but a few younger fish were found, as well.  Bluegills sampled in trap nets averaged 7.1 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThere was an excellent forage base of Yellow Perch in the lake.  Northern Pike showed good growth rates.  In 2013, the average sampled pike weighed 2.4 pounds and the average Walleye weighed 2.6 pounds.  Catch rates for both species were near the upper end of the historical ranges for Acorn Lake. <br> \n <br> \nModest populations of Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were present.  Crappies sampled by electrofishing averaged a little over a half pound each. <br> \n <br> \nAs a relatively small lake, Acorn is vulnerable to overfishing.  Anglers can help maintain a balanced and healthy fish community by releasing a portion of medium and larger fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Examination of historical netting data for Acorn Lake finds some unusual information.  A large tullibee populationpresent in 1955 has disappeared, a substantial number of rock bass collected in 1955 have not been sampled since,and brown bullheads have virtually disappeared.  Additionally, species not collected in 1955 but found insubsequent surveys include bowfin, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, and largemouth bass.  A meager bluegillpopulation in 1955 (2.8 per trapnet) exploded to over 130 per trapnet by 1983 but has since declined again to only5.1 per trapnet for no discernible reason.  The majority of bluegills in the 1988 survey were over seven yearsold and could be termed \"stunted\".  Most bluegills in the current survey are less than seven years old with nearaverage growth.  Yellow perch, very abundant in 1955 at 55.5 per gillnet, have increased even more, currently at121.3 per gillnet.  Northern pike, which you would expect to thrive in the presence of such a huge yellow perchforage base, have remained relatively stable at approximately three per gillnet.  They do exhibit fast growth. Walleyes on the other hand, perplexingly, exhibit growth that is well below average. The walleye gillnet catch was 3.7 per gillnet in 1955 following seven consecutive years of fingerling stockingfrom 1945 to 1952.  Walleye stocking was discontinued after 1952 for lack of a public access.  No walleyes weresampled in the 1976 or 1983 surveys.  Upon acquisition of a public access walleye stocking was renewed in 1983and fingerlings were stocked in consecutive years through 1989, then again in 1991 and 1993.  The 1988 surveyfound only 0.8 per gillnet but it was ascertained at this time that many walleye fingerlings stocked from thepublic access (located near the outlet) were leaving the lake to downstream Town Lake shortly after stocking. In 1988 the lake was actually stocked twice, initially in early September at the public access, then again in mid-October when a stocking site more removed from the access was located.  The remote stocking site has been usedsince 1988.  The current survey found walleyes at 5.8 per gillnet and many were from the 1988 year-class.  Anglersreported catching \"limits\" of 1+ lb. walleyes in the winter of '93/'94. Based on growth rates these would be '88year-class fish.  The current survey found disappointing numbers of '89 and '91 year-class fish stocked at theremote site.  These fingerlings were stocked in September and apparently either sufferd a high mortality or havea greater propencity to migrate downstream when the water is a little warmer, irregardless of stocking location. In any case, it appears that providing a significant walleye fishery in Acorn Lake would require regular, highdensity stocking.  There is virtually no natural reproduction. Even if a walleye population could be maintained,growth rate is poor. Acorn Lake simply does not seem to have the necessary elements favorable to walleyes.  Management for the fastgrowing northern pike, along with largemouth bass and panfish, would seem to be more appropriate.  Anglersoccassionally report good black crappie and bluegill fishing, particularily ice fishermen.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Acorn Lake's fishes include most of the species popular with anglers in central Minnesota lakes.  Northern pike, walleye, bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch and several species not typically sought by anglers are part of the fish community.  Of these, only walleyes require stocking in order to sustain a fishery in this lake.  The others listed above have ample spawning habitat and conditions to maintain their populations in Acorn Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches are once again quite high (69 per trap net) after near-historic lows during the 1990's.  Bluegills are not particularly fast growing in Acorn and it takes about six years to produce a seven inch fish.  The majority of bluegills sampled in 2008 were age four, but good numbers of five and six year old fish were also found.  Bluegills sampled in trap nets averaged 6.9 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThere is an excellent forage base of yellow perch in the lake.  Northern pike and walleye show good growth rates.  In 2008, the average sampled pike weighed 4.2 pounds and the average walleye weighed just under two pounds. <br> \n <br> \nModest populations of black crappie and largemouth bass are present.  Crappies sampled in trap nets average about a half pound each. <br> \n <br> \nAs a relatively small lake, Acorn is vulnerable to overfishing.  Anglers can help maintain a balanced and healthy fish community by releasing a portion of medium and larger fish and keeping smaller ones for eating. <br> \n</p>",
