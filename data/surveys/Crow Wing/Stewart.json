The fish population consisted of high numbers of yellow bullheads and average numbers of bluegills, pumpkinseeds, hybrid sunfish and northern pike.  Only one largemouth bass was sampled.  Walleyes were only caught in trapnets and averaged 3.5 lbs..  Bluegills as large as 8.7 inches and pumpkinseeds to 9.3 inches long were sampled.  Northern pike were fairly abundant but most sampled in 1993 were age 1 or 2, thus average size was small.  Spawning habitat was listed as \"fair\" for northern pike and \"good\" for bass, sunfishes and walleyes.</p>",
