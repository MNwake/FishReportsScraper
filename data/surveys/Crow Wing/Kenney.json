Tullibee (cisco) was abundant and all other species were found in average numbers for the lake class.  Northern pike (5.0/gillnet) was again caught in average numbers (similar to 1971- 6.0/gillnet) after not being sampled in gillnets in 1982.  Four age classes were sampled and growth appeared good. About 67% of the sample aged to be from the 1989 year class.  Walleye abundance was low (1.0/gillnet). Private stocking (by permit) was done in the springs of 1988 and '89.  Two of the five walleye captured aged from these stockings.  As in 1982, largemouth bass were taken only in shoreline seine hauls.  Only yoy (young of year) largemouth bass were sampled in 1992. Although present in average numbers for the lake class, bluegill was captured at a rate of 37.5/trapnet in 1992, similar to abundance found in 1971 and 1982.  Median length remained at 5.0-5.4.  Four age classes were sampled and growth was slow.  Rock bass (0.75/trapnet) and pumpkinseed (4.25/trapnet) were again present in average numbers.  Black crappie (0.25/trapnet) catch dropped to low abundance, but was similar to the 1971 catch (0.5/trapnet).  Tullibee (cisco) (10.0/gillnet) continued to be abundant.  White sucker (1.0/gillnet) was caught in average numbers, similar to 1971, after being only sampled in trapnets in 1982.  Black bullhead (1.0/trapnet) was sampled for the first time in 1992.  Yellow bullhead (7.0/trapnet) remained present in average numbers.  Brown bullhead was not sampled in 1992. Bowfin (0.25/trapnet) abundance was low.  Common carp was taken for the first time, but only in gillnets (0.67/lift).  Average size was 7.9 lb.</p>",
