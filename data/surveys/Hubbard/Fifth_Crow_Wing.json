                "narrative": "<p>Fifth Crow Wing Lake is located three miles southwest of Nevis in central Hubbard County. Fifth Crow Wing Lake is 400 acres with a maximum depth of 35 feet.  A county-owned public access is located on the southwest shore of Sixth Crow Wing Lake, and access to Fifth Crow Wing Lake is gained through a short stretch of the Crow Wing River.  Boats can travel through the river in the summer, but ice fishing is limited because of open water and no public access to Fifth Crow Wing.  Fifth Crow Wing Lake provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish.  Fifth Crow Wing also has a special regulation for Northern Pike requires all northern pike from 24 \u0013 36 inches to be immediately released.  There is also a limited Tullibee population for fall sport netting. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Fifth Crow Wing is in lake class 31. Lake Class 31 lakes are generally regularly shaped and have very hard water.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second Crow Wing, Sixth Crow Wing, Seventh Crow Wing, Eighth Crow Wing, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, Tripp and Lower Twin.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has been consistent in previous years, and close to similar area lakes.  Walleyes are a great size for anglers, with an average size of 16 inches and fish sampled up to 28 inches.  The 2011 year class of Walleyes appears to be very abundant and should provide good fishing in the near future. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of Northern Pike, with the 2014 sample being the second highest on record.  Northern Pike had an average size of 22.9 inches and weight of 2.7 pounds.  A few fish over 30 inches were sampled, with the largest being 32.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are an important forage species for Walleyes and Northern Pike in Fifth Crow Wing. They were sampled in good numbers, but generally too small for angling. <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in lower numbers than previous surveys.  The size was very good, with an average length of 14.2 inches and fish sampled up to 20 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nFifth Crow Wing has been a popular lake for panfish in recent years.  Angling opportunities for panfish include Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed.  Black Crappie numbers were low, but size was good with most fish from 9-11 inches in length.  Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds were sampled in higher numbers than recent years, and most fish were 5-8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNo aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Fifth Crow Wing Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fifth Crow Wing Lake is located three miles southwest of Nevis in southern Hubbard County.  Fifth Crow Wing is part of a chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Fifth Crow Wing Lake has a surface area of 400 acres and a maximum depth of 35 feet.  There is no public access on Fifth Crow Wing Lake.  A DNR-owned public access is located on the southwest shore of Sixth Crow Wing Lake, and boats can access through a short, narrow channel that connects the two lakes.  Winter access is limited, as the channel is generally open though the winter. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Fifth Crow Wing Lake is in Lake Class 31.  Class 31 lakes generally have very hard water, and regularly shaped shorelines.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Second, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Crow Wings, Boulder, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, Tripp and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nA special 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit on Northern Pike is in place on Fifth and Sixth Crow Wing Lakes.  The objective of this regulations is to maintain or improve pike sizes in these lakes.  Anglers can expect to find good numbers of Northern Pike in Fifth Crow Wing Lake.  Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 21.8 inches and 2.3 pounds, with pike measured up to 32.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were a good size for anglers, with all fish 13 to 26 inches.  Walleyes grow fairly quickly, and had an average length of 18 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for both Walleye and Northern Pike were sampled in good numbers.  Yellow Perch are generally too small for anglers with most fish 6 - 7.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSpring sampling showed good numbers of Largemouth Bass. They had an average length of 15 inches, with fish sampled up to 18.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFifth Crow Wing Lake supports a healthy panfish population and can provide good fishing for Black Crappie and Bluegill.  The Black Crappie catch rate in 2019 was higher than the last sample, but still moderate numbers compared to other local lakes.  They were an average length of 7.5 inches, with crappies sampled up to 12 inches.  Bluegills were sampled in good numbers, similar to past surveys. The majority sampled were 3-6 inches, but anglers will find larger Bluegill in the 6-9 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nNo aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Fifth Crow Wing Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fifth Crow Wing is located in southern Hubbard County, three miles southwest of Nevis.  Fifth Crow Wing has a surface area of 392 acres and a maximum depth of 35 feet.  There is no public access on the lake, however, there is a public boat ramp on Sixth Crow Wing and the two lakes are connected by a small river channel.  There is a dam at the outlet of Fifth Crow Wing which limits boat travel downstream; however, there is a portage trail around the dam for canoes.  Fifth Crow Wing provides fishing opportunities for panfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Fifth Crow Wing is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second Crow Wing, Sixth Crow Wing, Seventh Crow Wing, Eighth Crow Wing, Duck, Hinds, and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are highly sought after by anglers on Fifth Crow Wing.  Bluegill abundance (8.6 bluegill/trapnet), was down from past surveys, and at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class. Winter fishing pressure was very high during the winters of 2001-02 through 2006-07, as evidenced by record or near record numbers of fish houses on Sixth Crow Wing Lake each of those winters.  In addition, Fifth and Sixth Crow Wing Lakes experienced a partial fish kill in June of 2007.  Either or both of those events may be at least partially responsible for lower bluegill and pumpkingseed abundance in 2008.  Anglers will find decent numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers, with catch rates within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have shown black crappies abundance to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers.   Anglers will find black crappie in the 9-11 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (3.0 walleye/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but below the current management goal of 7.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to high numbers.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 18.9 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Fifth Crow Wing is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Important walleye and northern pike forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (TLC) were sampled in moderate numbers. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (8.7 pike/gillnet) was up from past surveys.  Past surveys have sampled northern pike in low to moderate numbers; with gillnet catch rates below or at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.8 inches and 2.4 pounds, with pike measured up to 36.5 inches.  A 40-inch minimum size limit for northern pike was implemented in the spring of 2003.  This length limit regulation is being evaluated to see if an increase in larger northern pike has occurred. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown Fifth Crow Wing to have good numbers of largemouth bass when compared to other lakes in the Crow Wing chain.  Fifth Crow Wing has good water quality, submerged and emergent vegetation that provides excellent habitat for bass and panfish.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of white sucker, yellow bullhead, and bowfin (dogfish).  Brown bullhead, rock bass, and golden shiner were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

The average weight of the walleyes sampled was 1.7 pounds with 62% in the 15 to 22 inch range.  Growth rates are average.  Natural reproduction is limited as only 3% of the walleyes sampled were from non stocked years.  Northern pike abundance of 2.1 per set is low for lake class 31, but is similar to historical levels for this lake.  Their average size in 1994 was 21.7 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Reproduction appears consistent and growth rates are good.  Largemouth bass abundance is high for this lake class, however, the majority of them are young fish.  Growth rates are slightly below average.  Black crappie were sampled in numbers slightly below the median for this type of lake.  There were multiple year classes with 50% of the samples greater than 10 inches.  Bluegill abundance of 36.8 per set is above the median for lake class 31.  They averaged 6.4 inches with 66% of those sampled from 6.0 to 8.0 inches in length.  Growth rates are just below average and stunting is not severe.  Yellow perch abundance is above the third quartile for lakes in this class and should provide an excellent forage base.  Forty three percent of the yellow perch sampled were over 8 inches while only one exceeded 10.0 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Fifth Crow Wing Lake was conducted on July 3rd, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at eight sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two station.  Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and that is tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from the week of August 26th, 2019 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Fifth Crow Wing Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fifth Crow Wing is located in southern Hubbard County, three miles southwest of Nevis.  Fifth Crow Wing has a surface area of 392 acres and a maximum depth of 35 feet.  There is no public access on the lake, however, there is a boat ramp on Sixth Crow Wing and the two lakes are connected by the Crow Wing River.  Fifth Crow Wing supports an excellent panfish fishery, as well as good fishing for largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.  Fifth Crow Wing has good water quality and excellent fish habitat such as submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Fifth Crow Wing is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second Crow Wing, Sixth Crow Wing, Seventh Crow Wing, Eighth Crow Wing, Duck, Hinds, and Lower Twin.Panfish are highly sought after by anglers on Fifth Crow Wing.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers (14.3 bluegill/trapnet), similar to past surveys and within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie abundance (1.3 black crappie/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Black crappie numbers in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers.  Both bluegill and black crappie had good growth rates when compared to other class 31 lakes.Walleye abundance (4.4 walleye/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but below the current management goal of 7.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to high numbers.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Walleye stocking by the DNR is contributing to the walleye population in Fifth Crow Wing.  Age analysis showed 64% of the walleye sample corresponding to stocked years.  Fifth Crow Wing (as well as the whole Crow Wing chain of lakes) is stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd years.  Important walleye forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in good numbers.Fifth Crow Wing has a history of having a low to moderate northern pike population composed of quality-sized fish.  The 2004 catch rate of 3.5 pike/gillnet is at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.  Northern pike were large-sized with an average weight of 4.2 pounds and pike measured up to 37.0 inches.  Northern pike have fast growth rates in Fifth Crow Wing, above other class 31 lakes.  With the backing of strong public support, a 40-inch minimum size limit for northern pike was implemented in the spring of 2003.Present and past surveys have shown Fifth Crow Wing to have good numbers of largemouth bass when compared to other Crow Wing chain and class 31 lakes.  Largemouth bass up to 21.0 inches were sampled.Other species sampled included high numbers of bowfin (dogfish) and moderate numbers of rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

Walleye fingerlings could be stocked for an additional fishery, as the survey of 1955 indicated Fifth Crow Wing had a little above average walleye population at that time.  A rough fish removal project should be considered in face of the above average catch on bullheads.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>As compared with the statewide index numbers, there appears to be a good population of bluegills, rock bass, common suckers, tullibee, perch, and average populations of northern pike and walleye.  All species appear to have a fairly fast growth rate.  The age class structure appears to be normal for all species except bluegill and pumpkinseed which tend to form dominant year classes.Discussion and SummaryFifth Crow Wing Lake has the necessary chemical and physical characteristics for good fish productivity.  It is best suited ecologically for bass and panfish but it is also supporting good populations of walleye and northern pike.  The growth rate for all species appears to be good.Fish StockingAll species appear to be maintaining good populations through natural reproduction.  It is believed that angling will not be significantly improved through stocking.Local Fishin ReportFishing on the lake is mostly for northern pike, crappie, walleye, and bluegill.  Fishing success has declined for the last several years and was poor during the summer of 1955 according to resort owners.Aquatic PlantsAquatic plants were found to a depth of 15 feet and cover 15 to 20 percent of the lake area.  Wild rice and bulrush are most abundant; yellow water lily, duckweed and pondweeds are also present.Special Regulations:The following special regulations have been in effect on this lake.Closed to darkhouse spearing - 1946-48, 1949-51.Closed to angling - 1945-48.Spawning beds closed - 1949-54.Fish RemovalDuring 1944-45 there were 136 pounds of bullheads removed from the lake.ShorelineThere are 4 resorts, 12 cottages, and 35 boats on the lake.  Access is by roads fo the lake from State Highway 34.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fifth Crow Wing Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, three miles southwest of Nevis.  Fifth Crow Wing has a surface area of 392 acres and a maximum  depth of 35 feet.  There is no public access on the lake, however, there is a boat ramp on Sixth Crow Wing and the two lakes are connected.  Fifth Crow Wing supports an excellent panfish fishery, as well as good fishing for largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.  Fifth Crow Wing has good water quality and excellent fish habitat such as submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Fifth Crow Wing is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second Crow Wing, Sixth Crow Wing, Seventh Crow Wing, Eighth Crow Wing, Duck, Hinds, and Lower Twin.Panfish are highly sought after by anglers on Fifth Crow Wing.  Bluegill numbers (13.4 bluegill/trapnet) were down from past surveys, but still within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  While average size of bluegill was small (5.8 inches), good numbers of fish over 7.0 inches were sampled.  Bluegill growth rates were fast when compared to other class 31 lakes. Pumpkinseed are also abundant, but tend to run smaller, with few fish over 6.0 inches.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were sampled during spring electrofishing (35 black crappie/hour) as well as during the summer survey.  Black crappie had an average length and weight of 8.7 inches and 0.4 pounds.The walleye gillnet catch (2.3 walleye/gillnet) dropped from previous surveys.  The last three surveys have had higher walleyegillnets catch rates: 9.8/gillnet (1987), 4.5/net (1989), and 10.9/net (1994).  The management goal for walleye on Fifth Crow Wing is 4.0 walleye/gillnet.  Sampled walleye had a mean length and weight of 19.0 inches and 2.4 pounds, with fish measured up to 28.7 inches.  Walleye stocking is contributing heavily to the population in Fifth Crow Wing, with 30 of the 35 walleye sampled corresponding to stocked years.  Fifth Crow Wing (as well as the whole Crow Wing chain of lakes) is stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd years.  Important walleye forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in good numbers.  Fifth Crow Wing has had a history of having a low to moderate northern pike population composed of quality-sized fish.  The 1999 catch rate of 3.2 northern pike/gillnet is below the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys. Northern pike were large-sized with an average weight of 4.3 pounds and fish measured up to 38 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were fast when compared to other class 31 lakes.Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time on Fifth Crow Wing and catch rates for largemouth bass were good (53 largemouth bass/hour).  Sampled largemouth bass had an average length and weight of 11.0 inches and 1.0 pound, with fish measured up to 18.2 inches.  The number of largemouth bass sampled over 15.0 inches was low when compared to other area lakes.Other species sampled include white sucker in high numbers, with rock bass, bowfin (dogfish), and golden shiners in moderate numbers.  Yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, sculpin, and common shiner were sampled in low numbers.               </p>",
