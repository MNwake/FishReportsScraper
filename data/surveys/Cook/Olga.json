Splake (1,000 fingerlings/stocking) have been stocked in this lake annually since 1994.  This was the first of two surveys scheduled in the current (2014) lake management plan to determine whether goals for the Splake population have been met, and whether the lake continues to provide the cool, well-oxygenated waters needed by Splake and Brook Trout. <br> \n <br> \nSplake appeared to have been fairly abundant in 2016, although most were small.  Goals for Splake in this lake were met in 2016, although not by a wide margin.  The gill net catch exceeded 5.0 fish/set, at least two year classes of fish over 10 inches in length were present (actually four), and the capture of one fish larger than 16 inches met the goal of producing some fish of that size in this lake.  Long-term survival of stocked fish appeared to have been good, with Splake as old as six years taken.  Growth, however, had been slow.  Fish reached a mean length of just 11.0 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 12.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCompetition from White Sucker may have contributed to the slow Splake growth observed in 2016.  White Sucker have been present in this lake since at least 1971, and the 2016 gill net catch was similar to past catches seen in Olga Lake.  The 2016 gill net catch exceeded the normal range (2.83-14.83 fish/net) for surveys of stream trout lakes in this area, suggesting White Sucker abundance may have been excessive. <br> \n <br> \nPoor water quality may also have driven slow Splake growth.  The temperature-oxygen profile measured on 17 August 2016 found conditions suitable for Splake (water temperature < 68 F, dissolved oxygen > 5 ppm) in just a narrow range of depths (about 6.5 to 7.5 ft).  As has often been observed in deeply bog-stained lakes like Olga, the transition from warm surface waters to colder deep waters was shallow and abrupt, with cold waters at depths greater than nine feet essentially lacking oxygen entirely.  Although Olga Lake is over 40 ft deep, most of that water is unavailable to trout by the end of the summer. <br> \n</p>",

The average size for splake taken in 2004 was low; however, several fish larger than 13 inches (up to 15.4 inches) were taken.  Splake growth had been a little slower than normal, probably due to competition for forage from white sucker.  The white sucker catch in 2004 was within the normal range for stream trout lakes in this area, and it was similar to catches seen in this lake in the past.This was the first assessment done on this lake since stocking changed from brook trout to splake in 1994.  It seemed that the lake supported a splake population that was similar in number and size of fish to the brook trout population present prior to 1994.</p>",

The results of that assessment were suspect because the lake was reported to have supported some good fishing for splake the previous winter.  Splake were found in 2009.  The gill net catch fell short of the normal range (6.00 to 14.25 fish/set) for spring assessments of stream trout lakes in this area, but met the long range goal for the species (5.0 fish/gill net set) established in the 2005 lake management plan for Olga Lake.  Splake growth had been about average for the area, two-year-old fish reached a mean length of 9.2 inches by the end of their second year and three-year-old fish reached a length of 12.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker abundance appeared to have been high in 2009, although it still fell within the normal range (3.17 to 28.00 fish/gill net set) for catches in spring assessments of stream trout lakes in this area.  White sucker compete with trout for invertebrate forage, and their presence in the numbers indicated by the 2009 assessment might result in reduced growth rates for stocked splake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

GROWTH OF THE 1987 YEAR CLASS SEEMS FAIR. THE 22 INCH BROOK TROUT, AGED 5 YEARS OLD, IS A LONGEVITY RECORD FOR BROOK TROUT IN COOK COUNTY. IT IS CERTAINLY AN INDICATION THAT SQUAW LAKE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE TROPHY BROOK TROUT. WHITE SUCKER ARE VERY ABUNDANT. THIS COULD LIMIT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BROOK TROUT MANAGEMENT IN THIS LAKE, BY REDUC- ING GROWTH RATES OF BROOK TROUT.</p>",
