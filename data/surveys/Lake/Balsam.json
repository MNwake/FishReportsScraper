This is the only deep water in the lake. Migration may be occurring between the lake and Balsam Creek, a trigutary to the Manitou River. White Sucker were the only other specie sampled. Their numbers appear to be stable as the gill net catch of 7.5/lift is consistent with the past catches. A dense population of minnows is also present.</p>",

There is no record of the lake ever being stocked and Balsam Lake is not a designated stream trout lake.Brook trout were sampled in average numbers with fish up to 15.8 inches (1.5 pounds) observed.  Two-thirds of the brook trout in the sample were less than 10 inches; however, there were some quality-size fish taken with approximately one in six being over 14 inches.  Balsam Lake appears to have marginal conditions for sustaining a brook trout population but in spite of these conditions brook trout do survive and at times do fairly well.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Balsam Lake is a Brook Trout lake located eight miles north-northeast of Finland in the Finland State Forest.  It is a scenic lake with the entire shoreline in a natural undeveloped state and maintains a naturally reproducing population of Brook Trout.  The lake is 221 acres with a maximum depth of 18 feet.  The water clarity is visible to 5 feet in depth in brown bog stained water.  Muck and decaying organic matter are the most common bottom substrates across much of the lake and bog shoreline.  Gravel, rubble, boulder, and sand are found near the upland portions of the shoreline.  White-stemmed and large-leaf pondweed grow throughout the lake.  The lake is fed by two inlets one is located along the southwest shore and the other along the northwest, with the outlet of Balsam Creek on the north end. <br> \n <br> \nBalsam Lake is unique in the Finland Area as the Brook Trout population in the lake is a natural population without any known historical stockings.  However, angling is very limited as the access to the lake is very long, difficult, and not accessible by a highway legal vehicle.  An ATV can bring you within 1400 feet of the lake up to the State of Minnesota Aquatic Management Area (AMA) boundary where no motorized traffic is allowed.  As available routes to Balsam Lake change over the years it is best to contact Finalnd Area Office for latest information on how to access Balsam Lake.  <br> \n  <br> \nIn 2015, a lake survey was conducted to assess the current status of the population.  The 2015 Brook Trout catch rate was average compared to other Brook Trout lakes in the Finland Area.  The average weight was 0.8 pounds which was above average when compared to other Finland Area Brook Trout lakes.  The largest fish sampled was just shy of 14 inches long and 48% of the catch was 12 inches or longer.  Brook Trout growth was average by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nThere are large numbers of White Sucker in Balsam Lake with smaller than average size.  Minnow traps were set to inventory minnow species and sampled Brook Stickleback, Fathead Minnow, Finescale Dace, Northern Pearl Dace, and Northern Redbelly Dace. Balsam Lake is not a designated trout lake and therefore does not adhere to all applicable rules governing other designated trout lakes.  Refer to the current Minnesota State Fishing Regulations for rule applicable to angling on Balsam Lake. <br> \n</p>",
