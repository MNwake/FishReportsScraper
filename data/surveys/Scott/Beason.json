The most numerous species found during the 1994 lake survey was black bullheads. Their population far exceeded the number normally found in similar lakes. Bowfin were also found in above average numbers. The two main management species, black crappies and bluegills, were found in low numbers. Only nine black crappies and two bluegills were sampled out of nine trapnets. These species are normally stocked annually into Beason Lake, which is used as a children's fishing pond. Flooding has prevented the stocking of these species in 1993 and 1994. Northern pike, which are not normally found in this type of a lake, were also netted. Their average size was 22.4 inches and 2.6 pounds.</p>",
