                "narrative": "<p>Wirth Lake, 38-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet, is located in Wirth Park of Golden Valley.  Plenty of open shoreline exists for fishing as well as a fishing pier.  Boat access is available for electric motors only and a swimming beach provides ample room for recreational use of the lake.  Wirth Lake is managed as a Kid's Fishing Pond, and black crappie, bluegill, and channel catfish have been stocked.  Fifteen fish species were sampled during the 2001 population assessment, and the dominant fish species was bluegill.  A large number of bluegill were present, but the average size was 5 inches with some fish over 6 inches.  Black crappie have been stocked in the past but has been discontinued.  The average length of black crappie was 6 inches with few fish over 8 inches.   The presence of walleyes offers a unique opportunity to catch walleyes in a Kid's Fishing Pond.  Majority of the walleyes came from walleye stocking in 1997 and ranged in size from 17 to 21 inches.  Another predator fish species that is present in a fair number is northern pike.  The average length for northern pike was 23 inches.  Channel catfish have been stocked but none were captured during the survey suggests that they might not survived predation by larger predators.  A closely related species, black bullhead, might be misidentified, but the average length was 10 inches.  Larger largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleyes are ideal candidates for catch and release because they help control the numbers of small panfish and bullheads, which will provide opportunities for anglers to catch larger fish in the future.</p>",

Wirth Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2012 as part of the lake's regular sampling regime.  It is located within the city limits of Golden Valley, but is surrounded by Theodore Wirth Park which is administered by the city of Minneapolis.  Wirth Lake has a public fishing pier and public boat launch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance has increased since 2007 and considered average for this lake type.  Bluegill mean length was 5.27 inches (2.80-6.57 inches) and the population is dominated by smaller fish.  Bluegill growth rates were below average.  Age analysis revealed representatives from all year classes from 2005 to 2012 with strong 2008 and 2009 year classes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance has increased since 2007 and considered average for this lake type.  Black crappie mean length was 5.14 inches (4.57-7.09 inches) and is composed entirely of young fish.  Only one and two year old black crappies were caught but lengths indicate above average growth rates.  Age analysis revealed limited recruitment with only 2010 and 2011 year classes represented.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern abundance was less than 2007, but still considered average for this lake type.  Northern pike mean length was 25.75 inches (22.52-32.17 inches) and population is dominated by larger individuals.  Northern pike growth rates were above average. Age analysis revealed limited recruitment with only 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 year classes represented.    <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance has increased since 2007 and considered average for this lake type.  Yellow perch mean length was 6.44 inches (6.22-6.77 inches) and is composed only of two year old fish.  Lengths of fish indicate above average growth rates.  Age analysis revealed sporadic recruitment with only one year class represented, 2010.    <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in the 2012 survey include black bullhead, brown bullhead, green sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead.  Walleye have been sampled in past surveys but none were captured in 2012 despite fry stocking every five years. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements were taken on 8/27/2012.  The sampling site was taken in 25.4 feet of water.  Water clarity increased with a secchi disk reading of 7.0 feet from 4.2 feet in 2007.  Dissolved oxygen ranged from 0.1 to 8.8 parts-per-million (ppm) with oxygen levels falling below 4.0 ppm at 11 feet of depth. <br> \n</p>",

It is located within the city limits of Golden Valley but is surrounded by Theodore Wirth Park which is administered by the City of Minneapolis.  Wirth Lake has a public fishing pier and boat launch that provide access for fishing. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was well-above average for comparable lakes.  Bluegill ranged in size from 3.1-6.7 inches with an average length of 4.7 inches.  The majority of fish were in the 4-5.4 inch range. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was just below average for comparable lakes. Black Crappie ranged in size from 5.8-7.2 inches and were 6.4 inches on average for this survey.   <br> \n <br> \nThree Northern Pike were captured for this survey.  Northern Pike abundance was well-below-average for similar lakes.  Individual fish lengths were 25, 28, and 29 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance in Wirth Lake was average.  Largemouth Bass in this survey were small, as the largest fish captured was 8.4 inches, with an average length of 6.7 inches. Electrofishing is the optimal method for sampling Largemouth Bass, however, and that method was not used for this survey.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish captured included Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, Black Bullhead, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  Yellow Perch were captured in the previous survey (2012) but were absent in this survey.  No Walleye were captured despite four stockings-three of fry, one of fingerlings-since 2010.  Most recent stockings were of fry, in 2017 and 2018. <br> \n</p>",

BLACK BULLHEADS HAVE CON- TINUED TO DECLINE IN ABUNDANCE SINCE 1979. BLUE- GILL ABUNDANCE IS ABOUT ONE HALF OF THAT FOUND IN 1982 BUT THE AVG SIZE IS IMPROVED. WALLEYE ABUN- DANCEIS IMPROVED DUE TO INCREASED STOCKING QUOTAS. CHANNEL CATFISH SAMPLED WERE THE RESULT OF THE 1985 STOCKING.</p>",

Boat access is available for motors up to 8 hp and the swimming beach provides ample room for recreational use of the lake.  Wirth Lake is managed as a Fishing in the Neighborhood Pond (FiN). <br> \n <br> \nEleven fish species were sampled during the 2007 population assessment and the dominant fish species was bluegill.  A large number of bluegill were present however the average size was 5 inches with some fish over 6 inches.  Two black crappies were captured during this assessment. They averaged 8.3 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nOne walleye was sampled during this assessment.  Walleye fry were stocked in May of 2007.  If these fish survive, they will grow to provide an opportunity for kids to catch walleyes.  Northern pike is another predator fish that is present in numbers.  Northern pike averaged 25 inches in length and 3.6 pounds, average for this lake type.   <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish have been stocked but none were captured during the survey, suggesting that they might not have survived predation by larger predators.  Although gill nets are not the ideal sampling equipment for largemouth bass, a largemouth bass was caught during this assessment and measured 13.8 inches in length and 1.8 pounds in weight.   <br> \n <br> \nTo find out more about Wirth Park visit: www.minneapolisparks.org. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at: www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin. <br> \n</p>",

Over 30% of the bluegills sampled were larger than 7 inches. Only 2.6% of the black crappies were over 10 inches in length.Northern pike were sampled in the highest abundance since 1972. The average size of fish captured during the 1996 survey was 22.8 inches in length and weighed 2.2 pounds. Water levels have been high the past few years which has allowed northern pike to gain access to flooded marshy areas to spawn.The walleye population was the lowest number sampled in 13 years, but is still at a level considered average for this type of a lake. Walleye growth is very good due in part to the abundant shiner population. The average size walleye sampled was 17.0 inches and weighed 1.6 pounds.Black bullheads were one of the most abundant fish species captured. The average size sampled was slightly over 7.0 inches in length and weighed approximatly one quarter of a pound. Yellow bullhead were much less abundant but were much larger. They averaged 10.3 inches in length and 0.6 pounds.White suckers, carp, and golden shiners were each sampled in average numbers for this lake type. Only one pumpkinseed sunfish was sampled in this survey, while green sunfish and hybrid sunfish were captured in abundant numbers.</p>",
