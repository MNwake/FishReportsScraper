                "narrative": "<p>Lake Six is a 188-acre lake located in north-central Otter Tail County.  It has a maximum depth of 140 feet and 34% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 3.3 miles and the secchi disk reading in this survey was 12.5 feet.  Secchi disk readings, a measurement of water clarity, have ranged from 8.5 to 19.0 feet.  A DNR-owned concrete public access is located on the south shoreline.     The majority of development is located on the west and north shorelines.  Lakeshore development has been shown to negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient levels and shoreline erosion.  This can result in increased plankton/algae blooms, aquatic plant growth and suspended sediments, all of which can lead to decreased water clarity.  By using best management practices (BMP's) and \"lakescaping concepts\", impacts of shoreline development and shoreline erosion can be minimized.  Contact any county extension office for information on BMP's and your local DNR-Fisheries office for information on lakescaping techniques.     Sand composes the majority of the shoreline substrates.  The most abundant type of submerged aquatic plant is chara, a plant that can grow up to one foot or more off the bottom.  Emergent plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattails are located in areas throughout the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their important ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Walleye is the primary management specie in Lake Six.  The current walleye gill net catch rate of 5.3 fish per net is the highest recorded since the 1974 lake survey.  Walleye natural reproduction is very limited, thus stocking is needed to maintain or improve the walleye population.  Currently, large walleye fingerlings or yearlings are stocked biennially.  Average length and weight of walleye sampled in 2001 was 19.5 inches and 3.1 pounds.  The abundance of northern pike is low; however, there is potential for catching large fish.  Small tullibee are present and provide an excellent forage base for northern pike and walleye.  Abundance of bluegill, largemouth bass, and black crappie are about normal for this lake.     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all fish species in Lake Six by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and will also provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

Average weight was 1.3 pounds and pike in the sample ranged in age from I+ through III+.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance declined from 96.7 per trap net lift in 1984 to 76.8 per net, but remains more than twice the area median.  Quality size bluegill appear to be few in numbers.   <br> \n     Largemouth bass and black crappie abundances appear high, similar to previous surveys.  Reproduction for these two species appears excellent as fish aged II+ through VII+ were present in the sample.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance was 2.8 per gill net.  <br> \n     Walleye reproduction is difficult to assess as the lake has been stocked annually with fingerlings.  The average weight of walleye was 2.5 pounds.  These factors, combined with the high abundance of small tullibee and  a low littoral area suggest that this lake contains quality-sized walleye and should be managed as a trophy walleye lake. <br> \n</p>",

The bluegill and largemouth bass populations exceed area medians.   <br> \n     The northern pike and walleye populations are comprised of nice sized fish with a chance of angling a trophy. As fish grow larger, evidence shows that the northern cisco takes the pressure off the low yellow perch population as primary forage.  <br> \n     Bluegill numbers are high and fish are of a small size.   <br> \n     A total of 16,903 rainbow trout yearlings have been stocked since 1982.  Two attempts at sampling trout have been conducted with not trout sampled either time.  Netting for trout is planned for 1985. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Lake Six is a 188-acre oligotrophic (low fertility) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Vergas, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of mixed hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 140 feet; however, 34% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2019 survey was 17.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 8.5 to 19.5 feet.   <br> \n      Lakeshore development is located primarily along the west and north shorelines.  Homes and cabins compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located along the south shoreline.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent in various areas throughout the lake.  These emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and can absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants also provide spawning habitat for fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their significant ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed from the lake without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community of Lake Six. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 15.7 to 23.7 inches with an average length and weight of 18.4 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.9 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Northern Pike ranged in length from 9.5 to 35.4 inches with an average length and weight of 18.5 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 21.6 inches at five years of age.     <br> \n     Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.3 to 15.8 inches with an average length and weight of 11.1 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 11.9 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing on Lake Six by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large fish while allowing the harvest of the more numerous, smaller fish for eating.  Releasing medium to large fish ensures that the lake will have enough spawning aged fish and will also provide anglers with opportunities to catch larger fish in the future. <br> \n     Lake Six is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.         <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> Lake Six is a 188-acre lake located in north-central Otter Tail County.  The immediate watershed is composed of hardwood woodlots.  It has a maximum depth of 140 feet; however, 34% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 3.3 miles.  The secchi disk reading, the measure of water clarity, was 19.5 feet in the 2007 survey.  Readings in past surveys have ranged from 8.5 to 19.0 feet.  A DNR-owned concrete public access site is located on the south shoreline.   <br> \n     Lakeshore development is located mainly on the west and north shorelines.  Lakeshore development has been shown to negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient levels and shoreline erosion.  This can result in increased algae/plankton blooms, aquatic plant growth and suspended sediments, all of which can lead to decreased water clarity.  By using best management practices and \"lakescaping techniques\", impacts of shoreline development and shoreline erosion can be minimized. <br> \n     The shallow water substrates around Lake Six are primarily sand.  Emergent plants like hardstem bulrush and cattails are located in various areas throughout the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants also provide spawning habitat for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their significant ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed from the lake without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Walleye is one of the primary management species in Lake Six.  The walleye gill net catch rate of 0.8 fish per net is a historical low.  Walleye catch rates from previous surveys have ranged from 1.6 to 8.0 fish per net.  Walleye natural reproduction in very limited and the population is maintained by stocking.  In an attempt to increase abundance,  the walleye fingerling stocking rate will be doubled beginning in 2009.  Data from future surveys will determine if this increased stocking rate can increase the abundance of walleye in Lake Six. <br> \n     The northern pike test-net catch rate indicates that they are abundant.  Length data indicate that northern pike size structure has been impoving.  In 2007, 50% of the pike were 24.0 inches or greater in length compared to 14% in 2001 and 4% in 1996.  Average length and weight of pike was 23.2 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 23.8 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     The black crappie and largemouth bass populations have remained stable over the series of surveys.  Bluegill abundance has varied and average size is small.  Seventeen percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of their fishing experience for all species in Lake Six by using selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large fish while allowing the harvest of the more numerous, smaller fish for eating.  Releasing medium to large fish ensures that the lake will have enough spawning aged fish and will also provide anglers with opportunities to catch larger fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Lake Six is a 188-acre oligotrophic (low fertility) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Vergas, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of hardwood woodlots.  It has a maximum depth of 140 feet; however, 34% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 3.3 miles.  The secchi disk reading was 17.6 feet.  The secchi disk reading in previous surveys ranged from 8.5 to 19.5 feet.   <br> \n      Lakeshore development is located primarily along the west and north shorelines.  A DNR owned public access is located along the south shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush and cattails are located in various areas throughout the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants also provide spawning habitat for fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their significant ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed from the lake without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Lake Six.  Walleye abundance was in the normal range for this type of lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 12.7 to 22.4 inches with an average length and weight of 16.6 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     An abundant Northern Pike population exists.  Pike ranged in length from 8.7 to 31.9 inches with an average length and weight of 20.2 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 21.5 inches at five years of age.     <br> \n     A balanced Largemouth Bass population is present.  Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 7.4 to 13.5 inches with an average length of 11.1 inches.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 11.0 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has historically fluctuated due to inconsistent reproduction.  Bluegill abundance in this survey was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Thirty-one percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of their fishing experience for all species in Lake Six by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large fish while allowing the harvest of the more numerous, smaller fish for eating.  Releasing medium to large fish ensures that the lake will have enough spawning aged fish and will also provide anglers with opportunities to catch larger fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",
