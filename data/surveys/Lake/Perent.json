The US Forest Service administers the permit system for entry into BWCAW lakes for overnight camping and day use. The primary access is located on Kawishiwi Lake Road (Forest Service 354) and is a carry-in to Hog Creek followed by a three mile paddle to the lake. A standard survey was completed the week of June 24th to monitor the fish community. Sampling effort consisted of twelve gill net sets and three mini-fyke trap net sets.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 Walleye catch rate of 16.92 per gill net was above the normal range for similar lakes but consistent with previous surveys. Size ranged from 6.2 to 26.8 inches with an average size of 12.5 inches and 0.73 pounds. Small-sized keepers, from 12 to 15 inches long, accounted for 46% of the catch.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were captured at a rate of 4.25 per gill net which is above the normal range and the highest of five surveys completed on the lake to date. Size structure was good and ranged from 12.1 to 38.2 inches with an average of 21.5 inches and 2.57 pounds. Pike greater than 30 inches long made up 10% of the gill net catch.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Lake Whitefish population has remained at a high level compared to similar lakes for each of the four previous surveys of the lake. The 2019 catch rate of 3.08 per gill net was equal to the 2009 catch and just above the normal range.  <br> \n <br> \nOther important forage species in the lake include Yellow Perch and White Sucker. Yellow Perch catch was the highest of any survey to date. Although they may not be the size sought after by anglers a good number of perch do reach an acceptable size for harvest. White Sucker catch was near the normal range for similar lakes and consistent with previous surveys of the lake.   <br> \n</p>",

The average length was 13.0 inches with a range from 6.9 to 28.9 inches.  Only 28% of the walleye sampled in 2009 were greater than 14 inches; historically in Perent Lake, few walleyes over 20 inches were sampled in previous investigations.   Growth for walleyes was slower than other lakes in the Finland area. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low (1.7 per net) with an average weight of 2.8 pounds which was near the lake class median quartile.  Recruitment was stable with fish from age two to nine sampled.  Growth accelerated after age-5, when it appears the pike were able to fully utilize the whitefish as forage. <br> \n  <br> \nYellow perch, lake whitefish and rock bass were also sampled in average numbers in the 2009 Perent Lake investigation. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is completely within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) and is accessible from Hog Creek (3-mile paddle) and a portage trail from the Perent River.   The USFS administers the BWCAW and the campsites on the Perent Lake.  Permits are required and fees are charged for overnight use although day use permits are free.  Pressure on the lake was moderate during the summer and early fall weekends.  Perent Lake is not open to fall lake whitefish sport netting. <br> \n</p>",

Average size in 1990 was slightly larger (13.1 inches vs 12.1 inches). Walleye exhibit good growth thru age 3, but growth then slows for all ages. Yellow Perch have never been abundant, which is probably a factor in Walleye growth.     The Northern Pike gillnet catch decreased in 1990, but average size increased by 27%.     Lake Whitefish were sampled in far less numbers than before, however variability in netting dates may be a factor in the lower catch.</p>",
