                "narrative": "<p>Minnie Lake is a small 76 acre lake nestled in the jack pine forest of northern Hubbard County.  Minnie Lake is a shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 16.0 feet.  There is a county-owned public access located on the southeast shore of the lake.  Minnie Lake provides good angling opportunities for panfish and largemouth bass, as well as a bonus walleye and northern pike population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Minnie Lake is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Hennepin and Paine Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nMinnie Lake has an abundant panfish population and can provide good fishing for bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie.  Bluegill abundance was above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were sampled, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Surveys since 1990 have had similar black crappie catch rates, while no black crappie were sampled in the 1979 or 1985 surveys.  Anglers will find good numbers of black crappie in the 9-10 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nMinnie Lake supports an abundant largemouth bass population.  The spring electrofishing survey sampled good numbers of largemouth bass compared to other area lakes.  Sampled largemouth bass had an average length of 10.5 inches with bass measured up to 19.5 inches.  The proportion of largemouth bass sampled over 15 inches was low when compared to other area lakes.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetative cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Minnie Lake. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of walleye were sampled, with the gillnet catch rate above the range \"typical\" for this lake class, and above the current management goal.  Walleye up to 27.1 inches were sampled.  Stocking by the DNR is maintaining the walleye population in Minnie Lake.  Present and past evalutions have shown little or sporadic natural reproduction of walleye.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked biannually by the DNR from 1987 to 2003.  Starting in 2005, stocking was switched to annual stockings of walleye fry.  Future surveys on Minnie will evaluate the success of the walleye fry stockings. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are found in low numbers in Minnie Lake.  No pike were sampled during the 2006 survey.  Northern pike were sampled in low numbers during the 1990, 1996, and 2001 surveys.  Northern pike numbers are limited by lack of preferred marshy spawning habitat.  While abundance is low, some good-size pike can be present.</p>",

Minnie Lake provides good angling opportunities for panfish and largemouth bass, as well as a bonus walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Minnie is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Hennepin and Paine Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nMinnie Lake has an abundant panfish population and can provide good fishing for bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie.  Bluegill abundance (16.7 bluegill/trapnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were sampled (3.4 crappie/trapnet), within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Surveys since 1990 have had similar black crappie abundance, while no black crappie were sampled in the 1979 or 1985 surveys.  Anglers will find good numbers of black crappie in the 9-10 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nMinnie Lake supports an abundant largemouth bass population.  The spring electrofishing survey sampled good numbers of largemouth bass (76 bass/hour) when compared to other area lakes.  Sampled largemouth bass had an average length of 12.7 inches with bass measured up to 19.0 inches.  The proportion of largemouth bass sampled over 15 inches, was low when compared to other area lakes.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetative cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Minnie Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (4.5 walleye/gillnet) was down from past surveys and below the current management goal of 6.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has been slightly higher, near or above the current management goal.  Walleye up to 26.6 inches were sampled.  Stocking by the DNR is maintaining the walleye population in Minnie Lake.  Minnie Lake is stocked annually with walleye fry (75,000 fry). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are found in very low numbers in Minnie Lake.  No northern pike were sampled in the 2011 survey.  Northern pike have only been sampled in three of the seven surveys conducted on Minnie Lake.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates have been below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike numbers are limited by lack of preferred marshy spawning habitat.  While abundance is low, some large-sized pike can be present. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of white sucker, and low numbers of rock bass and golden shiner. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnie Lake is a small 75 acre lake nestled in the jack pine forest of northern Hubbard County, three miles north of the town of Lake George.  Minnie is a shallow lake, with a maximum depth of only 16 feet.  There is a county-owned public access located on the southeast shore of the lake.  Minnie Lake provides angling opportunities primarily for Largemouth Bass and Panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Minnie is in lake class 39.  Class 39 lakes are characterized by being shallow and having a high littoral area (less than 15.0 feet in depth).  Other area lakes in this same classification include Hennepin and Paine Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nMinnie Lake has an abundant panfish population and can provide good fishing for Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie.  Present and past surveys have shown the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations in Minnie to fluctuate from moderate to high numbers.  Anglers will find most Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 5-7 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 10-12 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nMinnie Lake supports an abundant Largemouth Bass population.  The spring electrofishing survey sampled good numbers of Largemouth Bass (69 bass/hour) compared to other area lakes.  Anglers will find good fishing for bass in the 12 to 15 inch size range.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetative cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass in Minnie Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Northern Pike, White Sucker, Rock Bass, Walleye, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Minnie Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnie Lake is a small 75 acre lake located three miles north of Lake George in northern Hubbard County.  Minnie is a shallow lake, with a maximum depth of only 16 feet.  There is a county-owned public access with an earthen ramp located on the southeast shore of the lake.  Minnie Lake provides angling opportunities primarily for panfish and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Minnie is in lake class 39.  Class 39 lakes are characterized as being shallow and having a high littoral area (less than 15 feet in depth).  Other area lakes in this same classification include Hennepin and Paine. <br> \n <br> \nMinnie Lake has an abundant panfish population and can provide good fishing for Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie.  Past and present surveys have shown Bluegill and Black Crappie populations in Minnie to fluctuate from moderate to high numbers.  Anglers will find most Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 5-7 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 9-11 inch size range. <br> \n   <br> \nMinnie Lake supports an abundant Largemouth Bass population.  The spring electrofishing survey sampled high numbers of Largemouth Bass when compared to other area lakes.  Anglers will find good fishing for Largemouth Bass in the 12-15 inch size range.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation, and spawning substrate provides excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass in Minnie Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe habitat in Minnie Lake is best suited for Largemouth Bass and panfish populations. However, a low density stocking of Walleye provides anglers with an additional fishing opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nPast and present surveys have shown low numbers of Northern Pike in Minnie Lake.  While abundance is low, some moderate to large-sized Northern Pike are present. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Minnie Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnie Lake is located three miles north of Lake George in northern Hubbard County.  Minnie Lake has a surface area of 76 acres and has a maximum depth of 16.0 feet.  The public access is located on the southeast shore of the lake and is owned and maintained by Hubbard County.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Minnie Lake is in Lake Class 39.  Other area lakes in this same class include Ham (5 miles east of Nevis),Hennepin (1 mile southeast of Becida), Paine (south of Lake George), Peysensky (5 miles east of Park Rapids), Rice (11 miles north of Park Rapids), Shallow (3 miles west of Nevis), Upper Twin (4 miles northeast of Menahga), Wolf (7 miles south of Nevis), Stocking (2 miles east of Nevis), and Hungry Man (2 miles northeast of Two Inlets).     The walleye catch of 5.5/gillnet is within the range typically found in lake class 39 (1.5/net - 5.8/net).  The two previous surveys had similar walleye gillnet catches; 5.5/net in 1990 and 5.0/net in 1985.  The gillnet catch from the 1979 survey was higher (10.0/net).  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 14.8 inches and 1.43 lbs, respectively.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.7 to 24.2 inches.  Walleye growth was slow when compared to other area lakes.  Little or no natural reproduction of walleye takes place in Minnie Lake, as all sampled walleye correspond to years of walleye fingerling stockings.  Minnie Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd calendar years.     Minnie Lake is known for having a low northern pike population and the 1996 survey showed no different.  Four northern pike were sampled in the gillnets (2.0/net), below the range typically found in lake class 39 (4.6/net - 11.6/net).  Northern pike numbers are limited by lack of preferred marshy spawning habitat.  While northern pike numbers are low, size range of the sample was good (21.3 to 29.3 inches).  Only three year classes of northernpike were sampled.  Northern pike growth rates are similar to other class 39 lakes.     The yellow perch gillnet catch of 31.0/net is within the range typically found for lake class 39.  Yellow perch catches were similar in the 1979 and 1985 survey, while perch numbers were low in the 1990 survey.  The yellow perch in Minnie Lake is primarily a forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations, with few perch of an acceptable size to the angler.  Average length of yellow perch was 7.2 inches, with fish measured up to 9.4 inches.     Minnie Lake supports an abundant bluegill population.  The trapnet catch of 104.3/net is well above the range typically found in lake class 39 (2.5/net - 25.0/net).  Previous surveys have also had a high trapnet catch (52.0/net - 87.0/net). Bluegill were of a quality size, with an average length of 6.9 inches and with fish measured up to 8.4 inches.  Forty-eight percent of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or larger.  Bluegill growth rates were moderate when compared to other class 39 lakes.     The black crappie trapnet catch of 4.1/net is within the range typical for lake class 39 (0.8 - 6.5) and similar to the previous survey in 1990.  No black crappie were sampled in the 1979 or 1985 survey.  Black crappie were of a moderate size, with an average length of 7.5 inches and the largest fish measuring 9.4 inches.  Black crappie growth was very slow when compared to other class 39 lakes.       Largemouth bass were sampled at a rate typical for Lake Class 35 and similar to historical netting.  Size of the sampled largemouth bass was small, ranging from 6.5 to 10.4 inches.  Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective tools in assessing largemouth bass populations.  To adequately assess largemouth bass abundance and size distribution, special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted on Minnie Lake.  Minnie Lake has good spawning areas and aquatic vegetation habitat that willinsure a healthy largemouth bass population.     Pumpkinseed trapnet catches were high at 14.8/net, above the range typically found in lake class 39 (1.4/net - 8.6/net).  Pumpkinseed were of a quality size with an average length of 6.7 inches and with fish measured up to 8.6 inches.  Forty-three percent of the pumpkinseed sample was 7.0 inches or larger.     Other species sampled were white sucker and rock bass.     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but to release medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Minnie Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnie Lake is a small 76 acre lake  nestled in the jack pine forest of northern Hubbard County.  Minnie Lake is a shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 16.0 feet.  There is a county-owned public access located on the southeast shore of the lake.  Minnie Lake is noted for providing good angling for panfish and largemouth bass and a bonus walleye and northern pike population. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Minnie Lake is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Hennepin and Paine Lake.Minnie Lake has an abundant panfish population and can provide good fishing for bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie. Bluegill abundance (20.9 bluegill/trapnet) was down compared to past surveys, however, the numbers sampled are still within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  The bluegill population in Minnie Lake is known more for numbers than size of fish.  The average length of the sampled bluegill was only 6.4 inches, however, enough larger fish are present that you can sort through the small ones and still get enough \"eaters\".  Good numbers of pumpkinseed were sampled and average size was 6.5 inches with fish measured up to 8.6 inches. Moderate numbers of black crappie were sampled, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class .  Black crappie abundance was similar in the 1990 and 1996 surveys, while no black crappie were sampled in 1979 and 1985.  Most of the black crappie sampled were in the 8 to 9 inch range.Minnie Lake supports a good largemouth bass population.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time and good numbers of largemouth bass were sampled when compared to other area lakes (77 bass/hour).  Sampled largemouth bass had an average length of 8.0 inches with bass measured up to 20.2 inches.  The numbers of largemouth bass sampled over 15.0 inches was low when compared to other area lakes.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Minnie Lake.Minnie Lake is known for having a low northern pike population.  Northern pike abundance (4.0 pike/gillnet) was up from past surveys, however, pike numbers were still below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  While abundance was low, sampled pike were good-sized with an average length of 28.0 inches.  Northern pike numbers are limited by lack of preferred marshy spawning habitat. Good numbers of walleye were sampled with the catch rate of 9.0 walleye/gillnet above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have had walleye gillnet catch rates around 5.0 walleye/gillnet.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 15.9 inches and 1.6 pounds with fish measured up to 27.2 inches.  Little or no natural reproduction of walleye is taking place in Minnie Lake as all sampled walleye correspond to years of walleye fingerling stockings.  Minnie Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd years.</p>",
