Sampled bluegill ranged from 3.3 inches and about 15% were at least 7.0 inches.  Growth was good.  About one-third of the measured fish aged to be from the 1988 year class.  Top predator species were caught in low numbers.  Northern pike (0.33/gillnet) and largemouth bass (0.33/gillnet) were represented by single individuals.  Pumpkinseed (1.0/trapnet) and black crappie (0.33/ gillnet) were also present in low numbers.  Yellow perch (2.33/gillnet) was found in average abundance for the lake class.  Four age classes of perch were sampled, 50% were from the 1989 year class.  Perch growth was good.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pennington Lake is a former open pit iron ore mine pit located in the Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area. Rainbow Trout were first stocked in 1982 and are stocked annual as yearlings (15,000/year) into Pennington and connected Mahnomen.  Temperature and oxygen conditions suitable for trout occurred from a depth of about 20' down to around 45' in July.  Rainbow Trout provide for a popular fishery, especially early in the season.  Rainbow Trout were sampled at 1.5/gillnet, with an average length of 11.4\". <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout were first stocked in Pennington in 2019 and are stocked biennially as yearlings (1,670/year).  No Lake Trout were sampled in this survey, although there are reports of anglers catching a few.  Tullibee (Cisco) were also stocked in 2019 to provide forage for the Lake Trout.  Tullibee (Cisco) were sampled in average numbers, when compared to similar lakes, at 1.3/gill net.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled in high numbers at 82.7/trap net.  Most ran on the small side with an average length of 5.5\" and only 9% at least 7.0\" in length.  Two Northern Pike were sampled, with an average length of 24.3\". <br> \n <br> \nPennington is a designated stream trout lake.  Designated stream trout lakes have additional angling regulations.  Be sure to consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations book for regulations, seasons, and possession limits before fishing designated trout waters.  <br> \n  <br> \nZebra mussels are present in Pennington Lake.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pennington Mine Pit Lake is a former open pit iron mine located north of Ironton that has filled with water.  Together with the connected Mahnomen Mine Pit Lake this complex is the largest mine pit lake in the Cuyuna Range with a total surface area of 320 acres.  The deepest water in Pennington is over 250 ft.  The water is very clear with visibility to a depth of nearly 30 ft.  A concrete boat launch is located on the west end of Pennington Mine.  A channel on the northeast end of Pennington connects to Mahnomen Mine.  Pennington is within the Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area.   <br> \n <br> \nPennington is a designated stream trout lake.  Designated stream trout lakes have additional angling regulations.  Be sure to consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations book for regulations, seasons, and possession limits before fishing designated trout waters.   <br> \n <br> \nA survey of the fish community and aquatic habitat in Pennington Mine Pit Lake was conducted in 2010.  The fish community was assessed with 3 gill net and 3 trap nets.  The total catch in the gill nets was 4 fish per set, and this was low compared to other Cuyuna mine pit lakes where average gill net catches have ranged from 2 to 63 total fish in recent surveys (median of 9.7 fish per net).  Only two species were captured in the gill nets: rainbow trout and northern pike.  The rainbow trout (3 per gill net) were all age-1 fish from the spring 2010 stocking of 20,062 rainbow yearlings and ranged in length from 9 to 11 inches.  With an average weight at capture of 0.5 lbs, the rainbow trout did show some growth after stocking.  The April 5 stocking of 10,500 yearlings had an average weight of 0.3 lbs and the May 3 stocking of 9,562 yearlings had an average weight of 0.4 lbs at stocking.  Two of the northern pike captured in the gill nets were 33 inches long, and the third was 28 inches long for an average weight of 7 lbs per fish.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most common fish in the trap nets with average catch of 55 per set.  Bluegills ranged from 3 to 6 inches long.  Rock bass were the second most abundant species in the trap nets at 2.7 per net.  The catch of other species was fewer than 2 fish per trap net.   <br> \n <br> \nSeveral other fish species were found in a concurrent survey of the connected Mahnomen Mine Pit Lake that were not found in Pennington.  These species included: bowfin, burbot, smallmouth bass, walleye, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  All of these species could likely be found in Pennington.   <br> \n <br> \nTemperature and oxygen conditions suitable for trout occurred from a depth of about 16 ft down to about 42 ft.  The water was extremely clear with visibility about 30 ft.  The water chemistry had low phosphorus and chlorophyll, but had fairly high ionic strength and alkalinity.   <br> \n <br> \nNear shore substrates were primarily sand with some gravel and cobble.  Submerged trees which extend nearly to the surface are common in areas of medium depth - about 10 to 30 ft deep.   <br> \n <br> \nRainbow trout were first stocked into Pennington Mine Pit in 1982.  Since the early 1990's usually about 20,000 spring yearling rainbow trout have been stocked annually.  Starting in 2011 Pennington is scheduled to receive 15,000 rainbow trout yearlings annually.  Some of the Pennington quota has been stocked into the connected Mahnomen Mine Pit (18-0440-00) in recent years.  Trout stocked in the Mahnomen complex are recorded as being stocked into Pennington.   <br> \n <br> \nSee the Mahnomen Mine Pit Lake (18-0440-00) 2010 survey report for more survey information on this complex of mine pit lakes.   <br> \n</p>",
