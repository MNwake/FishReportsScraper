                "narrative": "<p>Walleye abundance in Alpine Lake in 2002 was about average for a lake of this type, and for this lake historically.  Average size of walleye present was excellent, with most of the catch in the 16 to 22-inch length range.  All walleye taken in 2002 had been produced naturally.  Walleye growth had been fast, despite the apparent lack of forage species.  They may have been feeding on 'dwarf' cisco, too small to have been taken in the gill nets used in this assessment.Northern pike and smallmouth bass catches were low compared to similar lakes, but were similar to catches seen in the past in Alpine Lake.  It is likely that spawning success or recruitment are poor for both species.  Northern pike growth rates appeared to have been fast; they too may have had access to a cisco (or small lake whitefish) forage base.The 2002 catch of lake whitefish was the lowest to date in this lake, and northern cisco (tullibee), which were abundant in 1990 and 1984, were not taken at all.  The northern cisco in this lake have been described as a 'dwarf' variety, which can sometimes be too small to be taken in standard gill nets.</p>",
