                "narrative": "<p>Leif Lake is primarily suited for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish and these are generally the fish species most anglers target in this lake.  Walleyes are present in the fishery, as well.  Northern Pike and Walleye catch rates were at their historical highs for Leif Lake in 2013.  Walleyes sampled in 2013 were primarily the result of stocking, which was resumed in 2006 when the public access was constructed.  The current management plan calls for annual Walleye stocking to continue.  Walleyes sampled in test nets in 2013 averaged 14.4 inches in length with an average weight of 1.2 pounds.  Walleyes do not grow rapidly in this lake, likely because of the historically low numbers of Yellow Perch.  Yellow Perch are a primary forage for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass in most Minnesota lakes and an important part of the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills and other sunfishes remained relatively strong in number compared to other similar lakes, but Bluegill catch rates were historically low for this lake at 20.7 per trap net.  The average length of sampled Bluegills was 5.7 inches in 2013 and, for the first time since 1998, a few fish over eight inches were found.  Interestingly, over half the Bluegills sampled in 1967 (the initial survey) were longer than eight inches.  Fishing harvest is likely responsible for the recent decline in Bluegill sizes.  Anglers tend to keep Bluegills longer than 6.5 to 7.0 inches and throw back smaller ones.  This would explain the sharp cutoff of larger Bluegills in Leif Lake.  It takes about eight or nine years for Bluegills to reach lengths over eight inches in Leif Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Black Crappies were also found in moderate numbers in 2013.  Crappies were generally small and young. <br> \n <br> \nLike most Minnesota lakes, Leif Lake's shoreline has been subject to heavy development during recent years.  Increasing shoreline development has been shown to put added pressure on a lake's fishery and its water quality which also affects shoreline property values.  Shoreline and watershed property owners are encouraged to use best management practices on their land.  Shoreline buffer zones and emergent vegetation stands are particularly important to the lake's water quality and fish populations.  Anglers are encouraged to keep smaller fish for eating and release larger ones to promote a healthy and balanced fishery.  Anglers are encouraged to release Northern Pike 24-inches or longer and Bluegills longer than seven inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Leif Lake was conducted on August 30-31, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at fourteen sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due soft sediments and dense vegetation. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured twenty species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Leif Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Leif Lake was fully supporting aquatic life use. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leif Lake is primarily suited for northern pike, bass, and panfish and these are generally the fish species most anglers target in this lake.  A few walleyes are present in the fishery, as well.  They may be immigrants from Big Cormorant or naturally reproduced because none have been stocked since 1984 due to concerns about the low perch population and a management emphasis on panfish and northern pike.  Yellow perch are a primary forage for walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass in most Minnesota lakes.Bluegills and other sunfishes were the most abundant species in test net catches.  Average sizes of these fish have decreased in the past five years and the average length of sampled bluegills was 5.2 inches in 2003.  No bluegills larger than 7.4 inches or older than six years were found in 2003.  In 1998, half the test net catch of bluegills were fish older than six years and, as a result, the average size of those bluegills was larger.  Fishing harvest is likely responsible for the recent decrease in bluegill sizes.  Anglers tend to keep bluegills longer than about 6.5 to 7.0 inches and throw back smaller ones.  This would explain the sharp cutoff of larger bluegills in Leif Lake.Test net catches of largemouth bass have increased to a level that is typical for this lake.  Spawning habitat for this species, as well as bluegill, is in ample supply in Leif Lake.  Smallmouth bass are rare, but can also immigrate from Big Cormorant Lake.Like most Minnesota lakes, Leif Lake's shoreline has been subject to heavy development during recent years.  Increasing shoreline development has been shown to put added pressure on a lake's fishery and its water quality which also affects shoreline property values.  Shoreline and watershed property owners are encouraged to use best management practices on their land.  Shoreline buffer zones and emergent vegetation stands are particularly important to the lake's water quality and fish populations.  Anglers are encouraged to keep smaller fish for eating and release larger ones to promote an healthy and balanced fishery.  Anglers are encouraged to release northern pike 24 inches or longer and bluegills longer than seven inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leif is a 488-acre, highly developed lake located in western Becker County, near Audubon, MN.  The lake is surrounded by hardwood forest and agricultural land.  The lake has a mean water clarity of 5.8 feet and maximum depth of 26.0 feet.  Leif Lake has one intermittent inlet located on the north shore from Dahlberg Lake and an intermittent outlet is located on the south shore connecting to Big Cormorant Lake.  There is a public boat access located in one of the southeastern bays, north of Becker County Road 6. <br> \n <br> \nTo assess the fish community, surveys were conducted during the months of May and August 2018.  These surveys used gill nets, trap nets, and night electrofishing to sample fish species such as Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2018, Bluegill abundance increased and was near the historical average for Leif Lake.  Bluegills were slow growing and ranged in size from 2.8 to 8.9 inches.  Bluegills greater than 8.0 inches were typically seven to 10 years old.  It is recommended anglers keep smaller Bluegills and release the majority of larger Bluegills to maintain a balanced population. <br> \n <br> \nVery few Largemouth Bass are typically caught using trap nets during fish surveys.  Spring electrofishing is a better technique for capturing bass, and night electrofishing was completed in 2018.  Largemouth Bass were found to be abundant, with 31.6 bass captured per hour of shocking time.  Bass averaged 12.0 inches in length, with 50% of the fish measured being over 12 inches.  The largest Largemouth Bass measured was almost 17 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance increased in 2018 and set a new historic high for Leif Lake.  Pike were small, averaging 19.0 inches long, with only 4% of the population being greater than 24 inches.  Anglers are reminded of the new Northern Pike regulations, which should provide additional protection for the larger pike that do exist in Leif Lake, while also reducing the abundance of small pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was below average for Leif Lake but the average length was respectable at 17.9 inches.  Walleyes averaged 2.0 pounds and ranged from 11.3 to 27.6 inches in length.  A total of seven year classes were sampled with 62.5% of the population being 2 to 5 years old.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie averaged 8.0 inches and were abundant in comparison to previous surveys.  The population consisted of mostly smaller fish with the largest being 10.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was the lowest observed since 1989 and may be attributed to the high abundance of small Northern Pike.  Only three Yellow Perch were sampled in 2018 and averaged 5.8 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during this survey included Golden Shiner, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  Common Carp were first sampled in 1977 but were not sampled in 2018.  The highly developed shorelines make it even more important for shoreline property owners to preserve the aquatic habitat.  Well established aquatic habitat is important in protecting shorelines from eroding and the lake from pollutants.  Aquatic plants provide cover, food, spawning habitat, and rearing areas for fish and for the insects and small animals they eat.  Maintaining these areas in a natural state will help protect and preserve the water quality and fish community on this lake for the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leif Lake has a history of providing good bass, panfish, and northern pike fishing with an occasional walleye as well.  Its points, bays, islands, and vegetation stands provide a variety of habitat for a variety of fish species.While northern pike have been relatively abundant in Leif Lake and there is a shortage of their preferred forage (yellow perch), growth rates did not appear to have been seriously impacted.  Growth was average for this species and there was a wide range of sizes present up to 30 inches (about seven pounds).  Larger pike were rare which was likely due to fishing pressure.Test net catches of walleye were within the normal range for similar lakes despite the fact none have been stocked since 1984.  Walleye stocking has not resumed primarily due to the fact that yellow perch (primary forage) are already dangerously low in number.  Immigration from Big Cormorant and minimal natural reproduction probably accounted for the 1998 walleye population in Leif Lake.Despite the fact that bluegills grew somewhat slower than normal in this lake, there were good numbers of fish larger than seven inches.  Most anglers consider these \"keepers.\"Black crappies and largemouth bass were caught in test nets.  However, abundances of these two species were difficult to assess with mid-summer test nets and not much could be reliably stated about them except that they were present.Increasing demand for shoreline and the close proximity to the Fargo-Moorhead area have led to drastically increased development on Leif Lake.  Although it is a relatively productive lake, its size makes it vulnerable to overfishing.  Riparian owners and anglers can help to sustain Leif Lake's fishery, water quality, and property values in several ways including: (1) exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, (2) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus-free fertilizers, (3) leaving shoreline buffer zones of unmowed, natural vegetation, (4) leaving intact aquatic vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattails),  (5) following best management practices with all shoreline work, and (6) releasing a portion of medium-sized fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leif Lake is primarily suited for northern pike, bass, and panfish and these are generally the fish species most anglers target in this lake.  A few walleyes are present in the fishery, as well.  Three-fourths of the walleyes sampled in 2008 were either immigrants from Big Cormorant or naturally reproduced because none were stocked between 1984 and 2005.  Walleye stocking was resumed in 2006 and the current plan calls for biennial stocking to continue.  It remains to be seen if stocking will be effective at increasing walleye catches in Leif Lake.  Walleyes sampled in test nets in 2008 averaged 17.3 inches in length with an average weight just under two pounds.  Walleyes do not grow rapidly in this lake, likely because of the historically low numbers of yellow perch.  Yellow perch are a primary forage for walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass in most Minnesota lakes and an important part of the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills and other sunfishes were the most abundant species in test net catches.  Average sizes of these fish have decreased over the past few decades and the average length of sampled bluegill was just 5.0 inches in 2008.  No bluegills larger than 8.0 inches have been found in test nets since the 1998 survey.  Interestingly, over half the bluegills sampled in 1967 (the initial survey) were longer than eight inches.  Fishing harvest is likely responsible for the recent decrease in bluegill sizes.  Anglers tend to keep bluegills longer than about 6.5 to 7.0 inches and throw back smaller ones.  This would explain the sharp cutoff of larger bluegills in Leif Lake.  It takes about eight or nine years for bluegills to reach lengths over eight inches in Leif Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass and black crappies were also found in moderate numbers in 2008.  Crappies were generally small and young. <br> \n <br> \nLike most Minnesota lakes, Leif Lake's shoreline has been subject to heavy development during recent years.  Increasing shoreline development has been shown to put added pressure on a lake's fishery and its water quality which also affects shoreline property values.  Shoreline and watershed property owners are encouraged to use best management practices on their land.  Shoreline buffer zones and emergent vegetation stands are particularly important to the lake's water quality and fish populations.  Anglers are encouraged to keep smaller fish for eating and release larger ones to promote a healthy and balanced fishery.  Anglers are encouraged to release northern pike 24-inches or longer and bluegills longer than seven inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leif Lake is a relatively shallow (25' max. depth, 65% less than 15ft.), irregularily shaped lake withnumerous bays, islands, and peninsulas. It has the potential to winterkill in severe winters.  An abundance ofnorthern pike and sunfish have been present since the earliest survey in 1967.  Modest largemouth bass and blackcrappie populations are also present.  Standard lake survey gear does not sample these species adequately andelectrofishing or spring trapnetting should be conducted to thoroughly evaluate them.  Local anglers report thisto be one of the better bass lakes in the area and black crappies are an attraction in late winter and earlyspring.     All species appear to have below average growth rates in this lake.  Northern pike (after age three) andbluegills exhibit particularily slow growth.  Northern pike growth is likely slowed by a scarcity of yellow perch,its preferred food.  The bluegill's slow growth can be attributed to competition in the overabundant panfishpopulation.     A small walleye population is present as a result of walleye stocking efforts in the 1970's and early 1980's. It is comprised of older fish averageing 4.6 lbs.  Walleye stocking in the 1970's and early 1980's may have beeninstrumental in triggering a decline of the yellow perch population that was relatively abundant in 1967 but isnow negligible.  An abundant black bullhead population present in 1967 has declined to very low levels andapparently been replaced by a modest yellow bullhead population.  Yellow bullhead are generally more desireablein that they are considered to taste better, attain a larger size, and are less prolific than black bullheads.     Carp were first documented as being present in the 1977 survey.  Although they have increased in abundance,they have not experienced the population explosion that some predicted.  At this time they do not appear to havesignificantly impacted either water quality or the rest of the fish community.  What impact they may have in thefuture is not known.     The prospect exists for continued development on the remaining lakeshore of this lake and critical habitatareas should be identified and considered for aquisition in order to protect them.  General information andtechnical advice should be provided to lakeshore owners to encourage protection of aquatic and shoreline habitatsand minimize impacts to the lake from development.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leif Lake (also known as Leaf Lake) is a 488-acre, heavily developed lake located in western Becker County, near Audubon, MN.  The lake is surrounded by hardwood forest and agricultural land.  Leif Lake has one intermittent inlet located on the north shore from Dahlberg Lake and an intermittent outlet is located on the south shore connecting to Big Cormorant Lake.  The outlet is a 24-inch culvert under Becker County Road 6.  A standard fisheries survey was completed in August 2023 to assess the fish populations in Leif Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find a high number of Northern Pike in Leif Lake, however, most of these fish will be on the small side.  The average size of the pike captured was 20 inches, but one 36-inch fish was measured.  Walleye numbers are well above average for the lake and the size is good.  About 81% of the Walleye captured in 2023 were over 15 inches and 33% were over 20 inches.  Bluegill numbers were up for the lake and fish over eight inches were present.  Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were captured in low numbers in the nets, which is often the case with this sampling gear.  Black Crappie up to nine inches long were measured and Largemouth Bass up to 16.5 inches were captured.  Other fish species observed were Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.</p>",
