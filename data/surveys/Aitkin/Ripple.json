                "narrative": "<p>Ripple Lake is located about five miles south of Aitkin and is one of the more popular fishing lakes in southwestern Aitkin County.  Summer anglers target walleye, northern pike, bluegill and black crappie.  Winter anglers on Ripple Lake target primarily northern pike and black crappie. The public access, which is located on the Ripple River between Ripple and Diamond lakes, is unsafe for vehicular traffic during the winter season, however access is possible by foot.  Ripple Lake is part of the Ripple River chain of lakes.  Currently it is possible to access Elm Island Lake via the inlet during normal flows with most watercraft.  Downstream, the type C water control structure impedes motor boat traffic to Diamond and Hanging Kettle Lakes during most flow regimes. Canoe access is unlimited from Ripple Lake to the Mississippi River, and upstream to Sjodine Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in Ripple Lake has remained fairly stable over the survey history of the lake. The northern pike size structure is desirable for a small lake with a mean size of about 24 inches, and about 10% over 30 inches. Growth rates are near average for the county and statewide, and yellow perch are likely the primary food source, with shorthead redhorse and white sucker providing forage for larger individuals. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye fishery in Ripple Lake is supported by a walleye stocking program that has typically produced 2 to 3 fish per net in the past and was just slightly above that in 2008 at 3.22 per net. It is too soon to determine whether the increase in stocking rate in 2006 will result in an increase in walleye abundance.  Growth rates for walleye were near average, and some fish over 26 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nCisco have never been abundant in Ripple Lake, but had been observed in gill net assessments in 1970, and 1980-1998.  They have not been sampled in the last two gill net assessments in 2003 and 2008.  Water temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles suggest that the conditions at all depths were very near or below thresholds for survival of this coldwater species (Figure 1). <br> \n <br> \nThe abundant hardstem bulrush and wild rice beds along the shoreline of the lake provide ample cover for both bluegill and black crappie.  Thirty six percent of bluegills sampled in 2008 were greater than 7 inches long.  Black crappie catches remained high for this lake type at 19.1 per gill net. The winter black crappie fishery has increased in recent years to the point that some lake shore owners have requested that we limit access to the lake in the winter.  This is not feasible for a variety of reasons, including that the primary winter access is currently via private property. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers have decreased substantially since 2003, which is a bit of a concern for the existing walleye and pike fisheries since perch are their main forage.  However, variations in abundance of yellow perch similar to this have been previously observed, and the change does not appear to be due a trend in decreasing abundance.  There did not appear to be any major changes in walleye or northern pike abundance. <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ripple Lake, located about five miles south of Aitkin, is part of the lower Ripple River chain of lakes.  There is a public access located in the outlet channel a short distance downstream from the lake.  Motor vehicle travel from this access is not recommended during the winter due to flowing water.  During open water periods, most boaters are able to navigate upstream to Elm Island Lake at normal water levels.  Downstream travel to Diamond Lake is limited by a water control structure and only practical with a canoe or other small craft, however paddlers can navigate all the way to the Mississippi River and beyond.  The water is heavily tannin stained, appearing brown, and the shoreline is characterized by having numerous points and bays, with good stands of hardstem bulrush and wild rice.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in 2018 (1.6/gill net) decreased slightly from 2013 (2.2/gill net) and was near the lower end of the expected range for similar lake types.  Walleye have been stocked regularly at a variety of sizes and frequencies since the 1980's.  The catch rates in the ten surveys conducted since then have ranged from 1.6 to 3.4 per gill net.  Historically, stocking efforts along with some natural reproduction have supported a moderate Walleye population near the average for similar lake types, but no natural reproduction has been observed since 1991 and survival of stocked fingerlings appears lower than it used to be.  Several stocked year classes were identified in this survey suggesting that efforts have been somewhat successful at maintaining a modest walleye population, typical for this type of lake.  Walleye grew fast and were nearly 17 inches after 4 years.  The sample averaged 17 inches, with fish observed over 26\".   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 catches of Bluegill and Black Crappie were similar to historic surveys.  Black Crappie abundance was well above the expected range for similar lakes, while Bluegill abundance was moderately low.  Crappie growth is slow, with few fish exceeding 10 inches long. Multiple year classes indicate annual natural reproduction.  Bluegill exhibit much better size and growth characteristics than crappie, likely in part due to their relatively low abundance.  Sizes in the 2018 trap net catch averaged 6.0 inches, with 35% measuring greater than 7 inches and the largest just over 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance (5.3/gill net) increased somewhat since the previous survey (3.1/gill net) and was above the historic average for the lake (3.5/gill net).  Sizes ranged from 15.8\" to 28.8\", and averaged 20.7\" and 1.9 pounds.  While growth rates of pike in Ripple Lake have historically been slightly above local and statewide averages, they were very near average for the area in 2018.   Anglers are encouraged to release larger pike to help protect their role in maintaining quality size structure of many species, and to maximize the sporting benefit for multiple anglers by recycling these quality fish.   <br> \n <br> \nMaintaining the good bulrush and rice beds is important for both fish and wildlife resources.  In addition, coarse woody habitat such as fallen trees and branches offer additional habitat that should be left in place for the benefit of most fish species in Ripple Lake.  While it can be inconvenient when a tree falls into one's dock or swimming area, consider moving it to an area along your shoreline that is clear of your activity, rather than removing it from the lake.  Benefits of good habitat stewardship are often rewarded with good fishing. <br> \n</p>",

Trap net catch rates for rock bass, bluegill and black crappie are all lower than their respective first regional quartiles. Northern pike ranged from two to six years of age with a strong year class established in 1984. Growth rates for all increments are nor- mal. Bluegill ranged from one to six years of age with a strong year class established in 1984. Growth rates are normal for all increments ages one to five. Black crappie ranged from one to eight plus years of age with strong year classes established in 1983 and 1985. Growth rates form the second and third increments are thirty percent and twenty percent slower than normal respectively. Growth rates are normal for all other increments calculated. Yellow perch ranged from one to five years of age with strong year classes established in 1984 and 1985. Growth rates for the first and second increments are thirty-one percent and twenty six percent slower than normal respectively. Growth rates for the third through fifth increments are normal. Walleye ranged from one to eight plus years of age with strong year classes established in 1981, 1983 and 1986. The 1986 year class corresponds to the last year that walleye fingerlings were stocked. Growth rate for the first and second increments is slow while growth rates for the sixth, seventh and eighth increments appear to be fast although the sample size of the older fish is small to be statistically significant. Yellow perch increased in abundance significantly from 2.89 per gillnet in 1980 to 21.7 gillnet in 1987. Walleye increased in abundance significantly from 1.77 per gillnet in 1980 to 3.4 per gillnet in 1987. Based on tables, developed by Dennis Schupp, of the relative percentage of change in numbers of gill net caught fish which would be necessary to state with relatively accurate statistical certainty that a population has changed from one assessment to the next.</p>",

Summer anglers target walleye, northern pike, bluegill and black crappie.  Northern pike, which were of average abundance for this lake type, showed a wide range of sizes with several fish over 30 inches sampled during the survey.  Walleye are present in good numbers, with a wide range of sizes available to the knowledgeable walleye angler. The abundant hardstem bulrush and wild rice beds along the shoreline of the lake provide ample cover for both bluegill and black crappie.  Winter anglers target primarily northern pike and black crappie. The public access, which is located on the Ripple River between Ripple and Diamond lakes, is unsafe for vehicular traffic during the winter season.  Foot access is possible.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Ripple Lake was conducted on August 15, 2023 by Aitkin Area Fisheries staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen sampling stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 4 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including 4 species that were intolerant of disturbance (ie., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass) and one that was tolerant of disturbance (ie., Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Ripple Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life used determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to Mississippi River (Brainerd) Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ripple Lake, located about five miles south of Aitkin, is part of the lower Ripple River chain of lakes.  There is a public access located in the outlet channel a short distance downstream from the lake.  Motor vehicle travel from this access is not recommended during the winter due to flowing water.  During open water periods, most boaters are able to navigate upstream to Elm Island Lake at normal water levels.  Downstream travel to Diamond Lake is limited by a water control structure. During low water conditions, this is only practical with a canoe or other small craft; however, paddlers can navigate all the way to the Mississippi River and beyond.  The water is heavily tannin stained, appearing brown, and the shoreline is characterized by having numerous points and bays, with good stands of hardstem bulrush and wild rice.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in 2023 (3.0 per gill net) increased from 2018 (1.6 per gill net) and was at the upper end of the expected range for similar lake types.  Walleye have been stocked regularly at a variety of sizes and frequencies since the 1980's.  The catch rates in the eleven surveys conducted since then have ranged from 1.6 to 3.4 per gill net.  Several stocked year classes were identified in this survey suggesting that efforts have been somewhat successful at maintaining a modest walleye population, typical for this type of lake.  Walleye growth was average, reaching 15 inches in their fourth year.  The Walleye sample averaged 16 inches long and 1.7 pounds, with fish ranging from 7.5 to 25.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 catche rates of Bluegill and Black Crappie were similar to historic surveys, with Black Crappie abundance well above the expected range for similar lakes and Bluegill abundance more typical.  Crappie growth is slow, with few fish exceeding 10 inches long and needing  8-12 years to reach that size. Black Crappie averaged 8.2 inches, with a maximum size of 10.6 inches long.  Bluegill exhibited much better size and growth characteristics than crappie, likely in part due to their more moderate abundance.  Bluegill, in the 2023 trap net catch, averaged 6.3 inches, with 37% measuring greater than 7 inches and the largest was 8.3 inches. Multiple year classes of each species indicated annual natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance (8.4 per gill net) increased since the previous survey (5.3 per gill net) and was the highest that has been previously observed.   Catch rates of 3-5 per gill net are more typical at Ripple Lake.  Sizes ranged from 14.9 to 33.9 inches, and they averaged 23.3 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Growth rates of Pike in Ripple Lake were average for the area, reaching 20 inches in about 4 years.   Anglers are encouraged to release larger pike to help protect their role in maintaining quality size structure of many species, and to maximize the sporting benefit for multiple anglers by recycling these quality fish.   <br> \n <br> \nMaintaining the good bulrush and rice beds is important for both fish and wildlife resources.  In addition, coarse woody habitat such as fallen trees and branches offer additional habitat that should be left in place for the benefit of most fish species in Ripple Lake.  While it can be inconvenient when a tree falls into one's dock or swimming area, consider moving it to an area along your shoreline that is clear of your activity, rather than removing it from the lake.  Benefits of good habitat stewardship are often rewarded with good fishing. <br> \n <br> \nLastly, one Rusty Crayfish was also observed during this survey.  Rusty Crayfish are invasive and can significanly alter habitat in lakes.  Close attention to Crayfish will be paid in future assessments to determine how they progress in this environment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ripple Lake, located about five miles south of Aitkin, is part of the lower Ripple River chain of lakes.  There is a public access located in the outlet channel a short distance downstream from the lake.  Motor vehicle travel from this access is not recommended during the winter due to flowing water.  During open water periods, most boaters are able to navigate upstream to Elm Island Lake at normal water levels.  Downstream travel to Diamond Lake is limited by a water control structure and only practical with a canoe or similar craft, however paddlers can navigate all the way to the Mississippi River and beyond.  The shoreline is characterized by having numerous points and bays, with good stands of hardstem bulrush and wild rice, and the water is heavily tannin stained, appearing brown. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked regularly at a variety of sizes and frequencies since the 1980's, and the 2013 catch rate was similar to previous surveys over that time.  Several stocked year classes were identified suggesting that efforts have been successful at maintaining a walleye population typical for this type of lake.  Walleye exhibited slow growth, but displayed a nice range of sizes with fish sampled over 28\".   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2013 catches of bluegill and crappie were similar to historic surveys.  Black crappie abundance was well above the expected range for similar lakes, while bluegill abundance was moderately low.  Crappie growth was slow, and while fish greater than 10\" long were seldom captured in survey gear in the past, several strong year classes indicate annual natural reproduction.  Bluegill exhibit much better size and growth characteristics than crappie, in part due to their relatively low abundance.  Size from the 2013 trap net catch averaged 6.3\", with 48% measuring greater than 7\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has also remained at low levels and they have maintained a favorable size structure throughout the lake's survey history.  The 2013 gill net catch ranged in length from 17.1 to 32.4\",  and averaged 21.8\" and 2.3 pounds, with 21% greater than 24\".  Growth rates of pike in Ripple Lake have historically been slightly above local and statewide averages, and this is likely due to a robust forage base of perch and various sucker species.  Anglers are encouraged to release larger pike to help protect their role in maintaining quality size structure of many species, and to maximize the sporting benefit for multiple anglers by recycling these quality fish.   <br> \n <br> \nMaintaining the good bulrush and rice beds is important for both fish and wildlife resources.  In addition, coarse woody habitat such as fallen trees and branches offer additional habitat that should be left in place for the benefit of most fish species in Ripple Lake.  While it can be inconvenient when a tree falls into one's dock or swimming area, consider moving it to an area along your shoreline that is clear of your activity, rather than removing it from the lake.  Benefits of good habitat stewardship are often rewarded with good fishing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special assessment targeting near shore fish species was conducted on Ripple Lake on July 29, 2013.  This survey was completed in addition to the standard population assessment conducted the week of July 29, 2013.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (14 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations, but six sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at nine sites.  Nearshore sampling captured several non-game fish species including bluntnose minnow, central mudminnow, golden shiner, Johnny darter, and spottail shiner.  The preliminary IBI score (per Drake and Pereira, 2002) calculated from this survey, and using standard gill net and trap net data from the population assessment, was 70.  This value was lower than the previous score of 83 calculated  in 2008, using the same methods.  The late spring and cooler water temperatures experienced in 2013 may have reduced the likelihood of catching some species, resulting in a lower score. <br> \n</p>",

The average length was about 6 inches and 15% were greater than 7 inches.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were also sampled in Ripple Lake. The average pumpkinseed was 5.5 inches in length.  Black crappie ranged from one to seven years of age with a strong year-class indicated for 1996.  The gill and trap net indices for black crappie were higher than average for this lake class.  The typical black crappie sampled in the gill nets was about 7.5  inches in length, and about 20% were 8 inches or larger.  Northern pike ranged from one to eight years of age with a strong year-class indicated for 1995.  The northern pike population is average in abundance for this lake class.  The typical pike in Ripple Lake was about 21 inches and 1.5 pounds.  The longest individual pike measured was 36 inches in length and slightly over 10% were 25 inches or greater.  Walleye ranged from two to eleven years of age.  The 1989 and 1992 - 1996 year-classes correspond to stocking of walleye fingerling and fry.  Spawning activity has been documented on the Ripple River upstream from Ripple Lake and is occasionally successful as was indicated by the presence of 1991, 1988, and 1987 year classes.  The walleye population is slightly above average in abundance for this lake class. Yellow perch ranged in age from one to five years with a strong year-class indicated from 1996. Yellow perch were sampled within the species normal range for abundance.  This species provides a good forage base for the northern pike and walleye populations.  The bowfin and yellow bullhead trap net catch indices decreased from the 1992 assessment.  The gill next indices for tullibee and black bullhead were lower than average for this lake type.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of nearshore fish species was conducted on August 1, 2016 by IBI Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations, but 2 stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 5 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 5 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 4 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 21 species of fish including 5 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, and Rock Bass) and 2 that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead and Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2013 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for Ripple Lake is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and is indicative of a healthy fish community.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Ripple Lake is located in the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

The gill net indices for Tullibee, White Sucker, and Black bullhead were below their respective lake class 32 first quartiles.  The trap net index for Rock Bass was below its lake class 32 first quartile. Northern Pike (27 of 27 aged) ranged from two to eight plus years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1988 and 1989.  Growth rates for the first and second annual increments were faster than normal. Growth rates for the fourth, sixth, and seventh annual increments were slower than normal.  Total length at formation of seventh annulus was normal. Bluegill (63 of 194 aged) ranged from two to eight plus years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1989.  The growth rate for the second annual increment was slower than normal.  The growth rate for the fourth annual increment is faster than normal.  Total length at formation of the fifth annulus was normal.  Black Crappie (72 of 213 aged) ranged from one to eight plus years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1989 and 1991.  Growth rates for the first through the fifth annual increments were normal.  Yep (35 of 162 aged) ranged from two to six years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1989.  The growth rate for the first annual increment was slower than normal.  Walleye (27 of 29 aged) ranged from one to eight years of age.  The 1984, 1986, 1989, and 1990 year classes correspond to stocked year classes and were the strongest year classes observed. Spawning activity has been documented on the ripple river upstream from Ripple Lake and is occasionally successful as was indicated by the presence of the 1985, 1987, and 1991 year classes. Growth rates for the first through the fifth annual increments was normal.  Bluegill trap net catch index increased from the 1987 assessment to the 1992 assessment (Wilcoxon's signed rank test: p=0.0262, n=11).</p>",
