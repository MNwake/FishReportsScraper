Cattail, spikerush, yellow waterlily, bladderwort and largeleaf pondweed are present.  Lake bed soils are judged to be 40% muck, 20% boulder and rubble, 20% sand/gravel covered with muck, 15% boulder and sand and 5% sand and gravel.  One inlet was dry on the west shore.  The outlet on the north shore is blocked at the lake by a road grade formed by Federal Forest Service Road 172. On the east shore there is an outlet blocked by a beaver dam.  The lake map is not correct, showing the eastern outlet as an inlet.No gill nets were set because of the shallow nature of the lake or the weedy character of some areas.  Shoreline seining was not undertaken as no suitable areas were seen.  Only three white sucker were caught in trap nets.It is said that anglers have tried fishing the lake, but no fish were caught.  Local residents report that no angling has taken place in recent years.  However, people trap minnows here.  Cottages and boats are absent and there is no designated public access.</p>",
