                "narrative": "<p>Kimball Lake is 190 acres in size and is located about six miles east of Jenkins.  The lake is just upstream from Ossawinnamakee Lake, in that chain.  A public access is present on the south shore.  The lake is classified as a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is very good for the area.  About 20% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  Shallow water soils are a combination of sand and marl, with some gravelly areas also present.  Diversity of the aquatic plant community is rather low.  Emergent species like bulrush, often provide preferred spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Such plant species are rare in Kimball Lake.  Submergent species grow to a depth of about 25 feet in the lake.  They provide cover and feeding areas for a wide variety of fish species.The lake has a fairly diverse fish population but the abundances of many species is \"low\" to \"average\" when compared to similar type lakes.  In the 1994 netting, northern pike numbers remained \"low,\" as they were in previous nettings.  Typically, average size was in the \"large\" category (4.6 lbs.).  The walleye catch was \"average.\"  Four age classes were present, all from years when stocking was done.  Largemouth bass were also present in \"average\" numbers.  All were age 3 and were slow growing.  Smallmouth bass were sampled for the first time in '94 and were caught in \"average\" numbers.Bluegills were caught in \"high\" numbers.  Five age classes were sampled and had slow growth.  Other sunfish species sampled included rock bass, pumpkinseeds, green sunfish and hybrid sunfish.  Most were found in \"average\" numbers.  The black crappie catch was \"average,\" with most fish being from the 1990 year class and having good growth.Forage species which are important to the lake's gamefish include yellow perch, white suckers and tullibees.  Yellow perch were found in \"average\" numbers in '94.  White suckers and tullibees were both caught in \"low\" numbers.  Other species sampled in '94 included yellow bullhead and greater redhorse.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kimball lake is a 190 acre lake located six mile east of Jenkins.  The lake is upstream from Ossawinnamakee lake.  The lake is classified as a hardwater lake with low phosphrous fertility.  The lake has a maximum depth of 77 feet with 37% less than 15 feet deep.  Water clarity is excellent.  A public access exists on the south shore.The lake has a very diverse fish population but abundance of many species is low to average when compared to other lakes.  The walleye population in the 1999 survey was within the normal range for this lake class type with a catch rate of 2.7 fish/gill net.  Sizes ranged from 16.5 to 30.3 inches with normal growth rate and fish as old as 18 years were observed.  Catch and release of these big fish in this relatively small lake with a moderate walleye population is extremely important.  Northern pike numbers of 1.3 fish/gillnet in 1999 is considered low for this lake type.  Six previous surveys had a range of 0.0 fish/gill net in 1988 to 1.3 fish/gillnet in 1994. The size range in 1999 ranged from 16.6 to 27.3 inches with an average weight if 3.2 lbs.  Growth rates were normal.  Largemough bass were observed in moderate numbers with sizes ranging from 5.2 to 13.8 inches with normal growth rates.  Smallmouth bass were present in very low numbers.  The black crappie catch rate was considered normal with fish ranging from 6.7 to 13.2 inches.  Bluegill were represented with a low catch rate of 7.3 fish/trap net which is below the historical range of 19.7 to 87.7 fish/trap net.  Sizes ranged from 3.5 to 6.8 inches.  Yellow perch, as in past years, were present in low numbers.  Tullibee (cisco) were very abundant in 23.3 fish/gillnet. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kimball Lake is a 190 acre lake located about 6 miles east of Jenkins in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the south shore.  The lake is heavily developed with 31.6 homes/cabins per shoreline mile in 2004.  The maximum depth is 77' and about 19% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrate is primarily sand, although areas of gravel, rubble, and marl are common as well.  The aquatic plant community is somewhat diverse with 23 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush occur along small areas of the shoreline.  It is essential to protect and maintain these plants as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide critical spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  The 2004 walleye catch of 1.7/gill net is the lowest catch to date on this lake, though when compared to similar lakes, it is still considered average.  Seven different year classes were represented with fry stocking accounting for 70% of the fish sampled.  Average length and weight decreased from 25.1\" and 5.9 lbs in 1999 to 20.9\" and 3.9 lbs in 2004.Northern pike were caught in average numbers in 2004 at 6.0/gill net, though this is the highest catch to date.  Past catches have always been low when compared to similar lakes.  Average length and weight increased slightly from 22.9\" and 3.2 lbs in 1999 to 24.4\" and 3.8 lbs in 2004.  Growth was relatively good with 50% of these fish measuring at least 24\".  The largemouth bass abundance of 1.0/trap net and 1.5/gill net is typical of past catches on this and similar lakes.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 256/hr with an average length of 9.4\" and 21% measuring at least 12\". The 2004 bluegill catch increased from 1999, but at 28.1/trap net, it is similar to past catches on this and other comparable lakes.  Black crappie abundance of 0.9/trap net is also typical for this lake.Tullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  The 2004 tullibee catch was above average at 14.3/gill net.  Yellow perch abundance has generally been low in the past, and the 2004 catch of 0.7/gill net remains below average when compared to similar lakes.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Kimball Lake on August 14th, 2023 to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 17 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 36.7 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 7.1?C (44.8?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for these species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for these species was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. Data collected in 1993, 1994, and 1995 also indicated suitable oxythermal habitat. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kimball Lake has a steep, marl bottom along most of the shoreline, and very clear water, causing fishing to be difficult for many people.   <br> \n <br> \nSince 2007, walleye have been stocked in odd numbered years at double the standard rate (2 lbs/littoral acre in alternate years, 74 lbs total) in an attempt to increase walleye abundance.  However, this has not resulted in increased gill net catches.  The best walleye catches have resulted from fry stocking and future stocking will be done primarily with walleye fry. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were caught in average numbers (1.3/gill net) for this type of lake in the 2016 survey.  All of these fish were over 17\", with an average length of 22.7\".  Smaller fish were seen and netted while largemouth bass electrofishing in the spring of 2016 at the rate of 31.3/hr. run-time.  These walleyes had an average length of 12.4\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers have remained fairly steady the past three surveys, with the 2016 catch at 4.8/gill net.  Average length was 22.6\" and 31% of the fish measured 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass might be your best option if fishing Kimball.  They were sampled by electrofishing, yielding a catch rate of 110.2/hr.  Average length was 10.9\" and 41% were 12\" or larger.  Two larger (18\"+) smallmouth bass were also captured. <br> \n <br> \nIt may be hard to find large panfish on Kimball.  Bluegill were mostly small, with an average size of only 4.8\" and no crappies were captured (although some were seen while electrofishing). <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are also present in Kimball Lake and were captured at the rate of 3.7/gill net.  Average length of these fish was 11.7\". <br> \n</p>",

Some decent fish are present, however, for those who can figure out how to catch them. <br> \nOne of those fish that might present a good opportunity is Northern Pike.  They were caught in average numbers (6.7/gill net), but size was good.  Average length was 25.3\", with 18% within the 22-26\" protected slot and 38% over 26\".  Fish up to 37.7\" were captured. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have historically done better with fry stocking in Kimball Lake.  For this reason, it was switched from fingerling stocking back to fry stocking in 2017.  Walleye fry are now stocked in even numbered years at the rate of 1,350 fry/littoral acre (50,000 fry).  The first stocking on this new plan took place in 2018 and would have been the first fry stocked year class readily accessible to netting, however, none were captured.  A total of five Walleye (0.8/gill net) were captured and all were age nine or older and at least 21.0\" long.  Walleye were caught while Bass electrofishing at the rate of 8.0/hr.  These fish averaged 16.9\" and could have been from the 2018 stocking.  Why they didn't show up in the summer survey is unknown. <br> \n <br> \nWhile Largemouth Bass electrofishing numbers were down from 2016 when we had 110.2/hour, Bass were still caught at the rate of 76.0/hour.  Average size was 11.9\" and 44% were 12\" or larger.  Fish up to 18.9\" were caught.  Five Smallmouth Bass were also caught and ranged from 10.9\"-15.4\". <br> \n <br> \nIt may be hard to find decent panfish on Kimball.  Bluegill were mostly small, with an average size of only 5.5\" and only 20% measuring 7\" or larger.  Black Crappies averaged 6.9\" and only one fish over 8\" was caught. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are also present in Kimball Lake and were captured at the rate of 6.7/gill net.  Average length of these fish was 12.2\". <br> \n</p>",

Navigation is not allowed in the channel between the two lakes.  Kimball lake also contains Eurasian watermilfoil, another invasive species.  Please remember to follow all laws when entering and leaving these lakes.  Pull all your drain plugs, inspect and clean your boat thoroughly, and dispose of unused bait before leaving this lake so these exotics aren't spread elsewhere.  It is also recommended to spray/rinse your boat with hot water (above 120 F) or let it dry at least five days. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes have been stocked into Kimball on a regular basis since the 1960's.  Alternate year fingerling stocking began in 2007, which means at least one year class of those fish should have been vulnerable to our nets.  The walleye catch numbers were at their lowest, however, for the second straight survey at 1.7/net.  The size of the fish caught in the gill nets was big, with an average length of 24.9\".  All of the fish were over 17 inches.  Three fish were also caught in our trap nets with and average length of 9.1\".  These fish could be from our recent stockings. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in average numbers (4.7/net) when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 22.1\" and 39% were 24\" or larger.  These fish were fast growing.  Tullibees (cisco), which are an important forage fish for northern pike, had a decline in numbers this survey.  Average length of these fish was 11.4\". <br> \n <br> \nThe lake has a good bluegill population (50.7/net), but with the average length at only 5.5\", they are a little on the small side.  Only 16% were 7\" or larger.  Black crappie numbers were normal, with an average length of 8.9\". <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included black crappie, brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Various other species were caught while backpack electrofishing and seining, including brook silverside, mottled sculpin, logperch, and smallmouth bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kimball Lake is a 190 acre lake, with a maximum depth of 77', located six miles east of Jenkins in Crow Wing County.  Kimball is in the Pine River Watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on August 24, 2022, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 3 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 6 stations.  Soft bottom and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at the other sampling site.  Seventeen species were sampled, including 7 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mottled Sculpin, Rock Bass and Smallmouth Bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on June 27-30, 2022, to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake.</p>",
