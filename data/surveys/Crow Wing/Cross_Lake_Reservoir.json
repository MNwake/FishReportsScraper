The 2018 walleye catch was average for this type of lake (3.1/gill net).  Average length was 18.3\" and 96% of the fish were 12\" or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers continue to be high (14.9/gill net) and the size remained small, with an average length of 20.1\".  Only 13% of these fish were 24\" or larger.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers for the Whitefish Chain, which includes Cross, were 68.8/hr run-time during night electrofishing.  Average length was 13.5\".  Five smallmouth bass were also netted while electrofishing.  All but one were over 17\". <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were average for this lake.  Black crappies showed more potential for anglers, with 68% of the fish measuring 8\" or larger and fish up to 12.7\".  Bluegills were quite small, with an average size of 4.7\" and only 8% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers remained low at 2.2/gill net.  Average length was 6.9\" and 18% were 8\" or larger.  Lake whitefish and tullibee (cisco), which are important forage fish for walleye and northern pike, were both caught in Cross.  Only one whitefish, measuring 24.1\", was captured, while tullibee were caught in average numbers (1.7/gill net).  Average length of the tullibee (cisco) was 10.9\". <br> \n</p>",

Fish species found in \"average\" numbers were shorthead redhorse, tullibee, walleye, white sucker, black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, rock bass and yellow bullhead.  Lake whitefish, yellow perch and bowfin (dogfish) were found in \"low\" numbers.</p>",

Development is heavy, with 469 homes/cottages, one resort and a U.S.C.O.E. campground present along 19.7 miles of shoreline (1995 lake survey).  Water recreation by boats and jet skis is very heavy in mid summer.  Water clarity remained good, with a secchi disc reading of 14 feet in mid-July, 2005.In 2005, northern pike numbers remained in the \"high\" category compared to similar type lakes, at 12.53/GN.  Size averaged 19.9 inches and 1.9 pounds, a slight increase since 2000.  Twenty two percent of the pike were at least 24 inches long.  The walleye catch remained in the \"average\" category, at 2.53/GN.  Size averaged 17.6 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Twelve age classes were sampled, the oldest being age 21.  The largemouth bass catch was \"high\" and the highest to date in Cross Lake.  Eight year classes were sampled.  Growth became \"slow\" after age six.  Three age classes comprised 70% of bass sampled.The bluegill catch of 39.0/TN was in the \"average\" category and similar to 2000.  Two year classes comprised 50% of the sample.  Seven percent of sampled bluegills were at least 7.0 inches long, similar to the 2000 value.  Black crappie abundance, at 2.31/TN was in the \"average\" category in 2005.  Six age classes were sampled and growth was \"good\".  Two year classes comprised 87% of the crappie sample and 68% of sampled crappies were at least 8.0 inches long.Yellow perch are an important forage source for the lake's game species.  The perch catch remained in the \"low\" category for the fifth straight netting.  Additionally, growth of younger aged perch was slow.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleyes have been stocked into Cross Lake on a regular basis since 1948.  The current management plan calls for annual fry stocking at a rate of 1,000/littoral acre (880,000 fry) and fingerling stockings in even numbered years at a rate of 1 pound per littoral acre (880 pounds).  Night electrofishing was done on September 11th, 2023, to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleyes.  The total sample time was 2 hours in which no YOY Walleyes caught.  Past catch rates of YOY Walleyes have been as high as 6.5 fish/hour.  Walleye age 1 and older were sampled at a catch rate of 9.0/hour run-time.  These fish ranged in size from 7.8\" to 11.6\", with a mean length of 8.8\".</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 23 feet. Dissolved oxygen did not decrease to below 3.0 mg/L throughout the water column, at the time of sampling. The lowest temperature and within the profile was 5.7?C (42.3?F) at a depth of 79 feet which had a corresponding dissolved oxygen measurement of 6.2 mg/L. <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) values cooler than 17.2?C for Lake Whitefish or 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for these species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for these species was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. Data collected in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2010 also indicated suitable oxythermal habitat. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Lake Whitefish or Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

The current management plan calls for annual fry stocking and fingerling stockings in even numbered years at a rate of 2 pounds per littoral acre. Night electrofishing was done on September 20, 2010 to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) walleyes.  The total sample time was 1.9 hours, resulting in a walleye catch rate of 4.2 fish/hour.  There were no YOY walleyes in the sample for the third time in eight samplings.  Past catch rates of YOY walleyes have been as high as 6.5 fish/hour.  The fish sampled in 2010, ranged from age 1-3 and were 7.7-12.8 inches with an average length of 10.9 inches.  Fish from the 2008 year class were most abundant in the sample.</p>",

Development is heavy, with 494 homes/cottages and a U.S.C.O.E. campground present along 19.7 miles of shoreline.  Water recreation by boats and jet skis is very heavy in mid-summer.  Water clarity remained good, with a secchi disc reading of 15 feet on July 21, 2011. <br> \n <br> \nCross Lake is stocked annually with walleye fry and in even numbered years with fingerlings.  The 2011 walleye catch was average for this type of lake.  Average length was 18.5\" and 90% of the fish were 12\" or larger.  Northern pike numbers continue to be high and the size remained small, with an average length of 19.1\".  Only 11% of these fish were 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers for the Whitefish Chain, which includes Cross, were impressive while night electrofishing (112.5/hr run-time).  Average length was 12.8\".  Numbers were also good in our nets. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were average for this lake.  Black crappies showed more potential for anglers, with 58% of the fish measuring 8\" or larger.  Bluegills faired a bit smaller, with 14% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers remained low at 1.3/net.  Average length was 7.2\".  Lake whitefish and tullibee, which are important forage fish for walleye and northern pike, were caught in average numbers for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

Development is heavy, with 469 homes/cottages , a resort and a U.S.C.O.E. campground (1995 lake survey) present along 19.7 miles of mainly sand shoreline.  Water recreation by boats and jet skis is very heavy.  Water clarity was very good with a secchi disc reading of 12 feet.In 2000 the northern pike were found in high numbers with a catch rate of 12.3/gillnet.  A total of 16.2% were 24.0 inches or larger.  Walleye were present in average numbers for this type of lake and the catch rate of 3.3/gillnet is very similar to past nettings on this lake.  Sizes ranged from 9.9 to 26.4 inches with an average size of 16.3 inches.  Growth rate was good.  Largemouth bass numbers were very good and ranged in size from 7.0 to 18.1 inches.  Bluegill numbers were normal with size small and only 6.2% seven inches or larger.  The black crappie population is in excellent shape with all sizes present.</p>",
