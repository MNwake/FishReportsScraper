NOP GROWTH RATES APPEAR GOOD UP TO THREE YEARS OLD AND THEN SLOW SIGNIFICANTLY, PERHAPS REFLECTING A LACK OF YEP TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SIZE FORAGE (YEP HAVE DECLINED TO WELL BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE).  TLC, ALTHOUGH PRESENT, WERE FOUND ONLY IN THE NORTH BAY AND NOT IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS TO PROVIDE A SECONDARY FORAGE BASE.  BLGS FAR ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE IN THE PREVIOUS SURVEY, HAVE DECLINED TO A LEVEL THAT IS CURRENTLY SOMEWHAT BELOW THE THIRD QUARTILE.  THE DECLINE IN NUMBERS HAS APPARENTLY RESULTED IN AN IMPROVED SIZE STRUCTURE, FROM A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 4.0-4.4 INCHES IN 1986 TO 6.0-6.4 INCHES PRESENTLY.  ALTHOUGH NOT APPARENT FROM NET CATCHES, THE LAKE IS KNOWN FOR ITS CRAPPIE FISHING.  THE FEW CRAPPIES TAKEN IN NETS EXHIBIT GOOD GROWTH.  A NUMBER OF LMB WERE ALSO TAKEN IN TEST NETS AND EXHIBIT GOOD GROWTH.  THE WAE GILLNET CATCH HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE IN THE PREVIOUS SURVEY TO WHAT IS NOW AN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL FOR THIS LAKE CLASS.  WAE STOCKING WAS DISCONTINUED IN 1983 REINSTATED IN 1987 WITH THE ACQUISITION OF A PUBLIC ACCESS.  WAE AGES INDICATE THAT RECENT FINGERLING STOCKING HAS AUGMENTED SPORADICALLY SUCCESSFUL NATURAL REPRODUCTION TO PRODUCE THE PRESENT POPULATION.  WAE GROWTH RATES ARE GOOD. AN ABUNDANT YEB POPULATION IS PRESENT AND MAY HAVE POTENTIAL FOR COMMERCIAL HARVEST.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Floyd is a 1,178 acre lake with a heavily developed shoreline located just north of the city of Detroit Lakes.  The lake experienced a 64% increase in home construction between 1955 (191 homes) and 2001 (314 homes).  It has a relatively diverse fish community including cold water species like tullibee and is popular for angling and other water recreation.  As an example of other water recreation, a water skiing group has set up a permitted slalom course in the eastern portion of Mud Lake (aka North Floyd, Middle Floyd, the north basin) annually for several years. <br> \n <br> \nA special regulation for northern pike was in effect on Floyd (including the north basin) Lake since 2003.  This regulation required anglers to immediately release all pike between 24 and 36 inches in length.  The goal was to provide more \"quality\" pike.  Legislative action in 2011 required a statewide reduction in the number of lakes with special pike regulations from approximately 120 to 100 or less.  In the Detroit Lakes area, pike regulations in two lakes were subsequently dropped to comply with the legislative mandate.  Floyd (but not Little Floyd) was one of the lakes dropped.  In 2011, six area lakes were eight years into their regulation evaluations and it appeared that Floyd and Cotton lakes had the least chance of reaching their goals.  Thus, the pike regulation was discontinued in these two lakes. <br> \n <br> \nAt 3.9 walleyes per gill net, catches were not significantly different from those during the 1990's even though stocking rates were doubled in 1998 from 1.0 pounds to 2.0 pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre, biennially.  Floyd's walleye net catches have remained very stable under a variety of stocking schemes.  Future investigations will help determine if the current stocking plan will add to walleye catches.  Walleyes sampled in 2011 averaged 2.6 pounds each.  Natural reproduction of walleyes is not a factor in Floyd Lake and some kind of stocking is necessary to sustain a walleye fishery. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catches of bluegill declined in 2011, but not significantly.  As in many area lakes, the portion of bluegills over eight inches in length is smaller than it was before the 1980's.  However, these larger bluegills can still be found in Floyd Lake.  It takes approximately eight years to grow an eight-inch bluegill in Floyd Lake.  Bluegill growth rates were never considered fast in Floyd Lake, but it is likely that fishing pressure has increased.  In other words, more of the larger bluegills are harvested as soon as they reach \"keeper\" sizes than in the past.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of near shore fish species was conducted by Detroit Lakes Area Fisheries Staff on Floyd Lake (03038700) on July 13, 2016.  Floyd Lake is 1,178 acres, located 3 miles north of Detroit Lakes, MN.  During this survey, 14 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with either a 50-foot or a 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this survey, seven sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine, and four were sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Site conditions prevented the use of seines at three sites. Backpack electrofishing was done at 14 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 23 species of fish, including seven species intolerant of disturbance and/or poor water quality.  Intolerant species sampled were Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Stickleback, Fathead Minnow, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Northern Redbelly Dace, Pumpkinseed, Spottail Shiner, Walleye, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Floyd Lake is located in the Ottertail River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Floyd is a 1,212 acre lake with a heavily developed shoreline located just north of the city of Detroit Lakes.  The lake experienced a 64% increase in home construction between 1955 (191 homes) and 2001 (314 homes).  It has a relatively diverse fish community including cold water species like tullibee and is popular for angling. <br> \n <br> \nA special regulation for northern pike has been in effect on both Floyd (including the north basin) and Little Floyd lakes since 2003.  This regulation requires anglers to immediately release all pike between 24 and 36 inches in length.  Although early in the regulation, there are some indicators that the regulation may be having a positive effect on the size structure of northern pike in this lake.  The average length of sampled pike was longer in 2006 (21.4 inches) than in all but one of the eight previous studies since 1955.  Another measure used to define size structure is the proportional stock density (PSD).  For pike, this is simply the percent of stock (sexually mature) fish at least 21 inches in length.  In Floyd Lake in 2006, the northern pike PSD was second highest of those previously recorded at 54%.  The lake's historic mean is 26%.  Hopefully, these pike will grow to trophy sizes and opportunities will exist to catch more fish over 30, or even 36 inches.  With the presence of cisco, this lake has the potential to produce large pike. <br> \n <br> \nAt 4.7 walleyes per gill net, catches were not significantly different from those during the 1990's even though stocking rates were doubled in 1998 from 1.0 pounds to 2.0 pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre, biennially.  Floyd's walleye net catches have remained very stable under a variety of stocking schemes.  Future investigations will help determine if the current stocking plan will add to walleye catches.  Walleyes sampled in 2006 averaged nearly 2.5 pounds each. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catches of bluegill declined in 2006, but the numbers were similar to those reported prior to 1981 when more large bluegills were found in this lake.  As in many area lakes, the portion of bluegills over eight inches in length is smaller than it was before the 1980's.  However, these larger bluegills can still be found in Floyd Lake.  Bluegill growth rates were never considered fast in Floyd Lake, but it is likely that fishing pressure has increased.  In other words, more of the larger bluegills are harvested as soon as they reach \"keeper\" sizes than in the past. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Pollution Control Agency lists Floyd Lake as borderline eutrophic.  This makes it particularly vulnerable to nutrient input and other development related activities.  Good shoreland and watershed stewardship practices are essential to slow the degradation of water quality, fish populations, and property values for Floyd Lake.  A couple of excellent sources for help in restoring or protecting shorelines are available through the Minnesota Bookstore.  These include \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and \"Restore Your Shore.\"</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Floyd is a 1,212 acre lake with a heavily populated shoreline located just north of the city of Detroit Lakes.  The lake experienced a 64% increase in home construction between 1955 (191 homes) and 2001 (314 homes).  It has a relatively diverse fish community and is popular for angling.In 2001, net catches of several gamefish and panfish species were similar to those of 1996.  An exception to this was northern pike which showed higher net catches than at any time since test netting began in 1955.  Gill net catches averaged 24.5 pike per set.  Most northern pike were small (average length 19.4 inches) but a few over 30 inches were also found.At 4.9 walleyes per gill net, catches were not significantly different from those during the 1990's.  Big Floyd was one of several area lakes added to the Accelerated Walleye Program recently.  It was believed that the fishery in this lake might benefit from increased fingerling stocking and stocking rates were doubled from 1.0 pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre to 2.0 pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre.  Floyd's walleye net catches have remained very stable under a variety of stocking schemes and only time will tell if this stocking plan will add to walleye catches.  Recently expanded northern pike abundance may have an adverse impact on the stocked walleyes.Trap net catches of bluegill remained higher than the lake's historical average at 59.7 per set.  As in many area lakes, the portion of bluegills over eight inches in length was significantly smaller than it was before the 1980's.  Although bluegill growth rates were never considered fast in Floyd Lake, it was likely that fishing pressure has increased.  In other words, larger bluegills are harvested as soon as they reach \"keeper\" sizes.Minnesota Pollution Control Agency information listed Floyd Lake as borderline eutrophic.  This makes it particularly vulnerable to nutrient input and other development related activities.  Good stewardship practices are essential to slow the degradation of water quality, fish populations, and shoreline property values for Big Floyd Lake.  A couple of excellent sources for help in restoring or protecting shorelines are available through the Minnesota Bookstore.  These include the document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and the computer CD \"Restore Your Shore.\"</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Floyd Lake is located within the upper reaches of the Ottertail River watershed.  Big Floyd consists of two distinct basins with the south basin nearly three times the area and twice the volume of the north basin (Mud Lake).  The immediate watershed consists of approximately 15,475 acres of rolling forest (32%) and agricutural (35%) lands, the majority of which drains from the north into the Mud Lake basin of the lake.  Being the primary receiver of the watershed drainage, Mud Lake acts as a nutrient buffer for the south basin.  This is reflected by recent seasonal average trophic state index (TSI) values nearly 22% higher for Mud Lake.  Mud Lake also exhibits a distinctly stratified midsummer temperature/DO profile while the south basin remains relatively unstratified.  The two basins also differ in substrate types and riparian zone communities all of which provide for distinctly different fish habitats.Big Floyd is one of eight area lakes included in lake class 27.  Other area lakes fitting this lake class include: Big Toad, Round, Cotton, Strawberry, Sallie, Melissa and Tulaby.  Lakes within this class are characterized by the following mean values: area - 2,230 acres, maximum depth - 60.9 ft., %littoral - 44.5%, total alkalinity - 161.97 ppm, secchi - 8.47 ft., shoreline development factor - 1.49, morphoedaphic index - 12.42, and an average TSI of 46.3.  Fish communities associated with lake class 27 are predominated by northern pike, bluegill, and walleye but exhibit great species diversity.Historically, northern pike have been the most commonly caught piscivore sampled during midsummer gillnetting.  Though the current northern pike catch rate (8.0/set) equals the lowest ever recorded, it remains near the third quartile for lake class 27 (see attached historical net catch graphs).  The reduced number of pike could be considered favorable for the rest of the fish community and may be a contributing factor in the recent increase in yellow perch numbers.  The mean weight of gillnet sampled pike (2.4 lbs.) has doubled since the previous assessment and is the highest recorded for this lake.  Growth rates, too, have improved from previous surveys and are 20% higher than statewide averages.  Nearly 83% of gillnet sampled pike were less than 25 inches in length suggesting a high rate of fishing mortality for pike over 25 inches.  Northern pike year class strengths are often tied to annual water level fluctuations.  Higher spring water levels, as experienced in 1994 and 1995, enhanced spawning areas thus increasing recruitment to those year classes.Gillnet catch rates for walleye have fluctuated little since 1955, remaining near the bottom of the normal range for lake class 27.  Mean weights, however, have increased over the same period.  The current walleye mean weight (2.6 lbs.) is heavily influenced by the abundance of 6 and 7 year old fish.  Together, these two age classes constituted 55% of the gill net catch, reflecting good survival within these year classes and possible evidence of successful catch and release practices.  Midsummer gillnet data suggests that both natural reproduction and walleye fingerling stocking are contributing to the population.  Though not extensive, there appears to be sufficient spawning substrates to maintain a moderate number of walleye.  Fingerling stocking appears to be supplementing natural reproduction.  Walleye growth rates were near statewide averages, with females predictably faster growing through all year classes.Like many of our area lakes, Big Floyd has experienced large fluctuations in its bluegill population.  The current trapnet CPUE, of 76.4/set, is well above the normal range for lake class 27 and is the second highest recorded at this lake.  Bluegill growth is considered slow through all age classes, requiring four years to attain a length of 6.0 inches.The current gillnet catch rate for yellow perch (23.1/set) falls near the middle of the normal range for lake class 27 and is the highest recorded for this lake.  Catch rates from previous assessments were significantly lower, fluctuating near the bottom of the normal range.  Yellow perch, though never abundant, are an important forage species and will often describe the limits of abundance and growth of walleye and, to a lesser degree, northern pike.  Historically, gill net catch rates of walleye and yellow perch correspond closely in Big Floyd Lake.  An inverse relation exists between northern pike and yellow perch.  As northern pike catch rates fell, yellow perch catch rates have increased, suggesting that northern pike may have a limiting effect on both walleye and yellow perch populations.Yellow bullhead, until recently, have been present in above average numbers.  The current trapnet catch rate (1.9/set), though within the normal range, is the lowest since the 1950's.  Yellow bullhead have been the most abundant of the three bullhead species, an indication of good water quality.Though not apparent for midsummer net catches, both largemouth bass and black crappie have maintained stable populations in Big Floyd and are commonly sought by anglers.  Both species display near normal growth rates.Fisheries management is an adaptive science, seeking and adopting successful management practices and abandoning those that prove to be ineffective.  Special regulations, developed to manipulate fish populations, are becoming an increasingly important management tool.  A special regulation limiting the harvest of northern pike to fish under 24 inches may produce a pike population which is smaller in number but with a larger average size.  This kind of northern pike population structure not only would be popular with anglers but may also allow yellow perch and walleye populations to expand.Big Floyd Lake experienced a 32% increase in the number of shoreline homes between 1955 (191 homes) and 1991 (281 homes).  Lake friendly land stewardship is necessary on such heavily developed lakes if water quality, healthy fish populations and property values are to be maintained.  Good stewardship practices by individual lake home owners can do much to enhance lake shore aesthetics and reduce nitrification.  Such practices as proper building siting and color schemes, removal of dilapidated buildings, shoreline plantings, shared beaches and docks, minimal use of lawn fertilizers and herbicides, and proper installation and maintenance of septic systems can be employed by the individual lakeshore association and local COLA.  Collective efforts by these groups can yield big dividends for the individual, the lake, and the watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Floyd is a 1,178 acre lake with a heavily developed shoreline located just north of the city of Detroit Lakes. The lake experienced a large increase in development between 1955 (191 homes) and 2001 (314 homes). It has a relatively diverse fish community including the cold water species Cicso, and it is popular for angling and other water recreation. <br> \n <br> \nA special regulation requiring the release of Northern Pike between 24 and 36 inches was implemented on Floyd Lake in 2003. After eight years the pike population did not show signs of improved size structure so the regulation was discontinued in 2011. In 2016, the gill net catch rate for Northern Pike was 18.6 per net which is above both the historical average for Floyd Lake and well above what is expected for similar lakes. Sampled Northern Pike ranged from 9.7 to 36.3 inches with an average length of 17.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nGill net catch rate for Walleye has remained fairly stable for Floyd Lake despite varying stocking strategies. Gill net catch in 2016 was 3.4 per net, which is just below the historical average and not far below the highest catch ever reported. Walleye lengths ranged from 14.8 to 27.7 inches with an average length of 19.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catch increased slightly to 39.8 fish per net in 2016. While this was less than the Floyd Lake's historical average, it is within the range expected in similar lakes. In 2016, Bluegills sampled by trap net averaged 6.4 inches and lengths ranged from 3.0 to 8.9 inches. It was found that it required 9 to 10 years for a Bluegill to reach 8 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch has never been high in Floyd Lake with the historical average being below what is expected for similar lakes. However, gill net catch did increase slightly in 2016 to 1.3 perch per net. The average length of sampled perch was 7.4 inches and ranged from 6.4 to 9.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catch for Black Crappie remained characteristically low at 0.3 fish per set. Black Crappies sampled in both net types ranged from 10.2 to 13.6 inches. Black Crappie required 6 years to reach 10 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Largemouth Bass trap net catch rate greatly increased to 3.17 fish per net. This catch rate is well above both the historical average for Floyd Lake and what is expected in similar lakes. Across gears, Largemouth Bass length averaged 12.4 inches and ranged from 8.9 to 19.6 inches. It required bass about 7 years to reach 15 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nA survey of the emergent aquatic plants in Floyd Lake found that although there were some large beds of bullrush in the main south basin, the shoreline of the north basin was almost completely wringed with emergent plants. These plants play an important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat to fish and wildlife. Efforts should be made to protect these emergent vegetation beds so that the health of Floyd Lake is maintained.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Floyd (a.k.a., Big Floyd) Lake is a 1,212-acre lake located in Becker County two miles north of the city of Detroit Lakes. Floyd Lake's shoreline is heavily developed, and the lake receives a high amount of angling pressure and recreational use. Floyd Lake consists of two basins, the shallow larger main basin and the deeper more productive north basin (commonly referred to as Mud Lake). Zebra mussels were discovered in the lake in 2018. A daily limit regulation of five sunfish is in place on the lake. Floyd Lake provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Walleye, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie. A standard fisheries survey was completed on Floyd Lake in June 2021. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has been stable in Floyd Lake since 1991. The 2021 average catch rate of Walleye was about four per gill net. Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 9.5 to 23.7 inches, averaging 18.7 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe average catch rate of Northern Pike was roughly 13 pike per gill net, slightly lower than the historical average (about 15 pike per gill net). Sampled pike ranged in length from 9.9 to 34.6 inches, averaging 18.1 inches long. Of the sampled pike, 55.9% measured between 14 and 19 inches, indicative of a population dominated by small to moderately sized fish. <br> \n   <br> \nTrap nets caught an average of seven Bluegill per net, the lowest catch rate observed since initial surveying. Although Bluegill abundance has declined, the size of fish has improved. Sampled Bluegill ranged in length from 2.6 to 9.9 inches, averaging 7.5 inches long. Based on age estimates, it takes about 12 years to grow a ten inch Bluegill in Floyd Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie observed during the survey ranged in size from 5 to 13 inches long. Sampled Largemouth Bass were also found to range in length from 7.9 to 17.4 inches, averaging 12.5 inches long. Yellow Perch catch rates have remained low in Floyd Lake since initial surveying and this remained the case in 2021--gill nets captured only one Yellow Perch per net.  Additional species sampled in 2021 included Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain Floyd Lake's fishery by voluntarily releasing medium to large sized fish and harvesting smaller fish for eating, specifically Bluegill and Northern Pike. Shoreline owners can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat in Floyd Lake by maintaining shoreline buffer zones, leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, and by taking precautions to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species introductions.  </p>",
