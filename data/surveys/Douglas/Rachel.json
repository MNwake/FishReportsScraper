                "narrative": "<p>Rachel Lake is a 496-acre natural basin located in south central Douglas County near Holmes City.  Maximum depth is 65 feet.  Water quality and clarity are typically very good, although significant annual variability is noted.  Water transparency during the June, 2012 survey exceeded 10.0 feet.  Rachel Lake supports a robust aquatic plant community.  Habitat attributes are typical of a \"Bass-Panfish\" ecological classification. <br> \n <br> \nLake area and habitat characteristics have varied over the last 20 years.  Heavy rains in the mid-80s resulted in significant increases in water levels.  An outlet was constructed in 2003, but lake elevation remains near the ordinary high water mark.  Much of the basin's emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush and cattail) was lost.  Some portion of fisheries impacts was offset by navigable connection to Little Rachel Lake.  This shallow wetland-type habitat afforded sustained access to spawning and nursery habitats for northern pike and sunfishes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike harvest is regulated by a 24.0 - 36.0 protected slot length limit.  Due to the navigable connection between Rachel and Little Rachel lakes, the northern pike harvest regulation applies to both basins. <br> \n <br> \nHabitat changes did result in shifts in fish community structure, but throughout duration of environmental flux, Rachel Lake has sustained diverse, high-quality fishing opportunities.  Northern pike densities declined, but pike remain abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 7.3 pike/net.  Survey statistics suggest the 24.0 - 36.0 protected slot length limit has been modestly effective in reducing total standing stock of northern pike and positively reshaping size structure.  Seventeen percent of stock-size northern pike sampled in 2012 exceeded 28.0 inches in total length.  Average size was 24.3 inches and 3.4 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance also increased.  Largemouth bass electrofishing efforts yielded 90.0 fish/hour.  A large portion of the population is comprised of fish less than 12.0 inches in length.  However, 17% of captures exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  The largest fish sampled measured 18.2 inches.  Average size was 10.2 inches and 0.8 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nDespite a decrease in bluegill densities, anticipated improvements in growth rates and size structure were not observed.  Bluegills in Lake Rachel continue to grow slowly.  Age-4 fish averaged 4.1 inches in total length.  It can take up to nine years for bluegill in Lake Rachel to reach harvestable size.  Mean length of captures in 2012 was 6.1 inches.  No bluegill captures exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Releasing larger individuals while harvesting smaller fish would benefit Lake Rachel's bluegill population.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies are present, but insufficient numbers were captured to accurately assess abundance, growth, and age structure.  Anecdotal evidence suggests population abundance and contributions to angler's creel are greater than described by mid-summer survey statistics. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings or yearlings are stocked on an alternate-year basis in order to sustain a viable fishery.  As characteristic of lakes with abundant top predators (northern pike and largemouth bass), relative success of stockings are less than that of fertile, lightly vegetated lakes.  Catch rates increased modestly during the 2012 survey, but remain on the low side of expected catch rates for similar area lakes.  Walleye catches tend to be greater when northern pike numbers are low.   Average size of walleye captures was 15.6 inches and 1.6 pounds. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rachel Lake is a 496-acre basin located in south-central Douglas County near Holmes City.  Maximum depth estimates have varied from 65 feet to 76 feet with a sustained increase in water level since 1986.  This increase in water level created a broad navigable connection between Rachel and Little Rachel lakes and increased the littoral or shallow water habitat and productivity of the combined basins.  An outlet was constructed in 2003 to address high water and associated property damages.   <br> \n <br> \nWater quality and clarity are typically very good, although significant annual variability is noted.  Water transparency during the 2018 survey was 9.0 feet.  Rachel Lake supports a robust aquatic plant community.  Habitat attributes are typical of a \"Bass-Panfish\" ecological classification, although lake area and habitat characteristics have varied with water level changes.  Much of Rachel Lake's emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush and cattail) was lost to high water.  However, some fishes such as Northern Pike and members of the sunfish family prospered with connection of Rachel and Little or South Rachel basins and expanded spawning and nursery habitat. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern Pike harvest is regulated by a 24.0- to 36.0-inch protected slot length limit.  Due to the navigable connection between Rachel and Little Rachel lakes, the Northern Pike harvest regulation applies to both basins.  Survey results suggest the protected slot length limit has had a positive effect on reshaping size structure and improving quality of the Northern Pike fishery.  Northern Pike abundance has remained elevated since water levels increased.  Abundance of larger pike has also increased with restrictions on size of pike harvested.  Over half the pike captured during the 2018 survey exceeded 24 inches in length.  Three memorable-size pike exceeding 34 inches were captured.  Despite a decrease in the number of small pike in the survey, there is still an overabundance and surplus of small Northern Pike in the population.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest fish under 24 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass catches during the 2018 spring electrofishing survey decreased from that of the 2012 survey in apparent response to diminished annual recruitment in recent years.  Such declines can be expected with stabilization of water level and diminished carrying capacity.  Approximately half of Largemouth Bass captures were 12 inches or longer.  Bass in Rachel Lake grow slowly.  On average, it takes a Largemouth Bass 5.7 years to reach 12 inches.  The largest bass observed was 18.3 inches.  Bluegill numbers decreased for the second survey in a row, but a modest increase in catches measuring 8 inches and larger were observed.  The largest Bluegill caught was 9.3 inches.  On average, it takes Bluegill in Rachel Lake 4.6 years to reach 6 inches in length.  Black Crappie are observed in most surveys, but catch rates are typically low.  Crappie have a tendency to suspend in deeper water during the summer and are not always susceptible to capture in survey nets.  Angler reports would indicate that Rachel Lake supports a good fishery.  The Little or South Rachel basin is often a popular destination for spring crappie anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked every other year in an effort to sustain a fishery.  Walleye catch rates have been modest during all surveys and population density may be under-represented in gill net catch rates due to the difficulty in positioning and deploying standard gill nets in this deep, steep-sided basin.  Walleye catches declined during the 2018 survey to average only 1.6 fish/net.  Survival of recent stockings appeared to be poor.  The Walleye that are in Rachel Lake grow fairly fast and can obtain large sizes.  The largest Walleye measured 27.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRachel Lake supports a Cisco or Tullibee population.  Survey catches are limited due to low vulnerability of Cisco to capture in standard gill net sets during summer months.  Cisco catch rates were up slightly in 2018.  The largest fish measured 16.3 inches.  Only Rachel Lake and Lake Ida are open to Whitefish/Cisco netting in Douglas County. <br> \n <br> \nAt the time of the 2018 survey, Rachel Lake is not known to contain any invasive species.  It is one of very few lakes in Douglas County that does not support a naturalized Common Carp population.  The absence of invasive aquatic species should provide ample justification for recreational users to take any and all necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.  Do not dispose of any unused bait in the lake.  Updated information on invasive species infestations can be found on the MN DNR website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>An assessment of the fish population was conducted on Rachel Lake in June of 2002.  Rachel Lake is a small lake located in south central Douglas County south of Holmes City.  Water quality is good with an early summer secchi reading of 9.0 feet.  Rachel Lake has a diverse aquatic plant community with large stands of emergent vegetation located in Little Rachel Lake.  The lake is lightly developed but developmental pressures are on the increase around the lake.  Rachel Lake has a quality fishery present which includes northern pike, bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie and walleye. Water levels continue to rise on Rachel Lake.  The rising water is causing problems with lakeshore dwellings and is also resulting in the substantial loss of cattail in Little Rachel Lake.  A permit was issued in 2002 to establish an outlet to the south from Little Rachel Lake which should prevent the continuing rising water levels and prevent a connection to Echo Lake to the north which if connected could introduce carp into Rachel Lake.Northern pike are very abundant (14.1 fish/gillnet).  This is the highest recorded catch rate dating back to 1977.  Despite the implementation of a 24-inch maximum length limit in 1997 designed to improve the size structure; the existing average size of northern pike remains below expectations (2.5 pounds and 21.6 inches).  The largest fish sampled measured 35.9 inches.Largemouth bass numbers were high in the 2002 spring electrofishing survey (72.0 fish/hour).  The 2002 largemouth bass catch rate exceeded the previous survey's catch rate of 58.0 fish/hour.  The average size of largemouth bass was 12.5 inches and 1.2 pounds.  The largest fish captured measured 18.6 inches.  Approximately 33% of the fish sampled were from the 1998 year class (age 4).  Growth rates are slow with age-4 fish averaging 11.7 inches.Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2002 (58.2 fish/trapnet) which exceeds the three previous survey's catch rates but falls well below the 1982 catch rate of 272.1 fish/trapnet.  The average size of bluegill was fair (0.2 pounds and 6.1 inches) with the largest fish measuring 10.1 inches.Walleye numbers remain low in this bass-panfish lake (2.1 fish/gillnet) and remained similar to the historical catch rate of 2.2 fish/gillnet.  The population consists primarily of larger individuals with the 2002 average size being quite favorable (23.4 inches and 4.9 pounds).  The largest walleye sampled measured 29.7 inches.For clarification and compliance with the northern pike 24-inch maximum length limit, Little Rachel Lake was included in the fishing regulations synopsis and posted in 2001.  Rachel and Little Rachel Lakes are considered the same body of water with the same Division of Waters number and will continue to be treated as one lake while the northern pike regulation is in place.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rachel Lake is a 496-acre natural basin located in south central Douglas County near Holmes City.  Maximum depth is 65 ft.  Water quality and clarity are typically very good, although significant annual variability is noted.  The MPCA aquatic recreation use rating is \"fully supporting\".  Average water transparency from May - September is 9.5 ft.  Rachel Lake supports a diverse aquatic plant community.  Habitat attributes are typically of a \"Bass-Panfish\" ecological classification. <br> \n <br> \nLake area and habitat characteristics have varied over the last 20 years.  Heavy rains in the mid-80s resulted in  significant increase in water level.  An outlet was constructed in 2003, but lake elevation remains near the ordinary high water mark.    Much of the basin's emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush and cattail) was lost.  Other environmental impacts have included shoreline erosion and loss of trees along the shoreline.  Some portion of fisheries impacts was offset by navigable connection to Little Rachel Lake.  This shallow wetland-type habitat afforded sustained access to spawning, cover, and nursery habitats for northern pike and sunfishes. <br> \n <br> \nHabitat changes did result in shifts in fish community structure, but throughout the duration of environmental flux, Rachel Lake has sustained diverse, high-quality fishing experiences.   Northern pike remain abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 8.4 pike/net.  Survey statistics suggest a 24.0-inch maximum length limit imposed in 1997 may have been effective in reducing total standing stock of northern pike and positively reshaping size distribution.   Thirteen percent of stock-size northern pike captured in the 2006 survey exceeded 28.0 inches in total length.  Average size has increased to 24.3 inches and 3.1 pounds.  Contrary to expectations of reduced total abundance and a broader size distribution, average growth slowed.  Slower growth rates may be a function of stabilization of the water level and habitat conditions.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass electrofishing catches averaged 62.0 fish/hour.  Population statistics indicate exploitation is light.  Despite abundance, 50% of 2006 captures exceeded 15.0 inches in total length.  The largest fish captured measured 18.1 inches.  Average size was 14.2 inches and 1.7 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill continue to be abundant.  Survey catches have consistently exceeded that considered normal for similar lakes.  Size distribution of the bluegill population has been variable in response to annual recruitment irregularity.  Bluegill growth can be described as \"slow\", but fortunately sunfish are long-lived.  Rachel Lake can produce large bluegill.  Fifty-seven percent of individuals in the 2002 capture sample exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Fewer big fish were captured in 2006 in probable response to good fishing experiences and greater total harvest.    It takes nine years for a bluegill to grow to 8.0 inches, thus it is relatively easy to degrade fishing quality, in terms of average size harvested, with modest size-selective harvest. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie are present, but insufficient numbers were captured to gain a meaningful assessment of abundance, growth, and age distribution.  This species was likely suspended in deeper water rather than occupying shoreline habitat, thus capture efficiency was poor. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings or yearlings are stocked on a biennial schedule in order to sustain a viable fishery.  As characteristic of lakes with abundant northern pike and sunfish populations, relative contributions of stockingare less than that of fertile, lightly vegetated lakes.  Catch rates have been consistently low among all surveys.   Walleye catches have tended to be greater when northern pike numbers are low.  Growth is average.  Representatives of the 2006 population sample averaged 13.4 inches in total length at age-3.   Fishing quality in terms of catch and harvest rates are partially offset by size.  Average size captured was 15.8 inches and 1.9 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nIf fishing Rachel Lake for the first time, there are a few things to consider and remember.  High water has greatly diminished utility of the public access.  There is little room to turn around or park.  The shoreline has been weakened by high water.  Minimize amplitude of boat wakes to protect sensitive shoreline.  Northern pike harvest is regulated by a 24.0-inch maximum length limit.  Enjoy catching medium- and large-size northern pike and ensure success of the regulation by harvesting small pike.  Rachel Lake now has navigable connection with Little Rachel Lake.  The northern pike harvest regulation applies to both basins.  Lastly, minimize harvest of large bluegill and maximize harvest of 5.0 - 7.0 inch fish to improve predatory/prey relationships and take advantage of this harvestable surplus. <br> \n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Rachel Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nFifteen species were collected during this survey.  Four species (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Least Darter) were considered \"intolerant\" and one species (Green Sunfish) was considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Rachel Lake.</p>",

Water quality and clarity are typically very good.  Lake area and habitat characteristics have varied over the last 20 years.  Heavy rains in the mid-1980s resulted in significant increases in water levels that connected Rachel and Little Rachel Lakes.  An outlet was constructed in 2003, but lake elevation remains near the ordinary high water mark. <br> \n   <br> \nNorthern Pike harvest is regulated by a 24.0- to 36.0-inch protected slot length limit.  All pike between 24.0 and 36.0 inches must be immediately released.  One over 36.0 inches is allowed in possession.  Due to the navigable connection between Rachel and Little Rachel lakes, the Northern Pike harvest regulation applies to both basins. <br> \n   <br> \nA targeted Northern Pike survey was conducted shortly after ice out in 2016 for purposes of estimating Northern Pike abundance and evaluating changes in population size distribution that might be attributable to the protected slot length limit.  Northern Pike catch rates were very high in response to a great increase of young fish into the population.  Most of these young fish were three years old.  Due to elevated numbers of young pike, average size of the total catch was only 18.3 inches.  Fifteen captures measured 28.0 inches and larger.  The largest pike caught measured 38.4 inches.  Small Northern Pike are over-abundant in Rachel Lake.  Anglers are strongly encouraged to harvest fish under 24.0 inches in length. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>After three years of Walleye fingerling stocking, only five Walleye were netted during the survey. Two Walleye are from the 1984 year-class and three are from the 1985 year-class. The lack of Walleye in the nets may not be a true indicator of the population. The Walleye may suspend in search of food and aren't susceptible to conventional gill net sets. The Northern Pike have a good length frequency and age-class distribution characteristic of a cool water lake. There doesn't appear to be a bottleneck in the growth of Northern Pike. Growth rates of Northern Pike are similar to previous surveys. Mean size of Bluegill has increased from 0.14 lbs in 1982 to 0.21 lbs in the present survey this may be the result of Bluegill removal in 1982 and in the spring of 1987. Catch rates of bass using electrofishing gear suggests a good population. Growth rates on bass are very slow and are possibly a result of the cool water. Black Bullheads (absent in the 1954 survey), have decreased in numbers and increased in size from the 1982 survey. Pounds/set has remained nearly identical to the 1982 survey. Northern Cisco (Tullibee) probably provide a valuable niche in the food chain of the Northern Pike and Walleye.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye catch rate increased from 0.8 fish/gill net in 1987 to 7.0 fish/gill net in 1992.  The catch rate recorded in 1992 exceeds the third quartile of mean catch rates for lakes within Lake Classification 31.  A catch rate of 1.5 fish/gill net in 1977 was the highest catch rate recorded in previous surveys dating back to 1954.  The mean weight of fish captured was 1.1 pounds and RSD-P was calculated at 20%.  Analysis of the age class distribution of fish captured indicates that Walleye fingerling stockings in 1989 and 1990 were successful.  Cohorts from these two year classes comprised 77% (27/35) of the fish captured. Results of the 1987 population assessment indicated that Walleye fingerling stockings prior to 1987 were largely unsuccessful.  The reason for the change in stocking efficacy is unclear.  The recent decline in Northern Pike abundance may have allowed for expansion of the Walleye population.  Northern Pike gill net catch rate fell from 5.8 fish/net in 1987 to 1.8 fish/net in 1992.  Catch rates have ranged from 3.4 to 6.5 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1954.  The catch rate recorded in 1992 is below the inter-quartile range (3.4 - 10.5 fish/net) of mean catch rates for Lake Class 31. Catch rates during the special trap netting conducted after ice out were also low.  A mean catch rate of 1.0 fish/net was recorded during this special assessment.  The mean weight of fish captured during the standard population assessment was 3.1 pounds and PSD was calculated at 66.7%. One of the fish captured exceeded 35 inches in total length.  This size structure is consistent with reports that Lake Rachel provides trophy Northern Pike fishing.  Daytime AC electrofishing yielded 25.3 total Largemouth Bass per hour.  Stock size (8 inches and greater) catch rate averaged 17.3 fish per hour which is similar to the results recorded in 1987 when stock size catch averaged 20.0 fish per hour.  There was a difference in the size structure of the Largemouth Bass captured by electrofishing in 1987 and 1992.  PSD was calculated at 46.2% in 1992, compared to a PSD of 10.0% in 1987.  The mean growth rate of fish captured in 1992 is consistent with the growth rates measured in 1987, and similar to the mean growth rate of Largemouth Bass in other area lakes within Lake Class 31.  Age 5 fish averaged 12.2 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Bluegill catch averaged 40.2 fish/trap net, which is similar to the mean catch rate of 34.1 fish/trap net recorded during the 1987 population assessment. The normal range of mean catch rates for lakes within Lake Class 31 is 11.7 fish/net to 55.0 fish/ net.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds and PSD was calculated at 43.8%.  Bluegill growth in Lake Rachel is similar to other area lakes within Lake Class 31.  Age 5 fish average 5.5 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Bluegill catch rate and size structure are indicative of a quality fishery.  Yellow Perch catches averaged 10.4 fish/gill net in 1992 compared to a catch rate of 7.0 fish/gill net recorded in 1987. There has been a slight gradual increase in Yellow Perch catch rates since 1977.  The present catch rate is within the normal range of catch rates (4.5 - 37.2 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 31.  The population is dominated by small individuals.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds and PSD was calculated at 0%.  Cisco (Tullibee) catch rates increased from 0.8 fish/gill net in 1987 to 11.4 fish/gill net in 1992.  The present catch rate exceeds the third quartile of mean catch rates for Lake Class 31. Gill net catches are likely variable due to habitat preferences of this primarily cool water species. The Cisco population in Lake Rachel may provide a large forage item for trophy-sized Northern Pike and Walleye.  There is also some interest in Cisco netting during the open season.  Black Bullhead catches declined in both gill nets and trap nets.  Gillnet catch declined from 40.8 fish/net in 1987 to 2.4 fish/net in 1992.  Trap net catch rate fell from 15.2 fish/net to 0.6 fish/net during the same time period.  Black Crappie were not sampled in sufficient numbers to evaluate the population. Catch rates have never exceeded 1.0 fish/trap net in previous surveys.  The mid-summer habitat preferences of the Black Crappie and shape of the lake basin makes trap netting ineffective.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rachel Lake is a 496-acre natural basin located in south-central Douglas County near Holmes City.  Maximum depth is 65 feet.  Water quality and clarity are typically very good.  Lake area and habitat characteristics have varied over the last 20 years.  Heavy rains in the mid-1980s resulted in significant increases in water levels that connected Rachel and Little Rachel Lakes.  An outlet was constructed in 2003, but lake elevation remains near the ordinary high water mark. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike harvest is regulated by a 24.0- to 36.0-inch protected slot length limit.  All pike between 24.0 and 36.0 inches must be immediately released.  One fish over 36.0 inches is allowed in possession.  Due to the navigable connection between Rachel and Little Rachel lakes, the Northern Pike harvest regulation applies to both basins. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted Northern Pike survey was conducted shortly after ice out in 2018 for purposes of estimating Northern Pike abundance and evaluating changes in population size distribution that might be attributable to the protected slot length limit.  Northern Pike catch rates decreased in 2018 due to fewer small pike in the population.  Average length increased to 20.5 inches.  The largest pike caught measured 36.0 inches.  Despite a decrease in the number of small pike in the survey, they are still overabundant, making up 85% of the catch.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest fish under 24.0 inches in length. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rachel Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community which provides quality habitat fornorthern pike and centrarchids.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 25 feet and is commonthroughout the littoral zone.  Emergent vegetation is limited in coverage.  However, high water levelsin recent years have provided a direct connection to South Rachel Lake which has hardstem bulrush andcommon cattail along most of the shoreline.  South Rachel Lake may provide important spawning andrearing habitat for northern pike and centrarchids during high water levels.Northern pike abundance has increased in recent years.  Gillnet catches averaged 11.2 fish/gillnet in1997; compared to 1.8 fish/gillnet in 1992.  Gillnet catches averaged 5.8 fish/net in 1987, 3.4fish/net in 1982, and 6.5 fish/net in 1977.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes withsimilar chemical and physical characteristics is 2.8 - 9.0 fish/gillnet.  An experimental 24 inchmaximum length limit was imposed on Rachel Lake in 1997 as part of the Statewide ExperimentalRegulations Project.  Northern pike have been sampled annually since 1995 to collect baselineinformation on the population prior to the experimental regulation.  Results suggest that thepopulation is comprised of mostly small, young individuals due to high total annual mortality betweenthe ages of 3 and 6.Largemouth bass are relatively abundant.  Night electrofishing yielded 54.0 fish per hour. Approximately 30% of the fish captured were 12 inches in length or greater and 10% exceeded 15 inches. Limited natural reproduction during the unusually cool summers of 1992 and 1993 is apparent in the sizestructure and age class distribution of the largemouth bass population.  Poor natural reproduction in1992 and 1993 is likely responsible for a decrease in bluegill abundance.  Age-4 and age-5 fish werepractically non-existent in trapnet catches.  Trapnet catches averaged 12.9 fish/net in 1997; comparedto 40.2 fish/net in 1992 and 34.1 fish/net in 1987.  Trapnet catches averaged 272.1 fish/net in 1982. About one-half of the fish captured were 6 inches in length or greater, however few exceeded 8 inches. Walleye catches averaged 1.7 fish/gillnet in 1997.  Gillnet catches have been less than 1.5 fish/netin previous surveys, except for the catch rate of 7.0 fish/net recorded in 1992.  The normal range ofmean catch rates from similar lakes is 3.3 - 8.8 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1997was 2.2 pounds.  Efforts to improve walleye abundance with fingerling and fry stocking has been mostlyineffective.  There has been little correlation between year class strength and years of stocking,except for the 1989 and 1990 year classes that were responsible for the high gillnet catch rate in1992.  Survival of stocked fingerlings may have been greater during this time period when northern pikeabundance was low.  Yellow perch catches averaged 2.2 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches averaged 10.4,7.0, and 5.2 fish/net in 1992, 1987, and 1982, respectively.  Fish captured in 1997 ranged from 5.5 to7.9 inches in total length.  Black crappie are not effectively sampled with standard survey gear duringsummer months.  Gillnet catches averaged 0.3 fish/net and trapnet catches averaged 1.7 fish/net.  Age-3fish comprised 87% of the fish captured in trapnets.            </p>",
