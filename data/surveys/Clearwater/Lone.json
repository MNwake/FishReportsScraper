                "narrative": "<p>Lone Lake is a 69-acre lake with a maximum depth of 70 feet located five miles north of the city of Bagley in Clearwater County.  There is a County-owned public water access (earthen) on the northwest shore of the lake.  Lone Lake is managed for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie and Northern Pike.  The lake basin contains steep shoreline drop offs and little shallow water. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical characteristics and the fish community present in the lake.  Lone Lake is in lake class 28.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Lone Lake and other class 28 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Deep, Walkerbrook and Sandy (near Debs). <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 Bluegill catch rate of 19.89/TN was within the normal range found in similar lakes (5.69/trap net to 40.45/trap net).  Bluegill captured had an average size of 6.03 inches in length and 0.20 lbs/fish, which is near the top end of the range for similar lakes (0.12 lbs to 0.24 lbs/fish)Nighttime electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass resulted in a catch rate of 75.74 bass/hour, which is a high catch rate for the Bemidji area.  Largemouth Bass up to 15.04 inches in length were captured during electrofishing, although larger bass are present, with fish up to 19.61 inches captured in gill nets.   <br> \nThe catch rate for Black Crappie (0.44/trap net) was below the normal range found in similar lakes (0.50/trap net to 3.25/trap net).  The average size of Black Crappie captured (0.20 lbs.) was near the top end of the range found in similar lakes (0.24 lbs.).  Black Crappie up to 11.77 inches in length were captured in the assessment. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers have remained stable in Lone Lake over the past twenty years.  This is in contrast to a number of area lakes that have seen increases in numbers of Northern Pike and a decline in the proportion of larger fish in the population.  The 2015 Northern Pike catch rate of 7/gill net is near the top of the normal range for similar lakes (2.75/gill net to 8.67/gill net).  The average size of Northern Pike captured was 21.72 inches in length and 2.39 lbs/fish.  Twenty four percent of pike captured were greater than 24 inches in length and the largest pike captured was 33.27 inches in length.  Other species of fish captured in the survey were Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lone Lake, located about four miles north of Bagley, is in lake class 28. Lakes of this class are typically small and deep with soft water and  regular shorelines.  Class 28 lakes in the Bemidji area include Lomond, First, Second, Walkerbrook, Little Buzzle, Peterson and Deep.    Walleye fingerlings have been stocked during alternate years at one pound per littoral acre (31 lbs.).  The 1996 assessment found only three walleye with one from the 1993 stocked year and two from 1991, also a stocked year.  Despite regular fingerling stocking Lone Lake maintains a low level of walleye abundance typical of this lake type.  Growth of walleye is good, and the average size can be better than normal.    Northern pike were sampled in 1996 at 8.3 per gill net, among the lowest catches recorded from Lone lake, but they are still very abundant.  Previous assessments have found northern pike abundance in gill nets ranging from 18.3 in 1982 to a low of 7.0 in 1985.  The mean weight was 1.4 pounds slightly below the normal range for comparable lakes.  The small size is typical when abundance is high.  More than one-third of the pike sampled and aged were from the 1994 year class though at least one pike from each of the past six years was sampled.  Neascus (black spot) was noted on about 25% of the pike examined.  Although unsightly this parasite presents no danger to humans, and fish can be safely consumed.     Yellow perch were sampled at 26.0 per gill net, slightly higher than the normal range and had a mean weight of 0.2 pounds which is the lowest since 1962.  Perch averaged about seven inches in length with the largest about 12 inches.  Some perch have  yellow grubs, another common, though harmless parasite.    Largemouth bass are normally difficult to sample with standard survey gear, but trap nets used for this assessment captured them at 2.5 per trap net nearly double the normal range for this lake class.  Most of the bass sampled were from the 1994 year class and had a mean length of 7.8 inches.  The largest bass sampled was 14.1 inches.  Growth rates appear to be average.    Bluegill were sampled at a higher abundance than during any previous survey, and the average weight of one-third pound is better than that found in most lakes of the class.  The largest bluegill sampled was 9.2 inches, and the mean length is 7.4 inches.  Assessments in 1975 and 1962 did not find bluegills though a few green sunfish were present.  Bluegill were introduced by stocking in 1975, and the abundance has increased steadily.  Weights appear to be stable over the past 10 years.    Black crappie were very low in abundance during the initial survey in 1962 and reached their highest recorded abundance of 14.5 per trap net in 1985.  By 1996 their abundance had declined to less than one fish per trap net. The  mean weight of 0.4 pounds is about average for this lake class.  The largest crappie sampled in 1996 was 12.0 inches with the average about 8.2 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lone Lake is a small 69-acre lake with a maximum depth of 70 feet.  It is located 2  miles north of Bagley in central Clearwater County.  There is an earthen public access at the northwest corner of the lake off township road 114.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lone Lake is in lake class 28.  Typically lakes in this lake class are small, deep lakes with regular shorelines and soft water.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Lomond, Walkerbrook, Deep, Peterson, Pickerel, First, Second and Little Buzzle. <br> \n <br> \nWith the exception of bullheads, all species of fish typically found in a lake class 28 fish community are found in Lone Lake.  The Lone Lake fish community is dominated by northern and bluegill.  Bluegill are a newcomer to Lone Lake being sampled for the first time in 1975.   <br> \n <br> \nThe most abundant member of the sunfish family in Lone Lake is bluegill.  Their abundance would be on the high end of what would typically be found a class 28 lake.  The quality of the bluegill fishery has changed considerably in the last 10 years.  In 2006, only 4% of the bluegill sampled were greater than eight inches in length as compared to 28% in 1996.  Quality-sized bluegill are disappearing from many of our lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.  To maintain some quality in our bluegill populations, anglers would have to show some voluntary restraint when bluegill are biting well.  By practicing selective harvest, anglers can harvest the smaller more abundant bluegill for eating, and release more of the medium to large fish.  This would help maintain balance in the population and increase the opportunity to catch large bluegill in the future. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike quality has improved somewhat since 1996 assessment.  The average sized pike sampled was 2.1 pounds.  No previous assessment had pike average weight of greater than 1.5 pounds.    <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are difficult to sample with standard survey gear.  In 2006, only seven bass were sampled that ranged from 4.8 to 13.9 inches.  Specialized sampling targeting bass would need to be employed to obtain a representative sample of this important species. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one walleye was sampled in the 2006 assessment.  Despite a regular stocking schedule low numbers of walleye have been sampled in all assessments.  The physical characteristics of Lone Lake may be limiting suitability as a walleye lake.  Small lake size and low amounts of shallow productive habitat reduce lake's ability to produce walleye.  Natural reproduction is nearly nonexistent with most walleye aged to years of stocking.  Clear water and abundant northern pike increase mortality on young walleye.  This problem is worsened by a lack of small perch. Perch are the primary forage specie for walleye, and can also buffer the predatory effects from northern pike.     <br> \n <br> \nDevelopment pressure is increasing around the shorelines and within the watershed on Minnesota lakes.  This degrades water quality and impacts valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.
