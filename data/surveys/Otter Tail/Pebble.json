Average individual weight of pike decreased from 2.8 pounds in 1987 to 2.1 pounds.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased from 7.2 per trap net lift in 1987 to 58.2 per net, which exceeds the normal range.  Bluegill size structure appears to have declined as no bluegills greater than seven inches in length were captured in this survey compared to 40% in 1987.   <br> \n     Largemouth bass abundance increased from 0.4 per trap net lift in 1987 to 3.8 per net, which is three times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.  The 1990 year class of largemouth bass composed 83% of the sample.   <br> \n     Black crappie, absent from the 1987 survey, were sampled in this survey and were the result of the 1988 stocking.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance increased from 31.3 per gill net lift in 1987 to 111.3 per net, which is three times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance increased from 5.7 per gill net lift in 1987 to 15.3 per net, which is 2.8 times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.

                "narrative": "<p>     Pebble Lake is a 169-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located within the city limits of Fergus Falls, MN.  Pebble Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Land use in the immediate watershed is primarily composed of residential areas interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Pebble Lake is 62 feet; however, 39% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2023 survey was 14.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.3 to 15.8 feet.   <br> \n     The south and west shorelines of Pebble Lake have been extensively developed into residential areas.  A city park with a public water access and campground is located along the north shoreline of the lake.  A city park, swimming beach, and golf course are located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as hardstem bulrush or common cattail are rare except for an extremely small area along the north shoreline.      <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Northern Pike and Walleye populations. <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance is moderate.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 16.1 to 36.3 inches with an average length and weight of 24.2 inches and 3.5 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 23.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has declined over the recent series of surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 15.8 to 26.6 inches with an average length and weight of 20.9 inches and 3.3 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.3 inches at three years of age.  <br> \n     Pebble Lake is a popular angling lake because it is in close proximity to an urban area.  Anglers can preserve the quality of fishing in Pebble Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Pebble Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",

IBI data was collected in conjunction with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency watershed sampling. Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions. Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Eight fish species were represented, including young of the year gamefish species such as Largemouth Bass. Non-game species sampled included Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Pebble Lake is a 169-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located within the city limits of Fergus Falls, MN.  Pebble Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There is a non-navigable intermittent inlet along the northeast shoreline.  The immediate watershed is primarily composed of residential areas interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Pebble Lake is 62 feet; however, 39% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2011 lake survey was 9.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.3 to 15.8 feet.   <br> \n     The south and west shorelines of Pebble Lake have been extensively developed into residential areas.  A city park with a public water access and campground is located along the north shoreline of the lake.  A city park, swimming beach, and golf course are located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as hardstem bulrush or common cattail are rare except for an extremely small area along the north shoreline. <br> \n     Pebble Lake is a popular angling lake because it is in close proximity to an urban area.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     A high-density northern pike population exists.  Northern pike ranged in length from 14.7 to 31.3 inches with an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.2 inches at three years of age. <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that Pebble Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 9.5 to 19.3 inches with an average length and weight of 15.7 inches and 2.2 pounds. <br> \n    The bluegill and black crappie populations are abundant.  Eleven percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.6 inches at five years of age.  Twenty-six percent of the black crappies were 9.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 8.8 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 7.9 to 21.6 inches with an average length and weight of 15.8 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.3 inches at three years of age.     <br> \n     Anglers can preserve the quality of fishing in Pebble Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Pebble Lake is a 169-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located within the city limits of Fergus Falls, MN.  Pebble Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The immediate watershed is primarily composed of residential areas interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Pebble Lake is 62 feet; however, 39% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 17.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 7.3 to 15.8 feet.   <br> \n     The south and west shorelines of Pebble Lake have been extensively developed into residential areas.  A city park with a public water access and campground is located along the north shoreline of the lake.  A city park, swimming beach, and golf course are located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as hardstem bulrush or common cattail are rare except for an extremely small area along the north shoreline. <br> \n     Pebble Lake is a popular angling lake because it is in close proximity to an urban area.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     A high-density Northern Pike population exists.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 18.3 to 28.4 inches with an average length and weight of 21.9 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 24.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that Pebble Lake has a balanced Largemouth Bass population.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 3.4 to 20.3 inches with an average length and weight of 11.5 inches and 1.1 pounds. <br> \n    The Bluegill and Black Crappie populations are abundant.  Bluegill size structure; however, is poor with only four percent of the Bluegills measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.0 inches at four years of age.  Twenty-eight percent of the Black Crappies were 9.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 8.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     A moderate-density Walleye population exists.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.2 to 29.3 inches with an average length and weight of 18.7 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.8 inches at four years of age.     <br> \n     Anglers can preserve the quality of fishing in Pebble Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Pebble Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.     <br> \n    </p>",
