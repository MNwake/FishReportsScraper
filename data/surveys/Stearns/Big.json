The average weight of pike (1.9 pounds) decreased from the previous survey and was within the normal range.  The catch rate of Walleye (3.6/gill net) increase from the rate observed in 1984 survey (3.2/gill net) and was within the expected range of values for similar lakes.  Yellow Perch were sampled below the expected range for similar lakes and decreased compared to previous surveys. Bluegill were sampled in numbers and weight above the expected range and was similar to the rate observed in the 1984 survey. The Black Crappie was nearly identical to the previous two surveys catch and remained within the expected range.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Bowfin (dogfish), Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, and White Sucker.  All of these species with the exception of Yellow Bullhead were sampled either within or below their expected ranges for similar lakes.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Big Lake was conducted on June 19, 2017 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Big Lake is in exceptional health as indicated by an FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Sauk River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake is located in south central Stearns County, three miles southwest of Richmond.  It has a surface area of 403 acres and a maximum depth of 42 feet.  Water clarity is moderate, averaging six feet in summer months.  A public access is located along the west shore, and has a boat ramp.  A survey was conducted in 2002 to assess fish populations, and included spring electrofishing and summer netting (trap nets, gill nets, and seines).  Catch rates were compared to lakes with similar characteristics as a way to evaluate the fish populations of Big Lake.  Results were also compared to past surveys of Big Lake (most recently in 1994) to track changes over time.  The survey also included water chemistry analysis, watershed mapping, and an aquatic plant survey.Big Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and walleye.  In 2002, the population of northern pike appeared low compared to similar lakes, but catch rates have been consistently low for Big Lake.  In lakes with low densities of northern pike, average size is often high, as was the case for Big Lake in 2002 (3.0 pounds).  The walleye population of Big Lake is supplemented by stocking fingerlings in alternate years.  In 2002, the catch rate of walleye was above the normal range for a lake like Big, while average size (1.6 pounds) was in the normal range.  The largest group of walleyes were 14-17 inches (from the 1999 stocking), with some nearly 27 inches.  A large number of yearling walleye were also seen during spring electrofishing, suggesting that survival of stocked fingerlings from the previous fall was high.The population size of bluegill appeared normal in 2002, but average size was low; 92% of the bluegill sampled were less than six inches.  Growth rates appeared slower than average.  Black crappie catch was low, but often these are not sampled well in mid-summer.  Average size was in the normal range; the largest crappie sampled was 13.6 inches.  Yellow perch appear to be present in very low numbers, based on netting results.The largemouth bass population was sampled by electrofishing in the spring.  Forty-six bass were captured in one hour of sampling, near the average for the area.  The average size of bass sampled was ten inches, and the largest was 15 inches.A 16-inch channel catfish was sampled during the survey, which probably migrated in from the Sauk River.  Other species sampled in 2002 included bowfin, bullhead, carp, and white sucker.A cattail fringe is present around much of the lakeshore, with some bulrush beds off shore in a few locations.  The submerged plant community is dominated by chara (muskgrass), but several other species were also found.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake is a 458 acre recreational development lake located three miles southwest of the City of Richmond. It has a maximum depth of 42 feet and good water quality. Twenty one species of aquatic plants were identified with submersed plants growing to a maximum depth of 9.5 feet. Curly leaf pondweed was sparse and grew at or near the surface on less than 1% of the lake surface area. Big Lake is primarily managed for northern pike and walleye. Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year. There is one public access and two private accesses (Joe's Last Resort and Twilight Acres Resort) located on the lake. <br> \n <br> \nSince the 1984 survey, catch rates of northern pike have been below average; however, the average weight has been above average. The catch rate of northern pike in 2012 was the second highest on record, but within expected values for similar lakes. Average size was lower than 2002, but also within the range of expected values. Northern pike collected ranged in length from 14 to 33 inches with an average length and weight of 22 inches and 2.4 pounds. Growth of northern pike was fast for females and average for males. Females grew to 23 inches in 4 years, whereas males grew to 21 inches in 4 years. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked in alternating years for the past 40 years although fry stocking was experimented with in 2003, 2005, and 2006. Due to poor survival, fry stocking was discontinued and management returned to fingerling stocking in 2007. The catch rate of walleye in 2012 was similar to 2002 and above expected values. This is the third consecutive survey that the walleye catch has been above average. Walleye collected ranged in length from 7 to 27 inches with an average length and weight of 17 inches and 1.8 pounds. Growth was fast with both males and females reaching 15 inches in 3 years. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance remains low similar to past surveys. Only five yellow perch were sampled during the survey and three of those were young of the year (YOY). <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled during daytime electrofishing on May 10, 2012. A total of 85 largemouth bass were captured in 0.9 hours of effort for a catch rate of 91/hour. Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6 to 17 inches with an average length and weight of 11 inches and 0.9 pounds. Largemouth bass growth was average, reaching 11.5 inches in 4 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of black crappie in 2012 was similar to past surveys and within the range of expected values for similar lakes; however, the gill net catch was above expected values for similar lakes. Black crappies collected during the survey ranged from 4 to 11 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches. Growth was average with black crappie reaching 8.6 inches in 4 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population appeared normal, but average size was low; 76% of the bluegills sampled were less than 6 inches long. Bluegill collected ranged in length from 3 to 8.5 inches with an average length of 5 inches. Growth was slow with bluegill reaching 6.8 inches in 6 years. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during the survey including banded killifish, blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, bluntnose minnow, bowfin (dogfish), brook silverside, brook stickleback, central mudminnow, fathead minnow, green, hybrid, and pumpkinseed sunfish, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, pugnose shiner, tadpole madtom, white sucker and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Pike that were four years old or more had near normal growth rates the first two years, then slow growth. The total number of pike sampled I nets was below the state average. Walleye numbers were 1.5 times the state avg and the majority of the population had a normal to fast growth rate. Largemouth Bass catches were below the state average but had a normal growth rate. Bluegill were 5.5 times the state average in numbers but their growth was normal. The number of Black Crappie was near state medians with normal growth rates. Panfish young of the year numbers were high in the natural reproduction check but no one-year old fish were caught in the survey for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill or Black Crappies. Yellow Perch are definitely lacking. Yellow Bullheads between 8-13 inches in length were abundant.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye catch in gill nets increased from the 1989 lake survey and rose above expected levels when compared with other lakes similar to Big Lake.  Walleye caught ranged in size from 9.3-29.3 inches and averaged 17.6 inches in length.  The average weight of walleye sampled was 2.1 pounds, which was high for this lake type.  The majority of fish sampled (91%) came from years when walleye fingerlings were stocked and natural reproduction appears to occur rarely, if at all.  The growth rate of walleye was fast for one to four year old fish and average for five to eight year old fish.     The gill net catch rate of northern pike appeared to decline form the 1989 survey of the lake, and fell below expected levels for this lake type.  On the other hand, the average weight of northern pike caught (3.5 pounds) appeared to increase from the 1989 survey (1.9 pounds) and was large for this lake type.  Northern pike sampled ranged in length from 17.6-34.1 inches and averaged 24.3 inches in length.  No year class appeared to dominate and growth rate of pike was average when compared to other populations in the state.     The catch rate of yellow perch in gill net significantly increased from the 1989 survey and rose to high levels for this lake type.  Yellow perch sampled ranged in length from 5.2-8.0 inches and averaged 6.3 inches in length.  The average weight of yellow perch caught did not change and remained within expected levels for this lake class.     The trap net catch rate of bluegill appeared to decline from the 1989 survey but remained within expected levels for this lake type.  Bluegill caught ranged in size from 2.8-7.5 inches and averaged 5.9 inches in length.  The average weight of bluegill sampled (0.2 pounds) appeared in increase from the 1989 survey (0.07 pounds) and rose into expected levels for this lake type.     The black crappie trap net catch rate remained identical to the 1989 survey and stayed within expected levels.  Black crappie sampled ranged in size from 3.8-11.1 inches and averaged 6.7 inches in length.  The mean weight of black crappie caught (0.2 pounds) also did not change from the 1989 survey and remained within normal levels for lakes similar to Big.     Largemouth bass populations were assessed by spring electrofishing.  A total of 23 bass were caught at a rate of 13.3 bass per hour of sampling.  Largemouth bass caught ranged in length from 6.9-18.6 inches and averaged 13.6 inches in length.  One to seven year old fish were sampled and no dominant year class was apparent.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake is a 458 acre lake located three miles southwest of the City of Richmond. It has a maximum depth of 42 feet with an average depth of 15 feet. Big Lake has good water quality and excellent water clarity with a 10 year average summer Secchi reading of 10 feet. The Big Lake watershed is 20,371 acres with land use consisting of 65% agriculture, 17% pasture, 6% marsh/open water, 5% forest, 4% residential, and 3% grassland. Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year. There is one public access and two private accesses (Joe's Last Resort and Twilight Acres Resort) located on the lake. A standard survey was conducted in 2017 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nBig Lake has a diverse aquatic plant community. While no submerged plant survey was conducted in 2017, the last submerged plant survey conducted in 2012 found 13 species of aquatic plants growing to a depth of 9.5 feet. Muskgrass and sago pondweed were the most common. Emergent plants were mapped in 2017 and found to cover approximately 15% of the lake. Species found were bulrush spp. (2 acres), cattail spp. (36 acres), white waterlily (29 acres), and yellow water lily (2 acres). <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Northern Pike have not been abundant in Big Lake, however, since 1994 their abundance has steadily increased. The catch in 2017 was higher than 2012 and above the range of expected values for lakes with similar characteristics, and the highest on record. Northern Pike ranged in length from 15 to 34 inches with an average length and weight of 20 inches and about two pounds. Ten percent of the Northern Pike were longer than 24 inches and 3% were longer than 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerling stocking has been the stocking strategy for the past 50 years, although fry stocking was experimented with between 2003 and 2006. Due to poor survival, fry stocking was discontinued and management returned to biennial fingerling stocking in 2007. The catch in 2017 was the highest on record and above the range of expected values for the lake class. Walleye ranged in length from 10 to 25 inches with an average length and weight of 18 inches and two pounds. Seven year classes were present in the age sample with the 2014 year class making up 47% of the sample. Growth was fast with both males and females reaching 16 inches by age three. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance remains low, similar to past surveys. Only 15 Yellow Perch were sampled during the survey and ranged from five to 8.5 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during daytime electrofishing on May 11, 2017. A total of 302 Largemouth Bass were captured in 1.7 hours of effort for a catch rate of 179/hour. This was over four times higher than the average catch rate for daytime electrofishing in the Sauk Rapids area and almost twice the 2012 catch rate of 91/hr. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6 to 19 inches with an average length of ten inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch in 2017 was higher than 2012 but still within the expected range. Big Lake does not have a history of producing large sunfish, but some larger Bluegills were sampled in 2017. Bluegill sampled ranged in length from three to nine inches; however only 25% of the catch were longer than six inches and 5% were longer than eight inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Black Crappie in 2017 was similar to past surveys and within the range of expected values for similar lakes; however, the gill net catch was above expected values for similar lakes. Seventy-six crappies were sampled during the survey and ranged in length from four to nearly 15 inches with an average length of eight inches. Of the catchable sized fish above five inches, 74% of the catch were longer than eight inches and 23% were longer than ten inches. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2017, Smallmouth Bass were sampled in Big Lake for the first time. Four Smallmouth Bass ranging from 16 to 18 inches in length were sampled during the summer gill net survey. Channel Catfish were first sampled in Big Lake in 2002, and do not appear to be increasing in abundance as only one catfish has been sampled in each of the two surveys since. It is likely that Smallmouth Bass and Channel Catfish immigrated from the Sauk River Chain of Lakes during high water as Big Lake is connected to Becker Lake via Kolling Creek. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during the survey included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",
