Data collected during this nearshore survey were combined with trap net and gill net data to calculate a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score for the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe FIBI Tool-4 was used for scoring and resulted in a FIBI score of 57.  The previous score for Big Bass Lake was 50 in July 2013.  The impairment threshold score is 38, suggesting that the fish population in Big Bass Lake meets expectations for lakes of similar characteristics, and the lake is likely not biologically impaired.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Wild Rice River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass Lake's fish community, like many lakes, has undergone change.  Climate patterns, fishing pressure, shoreline development, fish stocking, and other factors may play a part in the change.  Some changes in fish populations are explainable while others are not.Walleye numbers have recently decreased despite tribal walleye fryling stocking during three consecutive years of 1992 through 1994, tribal walleye fingerling stocking in 2003, and a history of walleye natural reproduction.  Conversely, northern pike numbers are up despite the discontinuation of pike stocking in 1978.  Recent high water levels are likely expanding northern pike spawning habitat while inundating good walleye spawning habitat.  In addition, greater numbers of pike are likely feeding upon both stocked and naturally reproduced walleyes.  Large northern pike and walleye are still available to Big Bass Lake anglers, though small pike dominate the fish community.  In 2005, the average pike in Big Bass was 20.6 inches in length while the average walleye was 21.4 inches in length.Standard summer test netting did not adequately sample bass populations but abundances of both species (largemouth and smallmouth) seemed to be down.  This was the first survey of the six studies done since 1969, in which no smallmouth were sampled.  High water may have detrimentally affected bass and panfish spawning habitat.  Bluegills were small and slow growing, and a large proportion of the population consisted of older fish indicating stunting.  This is consistent with past studies in this lake.All lakes, but particularly small ones with increasing shoreline development, require responsible protection by riparian owners.  Protecting shorelines and fish habitats like bulrushes, cattails, and other aquatic vegetation can help to maintain water quality, fish populations, and property values.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass Lake's fish community, like most, is constantly undergoing change.  Weather patterns, fishing pressure, shoreline development, fish stocking and other factors each play a part in the change.  Some of those changes are easily explained while others are not.Walleye numbers, for instance, have recently decreased despite tribal walleye fryling stocking during three consecutive years, 1992-1994, and despite a history of walleye natural reproduction. Conversely, northern pike numbers are up despite the discontinuation of pike stocking in 1978.  Recent high water levels are likely expanding northern pike spawning habitat while inundating good walleye spawning habitat.  In addition, greater numbers of pike are likely feeding upon both stocked and naturally reproduced walleyes.  Large northern pike and walleye remain available to Big Bass Lake anglers, though small pike dominate the fish community.Standard mid summer test netting did not adequately sample bass populations but abundances of both species (largemouth and smallmouth) seemed to be down.  Again, high water may have detrimentally affected bass and panfish spawning habitat.  Bluegills were slow growing (stunted) and abundant, a large proportion of the population consists of older fish.All lakes, but particularly small ones with increasing shoreline development, require responsible protection by riparian owners.  Protecting shorelines and fish habitats like bulrushes, cattails, and other aquatic vegetation can help to maintain water quality, fish populations, and property values.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The northern pike population has increased significantly since past evaluations but is well within the normal range for lakes of similar classification at 6.6 per gillnet set.  Average growth rates are relatively fast for the young (predominantly age class II+ and III+) pike population.  The calculated PSD is presently 62 percent while the RSD(30) is 4 percent.  The reasons for the exceptionally strong 1989 and 1990 year classes and resultant abundance increase are unclear since no dramatic water level increases or other factors affecting natural reproduction are known to have occurred and spawning habitat is considered to be less than favorable.  Additionally, there has been no northern pike stocking since 1978.Yellow bullhead numbers have exploded during the eighties for no readily apparent reason.  Bullheads of all three species were rare during the initial survey in 1969, but, yellows presently average nearly seventy per gillnet set, well above the \"normal\" range.  In contrast, both black and brown bullheads continue to occupy a very small portion of the total fish population.The sunfishes, especially bluegill, remain high in number but small in size.  The average trapnet catch of bluegill (68.1) was well above the third quartile for class #31 lakes while the average trapnet catch weight (3.68 lbs.) was in the low end of the inter-quartile range.  Predictably, bluegill growth rates are very slow and the mean weight of trapnet-caught fish has decreased considerably.  Presently, the PSD and the RSD(8) are 6 percentand zero, respectively, as compared to 81 percent and 3 percent in 1969.  This phenomenon may be a factor of angler cropping of the largest individuals in the slow-growing population, or, possibly, it may be a factor of indirect competition with the rapidly expanding yellow bullhead population.Both smallmouth and largemouth bass are presumed to be indigenous although 500 fingerling \"black\" bass were stocked in the early part of the century.  The trapnet catch rate of 0.42 smallmouth per net is within the normal range for class 31 lakes and has not changed significantly from survey data taken during the eighties.  The 1969 initial survey, however, reported significantly higher numbers of smaller fish-13 per net.  Trapnet catches for largemouth bass, in contrast, remain somewhat above the expected range for similar lakes at 1.67 per net.  No drastic changes in the largemouth population have been observed since 1969.  Growth rates are somewhat slow for smallmouth but normal for largemouth bass.  PSD and RSD figures should be viewed with caution due to small sample sizes and are reported here only for posterity:     Smallmouth Bass     Largemouth Bass      1969     1992       1969     1992PSD =  0%       43%    PSD =        0%       65%RSD(14)=        0%        0%    RSD(15) =    0%       12%Black crappie are present in Big Bass Lake.  Although only three were taken in the test nets, they were significant in that none were collected in any of the three previous netting evaluations.  Stocking records show that 1,300 fingerling crappie were stocked by the state between 1920 and 1941.  It is unknown whether the present population is a result of those early efforts or some illegal stocking by well-meaning individuals.The yellow perch population appears to be hanging by a thread at 1.1 fish per gillnet set, well below the standard range.  The perch population has declined significantly since 1969, apparently due to northern pike/walleye predation.  Interestingly, the remnant perch population seems to have accomplished a rather large hatch since survey crew members observed an abundance of y.o.y. perch as well as shiners in stomach contents of nearly all walleyes captured in test nets.Walleye fry stocking was discontinued in 1984 with no reduction in the population.  Each year class from 1978 through 1991 was represented in the test net catch with the strongest showing from the '86 and '88 cohorts.  Walleye abundance has not changed significantly since the original survey in 1969, only a non-significant increase from 4.6 to 8.5 fish/GN.  The present gillnet catch rate is actually higher than the third quartile for class #31 lakes.  Walleye in Big Bass Lake grow faster than normal through age five and an average length of approximately 18 inches.  Thereafter, growth rates appear to lag behind normal, possibly a factor of the paucity of adult yellow perch or other suitable large prey.  The average walleye taken in test nets was relatively large at 2.8 lbs. and 20 inches long.  The present size quality is reflected in the PSD of 91% and RSD(20) of 54%.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass Lake's fish community, like most lakes, continues to change.  Climate patterns, fishing pressure, shoreline development, fish stocking, and other factors may play a part in the change.  Some changes in fish populations are explainable while others are not. <br> \n <br> \nWith continued tribal stocking and some sporadic natural reproduction, Walleye numbers have recently increased from the long-term low in 2005 to a more typical 5.1 fish per net.  Northern Pike numbers remain high despite the discontinuation of pike stocking in 1978.  Recent high water levels are likely expanding Northern Pike spawning habitat while inundating good Walleye spawning habitat.  In addition, greater numbers of pike are likely feeding upon both stocked and naturally reproduced Walleyes.  Large Northern Pike and Walleye are still available to Big Bass Lake anglers, though small pike dominate the fish community.  In 2013, the average pike in Big Bass was 19.1 inches in length while the average Walleye was 15.4 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBoth Largemouth and Smallmouth bass catches have declined since the 1960's.  Standard summer test netting in 2013 did not adequately sample bass populations but several of each were caught in test nets.  This was the second survey of the seven studies done since 1969 in which no smallmouth were sampled in trap nets.  High water may have detrimentally affected bass and panfish spawning habitat.  Bluegills continued to be small and slow growing, though the number of fish over seven inches was higher than in 2005. <br> \n <br> \nAll lakes, but particularly small ones with increasing shoreline development, require responsible protection by riparian owners.  Protecting shorelines and fish habitats like bulrushes, cattails, and other aquatic vegetation can help to maintain water quality, fish populations, and property values. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass Lake is a 735-acre lake located in southeastern Mahnomen County within the White Earth Indian Reservation.  White Earth Natural Resources and the Detroit Lakes Department of Natural Resources conduct fisheries management on the lake.  Tribal stocking and some sporadic natural reproduction maintain a Walleye population in low abundance.  A small, unimproved, county-owned public access on the west shore provides parking room for one rig.  The lake is one of a few area lakes with both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations.  A standard fisheries survey was conducted in early August 2022 to evaluate the fish populations at Big Bass Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers remain high, with most fish less than 23 inches.  The average Northern Pike length is 19.9 inches.  Northern Pike numbers increased in the 1990s, likely due to recent high water that has expanded Northern Pike spawning habitat while inundating good Walleye spawning habitat.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers decreased from 5.1 per net in 2013 to 3.3 per net in 2022.  The average length of Walleye was 17.1 inches, which is similar to the historical average.  <br> \n  <br> \nBoth Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass survey catches had declined since the initial survey in 1969.  However, gill net catches in the past two surveys have begun to increase.  It's important to note that gill nets and trap nets are not the most effective sampling techniques for bass.  The average length of a Largemouth Bass sampled was 10.7 inches and 13.6 inches for Smallmouth Bass.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills continue to be small and slow growing, and trap net catches were the lowest ever surveyed.  Black Crappie catch was higher than average, with fish primarily measuring 9 to 10 inches.  The high Northern Pike abundance is likely impacting the abundance of Bluegill and other panfish populations.  Other species caught during the 2022 assessment included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch.</p>",
