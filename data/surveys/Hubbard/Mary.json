                "narrative": "<p>Mary Lake is located off Wilderness Drive near the east entrance of Itasca State Park.  It lies entirely within the park boundary.  Access is on the north end of the lake by an improved concrete ramp, with parking for about 2 rigs.  Mary Lake is in lake class 28 with 15 other lakes in the Bemidji area.  Lakes of this type are small, deep and clear, and tend to be unproductive.   The game fish population in Mary Lake is primarily composed of northern pike, black crappie and bluegill.    Northern pike were sampled at above average abundance for this lake class.  Pike sampled ranged from 16 to 33 inches with most of them about 25 inches and 3 to 4 pounds.  The largest northern sampled was about seven pounds.  Natural reproduction is consistent with all year classes from 1986 through 1995 (except 1990) sampled in our gear.    Largemouth bass were not sampled in this assessment, but three were sampled in trap nets during the 1988 initial survey.  Netting assessments of this type are poor indicators of bass abundance since they are not as vulnerable to this gear.  Largemouth bass were present at least as far back as 1970, when a tracking study describing home ranges of bass was completed, and probably are still present in moderate to low levels.    Black crappie are common in Mary Lake.  Frequent successful reproduction, enhanced by undisturbed aquatic vegetation growth, provides a variety of sizes.  Many are too small to be acceptable to anglers but some 8-11 inch fish are available.    Bluegill are common but small.  Growth rate is too slow to allow them to reach a large size.  Some of the very largest reach seven inches and may be acceptable to anglers.  All year classes from 1989 through 1995 were sampled, but the 1992 and 1993 year classes were weak, as has been noted on many other lakes, probably due to cool weather patterns during spring and summer in those years.    Other fish sampled in 1997 included small numbers of pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, walleye, yellow perch, and white sucker.  Brown bullhead were not sampled in this assessment but were sampled during a previous assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mary Lake is a 56-acre lake with a maximum depth of 41 feet located within Itasca State Park in southern Clearwater County.  A State Park daily or annual vehicle permit is required.  There is a public water access with concrete ramp and parking for two vehicles/trailers.  Mary is one of four lakes located within the park that were selected for the implementation of special fishing regulations in 2006.  Special fishing regulations on Mary Lake consist of a reduced 5-fish bag limit for both Black Crappie and sunfish species, and a catch and release only regulation for Largemouth Bass.  Statewide fishing regulations apply to all other species in Mary Lake.  The lake is managed for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical characteristics and the fish community present.  Mary Lake is in lake class 28.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Mary Lake and other class 28 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Walkerbrook, Lomond, and Lone Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 Northern Pike catch rate of 7.33/GN is within the normal range found in similar lakes.  Pike captured in the survey had an average size of 21.30 inches in length and 2.27 lbs/fish, with fish up to 38.11 inches in length captured in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nAn electrofishing assessment targeting Largemouth Bass was conducted as part of the 2015 survey.  The catch rate of 82.81 bass/hour was a very high catch rate for the Bemidji area, indicating a very abundant bass population in Mary Lake.  Largemouth Bass up to 18.39 inches in length were captured, with an average length of 13.30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe special regulations for sunfish and Black Crappie were implemented to limit angler harvest (which had been high for a lake of this size) and provide more consistent fishing for these species from year to year.  In order to better understand effects of the special regulations for Black Crappie and sunfish, a special assessment using trap nets was conducted in April 2015 as warming temperatures brought these fish into the shallows in preparation for spawning.  This spring assessment supplements information from the standard summer survey, as summer trap net surveys of Black Crappie and sunfish often yield small sample sizes.  Black Crappie up to 13.11 inches in length were captured, with an average size of 8.74 inches, and Bluegill up to 9.09 inches in length were captured, with an average length of 7.33 inches.  The proportion of larger Black Crappie (greater than 10 inches in length) declined from the previous spring trap net survey in 2011, while the proportion of larger Bluegill (greater than 8 inches in length) increased.  Anglers will have the opportunity for some quality Bluegill and Black Crappie fishing in Mary Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2015 survey were Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mary Lake is a 54-acre lake with a maximum depth of 41 feet located within Itasca State Park in southern Clearwater County.  A State Park daily or annual vehicle permit is required.  There is a public water access with concrete ramp and parking for two vehicles/trailers.  Mary is an ideal lake to explore from a canoe or kayak with boats available for rent from the State Park.  Special fishing regulations in effect on Mary Lake consist of a reduced 5-fish bag limit for both Black Crappie and sunfish species, and a 14 to 20-inch protected slot limit regulation for Largemouth Bass.  Statewide fishing regulations apply to all other species in Mary Lake.  The lake is managed for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike.     <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Mary Lake.  The 2020 catch rate of 8.67 fish per net was at the upper end of the range found in similar lakes.  Northern Pike had an average size of 21 inches in length with fish up to 33 inches captured in the survey.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass are not captured effectively in summer surveys of Mary Lake; however, decent populations of these species are present.  Bluegill from 8 to 9 inches in length as well as Largemouth bass up to 17 inches in length were captured in this survey.  Habitat for these species is excellent in Mary Lake with numerous fallen trees and prominent aquatic vegetation around much of the shoreline.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2020 survey were White Sucker, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Hybrid Sunfish, Walleye and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n</p>",
