These two species catch rates exceeded the third quartile of the median of lakes in Lake Class 20 with fish being average in size.Northern pike and rock bass net catches show larger than average size fish for these species in Lake Class 20 with average population levels.The yellow perch net catches indicate below average population levels with catch rates below the first quartile of the median for Class 20 lakes.</p>",
