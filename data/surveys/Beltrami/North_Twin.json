                "narrative": "<p>North Twin Lake is a 313-acre lake with a maximum depth of 59 feet.  It is located six miles east of Turtle River in east central Beltrami County.  There is a United States Forest Service public access on the south side of the lake off county road 22.  The lake is entirely within the Chippewa National Forest.  Over half of the shoreline is under public ownership.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  North Twin Lake is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Buck, Grant, Swenson, South Twin, Elk, South Long and Walker Brook Lakes.  Typically lakes in this class are deep, have little area that is less than 15 feet deep and are clear.  If it gets too windy on the bigger surrounding lakes, North Twin Lake offers anglers a refuge from the wind.  Anglers have a wide variety of species to fish for in North Twin Lake.  DNR fisheries management focuses on walleye, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass.North Twin Lake along with Medicine Lake have an experimental regulation for northern pike.  Anglers are required to release all northern pike between 22\" - 30\".  The northern pike regulation was implemented in 1988 with a goal of improving the size of pike.  Northern pike size appeared to improve after the regulation was implemented.  The four assessments prior to the regulation had average weight of pike ranging from 1.5 - 2.0 pounds, while in 1993 and 1998, average weights improved to 2.8 and 2.6 pounds.  However, by 2003, the average weight of pike declined again to an average of 1.8 pounds.  It is uncertain what may have caused a reversal of the positive gains in pike size.  It has been documented that relatively low levels of noncompliance (illegal harvest) with special fishing regulations can nullify the expected gains.  Creel survey conducted in 2003 documented that 3 -4% of the northern pike caught in the protected size range were being illegally harvested.  Data from this assessment will be included with a variety of other sources such as special spring sampling and angler harvest information to formulate recommendations for the future of this experimental regulation.  Public comment is encouraged anytime, but a formal public review period will be announced prior to dropping, extending or modifying the current regulation.  Walleye abundance is good compared to other class 23 lakes.  Presently walleye fingerling are stocked every third year.  Walleye sampled ranged in length from nine to 25 inches with an average length and weight of 17 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Thirty percent of the walleye sampled in 2003 were greater than 20 inches long indicating a quality fishery.  The most predominant sizes ranged from 12 - 15 inches and 19 - 22 inches, corresponding to years of fingerling stocking.  Walleye in North Twin Lake were exceeding growth rates of other similar lakes.Few perch were sampled that were greater than nine inches which is the siz usually acceptable to anglers.  All perch caught by anglers in the summer creel survey were released and not of an acceptable size.  But yellow perch are important since they provide the primary food source for most larger predators.  In 2003 perch were sampled at a rate that was the lowest recorded out of eight surveys.  DNR personnel will be monitoring this species closely as an indicator of available forage.Both smallmouth and largemouth bass are present in North Twin Lake.  Largemouth bass up to 20 inches and smallmouth bass up to 16 inches were sampled in 2003.  They both are reproducing naturally in the lake.  Natural undeveloped shorelines with its abundant vegetation and submerged logs are ideal for bass spawning.  Protection of the habitat are critical for these species.  Anglers caught more largemouth bass than smallmouth bass during the summer creel survey.Bluegill are present in good numbers in North Twin Lake and is one of the primary species sought and harvested.  There has been a downward trend in the size of bluegill over the past three surveys.  In 2003 only 33% of the bluegill sampled were greater than six inches long and none were sampled greater than 8.5 inches.  Anglers should show some restraint when the bluegills are really biting.  Larger bluegill have disappeared in many lakes because of over harvest.Black crappie are also abundant and ranged in length from 4 to 13 inches.  Age 1 and 5 year olds are the two strongest age classes present and made up 79% of the sample.  Black crappie tend to be more cyclic in their reproductive success.  This leads to some fluctuation in fishing success and average size as individual dominant year classes cycle through.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Twin Lake is a 313-acre lake with a maximum depth of 59 feet located fifteen miles northeast of Bemidji.  There is a U.S. Forest Service (USFS) public water access located on the south shore of the lake off of County Highway 22.  There is one USFS boat-in campsite located on the north shore of the lake.  Anglers can also access Bass Lake, an approximately 50-acre, carry-in lake which lies at the end of a short portage from the northwest end of North Twin Lake.  A special regulation (24 to 36-inch protected slot) is in effect for northern pike.  Statewide regulations apply to all other species.  North Twin Lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are stocked as fingerlings every other year (2009, 2011, etc.).  Walleye abundance varies from year to year based on the success of these stockings as most walleye captured in assessments are aged to stocked years.  The 2012 walleye catch rate of 3.67 fish/gill net was above the median value for class 23 lakes (2.4 fish/gill net).  Walleye ranged in length up to 23.8 inches (although larger fish are likely present), with an average size of 18.3 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Age-3 walleye were the most abundant year class in the sample and averaged 14.1 inches in length.  Age-1 walleye (2011 year class) were also captured in the assessment, indicating some potential for this year class to contribute to the fishery within the next few years.  North Twin Lake has good water clarity, so anglers may want to pursue walleye early or late in the day, and fish deeper water during bright periods of the day.  A measurement of the oxygen profile taken in late July 2012 showed good conditions for fish down to 28 feet in depth. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 northern pike catch rate was 9.56 fish/gill net, which is above the normal range for lake class (8.7 fish/gill net).  The size structure of the northern pike population has shown improvement over the course of the last few assessments.  The proportion of larger northern pike (24 inches or longer) increased from 14% in 2003 to 26% in 2012.  Northern pike captured in the 2012 assessment ranged in length up to 34 inches, with an average size of 21.4 inches and 2.35 pounds.  Anglers should have good success fishing for pike in North Twin Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass are managed as secondary species.  Bluegill were captured  in good numbers, with a majority of the sample measuring between 6.0 and 7.5 inches in length with some larger fish present.  The black crappie catch rate (3.11 fish/gill net) was well above the normal range for lake class (1.67 fish/gill net).  Black crappie over 13 inches in length were present in 2012, with a good proportion of the sample larger than 10 inches in length.  Largemouth and smallmouth bass are both present in North Twin Lake, with largemouth outnumbering smallmouth bass by 6 to 1 in an electrofishing assessment that was conducted as part of the 2012 survey.  Largemouth bass up to 16.9 inches in length were captured, with an average size of 12.1 inches.  Smallmouth bass ranged in length up to 15.9 inches, but had a smaller average size than largemouth bass.  Other species captured in the 2012 assessment included yellow perch, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, and brown bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status of North Twin Lake in 1998     North Twin Lake is a relatively small lake located in the southeast corner of Beltrami County.  The lake has an area of 313 acres, 138 of which is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a scenic little lake with clear, cool water and a maximum depth of 59 feet.  The lake has very little shoreline development which is likely helping to maintain the good water quality.  The U.S. Forest Service manages a large portion of the land surrounding the lake including the picnic area on the southwest corner of the lake where the public boat landing is located.The Fisheries Section of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources manages the lake primarily for walleye, largemouth bass and bluegill.  Northern pike and black crappie are given secondary management consideration.  Currently, standard state regulations apply to North Twin Lake with the exception of a 22 to 30 inch protective slot limit for northern pike which was implemented in 1989.  This regulation was implemented in order to increase the proportion of large fish in the northern pike population.North Twin Lake has slightly above average numbers of walleye compared to other lakes of comparable size and character.  Surveys show that there were more walleye in 1998 than there were in 1993.  Most of the catchable sized walleye are in the 14 to 16 inch length range but fish 17 inches and above are present.  The largest walleye sampled in 1998 was 27.6 inches long and weighed 7.1 pounds.  The Bemidji Area Fisheries office stocks walleye fingerlings every three years.Northern pike are doing well in North Twin Lake.  The abundance of pike was higher than most comparable lakes in 1993 and the numbers in 1998 did not change significantly.  Survey results from 1998 showed good numbers of pike greater than 28 inches long, however, no exceptionally large pike were found.  The largest sampled in 1998 was 33.4 inches long and weighed 7.8 pounds.  Evidence from various studies on the lake suggest that proportionately more large pike are being found in the population today than were found 11 years ago and the protective slot limit may be contributing to the increase.Bluegill abundance is typical for lakes of comparable size and character and the number of bluegill in North Twin Lake has not changed significantly in the last five years.  Bluegill are in good condition, however, larger fish are hard to find.  Ninety five percent of the bluegill sampled in 1998 were less than seven inches long and no bluegill longer than 7.6 inches were found.Yellow perch abundance is typical for lakes of comparable size and character and abundance did not change significantly from 1993 to 1998.  Even though the number of yellow perch has not changed, the size structure of the population has changed.  In 1993, 27% of the yellow perch sampled were over nine inches long whereas less than one percent exceeded nine inches in 1998.  Reasons for the lack of larger yellow perch in the population are not known.Although the survey gear used in North Twin Lake are not effective at sampling largemouth bass, the population level appears to be on the rise.  Both gill net and trap net catch rates in 1998 were the highest reported for the lake.  The largest bass sampled in 1998 was 17.7 inches long and weighed 3 pounds.  However, because of gear limitations, this does not necessarily mean that larger fish are lacking.Abundances of black crappie and pumpkinseed sunfish are relatively low in North Twin Lake which is characteristic of this type of lake.  Black crappie up to 12.8 inches and pumpkinseed sunfish up to 6.8 inches were sampled in 1998.  Smallmouth bass have been found in the lake at least as far back as 1956 and the abundance appears to remain at a low, steady level.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Twin Lake is a 326-acre, lightly developed natural lake located in southern Beltrami County, approximately 20 miles northeast of Bemidji, MN. North Twin has a water clarity of 11 feet, a maximum depth of 59 feet and no inlets or outlets. A U.S. Forest Service (USFS) public water access is located on the southern shore of the lake and has room for five truck and trailers. There is one USFS boat-in campsite on the north shore of the lake. Also, anglers can access Bass Lake via a 25 rod portage located on the northwestern shore of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed on North Twin Lake in 2023 to assess the fish community. Gamefish species targeted by anglers in this lake include Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye lengths ranged from 12 to 23 inches and averaged around 17 inches. Walleye abundance decreased from 2018 and was below the lake's historical average but still within the typical range for lakes with similar morphological characteristics. The Walleye population is sustained by stocking and some natural reproduction. A total of 8 year classes were captured, with the 2019 year class being the most abundant. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance increased from 2018 and was above average for the lake but within the typical range for similar lakes in Minnesota. Northern Pike ranged from 10 to 36 inches and averaged 21 inches. Thirty-one percent of the Northern Pike captured in gill nets were larger than 24 inches. A special regulation (24 to 36 inch protected slot with a 3 fish possession limit, only one over 36 inches) continues to be in effect for Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was similar to the last two surveys which were below average for the lake but within the normal range for this lake type. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3 to 9 inches and averaged 7 inches. Bluegill growth rates in North Twin are slow with fish averaging 4 inches at 4 years old. It is recommended that anglers keep smaller sunfish and release the larger fish to help improve and maintain the population's size structure. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie total lengths ranged from 5 to 12 inches and averaged 10 inches. Black Crappie abundance increased in trap nets from 2018 and was above average for the lake. Black Crappie ages ranged from 2 to 9 years old and growth was slow compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance increased from 2018 and was above the lake's historical average. Largemouth Bass total lengths averaged 10 inches and ranged from 3 to 18 inches, similar to previous surveys. Smallmouth Bass are present in North Twin but at low abundance. Smallmouth up to 16 inches were captured in previous surveys. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has increased since 2003 and was above average for the lake. Yellow Perch total lengths ranged from 5 to 11 inches and averaged 8 inches. Yellow perch are considered an important forage species for large predators like Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. Other species sampled during the survey included Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, North Twin Lake is infested with Starry Stonewort, which is an aquatic invasive species (AIS). AIS can be transferred by anglers and boats from infested to non-infested waterbodies. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. Please follow the current AIS regulations to avoid spreading to other lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Twin Lake is a 326-acre lake with a maximum depth of 59 feet located fifteen miles northeast of Bemidji. There is a U.S. Forest Service (USFS) public water access located on the south shore of the lake off of County Highway 22. There is one USFS boat-in campsite located on the north shore of the lake. Anglers can also access Bass Lake, an approximately 50-acre, carry-in lake which lies at the end of a short portage from the northwest end of North Twin Lake. A special regulation (3 fish bag limit with a 24-36-inch protected slot) is in effect for Northern Pike. North Twin Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are stocked as fingerlings every other year (2017, 2015, etc.). Walleye abundance varies year to year based on the success of these stockings as most Walleye captured in these assessments can be aged to stocked years. In 2015 and 2017 mixed ages of Walleye were stocked due to low fingerling production. The 2018 Walleye catch rate of 4.44 fish/gill net was above the median value for class 23 lakes (2.4 fish/gill net). Walleye ranged in length from 10.63 inches to 25.00 inches with an average length of 16.91 inches and 1.67 pounds. Age-4 Walleye were the most abundant year class in the sample and averaged 14.5 inches in length. The stocked 2017 year class was not represented in the gill net sample, which may indicate poor survival or slow growth of fingerling Walleye. North Twin Lake has good water clarity, so anglers may want to fish Walleye in the lower light periods of the day or deeper water midday. A measurement of the oxygen profile taken in late July 2018 showed good conditions for fish down to 29 feet in depth.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Northern Pike catch rate of 6.56 fish/gill net was below the median value for the lake class (8.7 fish/gill net). Lowering Northern Pike abundance is one of the objectives or the special regulation.  As size structure improves large fish suppress the production of small fish eventually lowering abundance.  The size structure of the Northern Pike population continues to improve. The proportion of Northern Pike 24 inches and larger increased to 54% in 2018 compared to 25% in 2012. Northern pike captured in the survey ranged in length up to 35 inches, with an average length of 23.8 inches and 3.6 pounds.  The special regulation on North Twin Lake has been very effective in providing a high quality pike fishery, not typical of most north-central management zone lakes.  <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass are managed as secondary species. Bluegill were captured in good numbers; 26% of the sample measured between 7 and 8 inches with some larger fish present.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate increased from 3.11 fish/gill net in 2012 to 7.33 fish/gill net in 2018, which exceeds the normal range for lake class (1.67 fish/gill net).  Black Crappie ranged in length from 4.4 inches to 12.8 inches with an average length of 8.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and Smallmouth bass are both present in North Twin Lake. A total of 121 Largemouth Bass and 4 Smallmouth Bass were captured during the 2018 survey. Largemouth Bass ranged in size from 5.2 inches to 19.1 inches with an average length of 10.7 inches. Smallmouth Bass are present in low abundance and ranged in length from 7.6 inches to 15 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured during the 2018 assessment included Yellow Perch, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed sunfish, Rock Bass and White Sucker.  <br> \n</p>",
