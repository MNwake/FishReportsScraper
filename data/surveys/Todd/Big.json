                "narrative": "<p>       Daytime electrofishing was conducted on Big Lake to gather information on the Largemouth Bass population prior to a new regulation proposal.  The proposal would allow for an early catch and release season from March 1st until the last weekend in May (current bass opener) for Largemouth and Smallmouth bass. Thereafter, regular harvest, length and bag limits would apply.  The intent of the regulation would be to increase recreational opportunity for bass angling during spring while offering increased protection to spawning bass.  Routine day electrofishing conducted annually would be used to learn more about size structure, relative recruitment, growth and abundance on eight bass lakes (four experimental, four control) within Morrison and Todd Counties.  Results would be used to effectively educate both internal and external stakeholders of the biological consequences, if any, associated with the practice. Since completion of this assessment DNR Fisheries has decided not to pursue extending the catch and release bass season or the corresponding evaluation. <br> \n      Two earlier electrofishing assessments were conducted on Big Lake in 2011 and 1999.  The 2011 effort was also done during the day.  A new, more efficient electrofishing boat was acquired in 2007 and two netters are used with the new boat versus one netter with the old rig.  The 2013 day time electrofishing assessment on Big Lake produced a catch of 61 Largemouth Bass (45.6/hour) between 2.8 and 18.8 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 10.6 inches, modal length 13 - 14 inches, and PSD of 62.  Bass exceeding sixteen inches accounted for 1.6% (n=1) of the sample.   <br> \n     More Largemouth Bass (n=72) were caught in the 2011 daytime electrofishing assessment but the catch rate was lower, 35/hour.  Size structure of the sample was also less desirable.  The fish measured from 5.4 to 15.2 inches in length.  Mean length (11 inches) was longer then in 2013 but modal length (12 - 13) was shorter.  PSD for the sample was 53 and all of the fish were less than sixteen inches. <br> \n      The night electrofishing effort in 1999 produced the lowest catch rate (n=37; 28.3/hour) but the best size structure.  The bass ranged from 6.3 to 18.9 inches in length with a mean length of 13.5 inches.  There were two modal length groups, 12 - 13 inches and 13 - 14 inches.  PSD for the sample was the highest of the three electrofishing assessments at 89 and 13% (n=5) of the fish were more than sixteen inches in length.   <br> \n      The 2013 daytime electrofishing assessment was the only electrofishing assessment to meet the lake management goal of a bass catch rate of 40 - 60 per hour.  PSDs from all of the electrofishing assessments met or surpassed the management goal of a PSD from 40 - 60. <br> \n      Scales were taken from the Largemouth Bass less than fifteen inches in length netted in the 2013 electrofishing assessment.  Aging becomes more difficult and less accurate from scales in the older fish.  Ages 2 through 7 were represented in the aged sample.  A strong year class from 2011 accounted for 42% (n=20) of the aged sample and the high number of smaller bass under eight inches.  All the age groups exhibited normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n     Spring electrofishing assessments have also been used as an opportunity to evaluate Black Crappie populations in some lakes.  Only one 8.9 inch crappie was netted in the 2013 electrofishing assessment.   Water temperature at the time of 2013 spring electrofishing was 57 - 58 degrees.  Weather was cloudy and cool with a moderate northeast wind.  Pine Island Lake was also electrofished but later in the same day after Big Lake.  Thirty-five Black Crappie were netted in Pine Island and the fish tended to be deeper.   <br> \n     Ninety-nine Black Crappies (48/hour) were captured in the 2011 spring electrofishing assessment.  The fish measured from 6.6 to 12 inches in length with a mean length of 9.4 inches for the sample.  Modal length was 9 - 9.5 inches with 80% (n=79) of the fish more than nine inches in length and 22% (n=22) exceeding ten inches. <br> \n      Other fish species observed during the 2013 spring electrofishing assessment were an abundance of Yellow Perch and a few Bluegills, some up to eight inches in length. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake is a picturesque lake in northern Todd County west of Cushing.  The lake is slightly tea colored due to bog drainage but water clarity is still very good with visibility down to 7.25 feet.  Big Lake covers 277 acres and has a maximum depth of 21 feet. Approximately 60% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The most common bottom type in shallow water is sand although some gravel, rubble, and boulder substrates exist.  Bottom types in bays are muck and decaying vegetative matter.  An abundance of aquatic plants, including several \"cabbage\" (pondweed) varieties, grow out to a depth of 16 feet and provide excellent fish habitat.  Emergent vegetation types such as waterlily (white and yellow), bulrush and cattail are present and provide good fish cover and help maintain water quality by taking up excess nutrients.  A resort on the lake has one cabin and two campsites available.     Anglers probably seek panfish more than any other species on Big Lake.  Bluegill in the 6 to 7 inch range were common in assessment nets although anglers will likely sort through many small fish to obtain a meal.  Bluegill grow slowly in Big Lake with fish not reaching 6 inches until their seventh or eighth growing season.  For this reason, anglers are encouraged to limit their kill of \"keeper\" size fish of this species as slow growing panfish can be easily \"overfished\".  In other words, take enough for a meal and release the rest.  Black crappie are also abundant at times and can be a draw to anglers year round.  Spring trapnetting revealed an abundance of fish in the 8 to 9.5 inch range.  Adult crappies grow slow when compared to other lakes in the area with fish reaching 9 inches in their sixth year.  Black crappies up to 12 inches were seen during assessments in 1999.     Northern pike are abundant and provide fast action for anglers targeting this species.  Most fish (67%) caught during the assessment were 20 inches and less and displayed slow growth.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest these abundant small northern pike. Quality northerns up to 30 inches were seen in the survey and angler reports of 20 pound fish have been documented.  Large pike are rare in Big Lake and releasing fish over 24 inches would help maintain a healthy balance of predators and prey in the fish community.     Big Lake contains a quality largemouth bass population with opportunities for both numbers of fish and trophies.  Spring electrofishing sampled fish from 6 to 19 inches and anglers report occasional trophy fish in the 6 pound class.  Largemouth display normal to slow growth so big bass are quite old.  Releasing individuals 12 inches and longer will help maintain this quality fishery.     Walleye are stocked every third year and provide a limited fishery.  Survival of stocked walleye is limited due to predation by the abundant northern pike.  Walleye ranged from 20 to 26 inches and averaged 22.8 inches (4.4 pounds).  Trophy individuals in excess of 10 pounds are present.  Future walleye management will involve stocking fingerlings every other year and educating anglers of the value of harvesting small northern pike.  It is likely that walleye angling will not improve unless northern pike numbers decline.     Prey populations in Big Lake include yellow perch and white suckers, both of which are low in abundance when compared to similar lakes.  Limited prey abundance is probably the reason for slow growth rates of gamefish in Big Lake.  A decrease in the northern pike population would probably result in a corresponding increase in the abundance of prey.     Other species sampled during the assessment include bullhead (black, brown, yellow), hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed.  Several shiner species have been sampled in previous surveys.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake (DOW# 77-0063-00; Lake Class 29) is a 294 acre lake located near Cushing, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the southeast Shore. Big Lake has 3.75 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 21 feet. DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Big Lake is in Lake Class 29; lakes in this class generally have a high amount of water less than 15 feet deep and are regular shaped. <br> \n <br> \nBig Lake is predominantly known as a bass and panfish lake. The majority of Bluegill and Black Crappie were just below the size that most anglers prefer, although there were good numbers of both. Both numbers and size structure of Largemouth Bass were on the low end for the management goal ranges for Big Lake, but Largemouth Bass up to 18 inches were captured. Northern Pike and Walleye numbers were low with few larger fish observed. Anglers should consider any Walleye caught as a pleasant surprise. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS) can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Big Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake is a moderately developed lake in northern Todd County west of Cushing.  The lake water was slightly tea colored due to bog drainage and strong winds during the survey which decreased water clarity to 4 feet in mid-July.  Approximately 60% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep with aquatic vegetation growing down to 12 feet.  The most common submerged plants, those growing primarily under the water surface, were Robbins pondweed and coontail.  The most common shallow water bottom type was sand with muck being found near the marshy shorelines.  Much of the developement on the lake was on the east side due to extensive marsh areas along the south and west shores of the lake.      Anglers probably seek panfish more than any other species on Big Lake.  Bluegills in the 6 to 7 inch range were common in the survey although the average size was closer to 5 inches.  Black crappies are also common but the size does tend to small, about 7 inches.  Anglers have reported catching crappies up to 11 inches, however.  Most of the largemouth bass seen in the survey were less than 14 inches but anglers report good bass fishing and some tournaments are also held on the lake.  Other assessments on the lake have shown the presence of quality size to trophy size fish over 20 inches.    Northern pike numbers did show a decline from 1999 but continue to be above the desired management level.  The size typically caught by anglers will likely be small due to abundance of fish under 24 inches but some larger fish are present in the lake.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest these abundant small northern pike.  Large pike are rare in Big Lake and releasing fish over 24 inches would help maintain a healthy balance of predators and prey in the fish community.  Big Lake has a limited walleye fishery that is sustained through stocking in odd numbered years.  Any angler hooking into a walleye has a good chance of catching a nice fish as most of the walleyes in the survey were between 19 and 29 inches in length.  Yellow perch have never been overly abundant in the lake, however numbers did show an improvement from the last survey which was likely a response to the lower pike numbers.  High perch numbers help sustain good walleye and pike growth rates as well as that of bluegills.  The lower pike numbers should also improve the survival of the stocked walleyes.    Although all three species of bullhead are in the lake, yellow bullheads were much more abundant than the black and brown bullheads in the survey.      Neascus or black spot was common on some of the bluegills, northern pike, walleye, yellow perch, and largemouth bass.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin on the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested.    Proper land use practices are encouraged in the watershed and by the lakeshore owners to improve the water quality and fish habitat in Big Lake.  Protecting the fish habitat is important to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of nearshore fish species was conducted on June 27, 2016 by IBI Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but 1 station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 6 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 3 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 1 station.  Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including 1 species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and 1 that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish).  Additionally, trap nets were set at 9 locations on June 28 to capture a representative sample of the fish community.  The trap nets captured 10 species of fish and a majority of the catch was comprised of Bluegill and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for Big Lake is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Big Lake is located in the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A spring panfish assessment was conducted on Big Lake to further evaluate the bluegill population and replace the summer trap nets in the population assessment.  Regular summer population assessments typically do not sample many of the larger panfish in a population.   Efforts were made to locate panfish spawning areas while setting six standard lake survey trap nets around the lake.  Scales were taken from the bluegills for age and growth data.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 412 bluegill between 3 and 8.2 inches in length were sampled in the 2011 panfish assessment.  Mean length was 6.7 inches and modal length 7 - 7.5 inches.  Half (n=204) of the fish were more than seven inches in length with 3% (n=12) exceeding eight inches.  This was the first panfish assessment conducted on Big Lake.  A black crappie assessment was conducted in early April of 1999 that sampled 1,882 bluegill between 3.7 - 9 inches.  Only 10% (185) of the bluegill were measured so the length frequency distribution may not be representative of the catch.   Although the 2011 summer gill nets caught fewer bluegill (n=64), the size structure of the sample was more desirable than the 2011 spring catch.  The bluegill measured from 4.1 to 8.5 inches with a mean length of 6.8 inches and modal length of 7 - 7.5 inches.  Fish exceeding seven inches comprised 63% (n=40) of the sample while 3% (n=2) were more than eight inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nAges 3 through 9 were represented in the 2011 bluegill catch.   Ages 6 and 8 displayed fast growth while the remaining age groups showed normal growth when compared to an area mean back-calculated length table.  The 2004 year class dominated the catch, accounting for 32% of the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nWhen looking at the 2005 and 1999 summer surveys for Big Lake, the gill nets again sampled the bigger bluegill.  In 2005, the trap nets caught 265 bluegill between 3.4 and 7.1 inches in length.  Mean length was 5.2 inches and modal length 6 - 6.5 inches.   Only one bluegill (0.4%) was over seven inches in length.  The 2005 gill nets caught 171 bluegill ranging from 3.4 - 7.2 inches in length.  Mean length was an inch longer (6.2 inches), but the modal length was the same, 6 - 6.5 inches.  Four percent (n=7) of the bluegill were more than seven inches in length.   In 1999, the trap nets caught 607 bluegill between 3 and 7.3 inches in length.  Mean length was 5.5 inches and modal length 6 - 6.5 inches.  One percent (n=9) of the fish exceeded seven inches.   The 1999 gill nets sampled 201 bluegill between 3.5 and 8.8 inches in length.  The mean length was slightly longer than in the trap net catch (5.7 inches) but the modal length was shorter, 5.5 - 6 inches.  Two percent (n=5) of the fish were more than seven inches with one fish over eight inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 panfish assessment also sampled 30 black crappie between 7.1 and 10.2 inches in length.  Mean length was 9 inches and crappie over nine inches comprised 63% (n=19) of the catch.  The black crappie assessment in 1999 was more effective and captured 171 crappie measuring from 3.9 to 12.3 inches in length.   Mean length for the 1999 catch was eight inches and 25% (n=43) of the fish were more than nine inches in length.    <br> \n <br> \nWhile conducting a spring daytime electrofishing effort in 2011 for largemouth bass, 99 black crappie were also netted.  The fish ranged from 6.6 to 12 inches in length with a mean length of 9.4 inches.  The catch was dominated by larger crappie as 79% (n=79) were more than nine inches and 22% (n=22) were over ten inches in length.   Scales were collected from the electrofishing sample for aging data which was included in the 2011 summer population assessment. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 crappie gill net catch of 1.7/GN (n=10) was within the interquartiles for lake class 29 but a significant decrease from the 2005 catch of 4.2/GN (interquartile range = 1 \u0013 4.8/GN).  The fish measured from 7.6 to 10.1 inches in length with a mean length of 8.9 inches and 40% (n=4) exceeding nine inches in length.  Black crappie up to 10.2 inches were caught in the 2005 gill net sample but smaller fish dominated the catch.  Mean length was 7.1 inches and only 4% (n=1) was more than nine inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nSome of the gamefish caught in the 2011 panfish assessment included three northern pike between 11.7 and 19.7 inches, and three walleye between 15.8 inches and 29.1 inches.  Other fish species netted included black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nBoth the 2011 gill nets and trap nets were much more effective at sampling larger bluegill over seven inches than past sampling efforts and there appears to be a definite increase in bluegill over seven inches.  Daytime spring electrofishing has also shown promise as a method to evaluate black crappie populations and may be considered in the future for Big Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The current fish community structure of Big Lake is typical of lakes withinits classification (Lake Class 29).  The lake is characterized by a high abundanceof northern pike; low abundance of walleye and yellow perch; and small, slowgrowing sunfish.  Since 1988, the northern pike gillnet catch has shown asignificant increase form 3.83/set to 7.67/set while the walleye catch has declinedsignificantly from 4.50/set to 1.67/set.  High predation by the expanding northernpike population and low forage availability likely account for the reduced walleyecatches.  The yellow perch population remains below desired levels, however thegillnet catch was 0.67/set in 1988 compared to 6.83/set in 1993.  The largemouthbass population is difficult to assess using standard lake survey gear andelectrofishing will be required to properly identify population characteristics. Big Lake is one of the few lakes in the area targeted for largemouth bass.  Localsreported catching bass this year in the 5 pound class.  The bluegill trapnet catchfell within the normal range and is dominated by small individuals.  No bluegillslarger than 7 inches were sampled during the survey.  The black crappie trapnetcatch was also within the normal range.  One 12 inch crappie was sampled in thesurvey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Big Lake is a popular panfish lake in northern Todd County.   Although bluegill and black crappie are the main draw for anglers, the lake also supports other fish species that may attract fishermen.   Largemouth bass and northern pike are the primary management species for Big Lake.  Results from the summer survey suggest an increase in abundance of bass.  Smaller fish dominate the population as most of the bass observed in the 2011 assessments were less than 12 inches.  Anglers do, however, have a chance of catching quality fish as bass up to 19 inches have been observed in past surveys.  The pike population is also dominated by smaller fish as few fish over 30 inches have been documented in any of the surveys done on the lake.  While the 2011 gill net catch was above management goals, the catch was within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.   Anglers are encouraged to harvest the surplus of fish under 24 inches and release the larger pike.  This would help maintain a healthy balance of predators and prey in the fish community.  Black crappie provide a popular winter fishery and anglers report better fishing at night.  Crappie over nine inches were common in the summer assessment, spring electrofishing,  and 2011 spring assessment with some measuring up to 12 inches.   Walleye abundance was lower than desired despite stocking in even-numbered years.  Most of the walleye caught in the summer survey were more than 20 inches in length suggesting poor recruitment of young walleye.   Anglers looking for bluegill have a chance to find some \"keepers\" as fish over seven inches were common in both the summer and spring assessments.   Yellow perch have never been abundant in the lake, and the recent gill net catch suggested that numbers have declined which may be a response to the higher pike numbers.  High perch numbers help sustain good walleye and pike growth rates as well as that of bluegills.  All three species of bullhead, yellow, brown, and black, can be found in Big Lake.  Yellow bullhead are the most abundant of the three species.  Quality size fish over eleven inches were caught of all three species with some individuals up to 14 inches being measured.   <br> \n    Proper land use practices are encouraged in the watershed and by the lakeshore owners to improve the water quality and fish habitat in Big Lake.  Protecting the fish habitat is important to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Daytime electrofishing was conducted on Big Lake to gather information on the Largemouth Bass population prior to the potential proposal of a season expansion.  The proposal would allow for an early catch and release season from March 1st until the last weekend in May (current bass opener) for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass. Thereafter, regular harvest, length and bag limits would apply.  The intent of the regulation would be to increase recreational opportunity for bass angling during spring.  Routine day electrofishing conducted annually has been planned to learn more about size structure, relative recruitment, growth and abundance on six bass lakes (four experimental, two control) within Morrison and Todd Counties.  Results would be used to effectively educate both internal and external stakeholders of the biological consequences, if any, associated with the practice. Since completion of this assessment DNR Fisheries has decided not to pursue extending the catch and release bass season or the corresponding Study Four proposal at this time. <br> \nThe 2015 electrofishing assessment was the fifth bass electrofishing effort to be conducted on Big Lake.  There were also assessments in 2014, 2013, 2011, and 1999.  The three most recent electrofishing assessments were daytime assessments.  A new, more efficient electrofishing boat was acquired in 2007 and two netters are used with the new boat versus one netter with the old rig.  Prior to 2007, bass electrofishing was done at night with an older, less efficient boat and usually only one netter.   Catch rates for most species appeared to increase after the acquisition of the new boat for both day and nighttime efforts. <br> \nThe sixty-eight Largemouth Bass netted in the 2015 spring electrofishing assessment produced the highest catch rate to date for Big Lake, 88 bass/ hour.  The bass ranged from 2.9 to 20 inches in length with a mean length of 9.4 inches for the sample.  PSD for the catch was 68 and 2% (n=2) of the fish exceeded sixteen inches.  Modal length for the sample was 13 \u0013 14 inches, which was comparable to both 2014 and 2013 results.  Half of the bass caught in 2015 were less than eight inches in length.  No aging structures were collected from the bass sample. <br> \nIn 2014, sixty-nine Largemouth Bass were sampled in the bass electrofishing assessment for a catch rate of 62.1 bass/hour.  The fish ranged from 4.7 inches to 20.9 inches in length with a mean length of 10.9 inches.  PSD for the sample was 65 with 9% of the bass exceeding sixteen inches in length.  Modal length for the sample was 13 - 14 inches. <br> \nThe 2013 day time electrofishing assessment on Big Lake produced a catch of 61 Largemouth Bass (45.6/hour) between 2.8 and 18.8 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 10.6 inches, modal length 13 \u0013 14 inches, and PSD of 65.  Bass exceeding sixteen inches accounted for 1.6% (n=1) of the sample.  The 2011 year class also dominated in 2013, accounting for 42% of the aged fish.  Results from the 2013 assessment were very similar to the 2014 statistics.    <br> \nA larger sample size of bass (n=72) was caught in the 2011 daytime electrofishing assessment but the catch rate was lower, 35/hour due to more effort.  Size structure of the sample was also less desirable.  The fish measured from 5.4 to 15.2 inches in length.  Mean length (11 inches) was longer then in 2013 but modal length (12 \u0013 13 inches) was shorter.  PSD for the sample was 53 and all of the fish were less than sixteen inches. <br> \nThe night electrofishing effort in 1999 produced the lowest catch rate (n=37; 28.3/hour) but the best size structure.  The bass ranged from 6.3 to 18.9 inches in length with a mean length of 13.5 inches.  There were two modal length groups, 12 \u0013 13 inches and 13 \u0013 14 inches.  PSD for the sample was the highest of the four electrofishing assessments at 89 and 13% (n=5) of the fish were more than sixteen inches in length.   <br> \nCatch rates have shown an improvement since the initial electrofishing assessment in 1999 although data from that assessment may not be comparable due to a different boat, time of day, and number of netters.   Three of the electrofishing assessments, 2015, 2014 and 2013 met the lake management goal of a bass catch rate of 40 \u0013 60 per hour.  PSDs from all of the electrofishing assessments met or surpassed the management goal of a PSD from 40 \u0013 60. <br> \nSeventeen Black Crappies were also netted and measured in the 2015 bass assessment (17/hour).  The fish ranged from 5.6 to 11.2 inches in length with a mean length of 8.1 inches for the sample.  The catch was dominated by medium size fish less than nine inches in length as only four crappie exceeded nine inches (23%).  Crappie growth rates were relatively slow and age groups 3 through 7 were represented in the sample with no exceptionally strong year class evident. <br> \n\tThe 2014 spring bass assessment was not used to evaluate the Black Crappie population in Big Lake.  Only one nine inch crappie was netted in the 2013 spring assessment.  The first spring electrofishing assessment used to evaluate the crappie population was 2011 when ninety-nine Black Crappie were netted for a catch rate of 48 fish per hour.  The fish were between 6.6 and 12 inches in length with a mean length of 9.4 inches for the sample.  Modal length for the sample was 9 \u0013 9.5 inches with 80% (n=79) of the fish exceeding nine inches and 22% (n=22) more than ten inches in length.   <br> \n\tOther fish species observed in the 2015 spring bass electrofishing assessment were Bluegill of all sizes, Yellow Perch \u0013 some to 7.5 inches, small Northern Pike, and a few large bullhead.</p>",

A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the southeast shore. Big Lake has 3.75 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 21 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike and secondarily for Black Crappie and Walleye. The lake was initially surveyed in 1978 and 14 fish sampling surveys or investigations have occurred since then with the most recent prior sampling in 2016 (standard survey). Spring electrofishing has been completed on an annual basis since 2013 with 2 previous surveys before that. <br> \n <br> \nGuidelines for the taking of aging structures for age and growth were as follows; Largemouth Bass-otoliths from all fish (subsample-10 per 10mm).   <br> \n <br> \nA spring electrofishing targeted survey was completed as part of a review of black bass population dynamics in the Little Falls Fisheries Management Area. The Largemouth Bass spring electrofishing catch rate was 61.75 fish/hr. This catch rate was just above the long range management goal for Big Lake (40-60 fish/hr) and similar to past catch rates. Size structure values were 33 for proportional size distribution (PSD) and 8 for proportional size distribution-preferred (PSD-P). This did not meet the long-range management goal of 40-60 for PSD. Largemouth Bass growth was similar to the Little Falls Fisheries Management Area mean. Annual mortality was 28% with a maximum observed age of 12. Largemouth Bass recruitment was consistent with 10 age classes represented up to age 12. The mean length of Largemouth Bass sampled was 9.27 inches with lengths ranging from 5.1 to 16.2 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Daytime electrofishing was conducted on Big Lake to gather information on the Largemouth Bass population prior to the potential proposal of a season expansion.  The proposal would allow for an early catch and release season from March 1st until the last weekend in May (current bass opener) for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass. Thereafter, regular harvest, length and bag limits would apply.  The intent of the regulation would be to increase recreational opportunity for bass angling during spring.  Routine day electrofishing conducted annually has been planned to learn more about size structure, relative recruitment, growth and abundance on six bass lakes (four experimental, two control) within Morrison and Todd Counties.  Results would be used to effectively educate both internal and external stakeholders of the biological consequences, if any, associated with the practice. Since completion of this assessment DNR Fisheries has decided not to pursue extending the catch and release bass season or the corresponding Study Four proposal at this time. <br> \n       The 2014 electrofishing assessment was the fourth bass electrofishing effort to be conducted on Big Lake.  There were also assessments in 2013, 2011, and 1999.  Both the 2013 and 2011 electrofishing assessments were done during the day.  A new, more efficient electrofishing boat was acquired in 2007 and two netters are used with the new boat versus one netter with the old rig.  Prior to 2007, bass electrofishing was done at night with an older, less efficient boat and usually only one netter.   Catch rates for most species appeared to increase after the acquisition of the new boat for both day and nighttime efforts. <br> \n       A total of 69 Largemouth Bass were sampled in the 2014 bass electrofishing assessment for a catch rate of 62.1/hour.  The fish ranged from 4.7 inches to 20.9 inches in length with a mean length of 10.9 inches.  PSD for the sample was 65 with 9% of the bass exceeding 16 inches in length.  Modal length for the sample was 13 - 14 inches. <br> \n       Scales were taken from the Largemouth Bass less than 15 inches in length netted in the 2014 electrofishing assessment.  Aging typically becomes more difficult and less accurate from scales in the older fish.  Ages 2 through 7 and 9 were represented in the 2014 bass sample suggesting consistent recruitment.  The 2011 year class appears to have a dominant presence in the population, accounting for 36% of the aged fish.  A majority of year classes displayed normal growth rates when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.   <br> \n       The 2013 day time electrofishing assessment on Big Lake produced a catch of 61 Largemouth Bass (45.6/hour) between 2.8 and 18.8 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 10.6 inches, modal length 13 - 14 inches, and PSD of 65.  Bass exceeding 16 inches accounted for 1.6% (n=1) of the sample.  The 2011 year class also dominated in 2013, accounting for 42% of the aged fish.  Results from the 2013 assessment were very similar to the 2014 statistics.    <br> \n       A larger sample size of bass (n=72) was caught in the 2011 daytime electrofishing assessment but the catch rate was lower, 35/hour due to more effort.  Size structure of the sample was also less desirable.  The fish measured from 5.4 to 15.2 inches in length.  Mean length (11 inches) was longer then in 2013 but modal length (12 - 13 inches) was shorter.  PSD for the sample was 53 and all of the fish were less than16 inches. <br> \n       The night electrofishing effort in 1999 produced the lowest catch rate (n=37; 28.3/hour) but the best size structure.  The bass ranged from 6.3 to 18.9 inches in length with a mean length of 13.5 inches.  There were two modal length groups, 12 - 13 inches and 13 - 14 inches.  PSD for the sample was the highest of the four electrofishing assessments at 89 and 13% (n=5) of the fish were more than 16 inches in length.   <br> \n       Catch rates have shown an improvement since the initial electrofishing assessment in 1999 although data from that assessment may not be comparable due to a different boat, time of day, and number of netters.   Two of the electrofishing assessments, 2014 and 2013 were the only assessments to meet the lake management goal of a bass catch rate of 40 -\u001360 per hour.  PSDs from all of the electrofishing assessments met or surpassed the management goal of a PSD from 40- 60. <br> \n       Other fish species observed during the 2014 spring electrofishing assessment included some small Yellow Perch, an occasional Black Crappie, Bluegill up to 7.5 inches, a couple of small Northern Pike, and one bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Big Lake was conducted on July 24, 2017 by Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations and a 15-foot seine was used at one station.  No seine was used at station 2 due to bog fringe with soft substrates, deep water, and dense vegetation.  Nearshore sampling captured 16 native species of fish including just one species intolerant of habitat disturbance (Iowa Darter). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for this survey is just above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   <br> \n</p>",

The lake has been daytime electrofished during eight springs since 2011.  A total of 66 Largemouth Bass were captured in 2019 in 1.5 hours of effort resulting in a catch rate of 44/hour.   Bass ranged in length from 2.8 to 17.7 inches in length with 40 of the fish falling in the 12-15.9 inch range. Mean length was 12.2 inches.   Past daytime catch rates have been variable ranging from 35 to 88 per hour with a mean of 60 per hour.  The 2019 results were typical for Big Lake and suggest a relatively stable population with consistent reproduction.  A variety of habitats are present in the lake including bulrush beds, woody cover, lily pads, cattail fringe and boulders.  Anglers seeking bass should find a range of sizes with some potential for larger fish over 18 inches.  Harvest of  bass over 16 inches should be considered carefully as many of these fish may be 10 to 15 years old or even older.</p>",
