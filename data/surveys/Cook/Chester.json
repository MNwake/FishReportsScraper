                "narrative": "<p>The primary purpose of the 2010 assessment of Chester Lake was to determine whether survival and growth of stocked brown trout was satisfactory to meet the goals of the 2004 lake management plan.  Additionally, Clean Water Legacy funding allowed areas across the state to do some nearshore fish community sampling to improve our ability to use a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) to identify disturbed aquatic ecosystems.  Chester Lake was selected for nearshore sampling because its accessibility allowed for use of the required sampling gears. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch of brown trout was the low for this lake, but still close to average for the Grand Marais area.  Mean weight was the second highest since the species became well established, and was above average for the area.  Catch goals (at least four fish per net) and the size goal (some fish over 20 inches) from the current (2004) lake management plan were not met.  Growth rates for older brown trout in this lake seem to have declined since the species first became established, despite the presence of relatively high numbers of fathead minnow, rainbow smelt, and small white sucker.  <br> \n <br> \nRainbow smelt, as assessed by small-mesh gill nets, were abundant for the lake and the area.  Most were too small to be taken in standard gill and trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore sampling targeting small fish was done with a backpack electrofisher and three small-mesh gears: 0.25-inch-mesh trap nets, 0.25-inch-mesh wire minnow traps, and a 0.125-inch-mesh beach seine.   In decreasing order of abundance, 0.25-inch-mesh trap nets collected fathead minnow, rainbow smelt, brook stickleback, and white sucker.  Fathead minnow and brook stickleback were taken by all four gears.  White sucker were taken by all gears except the seine.  Rainbow smelt were taken only in the trap nets, and central mudminnows were taken only by electrofishing.  This sampling added no new species to the list of species identified from this lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chester Lake lies within the Lake Superior North watershed, draining to the lake via Portage Brook and the Pigeon River.  It is a designated stream trout lake that has been managed for stream trout since at least 1948, and has been almost exclusively stocked with brown trout since 1980.  Long range goals for brown trout from the current (2012) lake management plan are to maintain a minimum gill net catch of 4.0 fish/set, with some fish over 20 inches present.  Chester Lake is unique among stream trout lakes in this area in supporting high numbers of rainbow smelt, which provide an excellent forage base for brown trout.  This was the second of two surveys scheduled in the 2012 plan to determine whether growth and survival of stocked brown trout were satisfactory.  The first was completed in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nBrown trout seemed to have been fairly abundant in 2019, with most fish in the 14-17-inch size range.  The 2019 gill net catch appeared to meet the current long range goal for numbers of fish, but not the size goal (no 20-inch trout were taken).  The catch was similar to catches seen in this lake in the past, and fell within the normal range for fall surveys of stream trout lakes in this area (1.0 - 5.3 fish/set).  All of the brown trout taken in 2019 were probably one or three-year-old fish from yearling stocking done in 2019 and 2017.  The seeming lack of older fish was unusual for this lake.  Size goals for the lake have been met in the past when fish four years old or older were sampled.  It is likely that a few older fish were present in Chester Lake in 2019, and were simply missed by the small number of nets used.  From mean lengths at capture, it appeared that brown trout growth had been about average for the area.  <br> \n <br> \nSurvey results from 2014 and 2019 indicate growth and survival of stocked brown trout in this lake have been adequate.  Both have been high enough to allow catch and size goals to be met, although not necessarily in every survey, or in the same survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe high catch in the single small-mesh gill net set made in this survey, and the capture of several smelt in 0.25-in-mesh traps, indicated rainbow smelt probably remained abundant in this lake in 2019.  Most were small, and vulnerable to predation by brown trout of all sizes.  Brown trout also had access to minnows of several species. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 white sucker gill net catch was similar to past catches seen in this lake, and was within the normal range for a stream trout lake in this area (2.4 - 12.5 fish/set).  Although white sucker can compete with stocked stream trout for invertebrate forage, their presence has probably not limited brown trout in this lake due to the high-quality forage base provided by smelt and minnows. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

IMMED- IATELY AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF BROWN TROUT IN 1980, THEIR ABUNDANCE APPARENTLY DECLINED SHARPLY. THIS ASSESSMENT APPEARED TO SHOW LITTLE CHANGE IN ABUNDANCE SINCE THE INITIAL DECLINE, AND LITTLE CHANGE IN SIZE. THREE YEAR CLASSES WERE SAMPLED, AND GROWTH APPEARED TO BE ABOUT AVERAGE FOR COOK COUNTY. RAINBOW SMELT CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT FORAGE BASE FOR THE BROWN TROUT POPULA- TION. WHITE SUCKER ABUNDANCE WAS RELATIVELY HIGH. A WIDE RANGE OF SIZES WERE PRESENT, BUT WHITE SUCKER SAMPLED IN THE GILL NETS WERE IN POOR CONDITION. SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES WERE PRESENT, HOWEVER, THE 1987 YEAR CLASS WAS MISSING FROM THE SAMPLE. GROWTH APPEARED TO BE GOOD BY STATE STANDARDS. NORTHERN CREEK CHUB WERE SAMPLED IN THE 1/4 IN. TRAP NETS. CREEK CHUBS SAMPLED RANGED FROM 6.5 TO 9.5 IN, AND SHOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FORAGE FOR BROWN TROUT. ALTHOUGH NOT SAMPLED IN THIS ASSESSMENT, YELLOW PERCH WERE FOUND ELSEWHERE IN THE WATERSHED (DEVILFISH LAKE) FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1989. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE BARRIER BELOW CHESTER LAKE WILL BE ABLE TO PREVENT THE MOVEMENT OF YELLOW PERCH INTO THE LAKE (RAINBOW SMELT FROM DEVILFISH LAKE WERE ABLE TO BYPASS THE BARRIER).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chester Lake is a designated stream trout lake.  It has been managed for trout since at least 1948, and for brown trout since 1980.  The current goal for brown trout in this lake is a minimum gill net catch of 4.0 fish/set, with some fish over 20 inches present.  This was the first of two assessments scheduled in the 2012 lake management plan to determine whether growth and survival of stocked brown trout remained satisfactory in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nA temperature-oxygen profile done on 19 August 2014 found conditions ideal for brook (or brown) trout (temperature < 68 F, oxygen > 5 ppm) from the surface to a depth of about 15 ft.  The summer of 2014 was relatively cool, so this measurement may have represented a best-case scenario for late summer conditions in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nBrown trout numbers may have been somewhat low in September 2014, but a few larger fish were present.  The brown trout gill net catch fell below the long range goal for the lake, but with only two gill net sets used, the results of this single assessment cannot be given much weight.  That said, a similarly low catch was also observed in the last (2010) assessment.  If the next assessment (2018) yields the same results, we may have to adjust our stocking strategy in this lake.  Fish from the 2011 and 2013 yearling stockings were represented in the 2014 catch.  Too few fish were taken to describe growth with any confidence.  The size goal for the lake was met by the capture of one 21-in fish in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nBrown trout have been stocked in Chester Lake to take advantage of forage provided by abundant rainbow smelt.  Rainbow smelt remained abundant in 2014; the catch in small-mesh gill nets (58.0 fish/set) was at the upper end of the normal range for catches in that gear in lakes in this area.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker were also abundant in 2014; the gill net catch was above the normal range for this type of lake, and was the highest seen in Chester Lake historically.  Many smaller white sucker were present; they may have have provided additional forage for brown trout.  Because of the available rainbow smelt forage base, the presence of even large numbers of white sucker is probably not a factor limiting brown trout in this lake.   <br> \n</p>",

Rainbow smelt were also abundant, and provided an excellent forage base for brown trout.  Most of the rainbow smelt collected were one-year-old fish, but some survived to age 4.  Growth of rainbow smelt was average for the area.  White sucker, brook stickleback, creek chub, and fathead minnow were also collected, in relatively small numbers.</p>",
