Northern Pike numbers were the high at 20.8/gill net and average size was 20.4\".  While 28% fell within the 22-26\" protected slot there were plenty below (60%) to harvest and enough larger fish above 26\" (12%) to keep things interesting.  Walleyes are not stocked into Norway and none were caught for the second straight survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were average for this type of lake (4.8/gill net).  With 48% of the fish over 8\", there are some harvestable fish, however, the largest fish captured was only 9.5\".  Bluegill numbers were also average at 8.1/trap net, but size was small.  Average length was only 5.4\" and only 3% were 7\" or larger.  Yellow Perch were present in average numbers (9.0/gill net) and fish up to 10.8\" were captured. <br> \n</p>",

The northerns show an average weight of around 1.5 pounds and length groups from 9-32.9 inches.  The age groups from 1-8 are represented with 1,2 and 3 year old fish representing 85% of the total fish.The bowfin average 5.0 pounds.The whitesuckers average 2.0 pounds.The yellow perch have good length frequency distribution and age groups from 3 to 8 years represented.The yellow bullheads, pumpkinseed, bluegill and largemouth bass indicate an average population status for the area median.  The yellow bullheads average alomst .75 pound while the pumpkinseeds and bluegills are small in size with a few larger bluegills up to 8.9 inches.  The bluegill age groups are from 1-6 years with 4 and 5 years of age representling 81.2%.  The largemouth bass are averaging slightly over 1.0 pounds.  Age groups 2,3 and 5 years of age are represented with 3 years of age representing 66%.The brown bullhead, black crappie and walleye net catches fall into the first quartile of the area median, indicating a low population.The brown bullhead, black crappie and walleye net catches fall into the first quartile of the area median, indicating a low population.The brown bullhead, black crappie and walleye net catches fall into the first quartile of the area median, indicating a low population.The brown bullheads average close to 1 pound, while the black crappies were small, averaging around 1/3 pound.  The black crappie age groups were 4,5 and 6 years old with age groups 4 and 5 representing 89%.The two walleyes averaged over 2 pounds and the lengths were in the 21.0 to 22.9 inch range.  Both walleyes were 5 years old.</p>",

Walleye are present in low to moderate numbers (1.7/lift) with a variety of sizes present.  Bluegill are very abundant with an exceptionally good length-frequency distribution present.  Black crappie are present in fair numbers.  Yellow perch as forage food are found in high numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Norway is a 524 acre lake located at the City of Pine River.  A city-owned dam maintains the lake depth at about twelve feet.  There is a DNR provided fishing pier at the city park near the dam.  It is a hardwater lake with moderate phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is sometimes below average for the area due to bog stain and algae growth.The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent species provide shoreline protection and spawning habitat for a number of fish species.  Submergent species are common throughout the lake and provide quality food and habitat for fish.  Shallow water soils are primarily sand and gravel, and provide good substrate for spawning bass and panfish.The 1997 lake survey found northern pike, bowfin (dogfish) and bluegills to be present in high numbers when compared to similar type lakes.  Northern pike averaged 2.5 lbs. and 20 inches in length.  Most northerns were two or three years old.  Growth was good to fast.  Bluegills were abundant and tended to be slow growing.  About 18% were at least seven inches long.Walleyes were caught in \"low\" numbers, similar to the 1988 catch.  Catches of black crappies and largemouth bass were low in trapnets, but were \"average\" in gillnets.  Yellow perch, an important forage fish was also caught in \"average\" numbers.Other species caught in 1997 included \"average\" numbers of white suckers, shorthead redhorses, yellow bullheads, rock bass and pumpkinseeds.  Black bullheads and brown bullheads were caught in \"low\" numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Norway Lake is located on the Pine River north of the City of Pine River in Cass County.  Water levels are maintained by a dam in Pine River about one mile downstream from the main lake basin.  With a maximum depth of about 12 ft, aquatic vegetation can be found throughout the lake, but is most abundant in the western portion of the lake.  Natural vegetation along lakeshores is critical habitat for most aquatic species for at least a portion of their life.   <br> \n <br> \nPublic accesses are located in the southwest bay and on the north shore east of the Pine River inlet, although parking is limited at the north access.  A fishing pier is located on the west shore in the City north of the dam.   <br> \n <br> \nA fisheries population assessment was conducted on Norway Lake in June 2009 with four gill net sets and eight trap net sets.  Northern pike were the most abundant fish in the gill net catch (20.3 per net) and were caught at well above the normal catch rate for similar lakes in Minnesota.  A wide size range of northern pike were captured, from 9.5 to 34.2 inches long with most fish from 13 to 31 inches.  Yellow perch were the second most common fish in the gill net catch (13.3 per net) with catch near normal compared to similar lakes.  Yellow perch ranged from 4.7 to 11.2 inches with a mean length of 8.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catches were comprised primarily of bluegills (90.8 per net) with pumpkinseed sunfish (9.6 per net) the second most common fish.  Both of these species were caught at above normal numbers compared to similar lakes.  Most bluegills were around 5 to 6 inches long with the largest at 8.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOnly one largemouth bass was captured in the survey, although a few other largemouth bass were observed in the southwest bay near the access.  Largemouth bass are usually not captured very well in survey nets.  Other species that could provide angling opportunities include black crappie, bullheads, rock bass, and bowfin.   <br> \n</p>",
