                "narrative": "<p>A fall night electrofishing survey of young of year \"YOY\" walleye was conducted on Cottonwood during September 2, 2014. Cottonwood is a small (383 acres), shallow (7 feet maximum), aerated (6 unit helixor system and floating surface type aerators), and productive lake located in Lyon County. A significant winterkill occurred during late January or early February of 2013 on Cottonwood Lake. A long cold winter with significant snowfall accumulation occurred during the 2012-13 winter. The helixor aerator was not operational and additional surface aerators were unable to maintain sufficient winter oxygen levels during 2013 due to heavy snowfall accumulation. Abundant numbers of dead walleye and carp were observed floating in the water after ice out. Ice out trapnets in 2013 captured abundant numbers of black bullhead; low numbers of carp, yellow perch and northern pike. The helixor aeration system was repaired and no winterkill occurred during the 2013-14 or 2014-15 winters. The 2014-15 winter had mild temperatures and little snow accumulation. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are generally stocked (160,000-250,000) every other year in Cottonwood or after a fry stocking failure or winterkill occurrence. Walleye fry (244,188 fish) were last stocked in May of 2014. Other recent walleye stockings included 2008-2011 and 2013. Additionally, yellow perch adults were also stocked 2013 (8,554 yearlings, 329 pounds; 442 adults, 138 pounds). Walleye fingerlings and yearlings have been previously stocked into Cottonwood during late September of 2004 (12,130 fish, 715 pounds), January of 2010 (16,800 fingerlings, 700 pounds-private stocking), spring of 2010 (124 yearlings/adults, 19 pounds), fall of 2011 (5,152 yearlings, 260 fingerlings and 82 adults; 742 pounds), and fall of 2014 (29 fish, 38 pounds). <br> \n  <br> \nModerate numbers of YOY walleye (48.00 YOY/hour, 6.16 inches average length) were captured in the 2014 fall night electrofishing survey. No yearling walleye were captured in the 2014 fall night electrofishing survey. No young of year \"YOY\" walleye were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. However, there were abundant YOY northern pike (102.22 YOY/hour, 7.70 inches average length) captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. YOY walleye were abundant in the 2011 (311.99/YOY/hour, 6.86 inches average size) and 2006 (288.01 YOY/hour, 6.06 inches average size) fall electrofishing surveys. Most of the 2011 year class died as result of winterkill in February of 2013. There were low numbers of YOY walleye in 2008-2010 (< 13 YOY/hour) fall electrofishing surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Cottonwood fishery will be sampled in the 2016 fall for YOY walleye and 2017 for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted during late-June of 2022 on Cottonwood Lake. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). A fall daytime electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye was conducted in late August of 2023.  <br> \n <br> \nCottonwood is a small (379 acres), shallow (7 feet maximum), aerated (6 unit helixor system and floating surface type aerators), and productive lake located in Lyon County. There are two boat accesses and a park located along the lakeshore. A partial winterkill may have occurred in February of 2010. A significant winterkill last occurred during late January or early February of 2013 on Cottonwood Lake. A winter storm sunk one of the two surface aerators in February of 2013, but was replaced shortly afterward. A 2013 spring ice out netting confirmed a significant winterkill of Walleye, Black Crappie and Common Carp. However, enough Common Carp survived to produce large year classes in later years. Other fish species (Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and Black Bullhead) were relatively unaffected. The helixor system has struggled to maintain adequate oxygen levels during moderate to severe winters, but no winterkill after 2013 has been documented. Significant winterkill occurred on nearby School Grove Lake in 2019 due to intense fall algae blooms. Nearby Wood Lake experienced significant winterkill in 2022. Late snowfall accumulations in January or early February have lowered dissolved oxygen levels (<1 ppm) in shallow area lakes in recent years. However, winterkill severity and occurrence has been sporadic on these lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was moderate (3.0 feet) on June 27, 2022 for Cottonwood. Shoalwater substrates include boulder, rubble, gravel, sand, and silt. The fine sediments compose most of the lake substrates. Water levels have been low during recent summers. Submergent vegetation densities were moderate in 2022 which included sago pondweed, small pondweed and coontail. Other less desirable aquatic vegetation species included filamentous algae and water moss. Emergent and terrestrial vegetation species included low densities of cattail, bulrush, reed canary grass, cane and swamp milkweed located mostly in the northwest corner of the lake. Intense blue-green algal blooms are common during the summer due to agricultural, residential, municipal and golf course nutrient runoff. Nutrient levels were extremely high (total phosphorus=0.221 ppm, chlorophyll a=237 ppb) in June of 2012. There are approximately 15 drain tile, culvert and storm sewer inlets that enter Cottonwood Lake. The three largest inlets are ditches that enter the southeast (County Ditch#69), north (Judicial Ditch#18) and southwest corners of the lake. An outlet dam is located along the northwest shore. The outlet structure is inadequate at preventing fish movement (i.e. Common Carp, Northern Pike and Bowfin) into Cottonwood during high water events. The outlet flows into Judicial Ditch#24, which drains into the Yellow Medicine River and eventually the Minnesota River.  <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 1993, angling for game fish species was limited. Angling opportunities have increased dramatically following the 1993 reclamation and subsequent operation of aeration units in Cottonwood. Submergent vegetation (sago pondweed) increased substantially after the 1993 reclamation, however sago has declined in abundance over the last 24 years resulting in heavy algal blooms in Cottonwood. Primary species managed in Cottonwood include Walleye and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance was low (19.44 fish/trapnet) in 2022. The Black Bullhead historical average trapnet catch rate is 85.06 fish/trapnet. The 2022 Black Bullhead gillnet catch rate (32.00/gillnet) was also below the historical average (93.77 fish/gillnet). The 2022 Black Bullhead average size was large (0.64 pounds and 9.9 inches) from trapnets. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.46 pounds from trapnets for Cottonwood. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance low to moderate (3.00 fish/gillnet, 5.56 fish/trapnet) in 2022. The Common Carp historical catch rates are 10.21 fish/gillnet and 6.22 fish/trapnet for Cottonwood. The 2022 Common Carp average weights were small (2.08 pounds and 4.15 pounds respectively from gillnets and trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were not present in the 2022 or 2017 survey nets. Black Crappie were only sampled in Cottonwood surveys during 2007 (0.44 fish/trapnet, 9.3 inches average) and 2012 (4.11 fish/trapnet, 12.8 inches average). Black Crappie adults were last stocked (632 fish, 158 pounds) into Cottonwood during 2008. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were not sampled in the 2022 or 2017 survey nets. The Bluegill historical catch rate is 1.99 fish/trapnet for Cottonwood. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were last caught in the 2007 survey. Low numbers were caught in Cottonwood during 1997 and 2007 surveys. Channel Catfish fingerlings were first stocked into Cottonwood during 1994 (6,730 fish) and recently in 2008 (3,250 fish). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was moderate (2.67 fish/gillnet) in 2022 for Cottonwood. The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 3.56 fish/gillnet for Cottonwood. There were abundant numbers (15.00 fish/gillnet) of small sized (2.30 pounds) Northern Pike in the 2012 gillnets. Low numbers were present in the 2017 gillnets (1.07 fish/gillnet). The 2022 Northern Pike average size was moderate to small (2.85 pounds and 23.2 inches) from gillnets. Northern Pike historical average weight was 2.02 pounds from gillnets. Northern Pike growth rates were good for ages 1-4, but slow for ages 5-7. The 2018 year class comprised 33% of the 2022 Northern Pike catch. Abundant YOY Northern Pike numbers (102.22 YOY/hour, 7.7 inches) due to natural reproduction were captured in a 2013 fall electrofishing survey. Historically, unfavorable conditions (lack of submergent vegetation, poor clarity, and low Yellow Perch numbers) had not been conducive for Northern Pike survival and abundance in Cottonwood unlike in recent years. In the Southern zone, anglers and spearers can keep two Northern Pike, with a minimum size of 24.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were abundant (124.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 33.35 fish/gillnet for Cottonwood. The 2022 Yellow Perch average size was moderate (7.5 inches and 0.25 pounds) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average length is 8.2 inches. Yellow Perch growth rates were good to excellent for ages 1-8. The 2020 year class comprised 59% of the 2022 Yellow Perch gillnet catch. Yellow Perch were last stocked in 2013 (8,554 yearlings, 329 pounds; 442 adults, 138 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction has been generally insignificant based on previous surveys and analysis for Cottonwood. Walleye fry are generally stocked (160,000-250,000) every other year in Cottonwood, after a fry stocking failure or winterkill occurrence. Walleye fry (188,901 fish) were last stocked in May of 2022. Other recent Walleye fry stockings (180,000 - 250,000 fish) included 2008-2011 and 2013-2014, 2016, 2018 and 2021. Additionally, Walleye fingerlings and yearlings had been previously stocked into Cottonwood during late September of 2004 (12,130 fish, 715 pounds), January of 2010 (16,800 fingerlings, 700 pounds-private stocking), May of 2010 (124 yearlings/adults, 19 pounds), fall of 2011 (5,152 yearlings, 260 fingerlings and 82 adults; 742 pounds), fall of 2014 (29 fish, 38 pounds) and fall of 2020 (416 yearlings, 277 pounds; 69 adults, 137 pounds). Most of the recent stockings of Walleye yearlings and adults have come from nearby Sham Lake rearing pond. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of young of year \"YOY\" Walleye (36.00 YOY/hour, 6.35 inches) were caught in a daytime fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye are probably more numerous than documented in 2022 due to daytime electrofishing being less effective than nighttime electrofishing for catching YOY Walleye. Abundant numbers of large sized YOY Walleye were captured in the 2016 (86.00 YOY/hour, 8.2 inches) and 2018 (210.00 YOY/hour, 8.3 inches) fall night electrofishing surveys. Moderate numbers of YOY Walleye (48.00 YOY/hour, 6.2 inches) were captured in the 2014 fall night electrofishing survey. No yearling Walleye were caught in 2014 or 2016 fall electrofishing surveys. No YOY Walleye were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. No fall YOY Walleye electrofishing surveys were conducted in 2020-2021. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were abundant (17.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 25.60 fish/gillnet for Cottonwood. The 2022 Walleye trapnet catch rate was moderate (4.78 fish/trapnet). The 2022 Walleye average size was moderate (2.14 pounds and 17.9 inches) from gillnets. Walleye historical average weight is 1.31 pounds from gillnets. The 2022 Walleye catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches plus) was high (15.67 fish/gillnet). The 2022 catch rate of preferred size Walleye (20.0 inches plus) was moderate (2.33 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were excellent for ages 1-8. The 2019 (yearling/adult stocked and/or natural reproduction) accounted for 58% of the 2022 Walleye catch.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Cottonwood include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting local residents and the sportsman's club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. Cottonwood Lake will be surveyed for all fish species in the 2027 summer and 2024 fall for YOY Walleye. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cottonwood is a small (323 acres) and productive lake with a maximum depth of 7 feet. It is located within the city of Cottonwood, MN in Lyon County. The lake was chemicallyreclaimed in 1993 to reduce carp and bullhead numbers. An aeration system was installed andfirst operated in December of 1994. The aeration system provided adequate winter oxygenlevels for gamefish to survive in Cottonwood. The Cottonwood Sportsman's Club has beeninstrumental for improving the Cottonwood Lake fishery. The MNDNR Spicer Fisheries Officestocked  walleye fry in 1994 (171,840 fry) and 1996 (160,279). Other fish species were alsostocked in 1994 (yellow perch, channel catfish, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass,fathead minnows).     Walleye numbers in 1997 were abundant (38.3 fish/gillnet) within Cottonwood. The walleyeaverage size was small (0.7 lbs.). The majority of walleye present (79%) were from a 1996walleye fry stocking. Local anglers reported fair success catching 17 inch walleye (1994 yearclass) during the 1996-97 winter. Anglers were having excellent success catching the smallwalleye in the winter of 1997-98. The average size of walleye caught should improve by the1998 summer. Moderate numbers of larger walleye (2-3 lbs.) were also present in Cottonwoodduring 1997. In addition to prior walleye stockings, we documented good walleye naturalreproduction (69.0 young of year/hour) in 1997 for Cottonwood. Yellow perch abundance (94.3fish/gillnet) and average size (8.0 inches, 0.3 lbs) was excellent in Cottonwood. Localanglers reported good success for catching large (>8 inches) yellow perch during the 1996-97winter. The yellow perch population will provide a good panfish fishery for local anglers.In addition, yellow perch will provide an excellent forage base for walleye in Cottonwood.Black bullheads (148.7 fish/gillnet, average size=0.6 lbs.) have rebounded since the 1993reclamation, however this species will provide an additional forage base for walleye andprovide good shore fishing opportunities for some anglers. Only one channel catfish (23.4inches) was caught in the 1997 survey nets.     The MNDNR Spicer Fisheries Office will continue to manage Cottonwood for walleye andyellow perch. Management priorities will include protecting important habitat  (i.e., aquaticvegetation), stocking various species as necessary to maintain adequate fish populations,encouraging local landowners to practice best management practices (i.e., planting bufferstrips, using no/low phosphorus fertilizers, restoring wetlands, implementing conservationtillage, updating non conforming septic systems) within the watershed, and maintaining afunctional aeration system on Cottonwood Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cottonwood is a small (323 acres), shallow (7 feet maximum), aerated, and productive lake located in Lyon County. A population assessment was conducted during mid June of 2007. Water clarity was poor (1.0 foot) on June 21, 2007. Intense blue-green algal blooms are common during the summer due to agricultural and residential/municipal nutrient runoff. There are two boat accesses and a park located along the lakeshore. An outlet dam is located along the northwest shore. The outlet structure is inadequate at preventing fish movement (i.e. carp, northern pike) into Cottonwood during high water events. The outlet flows into a judicial ditch, which drains into the Yellow Medicine River. Cottonwood was chemically reclaimed with rotenone in the 1993 fall. Prior to 1993, angling for game fish species was limited. Angling opportunities have increased dramatically following the reclamation and operation of aeration units in Cottonwood. Submergent vegetation (sago pondweed) increased substantially after the 1993 reclamation, however intense algal blooms continue to occur in Cottonwood. Primary species managed in Cottonwood include walleye and yellow perch.  Walleye fry are generally stocked into Cottonwood every other year (250,000 fry in 2006). If a fry stocking is a failure, then the lake will generally be stocked again with fry the following spring. Walleye fingerling stocking is contingent in Cottonwood after successive fry stocking failures. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were abundant in 2007 (135.78 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and above the Cottonwood historical average catch rate (90.13 fish/trapnet). The 2007 black bullhead gillnet catch rate was also high (146.50/gillnet). The 2007 black bullhead average size was moderate to large (0.45 pounds and 9.01 inches) from trapnets. The 2007 black bullhead average size was small to moderate (0.19 pounds and 7.25 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weights were 0.32 pounds and 0.38 pounds respectively from gillnets and trapnets for Cottonwood. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were abundant in 2007 (34.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and above the Cottonwood historical average catch rate (10.33 fish/gillnet). The 2007 trapnet carp catch rate was also high (6.33 fish/trapnet). The 2007 carp average weights were small (1.95 pounds) from gillnets and large (7.38 pounds) from trapnets. The carp historical average weights were 2.09 pounds and 3.56 pounds respectively from gillnets and trapnets for Cottonwood. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low in 2007 (0.44 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. Black crappie have not been sampled in Cottonwood surveys prior to 2007. The 2007 black crappie average size was moderate to large (0.45 pounds and 9.16 inches) from trapnets. Black crappie growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-2. The 2005 year class accounted for 100% of the 2007 black crappie catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2007 (1.00 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but above the Cottonwood historical average catch rate (0.38 fish/trapnet). The 2007 bluegill average size was large (0.29 pounds and 6.79 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low 2007 (1.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and below the Cottonwood historical average catch rate (25.17 fish/gillnet). The 2007 yellow perch average length was large (9.02 inches) from gillnets and trapnets combined. Yellow perch growth rates were within or above the Spicer Area 75th normal ranges for ages 1-3. The 2004 year class comprised 100% of the 2007 yellow perch catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate in 2007 (2.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but above the Cottonwood historical average catch rate (1.97 fish/gillnet). There were also moderate numbers (3.22 fish/trapnet) of northern pike in the 2007 trapnets. The northern pike average length was small to moderate (21.63 inches) from trapnets. Northern pike growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-2. The 2005 year class comprised 100% of the 2007 catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2007 (39.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and above the Cottonwood historical average catch rate (16.97 fish/gillnet). The 2007 walleye trapnet catch rate was also high (6.22 fish/trapnet). The 2007 walleye average size was moderate (1.65 pounds and 16.71 inches) from gillnets. The 2007 walleye average weight and length were moderate to large (2.32 pounds and 18.52 inches) from trapnets. The 2007 catch rate of quality size walleye (15.00 inches) and larger was high (37.50 fish/gillnet). The 2007 catch rate of preferred size walleye (20 inches) and larger was moderate to high (4.00 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were above or within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2004 (stocked) and 2003 year classes (stocked) accounted for 60% and 35% respectively of the 2007 walleye catch. <br> \n <br> \nYoung of year \"YOY\" walleye were abundant (288.01 YOY/hour, 6.06 inches average size) in the 2006 fall electrofishing survey. There were low numbers of YOY walleye (6.00 YOY/hour, 7.26 inches average size) in the 2005 fall electrofishing survey. There were no YOY walleye captured in 2004. Other area walleye fry stocked lakes also had generally low YOY walleye catch rates in 2004 fall electrofishing surveys. The Cottonwood fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 79.06 YOY/hour and 6.65 inches respectively. The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 71.24 YOY/hour from lakes fry stocked and lakes with natural reproduction. Walleye fry have been stocked into Cottonwood during 1994, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2004-2006. The highest Cottonwood fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye occurred in 2006 for a fry stocked year and 1997 for a natural reproduction year (69.00 YOY/hour, 6.36 inches average size). Walleye fingerlings/yearlings were stocked into Cottonwood during late September of 2004 (12,130 fish, 715 pounds) in response to the poor survival of consecutive walleye fry stockings during 2003 and 2004.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Cottonwood include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting local residents and the sportsman's club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Cottonwood fishery will be sampled in the 2008 fall for YOY walleye.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cottonwood is a small (323 acres), shallow (7 feet maximum), aerated (6 unit helixor system and floating surface type aerators), and productive lake located in Lyon County. A resurvey was conducted during late June and early July of 2012. There are two boat accesses and a park located along the lakeshore. There were 83 homes, 2 recreational vehicles, and 1 former business along the lake shore in addition to a park and nearby golf course. Unfortunately, a significant winterkill (walleye, black crappie, northern pike, etc.) occurred near the aerator site in late-February or early-March of 2013 as reported by a commercial fisherman and the Cottonwood Sportsman's Club. The helixor aeration system was not operated in 2012-13 winter due to equipment problems. A winter storm sunk one of the two surface aerators in February of 2013, but was replaced shortly afterward. The helixor system has struggled to maintain adequate oxygen levels during moderate winters in recent years. A spring ice out netting was conducted in 2013 to determine the extent of the 2013 winterkill. A partial winterkill of gamefish may have also occurred in early February of 2010 due to low dissolved oxygen levels (< 1 ppm), although no significant numbers of dead fish were observed after ice out. Spring trap netting in 2010 did indicate the presence of low numbers of carp, walleye, yellow perch and black crappie, but high numbers of black bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nFish species numbers and sizes present have significantly changed after 2012 due to the 2013 winterkill. Fish species present included low numbers of northern pike, moderate numbers of yellow perch, abundant numbers of black bullhead, low numbers of carp and no walleye in the 2013 ice out trapnets. Walleye fry stocking is scheduled for 2013 spring. Other fish species (i.e. bluegill, yellow perch, etc.) stockings may also occur in 2013 or 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was poor (0.7 feet) on July 11, 2012. Aquatic vegetation is almost nonexistent with the exception of water moss. Other aquatic vegetation species include some cattail species, bulrush, reed canary grass and swamp milkweed located in the northwest corner of the lake. Invasive purple loosestrife was found and removed from a portion of the southeast shore of Cottonwood during the 2012 survey. Intense blue-green algal blooms are common during the summer due to agricultural, residential, municipal and golf course nutrient runoff. Nutrient levels were extremely high (total phosphorus=0.221 ppm, chlorophyll a=237 ppb) in June of 2012. There are approximately 15 drain tile, culvert and storm sewer inlets that enter Cottonwood Lake. The three largest inlets are ditches that enter the southeast (County Ditch#69), north (Judicial Ditch#18) and southwest corners of the lake. An outlet dam is located along the northwest shore. The outlet structure is inadequate at preventing fish movement (i.e. carp, northern pike) into Cottonwood during high water events. The outlet flows into Judicial Ditch#24, which drains into the Yellow Medicine River. Shoalwater substrates include boulder, rubble, gravel, sand, silt and detritus. The shoalwater substrates were covered with water moss and periphyton.  <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 1993, angling for game fish species was limited. Angling opportunities have increased dramatically following the reclamation and operation of aeration units in Cottonwood. Submergent vegetation (sago pondweed) increased substantially after the 1993 reclamation, however intense algal blooms continue to occur in Cottonwood. Primary species managed in Cottonwood include walleye and yellow perch.  Walleye fry are generally stocked into Cottonwood every other year. If a fry stocking is a failure, then the lake will generally be stocked again with fry the following spring. Walleye fingerling stocking is contingent in Cottonwood after successive fry stocking failures. <br> \n <br> \nThe following information presented below is data collected in the 2012 summer prior to the February 2013 winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers in 2012 (60.44 fish/trapnet) were moderately abundant and within the normal ranges of similar lakes and Cottonwood Lake. The black bullhead historical average trapnet catch rate is 85.18 fish/trapnet. The 2012 black bullhead gillnet catch rate (41.00/gillnet) was below the Cottonwood historical average (86.03 fish/gillnet). The 2012 black bullhead average size was moderate from both trapnets (0.35 pounds and 8.40 inches) and gillnets (0.31 pounds and 7.79 inches).  <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were moderately abundant in 2012 (9.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges of similar lakes and Cottonwood. The carp historical catch rate is 10.11 fish/gillnet. The 2012 carp average weights were small from gillnets (2.40 pounds) and from trapnets (4.63 pounds).  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderate (4.11 fish/trapnet) in 2012 compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The 2012 black crappie average size was large (1.35 pounds and 12.83 inches) from trapnets. The 2012 catch rate of memorable size (12.00 inches) and larger black crappie was high (3.44 fish/trapnet). Black crappie growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2006 year class accounted for 38% of the 2012 black crappie catch. Black crappie adults were last stocked (632 fish, 158 pounds) into Cottonwood during 2008. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderately abundant in 2012 (12.00 fish/trapnet) and within the normal range of similar lakes. The bluegill historical catch rate is 2.32 fish/trapnet for Cottonwood. The 2012 bluegill average size was large (0.38 pounds and 7.44 inches) from trapnets. The 2012 catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches) and larger bluegill was high (4.53 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2008 year class accounted for 46% of the 2012 bluegill catch. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2012 (6.00 fish/gillnet) were within the normal range for similar lakes, but below the Cottonwood historical average catch rate (21.97 fish/gillnet). The 2012 yellow perch average length was moderate (7.88 inches) from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2009 year class comprised 86% of the 2012 yellow perch catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2012 (15.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and above the Cottonwood historical average catch rate (4.14 fish/gillnet) . There were also abundant numbers (4.89 fish/trapnet) of northern pike in the 2012 trapnets. The northern pike average size was small to moderate (2.64 pounds and 22.00 inches) from gillnets and trapnets combined. Northern pike average weight was small (2.30 pounds) from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates were within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2010 year class comprised 83% of the 2012 northern pike catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2012 (94.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for similar lakes and Cottonwood. It was also the highest recorded walleye catch rate for Cottonwood. The walleye historical average catch rate is 29.81 fish/gillnet for Cottonwood. The 2012 walleye trapnet catch rate was also high (24.56 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (6.00 fish/trapnet). The 2012 walleye average size was moderate (1.29 pounds and 13.82 inches) from gillnets. The 2012 walleye average size (1.53 pounds and 15.91 inches) was slightly larger from trapnets. Walleye historical average weights are 1.20 pounds from gillnets and 2.10 pounds from trapnets. The 2012 catch rate of quality size walleye (15.00 inches) and larger was high (41.00 fish/gillnet). The 2012 catch rate of preferred size walleye (20.00 inches) and larger was low (1.00 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2009 (fry and yearling stocked) and 2011 year classes (fry and fingerling stocked) accounted for 47% and 38% respectively of the 2012 walleye catch. <br> \n <br> \nYoung of year \"YOY\" walleye were abundant in the 2011 (311.99/YOY/hour, 6.86 inches average size) and 2006 (288.01 YOY/hour, 6.06 inches average size) fall electrofishing surveys. There were low numbers of YOY walleye in 2008-2010 (< 13 YOY/hour) fall electrofishing surveys. The Cottonwood fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 79.92 YOY/hour and 6.95 inches respectively. Walleye fry (160,000 to 250,000 fish/stocking) have been stocked into Cottonwood during 1994, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2003-2006, 2008-2011. The highest Cottonwood fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye occurred in 2011 for a fry stocked year and 1997 for a natural reproduction year (69.00 YOY/hour, 6.36 inches average size). Walleye fingerlings and yearlings were stocked into Cottonwood during late September of 2004 (12,130 fish, 715 pounds), January of 2010 (16,800 fingerlings, 700 pounds-private stocking), spring of 2010 (124 yearlings/adults, 19 pounds) and fall of 2011 (5,152 yearlings, 260 fingerlings and 82 adults; 742 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nNo channel catfish were caught in 2012 survey nets. Low numbers were caught in Cottonwood during 1997 and 2007 surveys. Channel catfish fingerlings were first stocked into Cottonwood during 1994 (6,730 fish) and recently in 2008 (3,250 fish).  <br> \n <br> \nAn Index of Biotic Integrity \"IBI\" survey was conducted from June 26-28, 2012 on Cottonwood Lake to compare small fish species presence versus lake characteristics (i.e. water quality, size, depth, productivity, etc.). Seine hauls were conducted with a bag seine of 50 foot width and 1/8 inch bar mesh in depths of 3.5 feet or less. Near shore electrofishing was conducted with a back-pack unit in water depths less than 2 feet deep. Both seine hauls and electrofishing runs were conducted along 10 stations that were spaced equally apart around the entire shoreline of the lake in a variety of near shore habitats and each station was approximately 100 feet long. Approximately 9 different fish species (5 species from electrofishing, 9 species from seining) were captured from electrofishing and seining combined. Fish species captured included gamefish (i.e. northern pike and walleye), panfish (bluegill, black crappie, orangespotted sunfish, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish), large non-gamefish (black bullhead) and small non-gamefish (fathead minnow). The number of species captured in Cottonwood Lake was substantially less than other Spicer Area Lakes, but similar for other nearby shallow aerated lakes. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Cottonwood include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting local residents and the sportsman's club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Cottonwood fishery will be sampled in the 2013 fall for YOY walleye.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Cottonwood Lake during September 11, 2023 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. Three stations were sampled for a total of 30 minutes. The water temperature was 67 F. Water clarity was poor (3 inches) due to a blue-green algae bloom. We observed abundant numbers of YOY Yellow Perch, moderate numbers of adult Walleye, low numbers of Common Carp and Northern Pike. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nCottonwood is a small (383 acres), shallow (7 feet maximum), aerated (6 unit helixor system and floating surface type aerators), and productive lake located in Lyon County. A significant winterkill last occurred during late January or early February of 2013 on Cottonwood Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction has been generally insignificant based on previous surveys for Cottonwood. Walleye fry were generally stocked (160,000-250,000) every other year in Cottonwood, after a fry stocking failure or winterkill occurrence. Walleye fry (175,828 fish) were last stocked in May of 2023. Other recent Walleye fry stockings (180,000 - 250,000 fish) included 2008-2011, 2013-2014, 2016, 2018 and 2021-2022. Walleye fry are currently scheduled for annual stockings of 125,000 fish. Walleye fingerlings and yearlings had been previously stocked into Cottonwood during late September of 2004 (12,130 fish, 715 pounds), January of 2010 (16,800 fingerlings, 700 pounds-private stocking), May of 2010 (124 yearlings/adults, 19 pounds), fall of 2011 (5,152 yearlings, 260 fingerlings and 82 adults; 742 pounds), fall of 2014 (29 fish, 38 pounds), fall of 2020 (416 yearlings, 277 pounds; 69 adults, 137 pounds) and fall of 2021 (126 adults, 197 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of young of year \"YOY\" Walleye (14.00 YOY/hour, 8.35 inches) were caught in a 2023 nighttime fall electrofishing survey. Local residents reported seeing dead small Walleye along the Cottonwood near shore areas during early July of 2023. Moderate numbers of YOY Walleye (36.00 YOY/hour, 6.35 inches) were caught in a 2022 daytime fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye are probably more numerous than documented in 2022 due to daytime electrofishing being less effective than nighttime electrofishing for catching YOY Walleye. Abundant numbers of large sized YOY Walleye were captured in the 2018 (210.00 YOY/hour, 8.33 inches) and 2016 (86.00 YOY/hour, 8.17 inches) fall night electrofishing surveys. Moderate numbers of YOY Walleye (48.00 YOY/hour, 6.16 inches) were captured in the 2014 fall night electrofishing survey. No yearling Walleye were caught in 2023 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant YOY Northern Pike (102.22 YOY/hour, 7.70 inches) captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. No fall YOY Walleye electrofishing surveys were conducted in 2020-2021. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye were abundant (17.00 fish/gillnet) in the most recent 2022 summer standard gillnet and trapnet survey. Walleye average weight and length were 2.14 pounds and 17.87 inches from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were excellent. The 2019 year class (yearling/adult stocked and/or natural reproduction) accounted for 58% of the 2022 Walleye summer survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nCottonwood Lake will be surveyed for all fish species in 2027. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted periodically during Walleye fry stocked years. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Cottonwood Lake's fish population was conducted during late June and early July of 2002. Cottonwood is a small (323 acres), shallow (7 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Lyon County. Cottonwood was chemically reclaimed with rotenone during the 1993 fall in order to reduce carp and bullhead numbers. Various fish species (yellow perch, bluegill, largemouth bass, channel catfish, black crappie, walleye) were stocked into Cottonwood following the reclamation. An aeration system was installed and first operated during the 1994-95 winter to prevent winterkill of gamefish. The present aeration system is a combination of six subsurface helixors and one surface aerator. High nutrient runoff inflows are common into Cottonwood during rain events from agricultural, residential, golf course, and municipal sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. Recent high water years have allowed undesirable fish to move into Cottonwood via the outlet that eventually connects to the Yellow Medicine River. Aquatic vegetation and water clarity increased immediately after the 1993 reclamation project. However, both submergent vegetation densities and water clarity were generally low in 2002. Water levels in 2002 summer were below normal. Residential development has significantly increased around the previously undeveloped northeastern shoreline within the last ten years. Yellow perch numbers were abundant in 2002 (31.0 fish/gillnet). The 2002 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.18 lbs. and 6.9 inches) from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates in Cottonwood were above the normal ranges compared to area lakes. The largest yellow perch captured was 10.6 inches in the 2002 resurvey. Northern pike were first sampled in Cottonwood Lake during the 2002 resurvey. There have been no northern pike stocked into Cottonwood Lake by DNR personnel. Northern pike probably entered Cottonwood via the outlet during high water conditions during the late 1990's or early 2000's. Northern pike numbers in 2002 (7.3 fish/gillnet) were moderate to abundant. The northern pike average size was small (1.66 lbs. and 18.7 inches) from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates in Cottonwood were below the normal ranges compared to area lakes. Approximately 94% of the northern pike captured in the 2002 resurvey were hatched in 2000. The largest northern pike captured was 20.3 inches in the 2002 resurvey.Bluegill numbers were low in 2002 (0.8 fish/trapnet), but the highest recorded value for Cottonwood. The 2002 bluegill average size was moderate to large (0.27 lbs. and 6.5 inches) from trapnets. Bluegill growth rates were above the normal ranges compared to area lakes. The largest bluegill captured was 8.4 inches in the 2002 resurvey.Walleye were abundant in 2002 (7.0 fish/gillnet) and the second highest recorded value for Cottonwood. The 2002 walleye average size was small to moderate (1.27 lbs. and 13.1 inches) from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were above the normal ranges compared to area lakes. Approximately 48% of the walleye captured in the 2002 resurvey were hatched in 2001. The largest walleye captured was 24.4 inches in the 2002 resurvey. Local anglers reported poor success for catching walleye in 2002. Walleye natural reproduction in Cottonwood is generally absent or rare based on previous fall and summer surveys. Moderate young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (50.0 YOY/hour, 5.3 inches average length) were documented by a 2001 fall electrofishing survey for a 2001 fry stocked year. Cottonwood was stocked with 242,000 walleye fry in the spring of 2001. No fall electrofishing surveys were conducted during 2002.Black bullhead numbers were abundant in 2002 (107.3 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (82.2 fish/gillnet) for Cottonwood. The 2002 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.35 lbs. and 8.4 inches) from gillnets. The largest black bullhead captured was 12.8 inches from the 2002 resurvey. Carp numbers were abundant in 2002 (10.9 fish/trapnet) and above the historical average (5.9 fish/trapnet) for Cottonwood. The 2002 carp average size was moderate (3.74 lbs. and 19.5 inches) from trapnets. Current fish management activities on Cottonwood include assisting the Cottonwood Sportsman's Club in the operation of the aeration system, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking walleye fry every other year. The Cottonwood Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2006 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted during mid-June of 2017 on Cottonwood Lake. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nCottonwood is a small (379 acres), shallow (7 feet maximum), aerated (6 unit helixor system and floating surface type aerators), and productive lake located in Lyon County. There are two boat accesses and a park located along the lakeshore. A partial winterkill may have occurred in February of 2010. A significant winterkill last occurred during late January or early February of 2013 on Cottonwood Lake. A winter storm sunk one of the two surface aerators in February of 2013, but was replaced shortly afterward. A 2013 spring ice out netting confirmed a significant winterkill of Walleye, Black Crappie and Common Carp. However, enough Common Carp survived to produce large year classes in later years. Other fish species (Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and Black Bullhead) were relatively unaffected. The helixor system has struggled to maintain adequate oxygen levels during moderate to severe winters, but no winterkill has occurred after 2013. Water clarity was poor (1.5 feet) on June 21, 2017. Shoalwater substrates include boulder, rubble, gravel, sand, silt and detritus. The fine sediments compose most of the lake substrates. Aquatic vegetation is almost nonexistent with the exception of sago pondweed or water moss. Other emergent vegetation include some cattail species, bulrush, reed canary grass and swamp milkweed located in the northwest corner of the lake. Intense blue-green algal blooms are common during the summer due to agricultural, residential, municipal and golf course nutrient runoff. Nutrient levels were extremely high (total phosphorus=0.221 ppm, chlorophyll a=237 ppb) in June of 2012. There are approximately 15 drain tile, culvert and storm sewer inlets that enter Cottonwood Lake. The three largest inlets are ditches that enter the southeast (County Ditch#69), north (Judicial Ditch#18) and southwest corners of the lake. An outlet dam is located along the northwest shore. The outlet structure is inadequate at preventing fish movement (i.e. Common Carp, Northern Pike and Bowfin) into Cottonwood during high water events. The outlet flows into Judicial Ditch#24, which drains into the Yellow Medicine River and eventually the Minnesota River.  <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 1993, angling for game fish species was limited in Cottonwood. Angling opportunities have increased dramatically following the 1993 reclamation and subsequent operation of aeration units in Cottonwood. Submergent vegetation (sago pondweed) increased substantially after the 1993 reclamation, however sago has declined in abundance over the last 24 years resulting in heavy algal blooms in Cottonwood. Primary species managed in Cottonwood include Walleye and Yellow Perch. There are good fishing opportunities for Walleye and large sized Yellow Perch in Cottonwood Lake as of 2017. <br> \n <br> \nOne American Eel was captured in a trapnet during the 2017 summer survey. It was a 37.4 inch long female. The American Eel was released back into the lake. It likely emigrated from the Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic Ocean as a juvenile into the Mississippi River. As an adult it probably then moved into the Minnesota River, Yellow Medicine River, Judicial Ditch 2, and eventually over the Cottonwood outlet dam during a recent high water event. Other fish species such as Northern Pike and perhaps Bowfin also have entered Cottonwood Lake via the outlet during high water events. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were abundant (202.00 fish/gillnet, 84.33 fish/trapnet) in 2017. The Black Bullhead average size was large (0.75 pounds, 11.0 inches) in 2017. Common Carp numbers were also abundant (18.00 fish/gillnet, 10.67 fish/trapnet) in 2017 survey, but the average size was small from both gillnets (1.69 pounds) and trapnets (2.73 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill were not present in the 2017 survey. Black Crappie were only sampled in Cottonwood surveys during 2007 (0.44 fish/trapnet, 9.25 inches average) and 2012 (4.11 fish/trapnet, 12.83 inches average). Black Crappie adults were last stocked (632 fish, 158 pounds) into Cottonwood during 2008. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were not caught in 2017 or 2012 survey nets. Low numbers were caught in Cottonwood during 1997 and 2007 surveys. Channel Catfish fingerlings were first stocked into Cottonwood during 1994 (6,730 fish) and recently in 2008 (3,250 fish). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike exhibited low abundance (1.00 fish/gillnet), small average size (1.64 pounds and 19.84 inches) and slow growth rates for ages 1-3 based on the 2017 survey. The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 3.69 fish/gillnet for Cottonwood. There were abundant numbers (15.00 fish/gillnet) of small sized (2.30 pounds) Northern Pike in the 2012 survey gillnets. There were abundant Northern Pike fingerlings (102.22 fish/hour, 7.70 inches) captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was moderate in 2017 (11.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but below the historical average catch rate (20.40 fish/gillnet) for Cottonwood. Excellent Yellow Perch growth rates and average length (10.47 inches) were noted in the 2017 survey. Yellow Perch were last stocked in 2013 (8,554 yearlings, 329 pounds; 442 adults, 138 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction has been generally insignificant based on previous surveys and historical data review for Cottonwood. Walleye fry are generally stocked (160,000-250,000) every other year in Cottonwood, after a fry stocking failure or winterkill occurrence. Walleye fry (242,605 fish) were last stocked in May of 2016. Walleye fry are scheduled to be stocked in 2018. Other recent Walleye fry stockings included 2008-2011 and 2013-2014. Additionally, Walleye fingerlings and yearlings had been previously stocked into Cottonwood during late September of 2004 (12,130 fish, 715 pounds), January of 2010 (16,800 fingerlings, 700 pounds-private stocking), May of 2010 (124 yearlings/adults, 19 pounds), fall of 2011 (5,152 yearlings, 260 fingerlings and 82 adults; 742 pounds) and fall of 2014 (29 fish, 38 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2017 (9.00 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range for similar lakes, but below the historical average catch rate (26.83 fish/gillnet) for Cottonwood. The 2017 Walleye average size was small (0.90 pounds and 13.32 inches) from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were within the normal ranges for age 2-4. Small sized (10.00-11.50 inches) Walleye from the 2016 year class (fry stocked) accounted for 44% of the 2017 Walleye catch. Abundant 2016 young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) numbers (86.00 YOY/hour, 8.17 inches) were caught during a 2016 fall electrofishing survey. The 2014 and 2013 year classes (fry stocked) accounted for the remaining 2017 Walleye survey catch. Moderate numbers of YOY Walleye (48.00 YOY/hour, 6.16 inches) were captured in the 2014 fall night electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Cottonwood include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting local residents and the sportsman's club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. Cottonwood Lake will be surveyed for all fish species in the 2022 summer and 2018 fall for YOY Walleye. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Cottonwood Lake during September 5, 2018 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. Cottonwood is a small (383 acres), shallow (7 feet maximum), aerated (6 unit helixor system and floating surface type aerators), and productive lake located in Lyon County. A significant winterkill last occurred during late January or early February of 2013 on Cottonwood Lake. Winter dissolved oxygen levels were high in January of 2019 (> 15 ppm) and stayed above 3.0 ppm thru early March of 2019 in Cottonwood. Winterkill was only noted on a few area lakes (School Grove and Lady Slipper) even though low oxygen conditions occurred on many shallow lakes during mid-February of 2019 due to high snowfall accumulations. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction has been generally insignificant based on previous surveys and analysis for Cottonwood. Walleye fry are generally stocked (160,000-250,000) every other year in Cottonwood or after a fry stocking failure or winterkill occurrence. Walleye fry (476,588 fish) were last stocked in May of 2018. Other recent Walleye fry stockings included 2008-2011, 2013-2014 and 2016. Walleye fingerlings and yearlings had been previously stocked into Cottonwood during late September of 2004 (12,130 fish, 715 pounds), January of 2010 (16,800 fingerlings, 700 pounds-private stocking), May of 2010 (124 yearlings/adults, 19 pounds), fall of 2011 (5,152 yearlings, 260 fingerlings and 82 adults; 742 pounds), fall of 2014 (29 fish, 38 pounds) and fall of 2017 (152 yearlings, 87 pounds; 40 adults, 100 pounds). Additionally, Yellow Perch adults were also stocked in 2013 (8,554 yearlings, 329 pounds; 442 adults, 138 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nLarge sized YOY Walleye were abundant (210.00 YOY/hour, 8.33 inches) in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Large sized YOY Walleye (86.00 YOY/hour, 8.17 inches) were also abundant in the 2016 fall night electrofishing survey. Moderate numbers of YOY Walleye (48.00 YOY/hour, 6.16 inches) were captured in the 2014 fall night electrofishing survey. No yearling Walleye were caught in 2014, 2016 or 2018 fall electrofishing surveys. No YOY Walleye were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. However, there were abundant YOY Northern Pike (102.22 YOY/hour, 7.70 inches) captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye were abundant in the 2011 (311.99 YOY/hour, 6.86 inches) and 2006 (288.01 YOY/hour, 6.06 inches average size) fall electrofishing surveys. Most of the 2011 year class died as result of winterkill in February of 2013. There were low numbers of YOY Walleye in the 2008-2010 (< 13.00 YOY/hour) fall electrofishing surveys. Abundant numbers of YOY Yellow Perch and Orangespotted Sunfish were observed in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye abundance (9.00 fish/gillnet) in the most recent 2017 summer standard gillnet and trapnet survey was at or above the 50th quartiles for Cottonwood (25th=3.50, 50th=9.00, 75th=38.92 fish/gillnet) and Lake Class 43 lakes (50th=6.83 fish/gillnet). Walleye average weight and length were 0.90 pounds and 13.32 inches from gillnets. The 2016 (fry stocked) year class accounted for 44% of the 2017 Walleye catch. The 2014 and 2013 year classes (fry stocked) accounted for the remaining 2017 Walleye summer survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nCottonwood Lake will be surveyed for all fish species in 2022. A fall night electrofishing survey will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years. <br> \n</p>",
