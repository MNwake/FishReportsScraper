The north and east shores are privately owned and the remainder around the lake is primarily public land. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a user developed trail near the south bay which could provide public access. The survey crew accessed the lake with permission through private property. There are no campsites located near the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThis is only the second survey of Skeleton Lake. The previous initial survey occurred in 1983. Seven species of fish were sampled in 2019 compared to only northern pike and yellow perch in 1983. Northern pike and bluegill were the most common species sampled in the gill nets and trap nets in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch in 2019 was a little more than half that of the 1983 survey but slightly above the average of 5.5/gill net of other similar lakes in the area. Pike averaged 22 inches long which was much smaller than the last survey average of 29 inches. The largest pike sampled in 2019 was caught in a trap net and measured approximately 28 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2019 were above average when compared to other similar area lakes where bluegill occur. Bluegill sizes were small with the average length at 4.8 inches. Only one bluegill over 8 inches was sampled in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass in 2019 were sampled in above average numbers from both gill nets and trap nets but were generally in the 8 to 10 inch size range. Bass were not sampled in 1983. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie, golden shiner and walleye were sampled in relatively low numbers in 2019. White sucker were sampled near area averages. Yellow perch were sampled in 1983, but not in 2019. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
