                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Buck Lake was conducted on July 19-20, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but one was done from the boat due to soft substrate and depth. A 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station. Nearshore sampling captured eighteen species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with an August 2023 gill net and July 2023 trap net data to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Buck Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Buck Lake fully supported aquatic life use based on the FIBI. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River- Grand Rapids Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Buck Lake is a 492-acre lake in eastern Itasca County within the Mississippi River watershed.  Buck Lake is located 10 miles north of Nashwauk, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 31 ft and 180 littoral acres.  There is a concrete ramp on the southwest shore. Walleye gill-net catch was 3.4/net, which was within the expected range of similar lakes and was the highest catch rate ever sampled on Buck Lake.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0 to 2.3/net.  Size structure was good with fish up to 27 inches sampled.  Growth was higher than the statewide average for ages 1 to 5 and similar to the average for ages 6 to 10.  Fify-six percent of the walleye sampled in Buck Lake were from the 2000 year class.  Walleye sampled in this assessment were the result of natural reproduction, since walleye have not been stocked since 1985. Early walleye stocking was done to establish a self-sustaining population.  Based on this assessment, it appears that natural reproduction is sustaining a quality walleye population.The northern pike gill-net catch declined from previous assessments to 5.8/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.   Catch rates in the past two assessments were 11.9 and 17.6/net.  It is desirable to have a decline in northern pike catch rates, because abundant northern pike populations often exhibit poor size structure, poor growth, and reduce prey abundance such as yellow perch.  Size structure was poor with few fish exceeding 24 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching 23 inches by age 6.  The yellow perch gill-net catch was 2.8/net, which was below the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have been consistently low varying from 1.1 to 10.4/net.  Size structure was poor with no fish exceeding 9 inches.  Low yellow perch abundance is a concern, because they are a preferred prey species for walleye and northern pike.The bluegill trap-net catch was 17.9/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments varied from 4.1 to 37.3/trap net.  Size structure was very poor with only one fish exceeding 8 inches.  Growth was similar to the lake class average with fish growing to 7 inches by age 7.The black crappie gill-net catch was 2.0/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments varied from 0.3 to 25.6/net.  Size structure was good with fish up to 12 inches sampled.  Scales were not collected for age and growth analysis.  Electrofishing sampled 114 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 85.5/hour, which represents an abundant population compared to area lakes.  A previous assessment in 1996 sampled 9 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 6.9/hour.  The difference in catch rates is likely due to differences in electrofishing gear and timing of the survey, rather than a large increase in abundance.  Size structure was moderate with a few fish exceeding 15 inches.  Fish varied in length from 3 to 19 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish growing to 16 inches by age 7.Other species sampled include white sucker, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, and common shiner.  In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment, which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Buck Lake is a 492-acre lake located 10 miles north of Nashwauk, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake has a maximum depth of 31 feet and 180 littoral acres.  There is a concrete-ramp public access on the southwest shore off Hwy. 65.  Buck Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 31.  Other area lakes in this class include Lower Balsam and Snowball Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, net catches for Black Crappie have fluctuated considerably in Buck Lake.  The gill-net catch for Black Crappie was 6.0/net in 2013.  This is above the expected range for this lake class but similar to the long-term average for Buck Lake.  The Black Crappie trap-net catch was similar to the lake class median at 2.2/net.  Size structure was good; fish in the gill-net sample ranged from 4.3 to 13.0 inches with a mean length of 9.1 inches.  Fish from 10 to 11 inches made up 41% of the sample.  Ages 1 to 10 were represented, with 47% of the sample older than age 7.  Growth was slower than the lake class average with fish reaching 9.6 inches at age 6.  <br> \n <br> \nNatural reproduction has maintained a modest Walleye population in Buck Lake since they were last stocked in 1985.  Gill-net catches were within the expected range in the previous three assessments, but declined to 1.1/net in 2013.  The 2013 sample was composed of large fish from 19.8 to 28.5 inches, with a mean length of 24.7 inches and a mean weight of 4.9 pounds.  Only one fish was less than 10 years old.  Growth of Walleye was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching 18.1 inches at age 5. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2013 Northern Pike gill-net catch was above the expected range at 10.6/net.  As in previous assessments, Northern Pike size structure was fairly poor with very few fish over 24 inches.  Sampled fish ranged from 14.6 to 34.2 inches with a mean length of 19.5 inches and a mean weight of 1.6 pounds.  Ages 2 thru 6 and 8 were represented, but age 2 and 3 fish dominated the sample.  Growth was similar to the statewide average, with fish reaching 18.1 inches at age 3. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing sampled Largemouth Bass at a rate of 51.2/hour of on-time.  This is a moderately high catch rate compared to other area lakes.  Size structure was modest and similar to the previous assessment with few fish over 15 inches.  Sampled fish ranged from 5.6 to 18.3 inches with a mean length of 11.0 inches.  Recruitment appeared consistent with ages 1 to 11 represented in the sample.  Growth was slower than the statewide average for ages 1 to 4 and similar to the statewide average for all other ages.  Largemouth Bass averaged 11.4 inches at age 5. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch rate for Bluegill was similar to the lake class median at 25.3/net.  As in other recent assessments, size structure was poor.  Sampled fish ranged from 3.2 to 7.9 inches with a mean length of 4.5 inches.  Very few Bluegill over 8 inches have ever been sampled from Buck Lake.  Age analysis showed ages 3 to 7 were represented.  Growth was slower than the lake class average for all ages, with fish reaching 5.1 inches at age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included Yellow Perch, White Sucker, Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Hybrid Sunfish.   <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike have risen considerably since the 1951 assessment from a gill net CPUE of 1.3 to 17.6 in this survey.  Winter rescue northern pike were stocked during the 1950's-1970's in this lake and could partially explain the dramatic increase in abundance.  The last stocking took place in 1972.  Other factors are probably at work now in maintaining the high numbers.  Spawning area is not abundant; however, it is located mainly in the east bay.  Growth rates for northern pike are very good.Yellow perch have decreased from a gill net CPUE of 10.4 in 1951 to 1.4 in this survey - despite a stocking of 32,000 in 1978.Walleyes have never been abundant in Buck Lake with only an occasional fish sampled in past surveys.  The 1985 stocking of 3,500 fingerlings was successful and made up 100% of the 16 walleye sampled in this netting.  Anglers have reported good walleye fishing since this stocking.Bluegill and black crappie have decreased in abundance since the first survey in 1951.  Black crappie had a gill net CPUE of 25.6 and a trap net catch of 10.5 in the 1976 survey.  This survey sampled only 0.3/gillnet and 1.0/trapnet.  Bluegill have shown a similar, but not as drastic, decline.  This change occurred during a period of increasing abundance of northern pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Buck Lake has been managed as a bass-panfish lake in the past.  It was stocked with walleye in 1985 in an attempt to create a modest walleye fishery.  This one stocking of 3,540 fingerlings was very successful.  Not only has this stocking provided good walleye fishing but natural reproduction from these stocked fish appears to be capable of maintaining a modest fishery.  Walleye were sampled just below the lake class median with most year classes represented.  The walleye sampled were generally large, averaging 3.2 pounds and ranging in length from 11.0-26.0 inches.  Growth was excellent.     Northern pike have been numerous in many of the past assessments and were sampled in good numbers in this assessment.  Natural reproduction is excellent due to the abundant spawning habitat present in the lake.  Although large fish were sampled (up to 35.4 inches) in this assessment most of the northerns ranged in length from 17.0-21.0 inches.  The average length in this assessment was 19.7 inches.     Yellow perch, sampled below the median in this assessment, have declined in the gill net catch over the years.  Perch are an important forage species and are a major component of the diet of both northern pike and walleye.     Black crappie and bluegill have also declined over the past years.  Although netting results indicate lower numbers of crappie, fishing for this species has been reported to have been very good.  Although most of the crappie sampled in this assessment were small, several large ones were sampled.  The largest was 12.2 inches.     Buck Lake is a very good fishing lake that now appears to support a modest walleye fishery.  But as Buck Lake and other lakes in the area become increasingly more developed, lakeshore owners will have a larger impact on its future.  Owners of land adjacent to the lake should be encouraged to manage their property so that minimal damage is done to the shoreline ecosystem.  It is the individual actions of the lakeshore property owners that can degrade the lake and it is those same individuals that can restore or improve it.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Buck Lake was conducted beginning on July 10th, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations and a 15-foot seine was used at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured seventeen species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and zero that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured nine species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Northern Pike and Brown Bullhead comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Buck Lake is Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the general use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Buck Lake is fully supporting for aquatic life use. The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River - Grand Rapids Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Buck Lake is a shallow, productive lake located north of Nashwauk, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake is highly developed and has a small public access on the southwest side of the lake.  Buck Lake supports a variety of species of aquatic vegetation with good habitat for panfish and Largemouth Bass.  The 2014 lake management plan (LMP) listed Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass as a primary management species, with Walleye as a secondary management species.  The goals were to maintain a catch of 2.0 Black Crappie/net, a Largemouth Bass electrofishing catch of 50/h, and provide a bonus Walleye fishery.  A standard survey using 9 gill nets and 9 trap nets was conducted in August 2023 to assess the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catches have fluctuated substantially from a low of 0.3 in 1991 to a high of 25.6/net in 1976.  The 2023 catch of 7.8/net was the second highest on record and exceeded the LMP goal.  The sampled crappie ranged from 4.9 to 12.2 inches and averaged 8.4 inches.  Multiple good year-classes were observed with fish ranging from age 1 to 11.  Growth was generally slow compared to other lakes with similar habitat.  Fish averaged 9.3 inches after five years of growth.  Black Crappie likely provide good fishing when strong year-classes reach a size anglers desire. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are most effectively sampled with spring, night electrofishing but due to the late spring and staff shortages, it was not conducted in 2023.  The gill-net catches have generally ranged from 1.1 to 2.4/net since 1976.  The 2023 catch was 2.6/gill net.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.8 to 18.3 inches and averaged 11.3 inches.  Six year-classes from age 1 to age 6 were identified from the fish less than 15.0 inches.  Growth was somewhat slow compared to the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye habitat in Buck Lake is limited so the management goal is to provide a bonus fishery.  Various management strategies have been attempted to create a fishery.  The 2023 survey evaluated a period of stocking 1 lb of Walleye fingerlings/littoral acre every third year, beginning in 2015.  The nine surveys conducted since 1951 found Walleye catches ranging from 0 to 3.4/gill-net.  The 2023 catch of 3.1/net was the second highest for the lake.  The sampled fish ranged from 10.8 to 24.3 inches and averaged 18.9 inches.  Four ages were estimated with fish from age 2 to 22 represented.  The three stockings since 2015 resulted in all but one of the 28 fish sampled.  Growth rates were good compared to the statewide average.  Fish averaged 17.7 inches after four years of growth.  The Walleye population likely provides a modest fishery. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have been lower than most lakes with similar habitat since 1981.  In 2023, no perch were sampled in the gill nets or trap nets but they were observed in nearshore sampling.  The lack of perch is noted because they are often an important component of Walleye diets.  The perch population does not provide any angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches have been average to high compared to other lakes with similar habitat.  Pike were sampled at a rate of 8.2/gill net in 2023.  Few fish over 28 inches have ever been sampled; including only one over 34 inches.  The 2023 sample included fish from 15.6 to 30.0 inches and the average length was 20.2 inches.  Buck Lake is known for having higher numbers of smaller pike and these population attributes are not desirable because they result in slow growth.  Anglers and spearers are encouraged to not harvest fish over 26 inches to improve size structure. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population can be characterized as having moderate numbers and sized fish.  Trap-net catch rates declined from 25.3/net in 2013 to 8.4/net in 2023; the second lowest on record.  Size structure from the trap nets has generally been poor.  In 2023, nearly 7% of the Bluegill exceeded 8 inches.  Sampled fish ranged from 3.1 to 8.9 inches and averaged 4.6 inches.  Mid-summer trap netting generally does not represent Bluegill numbers or size very well.  Larger fish were sampled in the gill nets with 14% exceeding 8 inches.  Ageing structures were not collected in 2023 but based on the size distributions it appears recruitment is fairly consistent.  Buck Lake can provide decent Bluegill fishing opportunities at times. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nBoaters can help slow the spread of invasive species by removing all vegetation from their boat and trailer before moving from one waterbody to another. <br> \n</p>",
