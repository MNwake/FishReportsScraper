Will use as a fish rescue-removal area as needed.  Have adult fish migration in spring from Boy Lake - Rabbit Lake to Lomish Lake.Possibly dredge creek from Lomish Lake to Rabbit Lake to improve fish movement.  Low priority as cost would be prohibitive.  Rescue sites for pumping could be installed if fish are needed in the future.</p>",
