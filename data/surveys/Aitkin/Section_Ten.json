                "narrative": "<p>Section Ten (Wladimiraf) is a 400-acre lake located in southwestern Aitkin County.  The public access is located on the east side of the lake.  Most of the lake is less than 10 feet deep with a 17 foot hole located in the western bay of the lake.  The lake has purportedly had a history of occasional winterkill, however our survey data does not support this.  People fishing Section Ten will find angling opportunities for bluegill, black crappie, northern pike and largemouth bass.  There is a small population of walleyes present, which are occasionally caught by anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nA special gillnet only assessment was conducted in 2010 targeting walleye to evaluate the status of this naturally occurring population.  Records indicate that walleye fry stocking took place between 1931 and 1940 and to this date no further stocking has been implemented. Survey history on Section 10 began in 1979 and has been surveyed 5 times including the 2010 special assessment. Walleye have been documented in low abundance in all but the survey conducted in 2006. Net catches have varied from 2 per net in 1979 to 0.4 per net in 2010 indicating a declining trend. Two walleye were caught in 2010 both of which were 15 years old. Natural reproduction appears to be limiting the fishery. It is thought that in high water years walleye can successfully travel to Section 10 from Sissabagamah Lake; however, there have been year classes documented in Section 10 that did not corresponded to the stocking records for Lake Sissabagamah, indicating that walleyes have been able to reproduce successfully in Section 10 with some consistency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Section Ten (Wladimiraf) is a 421-acre lake located in southwestern Aitkin County.  The public access is located on the east side of the lake.  Most of the lake is less than 10 feet deep with a 17 foot hole located in the western bay of the lake.  Substantial beds of emergent vegetation such as bulrush still exist along much of the shoreline, creating excellent habitat for bass and panfish.  \n\nPeople fishing Section Ten will find angling opportunities for bluegill, black crappie, northern pike and largemouth bass.  There is also a small population of walleyes present, which are occasionally caught by anglers, although none were sampled in this survey in spite of annual fry stocking since 2011.  \n\nBlack crappie abundance was about average for lakes of this type, with 29% measuring 9 inches or larger, and fish up to 11.3 inches observed in this survey.\n\nThe size structure of the bluegill population seems to have improved slightly since the last survey done in 2006.  Bluegills averaged about 6.7 inches, although no fish over 8 inches were sampled. \n\nLargemouth bass were abundant and anglers should find success catching different sizes of fish; largemouth bass over 19 inches were observed in this survey.  \n\nNorthern pike were below average at 3.3 fish per gill net and ranged from 13 to 31 inches in length, with a mean size of 18.3 inches.  Larger pike can have benefits to the rest of the fish community, and anglers are encouraged to release them.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special assessment targeting near shore fish species was conducted on August 3-5, 2015. This survey was completed in addition to the standard survey conducted the week of August 3, 2015. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes. IBI program staff completed an additional repeat assessment that is meant to provide a means to evaluate quality control of sampling protocols (see Section Ten 7/27/2015).  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but three sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing. A 50-foot seine was used to sample 1 station, a 15-foot seine was used at 4 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 5 sites. Nearshore sampling captured several intolerant fish species including blackchin shiner, Iowa darter, and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \nSection Ten falls within lake class 39 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 5 lakes for evaluating IBI data. IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 24 (90% CI 9-39) and the potential exceptional quality level is set at 61. The IBI score, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2015 resurvey, calculated from this survey was 45.1. The survey conducted by IBI program staff, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2015 resurvey, resulted in a score of 48.7.  Both of these scores are well above the impairment threshold and indicate good overall fish community health. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of nearshore fish species was conducted on July 29, 2015 by IBI Program Staff. The survey consisted of 10 sampling stations evenly spaced around the lake. All of the stations were sampled with a backpack electrofishing unit, 5 were sampled with a 50-foot seine, and 2 were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Three sites were not seined because of dense vegetation. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish, including 4 intolerant species (Blacknose Shiner, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data was combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2015 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for Section Ten was high. The high score was driven by the high diversity of intolerant species, the high relative number of intolerant individuals in the nearshore gear, and low relative biomass of tolerant species in the trap net catch.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. Section Ten is located in the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Section Ten (Wladimiraf) is a 421-acre lake located in southwestern Aitkin County. The public access is located on the east side of the lake. Most of the lake is less than 10 feet deep with a 17 foot hole located in the western bay of the lake. Substantial beds of emergent vegetation such as bulrush still exist along much of the shoreline, creating excellent habitat for bass and panfish.   <br> \n <br> \nPeople fishing Section Ten Lake will find angling opportunities for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. There is also a small population of Walleyes present, which are occasionally caught by anglers, although none were sampled in this survey in spite of six years of fry stocking and two years of fingerling stocking. Walleye numbers in Section 10 Lake have never been high, and appear to be decreasing to even lower levels. It's likely that during high water periods, some Walleye migrate upstream from Lake Sissabagamah, which has a population of stocked Walleye. There has, however, been year classes of Walleye documented in Section 10 that have not corresponded to the stocking records for Lake Sissabagamah indicating that Walleyes have been able to reproduce successfully in Section 10 with some consistency. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was above average for lakes of this type and they have been slowly increasing in abundance over survey history to a gill net catch rate of 11/net. The average size was 8.9 inches and fish up to 11 inches were observed, indicating the potential for some quality fish.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population appears to have decreased since the last survey as measured by trap catches. The lower abundance may allow some fish to grow larger as more food resources are available. The size structure has been improving gradually. The average size of Bluegill is about 6.6 inches. Around 23 percent of Bluegill were 7.5 inches or longer, additionally a couple fish over 8 inches were sampled for the first time in many years.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were below average at 4.0 fish per gill net and ranged from 14.5 to 29.3 inches in length, with a mean size of 19.7 inches. Though sample size was small the majority of pike were below the 22-26 inch statewide protected slot. Larger pike can have benefits to the rest of the fish community, and anglers are encouraged to release them. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are abundant in the lake and were caught at a rate of 2.3/ gillnet. No bass greater than 16 inches were caught in this survey, but we were unable to electrofish this year. Electrofishing is a better way to assess the population and previous surveys have noted Largemouth Bass over 19 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

Of these, the bullheads rate the highest for size structure, relative to other lakes in the area. The other species were caught at below average rates, of fish that were of average size or smaller. The low catch rate of few largemouth bass is consistent with their ability to avoid the survey nets. This lake produces memorable-sized bass on occasion; one 19.8 inch bass was caught in this survey. The average bluegill continues to be slow growing, yet anglers should still be able to find good bluegill fishing at times during the year. The average length of 6.4 inches is acceptable to many anglers and at least 20% of the bluegills were 7 inches or larger. Black crappie abundance continues to remain low and yet the 1990 year class is the strongest, therefore anglers may have done well in 1996 at finding acceptable crappies. Irregular recruitment, indicated by the near absence of fish from the 1992 and 1993 year classes, will continue to limit crappie abundance. Growth rates are fast enough, however, to produce larger crappies periodically.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Section Ten (Wladimiraf) is a 400-acre lake located in southwestern Aitkin County.  The public access is located on the east side of the lake.  Most of the lake is less than 10 feet deep with a 17 foot hole located in the western bay of the lake.  The lake has a history of occasional winterkill.  People fishing Section Ten will find angling opportunities for bluegill, black crappie, northern pike and largemouth bass.  There is a small population of walleyes present, which are occasionally caught by anglers.  Black crappie abundance was about average for lakes of this type with a mean size of 8 inches, and fish up to 14 inches were sampled. The size structure of the bluegill population seems to have deteriorated slightly since the last survey done in 1996.  Bluegills averaged about 5.5 inches, and no fish over 8 inches were sampled. Largemouth bass anglers will find the occasional 17 to 20 inch fish.  Northern pike were about average at 5 fish per gillnet lift and ranged from 12 to 24 inches length with a mean size of 17.7 inches.</p>",
