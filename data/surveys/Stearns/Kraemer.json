Growth of bass is good and analysis of spring catch shows a proportional stock density of 39%, a reasonably balanced condition. Walleye abundance is near the local median and shows good growth. Bluegill numbers are high but have dropped about 20/trap net since 1978. Ages 0-4 were sampled with young of the year and age 2 dominant. Growth is variable from below average to good. Black Crappie, at 2.7/trap net, show average abundance for this area. Growth is good for the age 0-3 fish sampled. Yellow Perch abundance has increased dramatically to 142.4/ gill net compared to the 1960-73 data. Most fish were in the 5.5-6.9 length frequency, which has dropped since 1978. Black Bullhead numbers show the most dramatic drop, from 86.3 to 0.7/trap net, while Yellow Bullhead dropped from 23.0 to 3.3/trap net, and Brown Bullhead fell from 6.3 to 0.3/trap net. White Sucker abundance has returned to normal at 1.4/ gill net. Common Carp remain low. Three fish were seen in spring sampling and none were caught in summer.</p>",

Growth was good for both sexes, with females showing fast growth through age 2. The population profile was similar to that seen in 1984. The Walleye catch was similar to 1984 and below the statewide median. Walleyes had good growth and probably were from 1979 and 1980 stockings. Largemouth Bass abundance was above the local upper quartile. Summer sampled Largemouth Bass were ages 1 and 2, ranged from 4 to 9 inches in length and showed fast growth. Spring sampled Largemouth Bass were ages 1 and 3-7 and ranged in length from 4 to 17 inches. Spring sampled Largemouth Bass showed good growth. Largemouth Bass were abundant, showed good growth and consistent year class strength. Bluegill abundance remained very high. The trap net catch was dominated by fish less than 4 inches in length. Good numbers of 7-9 inch Bluegills were captured in spring Largemouth Bass seining. The Black Crappie catch was higher than in 1984 and below the local upper quartile. The modal length increment was 7.0-7.4 inches. Spring bass yielded a good sample of 8-10 inch Black Crappies. Yellow Perch abundance declined significantly since 1984 but remained above the local median and was similar to levels of abundance indicated in earlier surveys. The modal length increment was 6.0-6.4 inches. Forage species were sampled in moderate numbers. Common Carp and bullheads were captured at levels below local medians.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kraemer Lake is located two miles southwest of St. Joseph in eastern Stearns County.  An access on the east side of the lake belongs to the St. Joseph Rod and Gun Club and use of the access is limited to members only.  Most development has occurred along the north and east sides of the lake.  The only recent stocking that has been done is that of walleye fingerlings by the Gun Club.  The last survey was in 1989. <br> \n <br> \nA survey of curled pondweed was conducted at the time of peak abundance June 4th, 2007.  Curled pondweed was growing over 13.7 acres, 7.0% of the lakes\u0019 surface.  Only one species of aquatic plant, coontail, was found on 100% of the transects and noted to be abundant.  Bushy pondweed, wild celery and northern milfoil were widely distributed.  Plants grew out to a depth of eight feet.  At the time the survey was conducted in the latter part of June oxygen was available to fish down to 13 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nNet catches of northern pike were above the normal range.  The catch has been above the expected range for the past three nettings dating back to 1984.  Northern pike averaged nearly 24 inches in length and weighed three pounds.  Anglers have an opportunity to catch above average size northern pike in Kramer Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOne notable change in the fisheries apparent between the 1989 and 2007 surveys was the significant decline of yellow perch.  A total of only five yellow perch were sampled during the 2007 survey.  This was the first time that yellow perch catches had been below the range of expected values.  Yellow perch numbers had also been high in 1984 despite high northern pike populations. <br> \nA primary management species for Kraemer Lake is largemouth bass.  Kraemer Lake has an excellent bass population with a wide range of sizes available to anglers including fish up to 20 inches.  The electrofishing catch was 55 per hour, about the average catch for Stearns County lakes. <br> \nWalleye were caught at a low rate similar to that of 1989.  Approximately 1,500 walleye fingerlings have been stocked annually since 1999 by the St. Joseph Rod and Gun Club.  It\u0019s likely that the high northern pike population is decreasing survival of the stocked fish (in the absence of yellow perch). <br> \n <br> \nKraemer Lake has a moderate population of bluegills.  Only one bluegill larger than seven inches was taken in trap nets.  The average size of the bluegills was about 5.5 inches.  Growth of bluegill in Kraemer Lake was similar to the statewide average as bluegill grow to seven inches in eight years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled in relatively low numbers during the summer survey, however, large numbers of crappie approximately eight inches in length were observed during the night-time electrofishing conducted in mid May. <br> \n <br> \nOther species in the fish community include hybrid, green and pumpkinseed sunfish, and black and yellow bullheads. <br> \n <br> \nMaintaining the water quality in Kraemer Lake should be a high priority of the county and landowners around the lake.  Some effort may be needed to identify any sources of phosphorus and plans developed to reduce these sources.  Buffer strips on inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Maintaining adequate septics and keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out the lake will help reduce nutrients entering the lake, thus slowing algae and excess vegetation growth. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kraemer Lake is 194-acre recreational development lake located two miles southwest of St. Joseph in eastern Stearns County. An access on the east side of the lake belongs to the St. Joseph Rod and Gun Club and use of the access is limited to members only. Most development has occurred along the north and east sides of the lake. The lake has moderate water clarity (six feet) and adequate dissolved oxygen to 13 feet during early-June. Kraemer Lake has a small watershed dominated by forest, pastureland, and agriculture. Emergent and floating-leaf vegetation covers 23% of the lake with cattail and white waterlily being the most common. Currently the only stocking taking place is Walleye fingerlings purchased by the Rod and Gun Club. This survey was conducted to update information last collected in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nKraemer Lake has an average bass population in terms of numbers; however, the size structure is excellent with a wide range of sizes available to anglers including fish up to 20 inches. The electrofishing catch was 24 per hour, which is less than the average daytime catch rate of 43 per hour for Sauk Rapids Area lakes. Forty-three percent of the bass sampled were larger than 15 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers have an opportunity to catch good numbers of small Northern Pike in Kramer Lake as net catches have remained high despite continued low Yellow Perch numbers. The size of pike decreased from the previous survey and averaged 21 inches and 2.3 pounds; however, fish up to 35 inches were sampled with  11% of the pike being 26 inches  or longer. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were caught in low numbers but fish up to 24 inches were sampled. Since 2016, approximately 800 Walleye fingerlings have been stocked annually by the St. Joseph Rod and Gun Club. It's likely that the high Northern Pike population is decreasing survival of the stocked fish (in the absence of Yellow Perch). <br> \n <br> \nKraemer Lake has a relatively high population of Bluegill, but the average length was only six inches. While no Bluegill over eight inches were sampled, 17% were larger than seven inches in length, compared to only 3% in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in relatively low numbers during the summer trap net survey, however gill net catches of Black Crappie were above average. Black Crappie up to 13 inches were sampled, however only 4% of crappie sampled were larger than 10 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included: Black and Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nMaintaining the water quality in Kraemer Lake should be a high priority of the county and landowners around the lake. Some effort may be needed to identify any sources of phosphorus and plans developed to reduce these sources. Buffer strips on inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the lake. Maintaining adequate septics and keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out the lake will help reduce nutrients entering the lake, thus slowing algae and excess vegetation growth. <br> \n</p>",
