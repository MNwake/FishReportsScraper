There is county tax forfeit land in the northeast corner, however, all access points are private.     The 1995 lake survey found good populations of bluegill and black crappie.  Average size of the bluegill was 6.4 inches and ranged between 3.7 and 8.8 inches.  Black crappie averaged 9.7 inches and ranged between 8.3 and 11.8 inches.  Walleyes were present although low in number.  Average size was 17.9 inches.  Northern pike are more abundant, however, tend to be small with an average size of 19.6 inches.  Largemouth and smallmouth bass were also present to challenge the angler.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Schubert Lake is a 205 acre lake with 140 (68%) littoral acres and a maximum depth of 24 feet.  It is located east of Highway 53 off of CR #815.  There is no public back-in boat access, however, the lake is accessible off of CR #815.  Primary management is for largemouth bass and smallmouth bass although walleye fingerlings were stocked in Schubert Lake in 1990, 1992, 1998 and 2001.    Largemouth bass spring electrofishing abundance was 54.7 fish/hour.  This value was above average for Duluth Area lakes and was consistent with previous assessment values (63.5 fish/hour in 1996 and 60.1 fish/hour in 2000).  The overall size structure of the population indicates that the majority of fish sampled were 12 inches and longer.  Mean length of fish sampled was 12.7 inches.  Growth of largemouth bass was slow for Duluth Area lakes with a mean length of age 4 fish at 10.2 inches.  The majority of the electrofishing catch (68%) was made up of age 4-6 individuals.  Smallmouth bass gillnet abundance of 2.0 in 2003 was an increase from 0.3 in 1995.  Three of the past four population assessments (1997, 1981, 1995 and 2003) yielded abundances that were above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length of fish sampled was 14.7 inches with the mean length at age 4 of 0.3 inches.  Eight (67%) of the 12 smallmouth bass aged were age 6 or 7.  Walleye gillnet abundance of 1.5 was average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Age 4 walleye exhibited fast growth with a mean length of 18.6 inches.  The overall mean length of fish was 19.8 inches.  Forty-four percent of the fish aged were born in years that correspond to walleye stocking.    Northern pike gillnet abundance of 3.3 was average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length of fish sampled was 19.4 inches and growth was average for Duluth Area lakes with mean length at age 4 of 21.8 inches.  Thirteen of the 19 fish aged were from the age 2 year class.  Black crappie trapnet abundance decreased from 2.1 in 1995 to 1.0 in 2003.  Black crappie trapnet catch has decreasedg over the past four assessments.  The mean length of age 4 black crappie was 7.7 inches which represents average growth for Duluth Area lakes. Three age classes were represented in the assessment catch, age 2, age 4 and age 6.    Bluegill trapnet abundance of 15.6 was average to above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length of fish sampled was 7.2 inches.  Growth was slow with the mean length at age 4 of 3.7 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed ages 4-6 well represented.    Other fish species sampled during the assessment included pumpkinseed, rock bass and yellow perch.</p>",
