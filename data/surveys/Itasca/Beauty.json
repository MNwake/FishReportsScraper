                "narrative": "<p>Beauty Lake is 217 acres, has a maximum depth of 31 ft,  and is located near Goodland.  Littoral area is 70% and secchi depth is 9.0 ft.  Beauty Lake is moderately productive and is known for having a quality largemouth bass population.  Black crappie, northern pike, and walleye are also present.Walleye were not sampled in Beauty Lake in the first three assessments dating back to 1974, 1979, and 1985 respectively.  Walleye were stocked from 1986 through 1990, and subsequently were sampled in the 1991 survey. Walleye have not been stocked since 1991.   Gill net catch in this survey was 3.5/set which is higher than expected for similar lakes.  Mean weight was 1.5 pounds and length varied from 10 to 22 inches.  Aging data shows that 19 of 21 fish (90%) are from nonstocked years indicating good natural reproduction.  Walleye growth was within 15% of statewide averages.Northern pike gill net catch was 5.2/set which is higher than in any of the previous four surveys and assessments.  Northern pike abundance was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Mean weight was 1.5 pounds and length varied from 9.5 to 30 inches.  Size structure was average with only three fish over 28 inches sampled.  Yellow perch gill net catch was 1.0/set which is below the expected range for similar lakes.  Yellow perch gill net catch has historically been low, and yellow perch were not sampled in the last two assessments in 1985 and 1991 respectively. Black crappie gill net catch was 3.0/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Black crappie populations are often variable and abundance can fluctuate.  In Beauty Lake, black crappie abundance has been as high as 12.6/set in 1991 and as low as 0.8/gill net in 1985.  Bluegill trap net catch was 3.7/set which is below the expected range for similar lakes.  Bluegill have not previously been sampled in Beauty Lake.  Size structure was poor and all fish sampled were less than 6.5 inches.  Bluegill may be more abundant than the trap net data indicated, because during the electrofishing runs, approximately 85 sunfish (sp.) were noted, but not netted.Largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 16.9 fish/hour.  This is the first time electrofishing has been conducted on Beauty lake so it is difficult to make any conclusions.   Size structure was average with a PSD of 61 and an RSD-20 of 4.Since the quality of a lake largely depends on how the lands surrounding the lake are developed, it is important that lakeshore owners develop their lakeshore responsibly.  Some items which lakeshore owners should consider include leaving a 30 ft buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and debris from washing into the lake, inspecting septic systems to ensure that they are functioning properly and are up to present standards, and eliminate fertilizer usage.  If fertilizers must be used, choosing a low or no phosphorous brand will lessen the impacts of fertilizer usage.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beauty is a moderately productive lake located five miles northeast of Goodland, MN.  The Lake has 217 surface acres, a maximum depth of 31 feet, and is part of the St. Louis River watershed.  Adequate dissolved oxygen for fish was present to a depth of 23 feet during mid June 2005.  The lakeshore was approximately 20% developed with 10% residential and 10% pasture in 1991.  Minimal development has occurred since then.  There is a state owned public access at the east end of the lake. Angler reports indicate that Beauty Lake receives moderate fishing pressure during the summer and light fishing pressure in the winter.  Walleye were the primary species managed for, however largemouth bass, northern pike, and bluegill were also abundant.  Spring electrofishing and a population assessment conducted in 2005 were used to collect the following information about the fish population. Largemouth bass were sampled with assessment nets and by electrofishing.  As typically happens, few bass were sampled in assessment nets.  However, 45 bass were sampled at a rate of 32.8 per hour of electrofishing, which indicates a robust population.  This catch rate was nearly double the rate observed in 1998.  Bass varied from 8.9 to 16.8 inches in length with an average length of 12.8 inches and average weight of 1.3 pounds.  A typical largemouth bass reaches 14 inches at age 5 in Beauty Lake. The gill net catch rate of 4.3 walleye per net was similar to the historic high of 4.4 in 1991, and exceeded levels expected for this lake type.  Gill net captured walleye varied from 9.9 to 22.8 inches with a average length of 14.0 inches.  Walleye were stocked annually from 1986 thru 1990.  These stockings appear to have resulted in natural reproduction sufficient to maintain a healthy population.  None of the 26 walleye captured by gill net in 2005 were from stocked years.  Average growth of 15.4 inches at age four was similar to the statewide average.  The gill net catch rate of 9.8 northern pike per net exceeded catch rates from previous surveys, but was within the expected range for this lake type.  Size structure of the pike population was considered poor with a PSD of 28 and RSD-P(28) of 2.  One memorable size pike was captured (RSD-M(34) = 2), which indicates that pike can grow to large sizes in Beauty Lake.  Gill net captured pike varied from 12.3 to 37.4 inches with a average length of 20.0 inches and average weight of 1.7 pounds.    Bluegill were sampled at a rate of 32.8 per trap net, which is within the expected range.  This catch rate was the highest observed in any assessment.  Lengths varied from 3.4 to 9.3 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches.  Thirty four percent were larger than 7 inches.  Angler harvest can change the size structure of a bluegill population from relatively healthy, to one with high abundance and small size.  Beauty Lakes bluegill population is currently healthy.  In order to maintain this population it is important to selectively harvest the medium and small fish while releasing larger individuals that help maintain the size structure.   Black crappie trap net catch rates have decreased with each survey since 1974.  The trap net catch rate of 0.2 per net was also lower than expected for this lake type.  Two crappie were sampled with trap nets and both were 9.3 inches in length.  Crappie can experience large changes in abundance due to variable reproductive conditions.  However, it is unlikely that each successive assessment sampled a period of environmentally controlled reduced recruitment.Gill net catch rates of yellow perch have historically been low.  The gill net catch rate of 2.0 yellow perch per gill net in 2005 was the second highest observed since 1974.  However, that catch rate was lower than expected for this lake type.  Perch varied from 6.0 to 10.6 inches with an average length of 6.6 inches.Water quality of a lake can be driven by development of its watershed.  Runoff from developed lakeshore often contains nutrients and sediment that is detrimental to water quality.  Lakeshore owners should consider leaving a 30 foot strip of natural vegetation along the shore to reduce sediment and nutrient runoff from entering the lake.  If fertilizer is used on lawn or gardens, a 0% phosphorous brand will decrease impacts to the lake.  Septic systems are also a potential source of nutrient loading to a lake.  Septic systems should conform to current standards and function properly.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The northern pike gill net catch rate (CPUE) has always been at or below lake class medians when compared to ecologically similar lakes statewide grouped into lake class #8.  Growth rates are less than normal and the lack of spawning facilities may restrict the northern pike abundance in this lake.Bullhead populations were high in the late 1970's and early 1980's.  In 1988, 2,166 lbs. of bullhead were removed.  The 1991 survey shows a return to an historically high number of bullhead and bullhead removal may be a possible option in the future.There has historically been an absence of bluegill in all the test nettings and observations.  Pumpkinseed sunfish abundance has increased over the years to a trap net and gill net CPUE above the third quartile for this lake classification.  The black crappie gill net CPUE in 1979 was at an all time high of 22.8, then dropped off sharply to 0.8 in 1985, and has risen in the 1991 survey to 12.6.  The average size has now increased somewhat and this population is now comprised of 35% age IV's and a PSD of 72 (72%> the quality length of 8\").  The largemouth bass gill net CPUE has risen steadily to 5.0, well above the third quartile for this lake class, in the 1991 survey.  According to aging techniques 59% of this population is from the 1987 year class.  This species shows normal growth rates and have a PSD of 61 (61%> the quality length of 12\").  Bass populations are high and spawning and holding habitat are good.In this survey the walleye gill net CPUE is 4.4, well above the third quartile for this lake classification, with an average weight of 2.8 lbs./fish.  The walleye PSD value is 87 (87%> the quality length of 15\") and a RSD-20 of 39 (39%>the preferred length of 20\").Walleye fry were introduced in Beauty Lake in 1963 and 1966 but netting results from 1974 to 1985 failed to sample this species.  Walleye were again introduced first in 1986, with 6,704 fingerlings, and stocked every year through 1990 with fry, fingerlings and yearlings.  In the 1991 survey over 78% of the captured fish were the 1986 year class, indicating a successful fingerling stocking.  The other individuals sampled were aged at fry and fingerling stocked years suggesting no natural reproduction is occurring.  The high abundance of walleye does not appear to be causing any problems for the bass population but forage species are at low levels.Yellow perch numbers have been low since 1979 although fair numbers were sampled in seining done in 1985 and 1987.  This survey sampled only 4 adult perch but golden shiners were also captured.  Depletion of these forage species may relate to the introduction of walleye.Largemouth bass are the most sought species.  Care should be taken to balance the introduction of walleye with the healthy bass fisheries.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beauty Lake is a 217 acre lake located four miles northeast of Goodland, in the St. Louis River watershed.  Beauty Lake is in ecological lake class 29.  Class 29 lakes are relatively small lakes with moderate fertility and a high percentage of littoral area.  Other area lakes in this class include Lower Panasa, Stingy and Wilson Lakes.  Much of the shoreline of Beauty Lake is undeveloped and in a natural state.  Aquatic vegetation and coarse woody debris are found in many areas, providing good fish habitat.  A standard survey was conducted in July 2015 to assess the status of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in moderate numbers with spring night electrofishing and summer trap netting.  Fish from the electrofishing sample averaged 13.7 inches and 1.5 pounds while those from the trap net sample averaged 15.5 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Age analysis showed ages 2-7 were represented with the 2010 (age 5) year class most frequently sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with bass averaging 13.1 inches at age 5. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in numbers typical for this lake class and similar to recent surveys.  Sampled Walleye ranged from 9.5 to 25.6 inches with a mean length of 16.7 inches and a mean weight of 1.7 pounds.  Age analysis indicated consistent recruitment with ages 1-8 and 13 represented in the sample.  No Walleye stocking has occurred in Beauty Lake for the last 25 years and a stable population is sustained by natural reproduction.  Average growth of 19.1 inches at age 6 is similar to the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were captured in numbers similar to the long-term average for the lake.  Size structure of Northern Pike was generally poor; gill-net sampled pike averaged 19.8 inches and only one fish exceeded 24 inches.  One large pike (36 inches) was sampled in a trap net.  Age analysis from the gill-net sample indicated ages 2-4 were represented.  Northern Pike growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 20.2 inches at age 4.  The lack of fish over 23 inches and four years of age may be the result of angler harvest. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled in numbers below the typical range for this lake class.  Size structure was fairly good; fish from the trap net sample averaged 6.5 inches and 64% of the sample exceeded 7 inches.  The sample had a balanced age distribution with ages 2-9 represented and about half of the fish age 6 and older.  Average growth of 6.5 inches at age 6 was similar to the lake class average. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in numbers typical for this lake class.  Sampled crappie ranged from 5.1 to 11.2 inches with several year classes represented.  Crappie growth was considered average with a mean length 7.0 inches at age 3. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",
