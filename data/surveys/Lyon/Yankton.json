                "narrative": "<p>Yankton is a 387-acre lake with a maximum depth of 8.0 and is located partially in the city of Balaton in Lyon County.  Yankton is managed for walleye primarily while northern pike, yellow perch, and crappie as secondary species.  Oxygen levels dropped to a level of 1.7 parts per million during the winter of 2009-10.  Catch rates in 2010 remained quite good even though low oxygen levels may have reduced net catch per unit effort's (CPUE's) during the 2010 population assessment.  <br> \n <br> \nYankton Lake has a very good walleye population based on our fish assessment conducted in 2010.  The 2010 gill net catch rate of 12 walleye/net was just below the long term average of 15 fish/net.  Lengths of walleye captured in our gill nets ranged from 7.5 to 24.1 inches and averaged 9.8 inches.  The reason the average length is so low was because of a very strong year class of age 1 fish, which more than likely were the result of a fry stocking in 2009.  These fish were primarily 8.5 to 9.5 inches in length and should provide for some very good fishing in the near future.  The Age 2 walleye were nearly 14 inches in length at the time of sampling so it won't take long for these fish to be in the acceptable harvest range for most anglers. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population is high when compared to lakes with similar morphology and chemical characteristics.  The gill net catch rate for yellow perch in 2010 was 28.7.  We would expect catch rates to be between 2.6 and 25.0 fish/gill net.  Lengths of yellow perch captured in our gill nets ranged from 5.6 to 11.4 inches and averaged 9.3 inches.  There were quite a few fish in the 10 to 11 inch range which should provide anglers with some nice \"keeper\" fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 black crappie trap net catch rate of 6.3 fish/net is what we would expect for Yankton Lake.  The expected range for catch rates is from 1.2 to 20.5 with an average catch rate of 4.9.  Although the catch rate was within the expected range, the fish are not as abundant as in the early 1990s.  Lengths of black crappie captured in our trap nets ranged from 6.4 to 11.2 inches with an average length of 8.3 inches.  The majority of black crappie were just above 7 inch, but there were plenty of fish that were 10.5 inches or longer also sampled in our netting.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough bluegill are not managed for in Yankton Lake, there are still some present in the lake.  The trap net catch rate of 1.0 fish/net in 2010 was below the expected range in similar lakes..  The trap net catch rate was 2.9 fish/net in 2006 and 0.1 fish/net in 2002.  Although the numbers are not high, total lengths of bluegill captured in our trap nets ranged from 7.2 to 9.6 inches and averaged 8.2 inches.  Bluegill adults have been stocked in Yankton on several occasions starting in 1945.  The last time adult bluegill were stocked in Yankton was in 1987. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch rates were similar to what we saw in 2006, but less than what was sampled in the historically highest catch rate that occurred in 2002.  Lengths of northern pike captured in our gill nets ranged from 20.9 to 25.6 inches and average 23.2 inches.  It is likely the fish we sampled were from fish stocked in 2007 and 2008. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead catch rates were down substantially from 2006 and 2002.  There are plenty of bullhead available if you are looking to take home some for a meal.  Lengths of black bullhead captured in our trap nets ranged from 5.3 to 12.2 inches and averaged 9.4 inches.  There were quite a few bullheads in the 10 to 11 inch range. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish captured in our nets during the 2010 fish assessment included bigmouth buffalo, common carp, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Yankton Lake; we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

Yankton Lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet, and a watershed to lake ratio of 3 to 1. Despite having a small watershed and being the start of the West Fork of the Des Moines Watershed, Yankton Lake's water quality is poor.  Yankton Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, crappie, and yellow perch.  Yankton Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fry in the spring of 2017, due to surplus production of this strain.  The Lower Mississippi strain was last stocked decades ago, but has persisted in several area lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  A daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on October 4, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 108.0 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that the fry stocking was very successful.  Fin clips were collected from 50 age-0 walleye for genetic analysis.  Over 88% of those fish were a byproduct of stocking based on the analysis.  In stocked years, the goal is to attain 30.0 per hour electrofishing.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 5.7 to 7.7 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  If they survive the winter, the 2017 year class should be a very strong year class in the Yankton Lake Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nYankton Lake is a 387-acre lake located in the City of Balaton in Lyon County. Yankton Lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet, and a watershed to lake ratio of 3 to 1. Despite having a small watershed, Yankton Lake's water quality is poor with a secchi depth of 0.8 ft in 2014 and heavy algae blooms and turbid water throughout much of the year. An aeration system was installed in 1983, and since, severe winterkill has not been documented. Yankton Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, crappie, and yellow perch. To maintain the walleye population, walleye fry are stocked two out of three years (2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018). Populations of yellow perch, crappie, and northern pike are sustained primarily through natural reproduction, as stocking of these species has not occurred except for the northern pike fingerling stocking in 2008. A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 16, 2014 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nThe 2014 walleye catch rate of 8.3 per gill net is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net), but is the lowest walleye catch rate that has been documented for Yankton Lake. Prior to 2014, catch rates varied from 10.2 per gill net in 1998 to 24.0 per gill net in 2002 and have averaged 14.2 per gill net since 1985. Size structure of the population was stable walleye ranged in length from 7.8 to 27.6 inches and averaged 18.6 inches. Six year classes of walleye were sampled including year classes from 2013 (age-1), 2012 (age-2), 2011 (age-3), 2009 (age-5), 2008 (age-6), and 2003 (age-11), all of which correspond to walleye fry stocking events, except for the 2013 year class, which is likely the result of natural reproduction. Mean back-calculated lengths at age for walleye were 8.9 inches at age-1, 12.6 inches at age-2, 15.7 inches at age-3, and 17.8 inches at age-4, indicating relatively slow growth when compared to walleye growth from similar lakes. Walleye were plump, suggesting that ample forage is available in Yankton Lake. Yankton Lake's walleye population appears to be stable as multiple year classes and lengths are present. Although the walleye catch rate is below the desired level (12.0 per gill net), it appears that the fry stocking in 2014 was successful, as near shore survey conducted on July 3, 2014 sampled 40 age-0 walleye. If the 2014 year class recruits to the fishery, the walleye catch rate should increase as these fish become vulnerable to the sampling gear. The current walleye fry stocking regime of 2 out of 3 years should continue as it is effective at maintaining multiple year classes in the population.  <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nCatch rates of northern pike in Yankton Lake have varied from 0.8 per gill net in 1994 to 9.0 per gill net in 2002 and have averaged 3.0 per gill net since 1985. The 2014 catch rate of 4.3 per gill net is the second highest catch rate observed on Yankton Lake, and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net). Northern pike fingerlings were last stocked in 2008, indicating that the northern pike population is maintained primarily through natural reproduction. Several wetlands are present around Yankton Lake, which can provide high quality northern pike spawning habitat if water levels are high enough to connect Yankton Lake to these wetlands. Northern pike ranged in length from 16.4 to 30.5 inches and averaged 21.3 inches. Northern pike were plump, indicating that northern pike are foraging successfully in Yankton Lake. The northern pike population appears to be somewhat stable, as it is comprised of multiple year classes and a wide range of lengths.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nYellow perch catch rates have been highly variable in Yankton Lake, ranging from 2.6 per gill net in 1990 to 33.0 per gill net in 2002, and averaging 13.6 per gill net since 1985. In 2014 yellow perch were captured at a rate of 4.3 per gill net which is the second lowest yellow perch catch rate observed on Yankton Lake, but is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net). The population is sustained through natural reproduction, as evidenced by the capture of 17 YOY yellow perch during a July, 3, 2014 near shore survey. This suggests that adequate brood stock exists to maintain the yellow perch population. Yellow perch were small, ranging from 5.1 to 10.4 inches, with 92 percent of them being less than 6.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates have steadily declined in Yankton Lake since 1994. Trap net catch rates in 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014 were 63.3 per trap net, 33.4 per trap net, 24.4 per trap net, 19.0 per trap net, 6.8 per trap net, and 1.9 per trap net, respectively. Black crappie recruitment tends to be highly variable and cyclic, with strong year classes reoccurring every three to five years. Populations are often comprised of one or two strong year classes because of this cyclic recruitment. Within the last couple of decades, Yankton Lake's black crappie population has not been able to produce the strong year classes typical of other crappie populations. The lack of a strong year class in recent years, and inconsistent recruitment has likely contributed to the decline of the crappie population in Yankton Lake. There appears to be at least three year classes present in Yankton Lake's crappie population, including YOY black crappie sampled in the July near shore survey (age-0; N=29), black crappie from 4.0 to 5.5 inches in length (age-1; N=5), and black crappie from 10.0 to 12.6 inches in length (age-4 plus; N=12); however, there are missing year classes, and the year classes that are present appear to be relatively weak. Black crappies were plump, suggesting that ample forage exists in Yankton Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES  <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance has varied from 0.0 per gill net in 2010 to 122.0 per gill net in 1985. In 2014, bullheads were captured at a rate of 103.7 per gill net and 14.2 per trap net, both within expected ranges of catch rates for similar lakes. Lengths of black bullheads ranged from 4.6 to 11.3 inches and averaged 7.7 inches. With low numbers of yellow perch present in Yankton Lake, the black bullhead should provide a good forage base for the walleye population.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp numbers remained stable from the 2010 assessment (6.3 per gill net), with a catch rate of 5.7 per gill net in 2014. Common carp lengths ranged from 8.0 to 29.9 inches and averaged 16.0 inches. Fifty-nine percent of common carp sampled were less than 10.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 catch rate of bigmouth buffalo was 11.0 per gill net, which is the second highest catch rate observed on Yankton Lake. All of the buffalo sampled were between 6.5 and 8.4 inches, likely all from the same year class. Young-of-the-year buffalo (N=910) were also sampled in the July 3, 2014 near shore survey, indicating that 2014 year class is abundant.  <br> \nOther species sampled included white sucker and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Yankton, in the town of Balaton in Lyon County, is a 387 acre lake with a maximum depth of 8 feet deep.  Yankton is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, black crappie, and yellow perch.  Winterkill has been less of an issue since an Aire-O2 aeration system was installed in 1983.  The local sportman's club has operated a small northern pike rearing pond from time to time due to the fair northern pike habitat available during wet years.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 17, 2002 using 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets.The walleye catch rate in gill nets was above average as it was in 1985.  Most of the walleyes in the nets ranged from 11 to 23 inches in length and came from fry stockings in 1999 and 2000.  Most of these walleyes were \"plump\" which is an indicator of health.  Growth rates were similar or better than in other Windom Area lakes.  The take home message is that great numbers and sizes of walleyes are available to anglers.In addition to the relatively large walleye population, the northern pike catch in our nets  was the highest of all assessments done on Lake Yankton.  These \"plump\" fish averaged around 20 inches in length.  Growth rates were similar to those in other Windom Area lakes as Age 2 northern pike were about 18 inches in length.  A majority of the fish came from the 2000 year class which suggests environmental conditions (wet year) and timing were favorable for natural reproduction.  Other lakes in the Windom area, such as West Graham in Nobles County, also saw strong year classes of northern pike in 2000.  It is encouraging to observe healthy walleye and northern pike populations coexisting to provide an excellent predator base.  If you fish Yankton, be prepared to catch some nice \"toothies\" as the numbers and sizes are unlike that lake has had before.  If the walleye and northern pike season has closed or if you are wanting some panfish, Lake Yankton has above average numbers of yellow perch, averaging close to 9 inches in length.  The population is dominated by these larger sized individuals that are relatively \"plump\".  Growth rates were similar to other area lakes, as an 8 inch perch would be 2 years old.  The relatively large size structure, large relative abundance, and good growth rates of yellow perch indicated a balanced predator to prey ratio that most fisheries professionals strive for in lakes. Similar to yellow perch, the black crappie catch rates were above average and the population is dominated by larger sized individuals.  These \"plump\" crappies had growth rates that were average to above, as Age 2 black crappie were about 8 inches and Age 3 black crappie were about 10 inches in length.  Good numbers and sizes of white crappies can also be caught.  Many of these white crappies are \"slabs\" as they were averaging nearly 11 inches in length.  Both black bullhead and common carp numbers were relatively high and may add some excitement to your fishing.Other species captured were bigmouth buffalo, bluegill, brown bullhead, orangespotted sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Lake Yankton through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

                "narrative": "<p>Yankton Lake is a 387-acrelake, located in the City of Balaton in Lyon County.  Yankton Lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet, and a watershed-to-lake ratio of 3 to 1.  Despite having a small watershed and being the start of the West Fork of the Des Moines Watershed, Yankton Lake's water quality is poor with a Secchi depth of 1.0 ft in 2018 and heavy algae blooms and turbid water throughout much of the year.  Yankton Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, crappie, and yellow perch.  A standard survey was conducted during the week of June 18, 2018 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and eight trap nets.  As of 4-10-2019, it appears that Lake Yankton suffered a substantial kill during the winter of 2018-2019, as high numbers of Walleye, Yellow Perch, Buffalo, Carp, Suckers, and Crappie were observed after ice out. The results of the 2018 standard survey likely do not reflect what remains following the winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Walleye catch rate was 40.3 per gill net, which greatly exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net), and is the highest Walleye catch rate ever observed at Yankton Lake.  Seven year classes of Walleye were sampled, two of which were from non-stocked years in 2013 (N=5) and 2016 (N=8), suggesting that sporadic natural reproduction occurs in Yankton Lake.  The 2017 year class, which was 27 percent of the sample is from the 2017 stocking of Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) Walleye.  Walleye lengths ranged from 7.3 to 26.8 inches and averaged 12.2 inches.  Walleye growth was fast, as mean lengths age 1, age-2, age-3, age-4, and age-5 were 8.6 inches, 12.3 inches, 14.8 inches, 16.8 inches, and 19.0 inches, respectively.  The current fry stocking regime of two out of three years at 500 per littoral acre appears to be effective.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Northern Pike catch rate was the lowest ever recorded at Yankton Lake at 0.3 per gill net, a decrease from 4.3 per gill net in 2014.  The one pike that was sampled was 31.9 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate in 2018 was 8.9 per trap net, an increase from the 2014 catch rate of 1.9 per trap net, and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 3.9 to 13.8 inches and averaged 6.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates have been highly variable in Yankton Lake, ranging from 2.6 per gill net in 1990 to 33.0 per gill net in 2002.  In 2018, the Yellow Perch catch rate was the highest ever recorded at Yankton Lake at 39.0 per gill net, exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.8 to 11.9 inches and averaged 8.9 inches.  The Yellow Perch population should provide a quality angling opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead catch rates were low at 12.5 per trap net and 9.7 per gill net, both below expected catch rates for similar lakes.  Other species sampled included Common Carp, White Crappie, White Sucker, Bigmouth Buffalo, Green Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Yankton Lake is a 387-acre, class 43 lake, located in the City of Balaton in Lyon County.  Yankton Lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet, and a watershed-to-lake ratio of 3 to 1.  Despite having a small watershed and being the start of the West Fork of the Des Moines Watershed, Yankton Lake's water quality is poor with a Secchi depth of 1.0 ft during the last survey in 2018.  Additionally, Yankton Lake typically experiences heavy algae blooms and turbid water throughout much of the year.  Yankton Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  Dissolved oxygen levels were at 4.0-4.4 parts per million from early to late February 2019, then they decreased further to 0.02 parts per million in mid-March.  Dissolved oxygen below 3.0 parts per million is stressful to fish and lower values can result in death.  Following the low dissolved oxygen a winterkill was observed during late winter 2019 when many Common Carp, Walleye, Yellow Perch, and other species were observed dead in the aeration open water.  A winterkill survey was conducted during the week of April 24, 2019 to monitor fish population using 1 gill nets and 3 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nDuring 2018 in a fish survey prior to the winterkill there were 11 fish species of fish including Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Northern Pike, Walleye, White Crappie, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  During the winterkill survey in April of 2019 there were 11 species of fish were sampled including Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Common Carp, Creek Chub, Northern Pike, Walleye, White Crappie, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  The only difference in species between the two surveys was Green Sunfish absent from the winterkill survey and Creek Chub absent from the 2018 summer survey.  However, Green Sunfish and Creek Chub can be difficult to sample from year to year as they naturally fluctuate and in the case of Creek Chub move in and out of the lake.  Relative abundances of gamefish species, Walleye and Crappie, did decrease from the 2018 survey to the winterkill survey in 2019 indicating a loss many of those fish.  Yellow Perch and Northern Pike relative abundance remained similar from pre-winterkill to post-winterkill.  The rough fish, particularly Common Carp, seemed to be the most susceptible to the winterkill.  Pictures of many Common Carp dead on the lake after ice-off were taken by local residents.  Unfortunately, Common Carp will return to the lake with the connection that exists to the Des Moines River and several connected wetlands downstream.  Interestingly, it appears that the largest impact of the winterkill may have been the reduction of numbers of Walleye and Crappie as well as the reduction in the number of larger Yellow Perch in the lake.    <br> \n <br> \nRestocking efforts were undertaken following the winterkill assessment in April.  Lake Sarah strain Walleye fry (193,500) were stocked in May.  Northern Pike fingerling (194) were stocked in June.  Yellow Perch adults (1,862) were stocked in May.  Crappie adults were restocked by a private hatchery that were purchased by the local Balaton sports club.  Follow-up fall electrofishing was conducted in September of 2019, Walleye and Yellow Perch stocking was successful as there were many of each species observed.  Additionally, some Crappie were observed in the sample.  Northern Pike were not sampled in the fall, but they were sampled in good numbers in the April 2019 assessment.  It appears that Lake Yankton is well on the way to recovery from the partial winterkill in 2018-2019.  Walleye fry are proposed for stocking again in 2020 and surplus Northern Pike will be stocked if extra fingerling are produced in 2020. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Yankton Lake is a 387-acre, class 43 lake, located in the City of Balaton in Lyon County.  Yankton Lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet, and a watershed-to-lake ratio of 3-to-1.  Despite having a small watershed and being the start of the West Fork of the Des Moines Watershed, Yankton Lake's water quality is poor with a Secchi disk reading of 1.0 ft during the last survey in 2018.  Additionally, Yankton Lake typically experiences heavy algae blooms and turbid water throughout much of the year.  Yankton Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  Dissolved oxygen levels were at 4.0-4.4 parts per million from early to late February 2019, then they decreased further to 0.02 parts per million in mid-March.  Dissolved oxygen below 3.0 parts per million is stressful to fish and lower values can result in death.  Following the low dissolved oxygen period, a winterkill was observed during late winter 2019 when many Common Carp, Walleye, Yellow Perch, and other species were observed dead in the aeration open water.  Electrofishing was conducted September 16, 2019 to monitor the Walleye restocking effort after the winterkill.   <br> \n <br> \nFollowing the winterkill, 193,500 lower Mississippi strain Walleye fry were stocked.  To monitor the success of the Walleye fry stocking, fall electrofishing was conducted around the shoreline for 30 minutes.  Seventy eight Walleye were sampled that were from the stocking.  The extrapolated catch rate was 156 per hour.  Walleye that were measured (N=38) ranged in length from 5.0 to 8.4 inches with an average length of 6.1 inches.  If a fall electrofishing catch rate for Walleye is less than 20 per hour then the change of producing a year class is extremely low.  Therefore, a catch rate of 156 per hour indicates a catch rate that could result in a strong year class.  Additionally, the growth of the Walleye was good with an average length of 6.1 inches.  There is strong evidence in Minnesota that a Walleye that is larger than 5 inches by winter will have an excellent chance of survival.  So, all signs point toward the Walleye stocking being successful in 2019.  Walleye will be stocked again in the spring of 2020 and the spring of 2021 to continue to re-establish the population.  Fishing for Walleye could start to be good during the late winter and spring of 2021. <br> \n</p>",

Yankton is presently managed for walleye as the primary species while northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie are managed secondarily.  The long range management goal of eight walleye per net has consistently been met.  The walleye catch rate on Yankton was good compared to similar lakes.  Lengths of walleye ranged from 12 to 24.5 inches and averaged 16.3 inches.  The average weight of walleye sampled in our nets was just over 1.5 pounds.  The lake is presently stocked with walleye two out of every three years.  On the year the lake isn't stocked, natural reproduction is checked.  A good year class was produced in 1995 from natural reproduction.The yellow perch catch rate was good compared to similar lakes.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from five to 11.6 inches and averaged nine inches.  The average weight of yellow perch sampled in our nets was 0.3 pounds.  Five different ages of yellow perch were observed during the survey indicating good natural reproduction.The black crappie catch rate was high compared to similar lakes.  Lengths of black crappie ranged from four to 12 inches and averaged just over nine inches.  The average weight of black crappie of black crappie sampled was about 0.5 pounds.  Seven different ages of black crappie were observed during the survey.The northern pike catch rate was somewhat low compared to similar lakes.  Lengths of northern pike ranged from 15 to just over 27 inches and averaged 18.6 inches. The average weight of northern pike sampled in our nets was just under 1.5 pounds.  The lower number of northern pike in Yankton may be attributed to the lack of suitable habitat for natural reproduction. To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Yankton Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Yankton Lake is a 387-acre lake, located in the City of Balaton in Lyon County.  Yankton Lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet, and a watershed-to-lake ratio of 3 to 1.  Despite having a small watershed and being the start of the West Fork of the Des Moines Watershed, Yankton Lake's water quality has typically been poor with Secchi depth's less than 1.0 ft. and heavy algae blooms and turbid water throughout much of the year.  Water clarity improved in 2022 as the Secchi depth was 1.8 ft. during the survey, and clearer water was observed throughout much of the year, resulting in aquatic vegetation being present throughout much of the lake.  The increased water clarity and aquatic vegetation response is a common occurrence following a significant partial winterkill.  Yankton Lake suffered a substantial partial winterkill during the winter of 2018-2019, as several species of dead fish were observed in the aeration hole and after ice out.  While the number of species in the lake was not affected, the kill reduced the abundances of most species of fish. Yankton Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  A standard survey was conducted during the week of June 18, 2022 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nPrior to the 2018-2019 winterkill, Yankton Lake's Walleye abundance was the highest that had ever been recorded at 40.3 per gill net in the 2018 survey.  The Walleye population was hit pretty hard by the winterkill, as the catch rate in the 2019 winterkill check was 2.0 per gill net.  It appears that restocking efforts (2019 and 2021 fry) have been effective, as Walleye were captured at a rate of 16.0 per gill net in the 2022 standard survey, which is near the long-term average of 17.0 per gill net and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Two year classes of Walleye were sampled (2019 and 2021) which correspond to stocked years of Lower Mississippi River Strain Walleye (Sarah strain Walleye).  Age-3 Walleye, which were stocked the spring immediately after the partial winterkill, accounted for 96 percent of the sample.  Walleye lengths ranged from 10.1 to 19.8 inches and averaged 17.9 inches.  Mean length at age-3 was 18.2 inches which is incredibly fast growth when compared to similar lakes.  Walleye were plump suggesting that there is plenty of food available for them.  The 2019 year class should provide good angling in Yankton Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Northern Pike catch rate was 0.0 per gill net, the lowest catch rate ever recorded since 1985 and below the long-term average of 2.4 per gill net.  Three Northern Pike were sampled in trap nets, with lengths of 20.9 inches, 24.1 inches, and 26.1 inches.  Northern Pike fingerlings were last stocked in 2019 (N=194).  Yankton Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike longer than 24 inches can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nSince 1985, Yellow Perch catch rates in Yankton Lake have averaged 23.0 per gill net, ranging from 2.6 per gill net in 1990 to 39.0 per gill net in 2018.  In 2022, the Yellow Perch catch rate was 82.3 per gill net, the highest catch rate ever recorded in Yankton Lake, and greatly exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  It is highly probable that the aquatic vegetation response enable good nursery and spawning habitat for the Yellow Perch.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 4.8 to 11.1 inches and averaged 7.6 inches.  Yellow Perch are plump and foraging successfully.  The Yellow Perch in Yankton Lake should provide a good angling opportunity in the near future.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have been highly variable in Yankton Lake, ranging from 0.4 per gill net in 1990 to 49.3 per gill net in 2002 averaging 10.6 per gill net since 1985.  In 2022, the Black Crappie catch rate was 1.3 per gill net, below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.4 to 13.8 per gill net).  Black Crappie can be highly susceptible to low dissolved oxygen, so the population likely took a hit during the last winterkill.  Adult Black Crappie were stocked in 2020 by the Red Rock Sportsman's Club, but were not sampled effectively during the 2022 survey.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 5.8 to 12.1 inches and averaged 8.0 inches.  It is possible the highly abundant Yellow Perch is filling the niche and outcompeting Black Crappie given the habitat change since 2019.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate in 2022 was 57.7 per gill net, which is near the long-term average of 57.0 per gill net since 1985.  Black Bullhead lengths ranged from 0.8 to 12.8 inches and averaged 7.7 inches.  The Common Carp catch rate was 3.0 per trap net, which is the same as the long-term average.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Bluegill, Green Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Yankton is a 387-acre lake located near the town of Balaton, MN in Lyon County.   Yankton is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, crappie, and yellow perch.  Yankton was re-surveyed during the week of June 19, 2006 using gill nets, trap nets, and seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate in gill nets was 10.3/set, which was within the expected range.  Walleye averaged nearly 16 inches in length with most of the fish ranging from 14 to 25 inches.  Most of the walleye were plump and growth was quite good.  Walleye fry stocking has been successful as many of the fish captured came from fry stocking.  Most walleye anglers would be happy with this population and would be happy with the sizes being caught. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were down from the previous survey, however that was the highest catch rate ever recorded on Yankton.  Most of the fish were quite healthy and plump and averaged just over 27 inches in length.  Consistent northern pike abundance is more likely in lakes where quality wetland habitat exists.  During those hot summer months, target any tiles running as northerns will be seeking out these locations for feeding and thermal refuge.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish abundance appears to be fairly high in Yankton with crappie numbers dominating the fishery.  Yellow perch numbers were within the expected range, with most of the fish averaging just over 7 inches in total length.  As with many of the Windom Area lakes within the past few years, crappie numbers are quite high.  A majority of the fish are black crappie and averaged 9 inches in length.  The white crappie abundance was higher than expected and averaged over 10 inches in length.  The surprise this year on Yankton was the numbers of good-sized bluegills.  In fact, the 2006 survey captured the most bluegills than any previous survey on Lake Yankton.  Not only was their abundance relatively high, but many of the bluegills were in the 8.5-9.0 inch range.  This may indicate more aquatic vegetation than in previous years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers are as low as they have ever been in Yankton since surveys have been done by DNR.  While the abundance seems to be low compared to historical catch rates, the catch rates are still within the normal range.  Most of these fish were in the 5.0-5.5 inch and 9.0-10.0 inch range. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured were bigmouth buffalo, brown bullhead, common carp, orangespotted sunfish, white sucker, and fathead minnows. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by <br> \n <br> \nRyan Doorenbos <br> \n</p>",
