                "narrative": "<p>Crawford Lake is small (109 acres), mostly shallow, and has a history of winterkills.  The lake was reclaimed with rotenone in 1998 and restocked with walleye, yellow perch, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.  Special regulations placed on the fishery allow harvest of five bluegill, five black crappie, ten yellow perch, and two walleye.  No harvest of largemouth bass is allowed.  Aeration equipment is now available to prevent winterkill.Walleye fingerlings are stocked regularly in Crawford Lake.  The catch rate in 2004 was low, compared to lakes similar to Crawford.  The average size of walleyes sampled was 16 inches, but some were as large as 24 inches.Sixty-two largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The catch rate was near the median for lakes in this part of the state, and similar to the catch rate from 2003.  However, mean length increased from 11.8 inches in 2003 to 13.3 inches in 2004.  The largest bass sampled was 17.6 inches.  Most bass sampled were age 5, resulting from the first year class produced after broodstock were stocked in 1999.Bluegill were abundant but small in 2004.  Nearly all of the bluegill sampled were 5-6.5 inches, and mostly from the 2000 year class.  Growth rates appeared similar to statewide averages.  Many hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish were also sampled.  Hybrid sunfish were larger than bluegill, and ranged from 6-7.5 inches.  The catch rate of black crappie in 2004 was below average for the lake class.  Mean weight (0.27 pounds) was also below average.  Black bullheads appeared abundant, despite the removal of 3,300 pounds of bullheads in 2003.  The catch rate in 2004 was well above the range that is typical for lakes like Crawford.  Mean weight (0.21 pounds) was low, but has increased from previous years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crawford Lake is shallow (maximum depth = 19 feet) and has a history of winterkills. The lake was treated with rotenone in 1998 in an attempt to eliminate a large bullhead population and then re-establish game fish species. An aeration system has been used as needed since 2001 to prevent winterkill. During the winter of 2014, the aeration system failed and a winterkill occurred. Subsequent trap netting in April 2014 found only one Black Bullhead and one Brown Bullhead. Adult Black Crappie, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Largemouth Bass, Walleye fingerlings, and Yellow Perch were stocked in Crawford Lake in 2014 to re-establish the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nA brief electrofishing survey was conducted on June 6, 2016 to assess the recovery of the fishery. Several locations were electrofished around the lake for a total of 1,222 seconds (0.34 hours). The numbers of small Largemouth Bass, small Green Sunfish, and small Black Bullheads were high and no attempt was made to capture all fish seen. Largemouth Bass ranged in size from 4.2 to 12.6 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches. Green Sunfish ranged in size from 3.3 to 6.6 inches. Three Walleye were captured, ranging in size from 10.2 to 10.6 inches. These were likely fingerlings stocked in the fall of 2014. Other species captured in low numbers included: Black Crappie, Brown Bullhead, and Pumpkinseed.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass reproduction is good and no further stocking is needed. Walleye stocking will continue. No Bluegill were seen and addtional stocking will be used to establish a population. Previous Black Crappie introductions have reproduced poorly and further stocking may not be justified. Two Yellow Perch were seen but not captured during electrofishing. No Channel Catfish were caught and additional adults were stocked in 2016 to help control bullhead numbers. A variety of special fishing regulations are in place on Crawford Lake; additional surveys including trap nets and gill nets will be used in the future to evaluate the recovery of the fishery. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crawford Lake is a 109 acre lake located five miles south of the city of Buffalo in Wright County. The lake is shallow (max. depth of 19 feet) with a history of winterkill. The lake was reclaimed using rotenone in 1998, but not all bullheads were killed. An aeration system was purchased and has been used since 2001 to prevent winterkill, but the system failed in 2014 and a partial winterkill occurred. Black Crappie, Bluegill, Channel Catfish (to control bullheads), Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and Yellow Perch have been stocked since then. A variety of special fishing regulations exist for Crawford Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA brief electrofishing survey (~32 minutes) was conducted on June 14, 2019 to evaluate the status of the fishery. Water clarity was good; Secchi depth was 8.0 feet and the MPCA ten year average summer Secchi depth is 13.1 feet. All fish were dipped except for Black Bullheads, which were very abundant. Largemouth Bass (up to 14.8 inches) were abundant and good numbers of Bluegill (up to 6.8 inches) and Pumpkinseed (up to 7.9 inches) were sampled. Other species captured in low numbers included: Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, and two small Walleye. No Channel Catfish, Black Crappie, or Yellow Perch were caught. Submerged vegetation was very heavy and likely limited catchability of fish in water more than a few feet deep. An attempt to sample deeper water was made with little success. <br> \n <br> \nThe fishery is still recovering from the 2014 winterkill but no additional stocking seems needed except for Channel Catfish, if available. Walleye fingerlings will be stocked biennially when available. A targeted survey using gill nets would be helpful to evaluate the population of Channel Catfish, Walleye, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crawford Lake is a 109 acre lake located five miles south of the city of Buffalo in Wright County. The lake is shallow (max. depth of 19 feet) with a history of winterkill. The lake was reclaimed using rotenone in 1998, but not all bullheads were killed. An aeration system was purchased and has been used since 2001 to prevent winterkill, but the system failed in 2014 and a partial winterkill occurred. Black Crappie, Bluegill, Channel Catfish (to control bullheads), Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and Yellow Perch have been stocked since then. In 2021, a standard lake survey was completed to track the recovery of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate was identical to that of 2009, and within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Walleye fingerling and adult stocking occurred in 2017, 2019 and 2021.  The average length of Walleye was 16 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled for the first time since the reclamation at a rate well above the expected range of values for similar lakes. Northern Pike were not stocked by the DNR after the lake was reclaimed in 1998 and it is not known how they were introduced into the lake. Pike ranged in length from 15 to 33 inches with an average length and weight of 22 inches and 2.6 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population is still recovering from the partial winterkill of 2014. Fifty-six minutes of day-time electrofishing on June 4, 2021 produced a catch of 83 bass. Largemouth ranged in length from 6 to 14 inches with an average length of 10 inches. Nine percent of bass were greater than 12 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were abundant as the catch was above the range of expected values and more than that of 2009. Only one of the Bluegill sampled in 2021 was larger than seven inches in length which was similar to conditions prior to the winterkill. Despite the special regulations a memorable sunfish fishery has not developed.  <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch rate of Black Crappie was above the first quartile for the lake class, however no crappie were sampled in trap nets and only three in gill nets.  This was similar to 2009 when the catch was also low. The crappie fishery has never developed since the reclamation perhaps because of the mesotrophic nature of Crawford Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch has increased since 2009. Of the 43 bullheads sampled in gill nets the average length was 9 inches.  Adult Channel Catfish were stocked in 2014 and 2016 (100 and 200, respectively) to help control the bullhead population however, none were sampled in either gill nets or trap nets in 2021. <br> \n <br> \nThe fishery is still recovering from the 2014 winterkill but no additional stocking seems needed at this time. Walleye fingerlings will continue to be stocked every two years when available.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crawford Lake is located in Wright County, five miles south of Buffalo.  It is a small (109 acres), shallow lake (average depth of 3.6 feet, maximum depth of 20 feet) with a sand and muck bottom.  Aquatic vegetation becomes dense throughout much of the lake during the open water seasons.  A public access is located within a county park on the south side of the lake.Crawford Lake experienced occasional winterkills in the past, and the fish community became dominated by bullheads.  In an attempt to reduce the bullhead population and provide better angling opportunities, the Department of Natural Resources reclaimed the lake with rotenone (a natural fish toxicant) in 1998.  The lake was later stocked with walleye, yellow perch, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  An aeration system is also in place to prevent future winterkills.Assessments in 1999 and 2000 showed that black bullheads were not completely eliminated from Crawford Lake during the rotenone treatment, but that other gamefish species are reproducing successfully in the lake.  Walleye were sampled ranging from 8 to 20 inches.  Both fingerling and fry stocking are being tried to determine which is more effective for Crawford Lake.  Largemouth bass are abundant, and now reaching catchable size, ranging from 6 to 12.5 inches.  Sunfish and perch numbers are also growing.  Growth rates are generally good, which is expected for a newly-reclaimed lake.  Black crappie may not have been as successful in reproducing.  No crappie were sampled in the 2000 survey.Special regulations are in effect for Crawford Lake, which are more conservative than statewide limits.  Anglers can harvest two walleye, five bluegill, five black crappie, and ten yellow perch.  Largemouth bass are designated as catch-and-release only.</p>",

It is a small (109 acres), shallow lake (average depth of 3.6 feet, maximum depth of 20 feet) with a sand and muck bottom.  Aquatic vegetation becomes dense throughout much of the lake during summer months.  A public access is located within a county park on the south side of the lake.  Crawford Lake has experienced winterkills in some years.  In a 1988 survey, only Black and Brown Bullhead were found.  Black Crappie and Bluegill have been stocked in an attempt to re-establish populations, but with limited success.  The lake was reclaimed with rotenone (a fish toxicant) in the fall of 1998, and later stocked with Largemouth Bass, Walleye, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  An aeration system is in place that can be used to prevent winterkill if oxygen levels become low in the future.  In 1999, netting was conducted to assess the success of the rotenone treatment.  Unfortunately, Black bullheads were caught, indicating that they were not completely eliminated during the rotenone treatment.  Small Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch were also captured, indicating that re-introduction of gamefish was successful.  Four Walleye were captured and were most likely from the 1998 yearling stocking following the reclamation.  Future surveys will help to assess the survival and growth of stocked Walleye fry, as well as the success of the other fish species in the lake.Crawford Lake will be open for angling starting in March 2000, with special regulations in effect.  Limits are two Walleye, five Bluegill, five Black Crappie, and ten Yellow Perch.  Largemouth Bass are designated as catch-and-release only.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crawford Lake is a small (109 acres), shallow, recreational lake which had a history of winterkills.  The lake was reclaimed with rotenone in 1998 and restocked with walleye, yellow perch, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.  Subsequent netting revealed that black bullheads had not been eliminated, but that sport species which had been stocked were reproducing.  Angling regulations went into effect March 1, 2000 which limit the daily and harvest possession to 5 sunfish, 5 crappie, 2 walleye and 10 yellow perch per day.  Only catch and release is allowed for largemouth bass.  Walleye and largemouth bass are the primary management species and aeration equipment is now available to prevent winterkill.  This was the first assessment since the 2004 survey, though electrofishing for largemouth has occurred annually since 2001. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerling/yearling/adult stocking occurred in 2002, 2005 and 2007.  This stocking has resulted in a modest population.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of yellow perch was below the normal range, and less than 2004.  Approximately 75 pounds of adult yellow perch were removed both in 2003 and 2004 (1,586 perch total).  The perch were used to establish populations in School Section Lake, Stearns County, and Slough Lake, Wright County, respectively.  Northern pike have not been present in Crawford Lake since the reclamation so it is not clear why the perch population has declined. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing for largemouth has shown increasing catch rates and proportional stock size since reintroduction.  The catch per unit of effort has increased nearly every year and was above the average catch for Wright County lakes.  The average length of largemouth bass has increased as well.  The growth of largemouth is near the statewide average.  Bass grow to a length of 12 inches in five years.  Anglers have reported excellent catch and release fishing for largemouth bass.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were abundant but somewhat less so than the catch of 2004.  All of the bluegill were less than 6.8 inches.  Despite the special regulations a memorable sunfish fishery has not developed.  Hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed were both less abundant than in 2004 also.  Growth of bluegill was similar to the statewide average and bluegill reached a length of nearly six inches in five years. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of black crappie was below the average range for the lake class.  In fact no crappie were taken in trap nets and only two in gill nets.  This was similar to 2004 when the catch was also low.  The crappie fishery has never developed since the reclamation.  Prior to aeration stocked crappies flourished and provided a memorable fishery. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads exhibited a profound change (2.8/trap net) since 2004 (92.2/trap net).  Of the 14 bullheads taken in trap nets the average length was 11.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nAdult channel catfish were stocked in 2005 and 2006 (84 and 79, respectively).  It is possible that catfish are displacing bullheads.  Other factors have also influenced the decline.  Two channel catfish were taken with trap nets and one in gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, we\u0019re pleased with the direction of the fishery.  A quality largemouth bass population exists.  Bullheads  and hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish have declined.  The next years will show if bluegill will grow to larger sizes. <br> \n</p>",
