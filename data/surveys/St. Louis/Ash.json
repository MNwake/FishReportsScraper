                "narrative": "<p>Ash Lake is a moderately productive Class 5 lake located approximately 12 miles north of Orr, MN. It has a total surface area of 669 acres, with a maximum depth of 25 feet, and a maximum fetch (NE) of 1.8 miles. Approximately 28% (195 acres) of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. Undeveloped forest and bogs dominate the surrounding watershed. Plants with an abundance rating of \"common\" during the 2013 survey included clasping leaf pondweed, narrow-leaf pondweed group, and water celery. Submerged vegetation grew to a maximum depth of 8 feet. Sand was the most common shoal water substrate, followed by boulder and detritus. Six inlets were identified. Three of the inlets had no visible flow, while the other three had very little velocity, ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 feet per second. The outlet forms the source of the Ash River. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fishing regulations on Ash Lake for Walleye follow the statewide regulation, which is a 6-combination total possession limit with not more than 1 Walleye over 20\". There is a special regulation set to improve Northern Pike size structure, which is a possession limit of three with only 1 over 36\" and all Northern Pike between 24 - 36\" inches must be immediately released. Black Crappie fishing regulation follows the statewide regulation with a 10-combination total possession limit. Sunfish fishing regulation follows the statewide regulation with a 20-combination total possession limit. Bass fishing regulations follow the Northeast Zone regulation, which is six combined Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass possession limit. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net catch rate was 8.0 fish per net which is above average for similar lakes. Catch rate was above the management goal of 5.0 fish per net for Ash Lake. Total length ranged from 7.5 to 29.9 inches and mean length was 12.9 inches. Average weight was 1.2 pounds which is average for similar class lakes. A total of 10 year classes were present, and ages ranged from 2-17 years. Ash Lake offers a good Walleye fishing opportunity, there are good numbers of Walleyes in Ash Lake with the chance to catch Walleye over 26 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catch rate was 0.8 fish per net, which is well below the average for similar class lakes. Catch rate was below the management goal of an abundance between 1.8 and 5.5 fish per gill net for Ash Lake. Total length ranged from 23.7 to 38.2 inches and the mean length was 28.9 inches. Mean weight of Northern Pike captured in gill nets was 6.4 pounds which is well above average for similar lakes. A total of four year classes were present, and ages ranged from 2 - 8 years. Ash Lake offers good fishing opportunities for Northern Pike. With a lower density population there may not always be a fish on the line but there is a good chance to catch Northern Pike in the mid-30\" range.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trap-net catch rate was 8.1 fish per net, which was above average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 5.2 to 12.6 inches and the mean length was 9.6 inches. Mean weight was 0.5 pounds, which was above average for similar lakes. A total of seven year classes were present, and ages ranged from 3-12 years. Ash Lake offers a good fishing opportunity with quality Black Crappie in the system.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net catch rate was 7.3 fish per net which is slightly below average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 5.8 to 9.3 inches and the mean length was 7.7 inches. Mean weight captured in trap nets was 0.4 pounds which was above average for similar lakes. A total of seven year classes were present, and ages ranged from 3 - 11 years. Ash Lake offers a good fishing opportunity with quality Bluegill in the system. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass abundance was 189.3 fish per hour of On-Time, which was greater than the Ash Lake historic average of 141.6 fish per hour of On-Time. Total length ranged from 5.1 to 17.1 inches and the mean was 9.5 inches. Average weight was 0.5 pounds. Eleven year classes were present, and ages ranged from 2-17 years. Ash Lake offers a good fishing opportunity with quality Smallmouth Bass in the system.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill-net catch rate was 86.7 fish per net, which was well above the average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 4.2 to 11.2 inches and the mean length was 7.8 inches. Mean weight was 0.2 pounds, which is above average for similar lakes. Six year classes were present, and ages ranged from 2-7 years. Yellow Perch can offer an additional fishing opportunity but also offers great forage for Walleye and Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ash is a 690 acre lake located 12 miles north-northwest of Orr, MN. Ash is a fairly productive lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet and water clarity of just over 5 feet during the 2018 survey. Ash also has a long history of active fisheries management including special regulations for Northern Pike, stocking of Walleye fry and fingerlings, and removal of Yellow Perch. Ash Lake was sampled in 2018 as part of a regular rotation of lake surveys in the International Falls Management Area (IFMA).    <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were below the historic average for Ash Lake, but were still comparable to lakes similar to Ash. The average size was nearly 10 inches, and there were fish over 13 inches sampled during the 2018 survey.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were also slightly less than the historic average for Ash Lake, but again were near the average when compared to similar lakes. Average size was greater than what would be expected. The average Bluegill measured 6.5 inches and some were measured at over 9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike continue to impress since a special regulation was put in place on Ash Lake. Catch rates were within the expected range, and the overall size structure is good. An average Northern Pike during the 2018 survey was 5 to 6 pounds. The average length was over 29 inches and they ranged in size from 24 to 38 inches, which is much larger than would be expected from a small shallow lake such as Ash.  <br> \n <br> \nThere is a high density Smallmouth Bass population in Ash Lake. Smallmouth Bass catch rates reached a historic high during the 2018 survey. The average length was just over 10 inches and fish over 18 inches were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were the highest they've been since 1983, thanks to a pair of recent successful stocked year classes. Ash Lake is currently stocked with fingerlings in odd-numbered years, and the 2013 and 2015 year classes made up approximately 74% of the fish sampled during this survey. Walleye ranged from 7 to 29 inches and the average size was just over 15 inches. Walleye up to 17 years old were sampled, and 13 year classes were present.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers greatly exceeded what would be expected for similar lakes, but is still less than the historic average for Ash Lake. Ash has a history of producing great numbers of Yellow Perch, and is one of the few lakes where Yellow Perch removal has been used to manage a fishery. Despite the high numbers, some larger fish were sampled in 2018. The average length was nearly 8 inches, and some were measured over 10 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundance include Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ash is a clear, moderately productive, class 5 lake located about 10 miles north of Orr, MN.  The maximum depth is 25 feet and 29% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The fish community has many species including black crappies, bluegills, northern pike, smallmouth bass, walleye, white suckers, and yellow perch.  Currently, mean sizes and growth for all species are better than what is seen in most class 5 lakes.     Early investigations of Ash Lake indicated an unbalanced fish community with low predator abundance and extremely high forage abundance.  Efforts to reshape the community have included stocking since 1909; white sucker and yellow perch removal from 1980-1985; and starting on May 10, 2003, the use of a special regulation to protect northern pike from 24-36 inches from angler harvest.  Efforts to reshape the community have provided some very positive benefits to the fishery, however, the fish community has returned to an unbalaced state.   Black crappies have been very abundant in recent years and sizes are outstanding due to a large number of 7 year old fish.  In 2002, trap-net abundance was 12.00 fish/set, which was much greater than the third quartile of 4.50 fish/set for class 5 lakes and third highest ever recorded in Ash Lake.  Seven year-classes were present in the trap nets and age ranged from 2-9 years.  The 1995 year-class made up 77% of the sample.  Total length (TL) in trap nets ranged from 4.4-13.0 inches and the mean was 10.4.  The mean weight of black crappies captured in trap nets was much greater than most class 5 lakes.  Bluegill trap-net abundance was 5.33 fish/set and continued to decline from the high in 1995 of 57.5 fish/set.  Nine year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-11 years.  Total length ranged from 4.1-10.2 inches and the mean was 7.0.  Growth and mean weight were greater than the statewide average for class 5 lakes.  Northern pike gill-net abundance (5.33 fish/set) remained above the majority of class 5 lakes, as it has for the previous 12 years.  Eight year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-8 years.  The 1998 year-class made up 44% of the sample.  Mean TL was 22.5 inches with a range from 13.1 to 37.1.  Growth and mean weight were greater than what is seen statewide in lakes similar to Ash.Night electrofishing was used to sample 86 smallmouth bass on May 31, 2002.  Smallmouth bass were sampled at a rate of 66 fish/hour of on-time, a decrease from the 1998 rate of 170 fish/hour.  Mean TL increased from 7.7 inches in 1998 to 11.4 inches in 2002.  Total length ranged from 5.1 to 16.4 inches.  Nine year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-11 years.  The 1995 and 1997 year-classes each made up 31% of the sample.Walleye gill-net abundance was only 1.56 fish/set; over 75% of class 5 lakes have walleye abundaces greater than 2.00 fish/set.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-15 years.  Total length ranged from 8.0-21.6 inches and the mean was 18.3.  Mean weight was 0.62 pounds heavier than the third quartile (2.01) for class 5 lakes.White sucker gill-net abundance was 13.67 fish/set, which was well above the median of 4.75 fish/set for class 5 lakes.  White sucker gill-net abundance has remained well above the median since the initial survey in 1957.  Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 107.22 fish/set, which was over 20 times higher than the median of 5.22.  The abundance is approaching levels observed in the late 1970s and early 1980s that prompted a fish removal project.  In 2002, six year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 3-8 years, but few were older than 6 (N=2).  Total length in gill nets ranged from 5.4-11.0 inches and the mean was 8.3.  Growth and mean weight were above the statewide averages.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ash is a class 5 lake located about 10 miles north of Orr, MN.  Northern pike, panfish, smallmouth bass and yellow perch represent the majority of the sport-fish community.  Early investigations of Ash Lake indicated an unbalanced fish community with low predator abundance and extremely high forage abundance.  Efforts to reshape the community have included centrarchid and walleye stocking since 1909; white sucker and yellow perch removal from 1980-1985; and starting on May 10, 2003, the use of a special regulation to protect northern pike from 24-36 inches from angler harvest.  Efforts to reshape the fish community have provided some very positive benefits.  The 2008 assessment was conducted to collect information to be used with future assessments to evaluate the special regulation on northern pike, walleye stocking, and community balance.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie trap-net abundance was 7.83 fish/set, which was well above the level found in similar lakes.  In 2008, four year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-6 years.  The 2005 year-class represented 85% of the sample.  Total length in trap nets ranged from 6.3-11.3 inches and the mean was 7.9.   <br> \n    <br> \nSince the northern pike regulation was established in 2003 on Ash Lake, density has decreased and growth rate and size have increased.  Northern pike gill-net abundance (4.33 fish/set) decreased from the level observed in 2002 (5.33 fish/set).  Total length at age 4 was 26.3 inches in 2008 compared to 22.9 inches in 2002 and much greater than the statewide median of 20.5 inches.  In 2008, nine year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-9 years.  The 2004 year-class represented 30% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 15.9-35.8 inches and the mean was 28.5; the mean in 2002 was 22.5 inches.  The mean weight of northern pike captured in gill nets has increased from 2.88 pounds in 2002 to 5.90 pounds in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was used to sample a total of 239 smallmouth bass on one sampling night in early June.  Smallmouth bass were captured at a rate of 179.1 per hour of on-time, which was the highest level ever observed in Ash Lake, but similar to the 1998 investigation (170.5 per hour of on-time).  Total length ranged from 3.6 to 17.7 inches and the mean was 8.7.   Age ranged from 1 to 10 and the 2005 year-class represented 62% of the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net abundance was 0.78 fish/set, which was well below what is found in similar lakes and quite disappointing considering the stocking rate was increased to three pounds per littoral acre in 2003.  Four year-classes were present (two were from stocked years).  Age ranged from 3-10 years.  Total length ranged from 10.9-28.5 inches and the mean was 19.6.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net abundance was 97.56 fish/set, which was well above the third quartile of 14.13 for similar lakes.  The abundance in 2008 was a noticeable increase from the 2005 investigation (11.22 fish/set), but similar to the 2002 investigation (107.22 fish/set) in which abundance was approaching levels observed in the late 1970s and early 1980s that prompted a fish removal project.  In 2008, five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-6 years.  The 2005 year-class represented 77% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 5.4-10.2 inches and the mean was 7.3.   <br> \n</p>",

THE 1987 YEAR-CLASS RECRUITED TO THE FISHERY, AND IT COMPRISED 39% OF THE TOTAL CATCH OF PASSIVE GEARS. THE WHITE SUCKER POPULATION IS MAINTAINING ITSELF AT A HIGH LEVEL OF ABUNDANCE; ITS INDEX OF ABUNDANCE WAS ABOVE THE 3RD QUARTILE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS.

                "narrative": "<p>Ash is a class 5 lake located about 10 miles north of Orr, MN.  Yellow perch, white suckers, centrarchids, and northern pike make up the majority of the fish community.  Early investigations of Ash Lake indicated an unbalanced fish community with low predator abundance and extremely high forage abundance.  Efforts to reshape the community have included centrarchid and walleye stocking since 1909; white sucker and yellow perch removal from 1980-1985; and starting on May 10, 2003, the use of a special regulation to protect northern pike from 24-36 inches from angler harvest.  Efforts to reshape the fish community have provided some very positive benefits.  The 2005 assessment was conducted to collect information to be used with future assessments to evaluate the special regulation on northern pike, walleye stocking, and community balance.          Research has shown that as density of northern pike increases, growth of northern pike decreases.  Since the last investigation on Ash Lake density has decreased, and mean weight and growth rate have increased.   Northern pike gill-net abundance (3.67 fish/set) remained above the median of 3.18 fish/set for class 5 lakes, as it has for the previous 15 years.  However, abundance in 2005 was the lowest it has been since 1989.  Eight year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-8 years.  The 2002 year-class represented 47% of the sample.  Average length was 24.6 inches with a range from 12.8 to 33.0.  Growth rate has improved since the previous survey.  Length at age 4 was 24.7 inches (22.9 inches in 2002), which was greater than the statewide median of 20.5 inches.  The mean weight of northern pike captured in gill nets has increased from 2.88 pounds in 2002 to 3.54 pounds in 2005.     Walleye gill-net abundance was 1.44 fish/set, which was below what is found in most class 5 lakes and quite disappointing considering the stocking rate was increased to three pounds per littoral acre in 2003.  Six year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-24 years.  Total length ranged from 8.7-27.1 inches and the mean was 15.9.  Mean weight was 0.61 pounds heavier than the median (1.27) for class 5 lakes.       Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 11.22 fish/set, which was below the third quartile of 14.13.  A large decrease from the 2002 investigation (107.22 fish/set), in which abundance was approaching levels observed in the late 1970s and early 1980s that prompted a fish removal project.  Total length ranged from 5.6-11.4 inches and the average was 7.5.  Average weight was equal to the third quartile for class 5 lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ash Lake is a moderately clear 669 acre lake located 13 miles north of Orr, MN. Management efforts on this lake have primarily been directed toward Northern Pike and Walleye. Ash has a long history of Walleye stocking, and has had special regulations for Northern Pike since 2003. There has been a positive trend in the population structure of Northern Pike since the implementation of this regulation. Fish species sampled during the 2013 survey included Black Crappie, Bluegill, Golden Shiner, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates were slightly above the median for similar lakes, as was the average weight for these fish. Fish up to 12 inches were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates were high and the average weight of these fish was also slightly higher than Bluegill in similar lakes. Fish up to 10.5 inches were sampled. The growth rate of Bluegill is average for Area lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates were within the expected range for similar lakes. Since the 2003 implementation of a 24-36 inch protected slot, Northern Pike growth rates and mean length have increased. The population structure has greatly improved since the protected slot was implemented as average fish are nearly 6 pounds and over 29 inches. For comparison, the assessment in 2002 showed an average Pike prior to implementation of the protected slot was 22.5 inches and less than 3 pounds. There is also potential to catch trophy fish as Pike over 38 inches were sampled during this survey.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were sampled by electrofishing and the catch rates indicate that there are high numbers, and growth is slightly less than average for International Falls Management Area lakes. Average weight was 0.5 pounds and average length was 9.4 inches. There are a few bigger fish present though as a 19 inch individual was sampled by gill net. <br> \n <br> \nAngling for Walleye should be good as catch rates were much higher than the last survey in 2008, and are the highest seen since the 1980's. A good natural reproduction year class in 2010, and two successful stocked year classes in 2007 and 2011 have helped increase Walleye abundance. Average length was just over 16 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are very abundant in comparison to similar lakes. The average length for sampled fish is 5.39 inches but fish up to 10.2 inches were caught.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike numbers were about par for Ash Lake with the average northern measuring 23.7 inches and weighing 3.4 pounds.  Pike over 36 inches were seen in the 1998 survey.    Bluegill and black crappie numbers remained good with average lengths of 7.8 and 6.0 inches respectively.  Yellow perch and smallmouth bass numbers were much higher than expected, however, they tended to be small, averaging 7.0 and 7.7 inches respectively.</p>",
