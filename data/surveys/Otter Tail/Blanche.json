                "narrative": "<p>     Blanche Lake is a 1,228-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately four miles northeast of Battle Lake, MN.  An inlet from Annie Battle Lake is located on the southwest shoreline and an outlet to Otter Tail Lake is located on the north shoreline. The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwood woodlots.  Blanche Lake has a maximum depth of 64 feet; however,   82% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2010 survey was 8.9 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 9.0 feet.     <br> \n     Moderate development exists primarily along the northwest, north, and northeast shorelines.  Four resorts and 133 homes/cabins were located along the shoreline during the 2000 lake survey.  A state owned public water access is located along the north shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush and common cattail) is prevalent throughout the southern portion of the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Blanche Lake can be ecologically classified as a walleye-centrarchid type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in Blanche Lake.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.6 to 22.9 inches with an average length and weight of 13.9 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.9 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Bass reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 7.2 to 17.8 inches with an average length and weight of 12.5 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 13.0 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     The black crappie population is dominated by the 2004 and 2007 year classes.  Size structure is good with 41% of the trap net sample measuring 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 10.0 inches at five years of age.      <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has remained at a moderate level in recent surveys.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegill size structure is also good as 37% of the trap net sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake has enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Pike reproduction appears to be excellent as the sample consisted of fish ages-I+ through V+.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance declined from 105.2 per trap net lift in the 1986 survey to 72.6, but remains well above the area net catch median.  Thirteen percent of the bluegills were greater than 7.0 inches in length.   <br> \n     Largemouth bass reproduction appears to be good as the sample consisted of fish ages-I+ through IV+.  Smallmouth bass have not been sampled since the 1972 survey.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance was 3.2 per net, which is similar to previous surveys but well below the area net catch median.  Walleye abundance has increased from 1.7 per gill net lift in the 1972 survey to 4.2 per net.  Average weight of individual walleye increased from 1.2 pounds in 1986 to 1.6 pounds.  Although age data from previous surveys have indicated walleye natural reproduction occurs, recent fingerling stockings make it difficult to assess reproduction at this time. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blanche Lake is a 1,228-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County, approximately four miles northeast of the city of Battle Lake. MN.  It has a maximum depth of 64 feet and 82% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 9.0 feet.  Readings from previous surveys ranged from 6.5 to 9.0 feet.  An inlet from Annie Battle Lake is located on the southwest shoreline and an outlet to Otter Tail Lake is located on the north shoreline.  A DNR public water access is located on the north side of the lake.       Moderate development exists around the lake, primarily along the northwest, north, and northeast shorelines.  Four resorts and 133 homes/cabins were located along the shoreline during the 2000 lake survey.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush and common cattail) is located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Blanche Lake contains decent populations of all game fish.  Northern pike population characteristics have demonstrated stability over the past three surveys.  Northern pike abundance has remained at a moderate density and reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 5.3 to 26.6 inches with an average length and weight of 16.6 inches and 0.9 pounds.       The bluegill population has also remained fairly stable.  A good number of fish present are seven inches or greater in length (23%) and reproduction appears to be consistently good.       Walleye abundance has remained at a moderate density in recent surveys.  Eight year classes were represented in the walleye sample.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.3 to 19.4 inches with an average length and weight of 13.0 inches and 0.8 pounds.  To supplement the walleye population produced by natural reproduction, the DNR stocks walleye fry on a biennial basis.     Anglers can  maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blanche Lake is a 1,228-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately four miles northeast of the city of Battle Lake, MN.  It has a maximum depth of 64 feet and 82% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 6.5 feet in 2005.  Readings from previous surveys ranged from 6.5 to 9.0 feet.  An inlet from Annie Battle Lake is located on the southwest shoreline and an outlet to Otter Tail Lake is located on the north shoreline.  A DNR public water access is located on the north side of the lake.       Moderate development exists around the lake, primarily along the northwest, north, and northeast shorelines.  Four resorts and 133 homes/cabins were located along the shoreline during the 2000 lake survey.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush and common cattail) is located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Blanche Lake contains decent populations of all game fish.  Northern pike population characteristics have demonstrated stability over the past four surveys.  Northern pike abundance has remained at a moderate density and reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 9.8 to 27.3 inches with an average length and weight of 16.5 inches and 1.1 pounds.       The bluegill population has remained fairly stable over the past three surveys.  A good number of fish present are seven inches or greater in length (39%) and reproduction appears to be consistently good.     Populations of black crappie and largemouth bass are also good in Blanche Lake, primarily due to adequate spawning habitat that exists for these species to maintain good numbers on their own.     Walleye abundance has remained at a moderate density in recent surveys.  Eight year classes were represented in the walleye sample.  Walleye ranged in length from 11.5 to 29.0 inches with an average length and weight of 15.1 inches and 1.3 pounds.  To supplement the walleye population produced by natural reproduction, the DNR stocks walleye fry on a biennial basis.     Anglers can  maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Blanche Lake is a 1,228-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately four miles northeast of Battle Lake, MN.  An inlet from Annie Battle Lake is located on the southwest shoreline and an outlet to Otter Tail Lake is located on the north shoreline. The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwood woodlots.  Blanche Lake has a maximum depth of 64 feet; however,   82% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2015 survey was 6.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 9.0 feet.     <br> \n     Moderate development exists along the northwest, north, and northeast shorelines.  Four resorts and 133 homes/cabins were located along the shoreline during the 2000 lake survey.  A state owned public water access is located along the north shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush and common cattail) is prevalent throughout the southern portion of the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Blanche Lake can be ecologically classified as a Walleye-centrarchid type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in Blanche Lake.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.3 to 18.6 inches with an average length and weight of 15.1 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.0 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Catch and length data indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 6.3 to 15.2 inches.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 10.7 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has remained at a moderate level in recent surveys.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegill size structure is also good as 35% of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.4 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake has enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",
