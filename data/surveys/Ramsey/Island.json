Catch of other species was recorded, but is not discusses in detail in this report.   <br> \n <br> \nIsland Lake is a popular angling lake.  It is located just south of Interstate 494 at Victoria St in Shoreview.  There is a public boat launch and fishing pier, plus many areas to fish along shore.  Much of the shoreline is in a Ramsey County Park.  The park has excellent facilities for parking, picnics, bathrooms, and a playgound. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are the most abundant species present, but there are a variety of species present.  Other species sampled were: walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, channel catfish, pumkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, yellow perch, black crappie, black bullhead, carp, white sucker, and golden shiner. <br> \n</p>",

Both bluegill and northern pike should be considered to be present in average numbers.  Northern pike were aged as II annulus fish.  It is doubtful that northern pike were present prior to the 1979 fingerling stocking.  These fish aged as II annulus were more than likely misaged and actually represent the 1979 stocking or I annulus fish.  Bass were aged at I, II, III, and V annulus fish.  Bass were stocked in each corresponding year, but it is impossible to tell if any of these fish were the result of stocking or natural reproduction.  The exception is the V annulus fish, which is more than likely stocked.  Bullhead numbers appear little different than the 1979 netting, nor do the bluegill numbers.  Crappie catches in 1980 were twice as high as in 1979 as were pumpkinseed.  Sizes for these species appear little changed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a hard-water lake of 48.7 acres.  It has a maximum depth of 9 feet and a median depth of 5 feet.  The total area of the lake has been reduced somewhat since the time of the lake mapping by a new highway which intersects the north end of the lake dividing the lake into two separate bodies of water.  A channel has been constructed between these two bodies of water to provide boat accessibility from lake to lake.A county-owned pumping station is present at the picnic area on the southeast shore of the lake.  This pump is put into operation when the lake level falls below the \"0\" mark on the lake level gauge.A short intermittent inlet from a local marsh is present on the northeast shore.  There are no outlets present.The shoal water bottom of the lake consisted of 60% sand, 30% mud, and 10% mixed sand and mud at the time of the survey.Submerged pondweeds were scattered along much of the shoreline and Canada waterweed was abundant in the shallow north portion of the lake.  Various Sagittaria species were abundant in some locations along the shoreline.A secchi disk reading of 1.0 foot at the time of the survey indicated that the lake was quite turbid.The test net catches indicated that there were good populations of bullheads, sunfish, and crappies and a fair population of northern pike present in the lake at the time of the survey.Spawning conditions were considered to be poor for northern pike and walleyes, and good for largemouth bass, sunfish, and crappies, and shoal water seining indicated that good natural reproduction of sunfish had occurred in 1960. Local residents reported that very little fishing has taken place on Island Lake during the past 5 years, and that sunfish fishing has been fair, but the fish are small.The lake is known to have winterkilled occasionally in past years.Because of Island Lake's overall shallowness the lake is in danger of annual winterkills and therefore fry or fingerling stocking would probably not be practical.  However, some stocking of adult panfish following severe winterkills would provide some fishing for these species during the ensuing months.  Some deepening of the lake by dredging would lessen winterkill occurrence and would improve the fish habitat of Islane Lake.</p>",

Black crappie were captured in moderate numbers, with an average length of 7.9 inches and a number of fish between 8 and 9 inches.  The largemouth bass population is in good shape.  The electrofishing catch rate was high (83 fish/hour).  Lengths ranged from 4 to 19.5 inches, with 45% over 12 inches and 15% over 16 inches.  Northern pike and walleye were both sampled in low numbers.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 24 to 30 inches.   The walleyes ranged from 21 to 26 inches.  One 34.5 inch tiger muskie was captured - they have been stocked occasionally since 1988.  Yellow perch and channel catfish have also been stocked annually since 1996.  Both were sampled in moderate numbers.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 6.5 to 8.5 inches, and channel catfish lengths ranged from 9.5 to 17 inches.         </p>",

White sucker, northern pike, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and black crappie were sampled at or above local median levels.  Northern pike are mostly large individuals.  Approximately 57% of the bluegills sampled were 6.0 inches in length or greater.  Survival of stocked walleyes is low probably because of limited forage.  The numbers of black bullheads is significantly less than in 1980 (20.3 fish/trap lift).  Crappie numbers have remained stable, and most are small size.</p>",

Small bluegills and black crappies were very abundant.  Golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed were sampled at above local median rates.  Black bullhead, brown bullhead, and yellow perch were sampled at lower than local median levels.

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a shallow (max depth 12') 60 acre eutrophic water body (Lake Class 42) located in the city of Shoreview in Ramsey County. It consists of two basins bisected by Interstate 694. Much of the north basin (20 acres) is developed with single family homes. Island Lake County Park owns most of the shoreline of the southern basin (40acres). The lake level in 2009 was 3 feet below the ordinary high water level. Island Lake has one small public boat launch located on the northwest corner of the south basin. Boat launching and parking can be a challenge at Island Lake as there are only 5 parking spaces available. A fishing pier was installed in 1990 and is located near the boat launch in the county park. Island Lake is prone to winter kill and a winter aeration system has been operated since in 1975. Eurasian Water-milfoil is present in the lake and it can be extremely abundant and dense during low water years which can effect boating and make shore angling difficult.  <br> \nAlthough Bluegills were the most abundant species in Island Lake, their numbers were below average for this type of lake. The average size found was only 5.0 inches with only a few sampled that were larger than 6 inches. Other sunfish species seen in the survey gear were Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish, both of which were not very abundant and were small in size. Black Crappies were found in moderate to low numbers and were generally small size also.  Averaging 24 inches Northern Pike were found in above average abundance. Sampled in lower abundance than in previous years, three Channel Catfish were examined and had an average size of almost 19 inches. Channel Catfish provide a fishing opportunity to catch a larger species for shore/pier based anglers.  Other fish sampled in low abundance were: Yellow Perch (N=9), Largemouth Bass (N=3), White Sucker (N=1) and Golden Shiner (N=1). <br> \n</p>",
