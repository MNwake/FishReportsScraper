                "narrative": "<p>Razor is a small, clear, soft water lake in eastern Pine County.  Lakes having these physical attributes are assigned lake class 20.  Lacking a public access, fishing pressure on Razor Lake is limited.  The 2008 assessment was fairly typical compared to both historical data and other class 20 lakes.  However, the black crappie catch rate in both the gill nets and trap nets (1.3 and 0.3 respectively) was below the previous rate and the lake class norm.  Northern pike abundance, at 7.7/gill net, was similar to the 2003 catch and near the 75th  percentile for lakes in Razor's class.  Gill netted northerns averaged 20.1 inches and ranged from 15.4 to 31.1 inches with a 2.1 pound mean.  With a catch rate of 59.3 per trap net, the bluegill catch was up since the 2003 assessment and above the normal range.  While a fourth of the bluegill exceeded 7 inches, only 3% of the catch was over 8 inches.  Largemouth bass were sampled by night electro-fishing in May of 2008.  The catch rate of 49.5 bass per hour was higher than in previous samples and a substantial rate for the management area.  Bass were very similar in size to those previously measured in Razor Lake, averaging 11.1 inches and 0.7 pounds with a range from 8.1 to 15.1 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  On June 14, 1993, a lake survey was conducted on Razor Lake (lake class 20).  Standard netting and electrofishing methods were used to evaluate the present fish population status.  Additional fish sampling also included a mark/recapture population estimate.  Razor Lake is managed for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish, however, little can be done (in the way of management) due to the lake's small size and the lack of an official public access.  There has been no stocking in over 30 years.  The lake sustains itself well without stocking.  Northern pike abundance was high for this lake type with fish up to 29.1 inches captured.  The average size was 20.0 inches weighing about 1.8 pounds apiece.  Ages 1-7 were sampled with most being age 2-4.  Growth rates were normal.  Largemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing during the spring.  Their abundance was high with the average size being 10.3 inches.  Ages 2-8 were sampled with growth being slower than normal.  The bluegill abundance was very high with fish ranging from 3.1 to 7.4 inches.  The average size was 5.2 inches weighing 0.1 pounds.  Bluegills in Razor Lake grow slower than normal.  Black crappie abundance was low during summer test netting but spring netting showed a fair population ranging from 7.0 to 13.9 inches.  The average length was 10.0 inches.  Only 1 yellow perch was caught by all sampling methods.  The pumpkinseed abundance was very high with fish ranging from 4.4 to 8.2 inches.  The average length was 6.2 inches.  The remainder of the fish population consisted of brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and white sucker.  The bullhead abundance levels were high and the white sucker levels were low for this lake type.  Prepared by:  Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

Lacking a public access, fishing pressure on Razor Lake is limited.  The 2003 assessment was fairly typical compared to both historical data and other class 20 lakes.  The black crappie catch rate of 2.33 per gillnet was higher than the previous rate but similar to the lake class norm.  Northern pike at 8.3/gillnet were less abundant than in 1993 catch, but still higher than most lakes in Razors class.  Crappie and northerns averaged 8.3 and 19.8 inches respectively.  With a catch rate of 25.6 per trapnet, the bluegill catch was down from the record high of 80.4 in 1993, but very near the lake class median.  While more than half of the bluegill exceeded 6.5 inches, only one individual was over 8 inches.  Largemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing in May of 2003.  The catch rate of 34.8 bass per hour was similar to the 1993 rate and certainly respectable.  Bass averaged 11.6 inches and 0.8 pounds with a ranged from 5.4 to 15.4 inches.  Fall shoreline seining found young of the year bass, bluegill, and perch present.  </p>",
