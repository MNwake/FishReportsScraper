                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah has a remarkable population of northern pike.  Ample spawning habitat is available causing high reproduction and abundance.  The average size of pike captured was 3.9 pounds with 24% over 30 inches in length.Many fisherman are targeting bluegills and crappies on this lake.  Bluegill are very abundant and average 6.2 inches.  Good sized pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish contribute to the fishery.  Crappies are less abundant but average an excellent 8 inches.As in the last 10 years, yellow perch are not especially abundant for a lake of this type; but are slightly larger (7 inches) than in past surveys.  Perch, along with bullheads and golden shiners, are likely making a strong forage base for the large pike population.The largemouth bass population is improving in numbers and in size.  Largemouth bass may be an increasingly targeted species on Lake Sarah.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sarah is a productive 561-acre lake located near the town of Rockford in Hennepin County.  There is a township owned public boat access on the southwest shore of the west basin.  Lake Sarah is primarily managed for northern pike fishing and secondarily for bluegill and largemouth bass, although the lake supports a substantial crappie fishery as well. <br> \n <br> \nLake Sarah has a quality northern pike fishery as indicated by an abundant population with an extended size structure.  Gill net catch averaged 7.1 per net which is high for similar lakes in the state, although catch is down from the 2001 assessment (10.4 per gill net).  Average size was high at 28.1 inches and 5.3 pounds and the largest fish measured was 38.7 inches and 13.2 pounds.  Both mean length and weight are greater than the previous assessment (25.4 inches, 3.9 pounds), which could be a result of the lower abundance.  Forty-eight percent of northern pike were greater than 28 inches and 18% were greater than 34 inches.  Most age classes (1 - 7) of northern pike exhibited faster than average growth compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area.  Northern pike averaged 23 inches at 3 years of age.   <br> \n <br> \nBoth black and white crappie are present in Lake Sarah.  Black crappie are more abundant and, during the summer netting, tended to be captured more offshore in gill nets (33.1/gill net) relative to inshore in trap nets (12.1/trap net).  Gill net catch (16.5/net) was high compared to similar lakes in the state and was more than 4 times higher than the 2001 assessment (7.67/gill net).  Trap net catch (12.1/net) was moderately high and was twice as high as the previous assessment (6.0/trap net).  Mean length and weight for black crappie was 7.6 inches and 0.2 pounds and the largest was 10.1 inches and 0.5 pounds.  Approximately 41% of black crappie sampled were 8 inches or longer with relatively few over 10 inches.  Growth of black crappie (ages 1 - 12) was slower than average for similar lakes in the West Metro Area.  The white crappie population has expanded as well, 37 were sampled in 2007 and only 2 were collected in 2001.  White crappie were captured at a rate of 1.8 per trap net and 2.9 per gill net which was near median levels for both gears in the state.  Average length and weight of white crappie were 8.3 inches and 0.3 pounds and the largest was 14.0 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Approximately 69% of white crappie were 8 inches or longer and 20% were 10 inches or longer.  White crappie growth was slow for ages 1 and 2, then increased to average for the remainder of year classes (3 - 6).    <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was moderately high in both gill net (31.3/gill net) and trap net (54.4/trap net) catches.  Average bluegill size was 5.9 inches and 0.15 pounds with the largest measuring 8.0 inches and 0.4 pounds.  Approximately 55% were 6 inches or longer.  Other panfish sampled were yellow perch, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish.  Similar to recent surveys, yellow perch were sampled in moderately low numbers (5.5/gill net).  Mean length of yellow perch was 7.1 inches and mean weight was 0.2 pounds with the largest fish reaching 9.3 inches and 0.4 pounds.  Pumpkinseed (n = 9) and hybrid sunfish (n = 3) were low in abundance as has been the case historically.  Growth of bluegill (ages 1 - 10) was slower than average compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area.   <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gear, such as trap nets and gill nets, is not an effective method of collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments and this was not conducted during this survey.  However, 10 largemouth bass were collected ranging in size from 5 to 19.1 inches and weighing 0.04 to 3.4 pounds, 30% were greater than 15 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nGolden shiners may be an important prey fish for the predators in this lake and their abundance has increased since 2001.  This may be a strong factor in the quality of the northern pike population.  Rough fish sampled include bowfin (dogfish), yellow bullhead, black bullhead, and common carp.  Bowfin abundance is high and is considered high compared to other lakes in the state.  Yellow bullhead numbers are down from the previous assessment but remain moderately high.  Black bullhead abundance is similar to previous years and remains very low compared to other lakes in the state.  Common carp numbers are low and similar to previous years. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah is a productive 561-acre lake located southeast of Rockford in Hennepin County.  There is a township-owned public boat access on the southwest shore of the west basin.  Lake Sarah is primarily managed for Northern Pike fishing and secondarily for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass, although the lake supports a substantial crappie fishery as well.  Walleye, privately stocked since 2006, are now established at low levels.   <br> \n <br> \nMaximum depth is 59 ft and water clarity in July was 2.0 ft.  Mid-summer oxygen readings indicated the lake was strongly stratified with poor (<2 ppm) dissolved oxygen below 12 feet.  Low oxygen levels (starting at depths as shallow as 10 ft) during summer stratification may influence fish location and behavior.  A population assessment consisting of summer gill nets and fall trap nets was conducted in 2013 to characterize the game fish community in Lake Sarah.  Nighttime electrofishing was also conducted in the fall to assess the Largemouth Bass population.    <br> \n <br> \nLake Sarah has maintained its quality Northern Pike fishery, as reflected by an abundant population with an extended size structure.  One hundred fourteen pike were sampled (12.7/gill net).  Relative abundance was greater than the 75th percentile value (7.3/gill net) based on similar lakes.  Northern Pike numbers have fluctuated over the previous 4 assessments, dating back to 1996, where abundance ranged from 0.89 to 18.6/net.  Pike from 15.9 to 36.1 inches were sampled this survey and size structure was skewed toward larger fish.  Seventy-nine percent were 21 inches or longer and 16 percent were 28 inches or longer.  The average Northern Pike was 24.1 inches and 3.3 lbs.  Mean weight was near the 75th percentile (3.5 lbs) based on other similar lakes.  Both mean length and weight were smaller than the previous assessment (2007) where fish averaged 28.1 inches and 5.3 lbs; however abundance was lower in 2007 (7.1/net).  Northern Pike grew fast through age 5.  Fish were 21.9 inches by age 3 and 26.1 inches by age 6.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry or fingerlings have been privately stocked by the Lake Sarah Improvement Association on a yearly basis since 2006 (except 2009).  Despite this, abundance is low at 1.0/gill net.  Fish from the 2008 (age 5), 2010 (age 3), and 2011 (age 2) year classes were equally present.  All three of these year classes were stocked as fingerlings.  No fish from the fry-stocked 2006 or 2007 year classes were present.  Walleye ranged from 11.6 - 22.8 inches, averaging 17.9 inches and 2.2 lbs.  Mean weight was slightly heavier than the median of Walleye in other similar lakes.  Walleye grew fast compared to other lakes in the West Metro Area, reaching 17.1 inches by age 3.  It is often difficult to establish Walleye in lakes with high-density Northern Pike populations, such as Lake Sarah.  Lack of recruitment caused by Northern Pike predation may be limiting the quality of the Walleye fishery, but the surviving fish appear to be growing well.  Future assessments will help monitor the success of the Walleye stocking efforts.       <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was conducted in late September to assess the adult Largemouth Bass population in Lake Sarah.  Ninety-seven bass were sampled-a rate of 54.0/hour.  Relative abundance (54.0/hr) was slightly above average when compared to other similarly sampled West Metro lakes over the past two years (5 lakes, average= 45.8/hr, range = 18.6  102.3/hr).  Lake Sarah Largemouth Bass size ranged from 6.5 to 16.9 inches, averaging 11.0 inches and 0.8 lbs.  The size structure was balanced with 42 percent of sampled fish 12 inches or longer and 6 percent 15 inches or longer.  The 2009 (age 4) and 2010 (age 3) year classes were most abundant, 24 percent and 45 percent of the total, respectively. Largemouth Bass had good growth rates.  Most age classes (ages 2-8) had rates above or near the average compared to other lakes in the West Metro Area.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were moderately abundant in Lake Sarah (24.5/trap net).  The catch rate was near the median when compared to other similar lakes.  Bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 8.3 inches, averaging 6.4 inches and 0.2 lbs.  Size structure was skewed towards larger fish.  Fifty-six percent were relatively evenly distributed between 6.0 and 7.5 inches.  Twelve percent were between 7.5 and 8.5 inches.  Bluegill grew fast, reaching 5.3 inches by age 3 and 7.6 inches by age 7.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack and White crappie are present in Lake Sarah.  Black Crappie were the most abundant in the 2013 assessment, sampled at a rate of 13.8/gill net.  Numbers were lower than the previous assessment in 2007 (33.1/gill net) but were still near the 75th percentile (16.5/gill net) compared to other similar lakes.  Black Crappie ranged from 4.9 to 11.1 inches, averaging 7.3 inches and 0.2 lbs.  Mean weight was near the 75th percentile (0.3 lbs). The size structure was balanced and included a moderate abundance of larger fish.  Thirty-three percent were 8 inches or longer and 7 percent were 10 inches or longer.  Growth was faster than average.  Black Crappie were 7.7 inches by age 3 and 10.1 inches by age 7. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappie density is considered low at 1.0/gill net.  However, of the 6 fish sampled, all but one were longer than 9.0 inches.  White Crappie ranged from 5.5 to 12.0 inches, averaging 10.0 inches and 0.5 lbs.  Mean weight was above the 75th percentile (0.3) based on similar lakes.      <br> \n <br> \nGolden Shiners and Yellow Perch have increased since the last assessment.  Golden Shiners increased from 3.8/net in 2007 to 4.4/net in 2013.  Yellow Perch abundance (15.9/gill net) was considerably higher than the previous assessment in 2007 (5.5/gill net) and greater than the average over the previous 4 assessments (1991-2007, 3.5/gill net).  The size structure was skewed towards smaller-sized fish; however, a few larger fish were sampled as well.  Twenty-two percent were 8 inches or larger and the largest was 9.8 inches and 0.2 lbs.  Growth was fast compared to other similar lakes.  Perch were 6.3 inches by age 3 and 8.7 inches by age 7.  The high numbers of Yellow Perch and Golden Shiners provide abundant forage for many of the predatory species in the lake.  These forage species may play a significant role in the health of the Northern Pike population. <br> \n <br> \nRough fish in the survey included Bowfin (Dogfish), Yellow Bullhead, Black Bullhead, and Common Carp.  Other sunfish species included hybrid sunfish and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n</p>",

The average size of northern pike captured was 22.7 inches and 2.9 pounds. Individuals up to 36.5 inches were sampled during the survey. A total of 19.5% of the entire sample of northern pike were over 25.0 inches.Bluegills were the most sought after species by anglers during the survey. Over 30% of the bluegills sampled in the nets were 7 inches and over. The average size fish was 6.1 inches long. Both black and white crappies are present in this lake. The average size of these two species was found to be 7.0 inches for black crappies and 7.6 inches for white crappies. Pumpkinseed sunfish are also present but average only 5.4 inches in length.All three species of bullheads native to Minnesota were sampled. Black and brown bullheads were found in low abundance. Yellow bullheads were sampled at normal levels and above average sizes.Yellow perch were sampled within normal ranges for this type of lake. The average size captured, 6.6 inches, make excellent forage for the northern pike population.Largemouth bass are also present within the normal range. Individuals up to 17.3 inches were sampled. Excellent habitat exists throughout the lake for this species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah is a 561-acre lake with a maximum depth of 59 feet, located southeast of Rockford, in western Hennepin County. Sarah is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike, and also holds healthy populations of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Yellow Bullhead, and Walleye. Walleye have been stocked privately since 2006.  In 2021, a reduced possession limit, of 5 each, for Bluegill and crappies was implemented on Lake Sarah.  This is part of the statewide \"Quality Sunfish Initiative\" (https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/sunfish/index.html).   <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (trap nets and gill nets) was done on Lake Sarah during the week of 7/18/22. During the survey, water clarity was 2.5 feet, with low oxygen below 13 feet. Eurasian Watermilfoil remains present in Lake Sarah. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers in Lake Sarah were high, with 10.3 fish caught per gill net. Average size of Northern Pike was 25.0 inches, with the largest measured at 36.6 inches. Fish age-2 through age-9 were present in the sample, showing consistent reproduction in this population.   <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing for Largemouth Bass was not done in 2022.  The previous sampling for bass in 2017 yielded 92 fish at a rate of 52.2 fish per hour.  That catch rate is similar to the previous sampling's (2013) rate of 54.0 fish per hour.  These similar catch rates suggest a bass population that is consistent in its abundance over time.  In 2017, Lake Sarah Largemouth Bass size ranged from 5.4 to 19.7 inches, averaging 11.6 inches and 1.15 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were captured at an average rate (3.1/net) compared to similar lakes throughout the state. As of the 2017 survey, the Walleye population in Lake Sarah is primarily made up of large individuals, with an average size of 20.9 inches and 3.22 pounds, with the largest measured at 25.6 inches. Walleye grow fast in Lake Sarah, reaching 18.4 inches by age-3. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets (44.6/net) and trap nets (18.3/net) - at a higher than average catch rate relative to similar lakes. Gill-netted Black Crappie averaged 7.0 inches, trap-netted Black Crappie averaged 6.8 inches, and the largest fish measured at 10.4 inches. Twenty-eight percent of the Black Crappie sampled by both types of nets were larger than 8.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled with trap nets at a rate (42.9/net) similar to historical catches, which have ranged from 18-57 fish/net. Bluegill averaged 5.6 inches, with the largest measured at 8.7 inches. Approximately 18% of sampled fish were greater than 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullheads are an underutilized resource in Lake Sarah despite high numbers of quality-sized fish. Yellow Bullhead numbers were very high, at 40.3 fish per net. Average size of Yellow Bullheads in the 2022 survey was 11.8 inches, with the largest measured at 15.6 inches.  Eight-seven percent of the sampled fish were larger than 10 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed in lower abundances in this survey include Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Golden Shiner, and Green Sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted in Sarah Lake on August 1-2, 2018 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations. A 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations and a 15-foot seine was used to sample five stations. Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including one species that is intolerant of habitat disturbance (Iowa Darter) and one tolerant species (Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Sarah Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah is a 561-acre lake with a maximum depth of 59 feet, located southeast of Rockford, in western Hennepin County. Sarah is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike, but includes catchable populations of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Yellow Bullhead, and Walleye. Walleyes have been stocked privately since 2006. A Standard Survey (trap nets and gill nets) was conducted on Lake Sarah during the week of 7/17/17. During the survey, water clarity was 3.5 feet, with low oxygen below 10 feet. Eurasian Watermilfoil also remains present in Lake Sarah. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 52.2 fish per hour, similar numbers to the previous survey (54.0 fish/hour). Largemouth Bass averaged 11.6 inches with the largest measuring 19.7 inches, while 18% of fish sampled were over 15 inches. Growth was average compared to similar lakes across the state. The Largemouth Bass population in Lake Sarah is healthy, with many year classes of fish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers in Lake Sarah were high, with 10.1/net. Average size of Northern Pike in gill nets was 19.7 inches, with the largest measured at 37.2 inches. Despite some large fish, 76% of the total catch were age-2 (20.9 inches) and age-3 (23.5 inches) individuals. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were captured at a typical rate (2.4/net) compared to similar lakes throughout the state. As of the 2017 survey, the Walleye population in Lake Sarah is primarily made up of large individuals, with an average size of 19.7 inches, with the largest measured at 23.8 inches. Walleye grow fast in Lake Sarah, reaching 17 inches by age-3. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets (11.3/net) and trap nets (3.3/net) -- near the expected catch rate of similar lakes. Black Crappie averaged 6.7 inches, with the largest measured at 10.2 inches. The majority of sampled fish were identified from two year classes: age-2 (37%), and age-3 (39%) fish. These two large year classes should support angling opportunity in the future. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled with trap nets at a rate (38.7/net) similar to historical catches, which have ranged from 18-57 fish/net. Bluegill averaged 5.3 inches, with the largest measured at 8.3 inches. Approximately 21% of sampled fish were greater than 7 inches. Lake Sarah consistently provides both ice and open water angling opportunity for Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullheads are an underutilized resource in Lake Sarah despite high numbers of quality-sized fish. Yellow Bullhead numbers were high (42.6/net), over six times the catch rate expected for similar lakes. Average size of Yellow Bullheads in the 2017 survey was 11.5 inches, with the largest measured at 15.4 inches. <br> \n</p>",
