                "narrative": "<p>A fish resurvey of Long Lake was conducted in June of 2005. Long is a small (286 acres) and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 46 feet. Residential development (103 homes/cabins) has occurred around the entire lake with the exception of some south shoreline areas. There are four resort/campgrounds located adjacent to Long. Hardwoods and adjacent wetlands are the dominant cover types within the immediate watershed. Nutrient runoff is limited primarily to residential lawn runoff. The outlet connects to the Middle Fork of the Crow Reservoir. There are two public access sites adjacent to the lake. Emergent vegetation (waterlilies, bulrush, cattails, wild rice) is abundant in Long, especially in bay areas and south shoreline areas. Submergent vegetation (muskgrass, coontail, various pondweed species) is abundant in the lake. Shoalwater substrates are primarily sand, gravel, detritus, muck, and rubble. Water quality and clarity (secchi=16.2 feet) are excellent for Long Lake. An experimental regulation was implemented for bass (12 inch maximum size limit) in 1997 as part of a statewide research study. A public meeting was held at the end of the 2005 fishing season to get public input whether the regulation should remain, be changed, or discontinued. The DNR decided to change the bass regulation in December of 2005 to a DNR state toolbox regulation (a 12 inch maximum size limit with one bass over 20 inches allowed). The new bass regulation will be in effect on May 27, 2006. Long is a popular fishing lake for largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and northern pike. Anglers also seek walleye occasionally in Long Lake. Largemouth bass numbers were high in the 2005 spring electrofishing survey (71.19 fish/hour) compared to the Spicer Area average catch rate (47.20 fish/hour). The Long Lake historical average catch rate is 69.50 fish/hour. The 2005 largemouth bass average size was small (0.76 pounds and 10.6 inches) and similar to the historical average (0.77 pounds) from spring electrofishing. The 2005 catch rate of preferred size (15.0 inches) and larger largemouth bass (5.82 fish/hour) was high, but similar to the historical average (5.39 fish/hour). Largemouth bass growth rates in Long Lake were below the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2002 year class comprised 29% of the 2005 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch. The largest largemouth bass captured was 19.6 inches from 2005 spring electrofishing.Black crappie numbers were low in 2005 (0.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 1.61 fish/gillnet for Long. The 2005 black crappie average size was small (0.14 pounds and 6.1 inches) from gillnets.

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Long Lake was conducted in mid-July of 2018. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nLong is a small (286 acres) and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 46 feet. Residential development (110 homes/cabins, 2013 resurvey) has occurred around the entire lake with the exception of some south shoreline areas. There are three resort/campgrounds located adjacent to Long Lake. Hardwoods and adjacent wetlands are the dominant cover types within the immediate watershed. Nutrient runoff is limited primarily residential lawn runoff. The outlet connects to the Middle Fork Crow Reservoir. There are two public access sites adjacent to the lake. Emergent vegetation (i.e. water lilies, bulrush, cattails, and wild rice) is abundant in Long, especially in bay and south shoreline areas. Submergent vegetation (i.e. muskgrass, coontail, various pondweed species) is abundant in the lake. Shoalwater substrates are primarily sand, gravel, detritus, muck, and rubble. Water quality is good (total phosphorus=0.013 ppm, 6-10-2013) in Long Lake. Water clarity (secchi=14.0 feet) was excellent on July 9, 2018 for Long Lake. Dissolved oxygen levels were above 5.0 ppm down to 21 feet deep during the survey.  An experimental regulation was implemented for bass (12 inch maximum size limit) in 1997 as part of a statewide research study. A public meeting was held at the end of the 2005 fishing season to get public input whether the regulation should remain, be changed, or discontinued. The DNR decided to change the bass regulation in December 2005 to a DNR state toolbox regulation (a 12 inch maximum size limit with one bass over 20 inches allowed). The new bass regulation took effect on May 27, 2006. This regulation was monitored, and a public meeting was held at the end of September 2011 to get public input regarding the special regulation on bass. The DNR decided to change the bass regulation in December 2011 (all Largemouth Bass from 14 inches to 20 inches to be immediately released with one bass over 20 inches allowed in possession). The new bass regulation took effect May 26, 2012 and is in effect through 2020. Long is a popular fishing lake for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Black Crappie, and Northern Pike. Anglers also seek Walleye occasionally.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass was not surveyed by pre-spawn night spring electrofishing in 2018, but will be surveyed in 2019. Largemouth Bass were abundant in the most recent spring night electrofishing in 2016 (92.00 fish/hour). The Long Lake historical average catch rate is 74.03 fish/hour. The 2016 Largemouth Bass average size was small (0.53 pounds and 8.9 inches) below the historical average (0.74 pounds and 10.47 inches). The 2016 Largemouth Bass catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches and larger) was low (3.00 fish/hour) compared to the historical average (5.17 fish/hour).  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were moderate in 2018 (2.00 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes and the historical average (1.96 fish/trapnet). The 2018 Black Crappie average size was moderate (0.42 pounds and 8.6 inches) from trapnets. The 2015 year class comprised 40% of the 2018 Black Crappie catch from gillnets and trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were moderate in 2018 (5.75 fish /gillnet) compared to similar lakes, but above the historical catch rate (4.73 fish/gillnet). The 2018 average size was small (2.24 pounds and 21.5 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike average weight is 2.50 pounds from gillnets. Northern Pike growth rates were below average due in part to limited or a lack of preferred forage species like Yellow Perch, White Sucker and Tullibee. The 2015 and 2014 year classes each comprised 27% of the 2018 Northern Pike gillnet and trapnet catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Long Lake in the North-central Zone are as follows: 10 (Not more than 2 over 26\". All from 22-26\" must be immediately released.) by angling; 10 (only 1 Northern Pike between 22-26\" and 1 over 26\"; or 2 over 26\") by dark house spearing. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was low in 2018 (0.75 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes. The Walleye historical catch rate is 1.40 fish/gillnet. The 2018 Walleye average weight was large (3.80 pounds) from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were moderate. The 2013 year class comprised 67% of the 2018 total Walleye catch. Long Lake is stocked primarily with yearlings and adult Walleye to provide bonus fishing opportunities for anglers. Long Lake was stocked with Walleye in the fall of 2009 (504 yearlings, 252 pounds), 2010 (45 fish, 50 pounds), 2011 (1,162 yearlings, 252 pounds), 2013 (686 yearlings, 298 pounds; 330 fingerlings, 10 pounds), 2015 (179 adults, 234 pounds; 166 yearlings, 53 pounds; 308 fingerlings, 14 pounds), 2016 (169 adults, 255 pounds) and 2018 (16 adults, 21 pounds; 1,356 yearlings, 375 pounds). We do receive occasional local reports of Walleye harvest from Long Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were not captured in the 2018 gillnets, but low numbers were captured in the 2018 trapnets (0.30 fish/trapnet). The Yellow Perch historical catch rates for Long Lake are 1.20 fish/gillnet and 0.22 fish/trapnet. The 2018 Yellow Perch average size was moderate (0.18 pounds and 7.0 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were moderately abundant in 2018 (21.90 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes. The Bluegill average historical catch rate is 41.49 fish/trapnet. The 2018 Bluegill average size was small (0.10 pounds and 4.9 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from trapnets. The 2018 catch rate of preferred size (8.0 inches and larger) Bluegill was low (0.50 fish/trapnet). A few larger Bluegill (>7.0 inches) were captured in the 2018 gillnets. Bluegill growth rates were moderate compared to other area lakes. Local residents and resort guests have reported excellent Bluegill angling success for large sized (>7.0 inches) fish in recent years. Small sized Bluegill were the norm for both survey and angler catches in years prior to the implementation of Largemouth Bass experimental size regulations in 1997. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead numbers were abundant in 2018 trapnets (9.30 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (6.80 fish/trapnet). The 2018 Yellow Bullhead average size was large (0.78 pounds and 11.1 inches) from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Long Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, evaluating the new bass regulation, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Long Lake fishery will be surveyed in 2019 for Largemouth Bass by spring night electrofishing and 2023 for all fish species. The Long Lake experimental regulation will be re-evaluated for continuation, change or removal in 2020. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long is a small lake (286 acres) with a maximum depth of 46 feet. It is characterized bysteep drop-offs from the shoreline to deeper water.  Water clarity and quality (lowphosphorous levels) is excellent. There are a variety of submergent and emergent vegetationspecies present. Aquatic vegetation is most abundant within the shallow south bay. Theimmediate watershed is characterized by mostly hardwoods and red cedar on steep terrainsurrounding the lake. There is one small marsh/bog inlet that enters the lake along thenortheast corner. The outlet (NW corner) flows into the Middle Fork of the Crow River. Thereis a Type C with stop-log water control structure located 200 ft downstream of the lakeoutlet. The lake is highly developed with 185 homes/cabins and 4 resorts located along theshores. A small township public access is located along the northeast shore, and a new statepublic access is located near the outlet (NW shore). Historically, Long has been a popularbass/panfish lake, although, panfish (bluegill, black crappie) size has been small. Northernpike angling success has been sporadic due to periodic low abundance which may have beeninfluenced by limited spawning areas, temporary fish barriers restricting immigration intoLong Lake from MFCR (beaver dams, outlet trapping operations), amount of winter rescuestocking, and potential overharvest. Walleye angling success (numbers) has been poorhistorically, but there have been reports of some large walleye caught. Long has been stockedwith a variety of species throughout the years. Winter rescue northern pike were the mostcommonly stocked fish during the last fifteen years. A small northern pike spawning area hasbeen operated since 1988. Small amounts of walleye fingerlings (127 lbs) had been stockedabout every 2-3 years. In 1987, 317 lbs of smallmouth bass fingerlings were stocked. Statecrews have been removing small stunted bluegill since the early 1970's (1,016 lbs in 1989,242 lbs in 1990, 1,084 lbs in 1991, 911 lbs in 1992, 1,112 lbs in 1993, and 873 lbs in 1994)to promote bluegill growth. Limited commercial removal of bullhead, carp, and bowfin havealso occurred in the past.     Bluegill abundance in 1994 was the highest recorded value (93.1) and above the normalrange (5.6 - 42.3 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes. The historical average was 53.6fish/trapnet. The average size in 1994 (5.9 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) wasabove the historical average (5.6 inches). The largest bluegill caught in the 1994 survey was8.3 inches. Abundance of quality size fish (6-8 inches) in 1994 was the highest recordedvalue (52.6 fish/combined set). Historical abundance of quality size fish was 21.8fish/combined set. Reports from local anglers seem to confirm testnetting results thatbluegill size has increased. Historically, bluegill growth rates have been slow as alsoindicated by this survey. Although, there appears some enhanced growth during the previoustwo - three years from scale analysis. About 76% of the bluegill captured were over fiveyears old. Improved bluegill size structure may be related to a combination of factors whichcould include high predator populations (largemouth bass, northern pike, bowfin, yellowperch, yellow bullhead), selective removal of sunfish less than 6 inches (potentiallygenetically inferior fish), and limited survival of young of year/yearling sunfish due touncharacteristically cool\\wet summers during the last several years.     Black crappie abundance in 1994 (0.3 fish/gillnet, 0.4 fish/trapnet) was near or belowthe normal range (0.3 - 2.7 fish/gillnet, 0.7 - 3.2 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and belowthe historical averages (1.4 fish/gillnet, 2.3 fish/trapnet). The highest recorded abundancewas in the 1990 survey (3.7 fish/gillnet, 9.0 fish/trapnet). The largest black crappie caughtin the 1994 survey was only 9.1 inches. Black crappie population numbers have been low inlakes for the last several years throughout Kandiyohi County.     Largemouth bass abundance in 1994 (189.9 fish/hour) was above previous springelectrofishing surveys in 1993 (62.1 fish/hour) and 1990 (27.9 fish/hour). The largest fishcaptured was 20.7 inches. The average size decreased in 1994 (9.4 inches) compared toprevious surveys (10.3 inches in 1993 and 1990). Growth rates appear slow for largemouthbass. About 41% of the fish captured electrofishing were from the 1991 year class.     Smallmouth bass were not captured in the 1994 or 1993 electrofishing surveys. In 1990,1.5 fish/hour were captured in the spring electrofishing survey ranging in size from 8.7 -12.0 inches.     Northern pike abundance in 1994 (5.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.1 -8.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but above the historical average (2.8 fish/gillnet).Northern pike numbers are also abundant in the Middle Fork of the Crow River and MudReservoir which connects to Long Lake via the outlet. There may be some movement of northernpike into Long from the Middle Fork of the Crow River due to upstream spawning behavior orfish seeking cooler oxygenated water in the summer. The largest fish caught was 33.1 inches.The average size caught in 1994 (24.8 inches) was above the historical average (21.3 inchesgillnets and trapnets combined). Growth rates appear good for northern pike.         Walleye abundance in 1994 (2.3 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (1.3 - 5.5fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but above the historical average (0.9 fish/gillnet). It wasalso the highest recorded abundance value from previous surveys. The average size in 1994(15.3 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was similar to the historical average (15.6inches). Growth rates appear good. Historically, low walleye abundance in Long has been dueto no/low natural reproduction of walleye (lack of suitable spawning habitat), low stockingrates, and low abundance of primary forage species (yellow perch, black bullhead).     Yellow perch abundance in 1994 (5.5 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (2.5 -24.2 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but above the historical average (2.6 fish/gillnet).Yellow perch have never been abundant within Long compared to other local lakes. The averagesize in 1994 (5.7 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was slightly below thehistorical average (6.0 inches). Growth rates appear average.     The excellent water quality is a product of a small watershed drainage area and limitednutrient runoff. Small amounts of nutrient inputs are primarily from residential lawns andperhaps some failing\\inadequate septic systems around the lake. Intense angling pressure, duein part to high residential development (185 homes/cabins, 4 resorts/campgrounds) andimproved access on this small lake, may be one of the major limiting factors for maintainingquality size bluegill and largemouth bass. Experimental regulations (reduced bag limits ofcertain size groups, protected size groups, etc.) may be necessary to allow greater numbersof fish (bluegill, largemouth bass) to attain quality size. Experimental regulations (LCMRExperimental Regulations Statewide Study) are planned to be implemented for largemouth bassby the summer of 1997. In addition, continued removal of potentially genetically inferiorstrains of small bluegill should continue unless it is found to ineffective. Considerationshould be given to eliminating walleye stocking because of the cost, past lack of success forestablishing a good walleye fishery, and the potential negative effects on other species.Priority management should continue for maintaining northern pike numbers. In addition,maintaining good water quality and protecting/expanding of important habitat (bulrush) shouldalso be priorities.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A summer assessment of the fish population was conducted on Long Lake in July of 2001. Long is a small lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 46 feet. Long is a popular boating and fishing lake for local residents and visitors to three resort/campgrounds. Water quality and clarity is excellent in Long. Aquatic vegetation is varied and abundant within the lake. The immediate watershed consists mostly of hardwoods, wetlands, grasslands, and residential homes. An experimental regulation is in force for largemouth bass (12 inch maximum size limit) on Long Lake until 2006. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Long Lake for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and walleye. Black crappie numbers were high in 2001 (5.2 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (1.7 fish/gillnet). The 2001 black crappie average size was moderate (0.24 lbs. and 7.6 inches from gillnets). The largest black crappie captured in the 2001 summer assessment was 9.7 inches. Approximately 55% of the black crappie captured were 3 year old fish hatched in 1998. Black crappie growth rates in Long were below average compared to Spicer Area lakes. Local anglers had success catching black crappie during the spring of 2001 in Long Lake.Bluegill numbers were relatively low in 2001 (15.8 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (43.7 fish/trapnet). The 2001 bluegill average size was small (0.08 lbs. and 4.5 inches from trapnets). The catch rate of large bluegill (8.0 inches and greater) was low in 2001 (0.3 fish/trapnet), but the highest recorded value for Long since 1994. The largest bluegill captured in the 2001 summer assessment was 8.2 inches. Local anglers had fair success catching large bluegill in the 2001 summer.Largemouth bass numbers were high in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey (79.7 fish/hour). The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 67.7 fish/hour for spring electrofishing in Long. The 2001 largemouth bass average size was moderate (1.13 lbs. and 12.6 inches from spring electrofishing). The largemouth bass catch rate of large fish (15.0 inches and greater) in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey (13.2 fish/hour) was the highest recorded value for Long Lake. Largemouth bass growth rates documented in 2001 were below average compared to Spicer Area lakes, but above Long Lake historical averages. The largest largemouth bass captured in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey was 17.9 inches. Preliminary data suggests that the current experimental largemouth bass regulation has increased the number of large fish present in Long Lake.Northern pike numbers were high in 2001 (7.3 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (4.1 fish/gillnet). The 2001 northern pike average size was small (2.01 lbs. and 20.9 inches from gillnets). The largest northern pike captured in the 2001 summer assessment was 30.2 inches. About 45% of the northern pike captured in the 2001 summer assessment were infected with a black spotted parasite \"neascus\" located on the outside of the skin. The neascus parasite is not harmful to humans if the fish are thoroughly cooked before eaten.Walleye numbers were low in 2001 (2.7 fish/gillnet), but the second highest recorded value for Long. The walleye historical average catch rate is 1.5 fish/gillnet. The 2001 walleye average weight and length size was moderate to large (2.27 lbs. and 17.4 inches from gillnets). Walleye growth rates in Long were generally above average compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest walleye captured in the 2001 summer assessment was 27.4 inches. Recent walleye stockings occurred in 2000 (536 fingerlings and 309 adults), 1998 (365 fingerlings), and 1996 (2,730 fingerlings). Yellow perch were not captured in Long Lake during the 2001 summer assessment (0.0 fish/gillnet) The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 1.8 fish/gillnet.Other notable fish species captured in the 2001 summer assessment included abundant numbers of yellow bullhead (9.5 fish/gillnet) and low numbers of black bullhead (3.0 fish/gillnet). Historical average catch rates were 3.9 fish/gillnet for yellow bullhead and 2.0 fish/gillnet for black bullhead. Current fish management activities on Long include protecting the important aquatic vegetation habitat through the permit process, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, evaluating the largemouth bass experimental regulation by spring electrofishing every other year, and stocking walleye fingerlings as warranted. The entire Long Lake fishery will be surveyed again in 2003.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish resurvey of Long Lake was conducted in June of 2003. Long is a small (286 acres) and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 46 feet. Residential development (103 homes/cabins) has occurred around the entire lake with the exception of some south shore shoreline areas. There are four resort/campgrounds located adjacent to Long. Hardwoods and adjacent wetlands are the dominant cover types within the immediate watershed. Nutrient runoff is limited primarily to residential lawn runoff. The outlet connects to the Middle Fork of the Crow Reservoir. There are two public access sites adjacent to the lake. Emergent vegetation (waterlilies, bulrush, cattails, wild rice) densities are abundant in Long, especially in bay areas and south shoreline areas. Submergent vegetation densities (muskgrass, coontail, various pondweed species) were abundant in the lake. Shoal water substrates include primarily sand, gravel, detritus, muck, and rubble. Water quality (total phosphorus=0.016 mg/l) and clarity (secchi=10.5 feet) are excellent for Long Lake. Water levels were down by late summer of 2003 due to drought conditions. An experimental regulation was implemented for bass (12 inch maximum size limit) in 1997. The experimental regulation will be evaluated and a public meeting held at the end of the 2005 fishing season to determine if the regulation will remain, changed, or discontinued. Long is a popular fishing lake for largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and northern pike. Anglers also seek walleye occasionally in Long. Largemouth bass numbers were high in the 2003 spring electrofishing survey (82.6 fish/hour) compared to the average catch rate from area lakes (46.1 fish/hour). The Long Lake largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 69.3 fish/hour. The 2003 largemouth bass average weight and length were 0.94 pounds and 11.8 inches respectively from spring electrofishing. The largemouth bass historical average size is 0.77 pounds and 10.7 inches from spring electrofishing for Long. The 2003 catch rate of preferred size (15.0 inches) and larger largemouth bass (13.0 fish/hour) was above the historical average (5.3 fish/hour). Largemouth bass growth rates in Long were below the normal ranges for ages 1-5 compared to area lakes. The 1999 year class comprised 28% of the 2003 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch. The largest largemouth bass was 21.3 inches from the 2003 spring electrofishing survey.Black crappie numbers were moderate in 2003 (1.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The black crappie gillnet historical average catch rate is 1.72 fish/gillnet. The black crappie average size was small (0.15 pounds and 6.40 inches) from trapnets. Northern pike numbers were low to moderate in 2003 (2.8 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 3.9 fish/gillnet. The 2003 northern pike average size was moderate (2.80 pounds and 21.8 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.44 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (21.0 inches) and larger northern pike was low (1.2 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (3.3 fish/gillnet) for Long. Northern pike growth rates in Long were below the normal ranges for ages 1-3, but within the normal ranges for ages 4-5 compared to area lakes. Approximately 58% of the northern pike captured in the 2003 resurvey were from the 2001 year class. The largest northern pike captured was 35.9 inches from the 2003 survey nets.Yellow perch were not captured in the Long 2003 survey gillnets or trapnets. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 1.6 fish/gillnet. Walleye numbers were low in 2003 (2.00 fish/gillnet). The walleye historical catch rate is 1.5 fish/gillnet. The 2003 walleye average size was moderate (1.80 pounds and 16.8 inches) from trapnets. Walleye growth rates were generally within or above the normal ranges compared to area lakes. The 2000 walleye year class (fingerling stocking) comprised 47% of the 2003 total walleye catch in the survey nets. The largest walleye captured was 27.3 inches from the 2003 survey nets. Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2003 (30.30 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The 2003 bluegill average size was moderate (0.15 lbs. and 5.6 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from trapnets. The 2003 catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches) and larger bluegill (12.4 fish/trapnet) was high and above the normal range of Long Lake. Bluegill growth rates in Long Lake were generally below the normal ranges for ages 1-6 compared to area lakes. The largest bluegill captured was 8.8 inches from the 2003 survey nets. Yellow bullhead numbers were moderate to high in 2003 (6.2 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The yellow bullhead historical average catch rate is 4.1 fish/gillnet for Long. The 2003 yellow bullhead average size was large (0.67 pounds and 10.38 inches) from gillnets.Current fish management activities on Long Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, evaluating the bass experimental regulation, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Long Lake fishery will be resurveyed in the 2004 spring for largemouth bass and 2005 spring and summer for all fish species. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A lake survey of Long Lake was conducted in mid-June of 2013. Long is a small (286 acres) and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 46 feet. Residential development (110 homes/cabins) has occurred around the entire lake with the exception of some south shoreline areas. There are three resort/campgrounds located adjacent to Long Lake. Hardwoods and adjacent wetlands are the dominant cover types within the immediate watershed. Nutrient runoff is limited primarily to residential lawn runoff. The outlet connects to the Middle Fork Crow Reservoir. There are two public access sites adjacent to the lake. Emergent vegetation (i.e. water lilies, bulrush, cattails, and wild rice) is abundant in Long, especially in bay and south shoreline areas. Submergent vegetation (i.e. muskgrass, coontail, various pondweed species) is abundant in the lake. Shoalwater substrates are primarily sand, gravel, detritus, muck, and rubble. Water quality is good (total phosphorus=0.013 ppm, 6-10-2013) in Long Lake. Water clarity (secchi=17.5 feet) was excellent on June 10, 2013 for Long Lake. Dissolved oxygen levels were above 5.0 ppm down to 18 feet deep during the survey. An experimental regulation was implemented for bass (12 inch maximum size limit) in 1997 as part of a statewide research study. A public meeting was held at the end of the 2005 fishing season to get public input whether the regulation should remain, be changed, or discontinued. The DNR decided to change the bass regulation in December of 2005 to a DNR state toolbox regulation (a 12 inch maximum size limit with one bass over 20 inches allowed). The new bass regulation took effect on May 27, 2006. This regulation was monitored, and a public meeting was held at the end of September 2011 to get public input regarding the special regulation on bass. The DNR decided to change the bass regulation in December 2011 (all largemouth bass from 12 inches to 20 inches to be immediately released with one bass over 20 inches allowed in possession). The new bass regulation took effect May 26, 2012 and is in effect through 2020. Long is a popular fishing lake for largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and northern pike. Anglers also seek walleye occasionally in Long Lake. The primary species managed in Long Lake include largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were abundant (71.43 fish/hour) in the 2013 spring electrofishing survey compared to the Spicer Area average catch rate (48.21 fish/hour) and near the Long Lake historical average (72.65 fish/hour). The 2013 largemouth bass average size was moderate (0.84 pounds and 10.80 inches) from spring electrofishing. The largemouth bass historical average weight is 0.75 pounds from spring electrofishing for Long Lake. The 2013 catch rate of quality size (12.00 inches) and larger largemouth bass (22.86 fish/hour) was near the historical average (21.19 fish/hour). The 2013 catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches) and larger largemouth bass was moderate (7.62 fish/hour) and slightly above the historical average (5.34 fish/hour). Largemouth bass growth rates in Long Lake were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 2-8. The 2010 largemouth bass year class comprised the highest percentage (23.6%) of the 2013 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch. Several other moderate largemouth year classes included 2008, 2009, and 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were moderately abundant in 2013 (3.80 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Long Lake and similar lakes. The black crappie historical average trapnet catch rate is 1.95 fish/trapnet. Low numbers of black crappie (0.33 fish/gillnet) were captured in the 2013 gillnets. The 2013 black crappie average size was moderate (0.29 pounds and 7.89 inches) from trapnets. The 2013 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was 1.10 fish/trapnet. Black crappie growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4 and near normal for ages 5 and 6. The 2010 black crappie year class comprised 81% of the 2013 black crappie catch from gillnets and trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were abundant in 2013 (9.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Long Lake and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate for Long Lake is 4.65 fish/gillnet. The 2013 northern pike average weight and length were small (1.94 pounds and 20.53 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.52 pounds from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was low (2.33 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were below or near the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4 fish and within the normal range for age 5 fish. The 2011 and 2010 northern pike year classes comprised 44% and 40% respectively of the 2013 northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were moderately abundant in 2013 (3.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Long Lake and similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 1.45 fish/gillnet. No walleye were captured in the trapnets in 2013. Walleye average weight and length were 2.33 pounds and 18.22 inches from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2010 year class comprised 33% of the 2013 total walleye catch. Long Lake was stocked with walleye yearlings (504 fish, 252 pounds) in the fall of 2009, (45 fish, 50 pounds) 2010, (1,162 fish, 252 pounds) 2011, and 2013 (686 fish, 298 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were not captured in gillnets in 2013. Yellow perch abundance in the 2013 trapnets (0.30 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range for Long Lake. The yellow perch historical average catch rate for Long Lake is 1.29 fish/gillnet and 0.21 fish/trapnet. The 2013 yellow perch average size was small (0.12 pounds and 6.51 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were moderately abundant in 2013 (46.90 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Long Lake and similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 43.00 fish/trapnet. The 2013 bluegill average weight and length were 0.15 pounds and 5.52 inches from trapnets.

The 2013 catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low (1.60 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6, and in the normal range for ages 7 and 8. The 2010 year class comprised 33% of the total 2013 bluegill catch.  <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed sunfish numbers were moderate in 2013 (3.50 fish/trapnet) and within the normal range for Long Lake. The 2013 pumpkinseed sunfish average size was small (0.15 pounds and 5.43 inches) in trapnets for Long Lake. The historical pumpkinseed weight and length are 0.14 pounds and 5.40 inches for Long Lake. <br> \n  <br> \nHybrid sunfish were abundant in 2013 (6.30 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for Long Lake. The 2013 hybrid sunfish average size was large (0.27 pounds and 6.55 inches) from trapnets. The hybrid sunfish historical weight and length are 0.18 pounds and 5.98 inches from trapnets in Long Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullhead numbers were abundant in 2013 (15.50 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Long Lake and similar lakes.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted on Long Lake during mid-May of 2021. Ten standard lake survey trapnets were set at historical stations to target Bluegill and Black Crappie. Special regulations for several area lakes (Nest, Long, Diamond, George and Florida) including Long Lake entail reduced bag limits (i.e., 5 or 10 fish) for Bluegill and possibly Black Crappie. A Bluegill bag limit of 10 fish was enacted for Long Lake in May of 2021. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Trapnet sampling of pre-spawn Bluegill during early/mid-May or September is preferred to summer (June-August) netting for regulation evaluation.  <br> \n <br> \nLong is a small (286 acres) and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 46 feet. Residential development (110 homes/cabins, 2013 resurvey) has occurred around the entire lake except for some south shoreline areas. There are three resort/campgrounds located adjacent to Long Lake. Hardwoods and adjacent wetlands are the dominant cover types within the immediate watershed. Nutrient runoff is limited primarily residential lawn runoff. The outlet connects to the Middle Fork Crow Reservoir. There are two public access sites adjacent to the lake. Emergent vegetation (i.e., water lilies, bulrush, cattails, and wild rice) is abundant in Long, especially in bay and south shoreline areas. Submergent vegetation (i.e., muskgrass, coontail, various pondweed species) is abundant in the lake. Shoalwater substrates are primarily sand, gravel, detritus, muck, and rubble. Water quality is good (total phosphorus=0.013 ppm, 6-10-2013) in Long Lake. Water clarity (secchi=14.0 feet) was excellent on July 9, 2018 for Long Lake.  An experimental regulation was implemented for bass (12 inch maximum size limit) in 1997 as part of a statewide research study. The DNR decided to change the bass regulation in December of 2005 to a DNR state toolbox regulation (a 12 inch maximum size limit with one bass over 20 inches allowed). The new bass regulation took effect on May 27, 2006. This regulation was monitored, and a public meeting was held at the end of September 2011 to get public input regarding the special regulation on bass. The DNR decided to change the bass regulation in December of 2011 (all Largemouth Bass from 14 inches to 20 inches to be immediately released with one bass over 20 inches allowed in possession). The new bass regulation has been in effect since May 26, 2012. Long is a popular fishing lake for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Black Crappie, and Northern Pike. Anglers also seek Walleye occasionally.  <br> \n <br> \nCatchability of various species (i.e., Bluegill, Black Crappie, Walleye, etc.) is often different by season. Summer historical average catch rates should be cautiously used when compared to spring or fall catch rates regarding relative abundance. Black Crappie and Bluegill are generally more susceptible to capture in trapnets during May and September compared to the summer months. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance in 2021 mid-May (13.50 fish/trapnet) was above the summer historical average catch rate of 1.95 fish/trapnet. The 2021 Black Crappie average size was large (0.55 pounds and 9.84 inches) from trapnets. The 2021 catch rate of quality size (8.00 plus inches) Black Crappie was moderate (8.30 fish/trapnet). The 2021 catch rate of preferred size (10.00 plus inches) Black Crappie was also moderate (6.60 fish/trapnet). Black Crappie growth rates were below the normal ranges for ages 1-5, but within the normal ranges for ages 6-8. The 2016 year class comprised 47% of the 2021 Black Crappie trapnet catch. The largest Black Crappie captured was 12.28 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 2021 mid-May was moderate (21.00 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill summer historical catch rate is 41.49 fish/trapnet. The 2021 Bluegill average size was large (0.38 pounds and 7.60 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from summer trapnets. The 2021 catch rate of quality size (6.00 plus inches) Bluegill was moderate (18.7 fish/trapnet). The 2021 catch rate of preferred size (8.00 plus inches) Bluegill was high (8.30 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2016 and 2015 year classes comprised 41% and 28% respectively of the 2021 total bluegill trapnet catch rate. The largest Bluegill captured was 10.71 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed Sunfish numbers were low in 2021 (1.40 fish/trapnet) compared to the summer historical average (3.93 fish/trapnet). The 2021 Pumpkinseed Sunfish average size was large (0.33 pounds and 7.01 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nHybrid Sunfish numbers were low in 2021 trapnets (1.60 fish/trapnet) compared to the summer historical average (4.42 fish/trapnet). The 2021 Hybrid Sunfish average size was large (0.40 pounds and 7.62 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Long Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, evaluating the bass and Bluegill regulations, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Long Lake fishery will be surveyed in 2023 for Largemouth Bass by spring night electrofishing and 2023 for all fish species. The Long Lake experimental regulation will be re-evaluated for continuation, change or removal in 2023. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long is a small lake (286 acres) with a maximum depth of 46 feet. Long is located 4miles northeast of New London, MN in Kandiyohi County. It is characterized by steep drop-offsfrom the shoalwater areas to deeper water. Aquatic vegetation stands are abundant in theshoalwater and shallow bay areas. Water clarity was excellent on June 26, 1997 (secchidisk=23.0 feet). Long is a popular fishing lake for bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and northern pike. A largemouth bass experimental regulation was implemented on Long during1997 as part of a statewide study. The objective of the study is to evaluate theeffectiveness of regulations for increasing largemouth bass average size. A final decision will be made in 2006 to determine if the regulation will remain in effect, changed orabolished. The experimental regulation states that all largemouth bass 12.0 inches or largermust be immediately released; a limit of 6 largemouth bass is allowed; no possession oflargemouth bass 12.0 inches or larger while fishing in or on Long Lake (34-0066).     Largemouth bass were numerous in the 1997 spring electrofishing survey (53.0 fish/hour),however the average size was small (9.7 inches). The largest bass caught during the springelectrofishing survey was 18.7 inches. Bluegill numbers (25.9 fish/trapnet) in 1997 weremoderate compared to previous years. The 1997 bluegill average size caught from trapnets wassmall (4.4 inches). However, local anglers reported good catches of large bluegill (>6inches) in the 1997 summer. The largest bluegill captured in the 1997 survey was 8.1 inches. Small bluegill (< 6 inches) have been removed (42,235 adults) since 1989 to reduce bluegillnumbers and promote growth in Long Lake. Black crappie numbers were normal (1.6 fish/trapnet)in 1997 compared to similar lakes. The black crappie average size was 8.6 inches in 1997.Anglers reported good fishing success for black crappie during the spring of 1997 and the1997-98 winter. Northern pike abundance in 1997 (5.0 fish/gillnet) was above the historicalaverage (3.1 fish/gillnet). Northern pike size (21.3 inches) was average. Walleye numbers(1.8 fish/gillnet) are normal compared to similar lakes. Walleye fishing is generally fairto poor in Long, however anglers do occasionally have success catching large fish (>20inches). Walleye fingerlings are stocked about every three years.     Long Lake will continued to be monitored by spring electrofishing through 2006 in orderto evaluate the effectiveness of the largemouth bass experimental regulation. Othermanagement priorities for Long include protecting important habitat (i.e., water lilies,hardstem bulrush), walleye stocking as needed, continuing bluegill removal efforts as needed,and encouraging local landowners to implement best management practices (i.e., conservationtillage, wetland restoration, planting buffer strips, using low/no phosphorus fertilizers,proper feedlot/manure management, updating non conforming septic systems) in the watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Long Lake was conducted in late June of 2008. Long is a small (286 acres) and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 46 feet. Residential development (103 homes/cabins) has occurred around the entire lake with the exception of some south shoreline areas. There are four resort/campgrounds located adjacent to Long. Hardwoods and adjacent wetlands are the dominant cover types within the immediate watershed. Nutrient runoff is limited primarily to residential lawn runoff. The outlet connects to the Middle Fork of the Crow Reservoir. There are two public access sites adjacent to the lake. Emergent vegetation (waterlilies, bulrush, cattails, wild rice) is abundant in Long, especially in bay and south shoreline areas. Submergent vegetation (muskgrass, coontail, various pondweed species) is abundant in the lake. Shoalwater substrates are primarily sand, gravel, detritus, muck, and rubble. Water quality is good in Long Lake. Water clarity (secchi=10.5 feet) was good to excellent during 2008 for Long Lake. Dissolved oxygen levels were above 4.0 ppm down to 23 feet deep. An experimental regulation was implemented for bass (12 inch maximum size limit) in 1997 as part of a statewide research study. A public meeting was held at the end of the 2005 fishing season to get public input whether the regulation should remain, be changed, or discontinued. The DNR decided to change the bass regulation in December of 2005 to a DNR state toolbox regulation (a 12 inch maximum size limit with one bass over 20 inches allowed). The new bass regulation took effect on May 27, 2006. Long is a popular fishing lake for largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and northern pike. Anglers also seek walleye occasionally in Long Lake. The primary species managed in Long Lake include largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were abundant (110.10 fish/hour) in the 2008 spring electrofishing survey compared to the Spicer Area average catch rate (47.78 fish/hour) and above the Long Lake historical average (73.19 fish/hour). The 2008 largemouth bass average size was small (0.47 pounds and 8.80 inches) from spring electrofishing. The largemouth bass historical average weight is 0.74 pounds from spring electrofishing for Long Lake. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (12.00 inches) and larger largemouth bass (13.47 fish/hour) was below the historical average (22.03 fish/hour). The 2008 catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches) and larger largemouth bass was low to moderate (4.69 fish/hour) and near the historical average (5.33 fish/hour). Largemouth bass growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2004 largemouth bass year class comprised the highest percentage (26%) of the 2008 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch. Several other moderate largemouth year classes included 2006, 2005, and 2002.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low to moderate in 2008 (1.40 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Long Lake (25th=0.38, 50th=0.95, 75th=1.74 fish/trapnet) and similar lakes. The black crappie gillnet historical average trapnet catch rate is 1.80 fish/trapnet. Low numbers of black crappie (0.25 fish/gillnet) were captured in the 2008 gillnets. The 2008 black crappie average size was moderate (0.32 pounds and 8.21 inches) from trapnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was low (0.80 fish/trapnet). Black crappie growth rates were above or within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. The 2005 black crappie year class comprised 73% of the 2008 black crappie catch from gillnets and trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate in 2008 (5.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Long Lake (25th=1.92, 50th=5.13, 75th=6.25 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 4.26 fish/gillnet. The 2008 northern pike average size was moderate (3.58 pounds and 23.69 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.56 pounds from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was moderate to high (3.25 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were near or below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3, but within the normal ranges for ages 4-6. The 2004 northern pike year class comprised 27% of the 2008 northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2008 (0.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 1.40 fish/gillnet. The 2008 yellow perch average size was small (0.11 pounds and 6.06 inches) from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2008 (0.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Long Lake (25th=0.42, 50th=1.17, 75th=2.08 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 1.32 fish/gillnet. The walleye trapnet catch rate was also low (0.60 fish/trapnet) in 2008. The 2008 walleye average weights were 0.31 pounds and 5.81 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively. Walleye growth rates were above or within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2005 and 1994 year classes each comprised 38% of the 2008 total walleye catch. Long Lake was stocked with 432 walleye yearlings (226 pounds) and 1,386 walleye fingerlings (69 pounds) in the fall of 2005. Walleye yearlings (6,480 fish, 270 pounds) were also recently stocked in the 2007 spring. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2008 (34.30 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Long Lake (25th=29.98, 50th=35.48, 75th=47.50 fish/trapnet) and similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 42.68 fish/trapnet. The 2008 bluegill average size was moderate to large (0.27 pounds and 6.63 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from trapnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was high (27.82 fish/trapnet). The 2008 catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches) and larger bluegill was also high (5.18 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5, but near or above the normal ranges for ages 6-10. The 2001 year class comprised 40% of the total 2008 bluegill catch.  <br> \n <br> \nHybrid sunfish numbers were moderate to abundant in 2008 (6.30 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for Long Lake (75th quartile (25th=2.19, 50th=4.85, 75th=6.78 fish/trapnet). The 2008 hybrid sunfish average size was large (0.36 pounds and 7.14 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed sunfish numbers were low in 2008 (1.60 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for Long Lake (25th=2.28, 50th=3.27, 75th=5.35 fish/trapnet). The 2008 pumpkinseed sunfish average size was moderate (0.22 pounds and 5.87 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullhead numbers were moderate in 2008 trapnets (4.50 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for Long Lake (25th=2.20, 50th=5.08, 75th=9.09 fish/trapnet). Yellow bullhead were absent from the 2008 gillnets. The yellow bullhead historical average catch rates are 3.46 fish/gillnet and 5.86 fish/trapnet for Long Lake.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of Long Lake was conducted for Largemouth Bass during June 9, 2016. Night time spring electrofishing was used to sample the Largemouth Bass population in Long. Ice out occurred earlier than normal (mid-March) for area lakes in 2016. The 2016 electrofishing survey occurred during post spawn conditions with a surface water temperature of 68 F. Six electrofishing stations of equal length and time were chosen by a representative sampling methodology. New and smaller length sampling stations were contained within the fewer and larger length historical electrofishing stations for better historical comparisons. Spring night time electrofishing surveys prior to 2016 were done with a different sampling methodology for timing and sample station selection. Historical Largemouth Bass sampling sites were initially chosen based on the presence of good spawning habitat, varied in length and time and were sampled during the peak spawning time period (55-60 F.). <br> \n <br> \nLong is a small (286 acres) and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 46 feet. Residential development (110 homes/cabins) has occurred around the entire lake with the exception of some south shoreline areas. There are three resort/campgrounds located adjacent to Long Lake. Hardwoods and adjacent wetlands are the dominant cover types within the immediate watershed. Nutrient runoff is limited and due primarily to residential lawn runoff. The outlet connects to the Middle Fork Crow Reservoir. There are two public access sites adjacent to the lake. Emergent vegetation (i.e. water lilies, bulrush, cattails, and wild rice) is abundant in Long, especially in bay and south shoreline areas. Submergent vegetation (i.e. muskgrass, coontail, various pondweed species) is abundant in the lake. Shoalwater substrates are primarily sand, gravel, detritus, muck, and rubble.  <br> \n <br> \nAn experimental regulation was implemented for Largemouth Bass (12 inch maximum size limit) in 1997 as part of a statewide research study. A public meeting was held at the end of the 2005 fishing season to get public input whether the regulation should remain, be changed, or discontinued. The DNR decided to change the Largemouth Bass regulation in December 2005 to a DNR state toolbox regulation (a 12 inch maximum size limit with one Largemouth Bass over 20 inches allowed). The new Largemouth Bass regulation took effect on May 27, 2006. This regulation was monitored, and a public meeting was held at the end of September 2011 to get public input regarding the special regulation on Largemouth Bass. The DNR decided to change the Largemouth Bass regulation in December 2011 (all Largemouth Bass from 14 inches to 20 inches to be immediately released with one Largemouth Bass over 20 inches allowed in possession). The new regulation took effect May 26, 2012 and is in effect through 2020. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were abundant (92.0 fish/hour) in the 2016 Long Lake spring electrofishing survey. The 2016 Largemouth Bass average size was small (0.53 pounds and 8.9 inches). Largemouth Bass catch rate of quality size (12.0 inches and larger) was high (19.0 fish/hour) in 2016. The 2016 Largemouth Bass catch rate of preferred size (15.0 inches and larger) was low (3.0 fish/hour). Largemouth Bass growth rates were generally slow growing compared to other Spicer Area lakes. The 2013 and 2014 year classes each comprised 20% of the 2016 spring Largemouth Bass electrofishing catch. A greater variety of Largemouth Bass sizes and ages were captured in 2016 compared to previous years. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were abundant (71.4 fish/hour) in 2013, but slightly below the 2016 spring electrofishing survey. The 2013 Largemouth Bass average size was moderate (0.84 pounds and 10.8 inches), but larger compared to 2016. The Largemouth Bass historical average weight is 0.75 pounds from spring electrofishing for Long Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Long Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, evaluating the new bass regulation, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Long Lake fishery will be surveyed in 2018 for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff conducted a targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on September 11, 2017. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with two sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station, and conditions prevented the use of seines at three sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 19 native species of fish including six species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and two tolerant species (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish).  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  The FIBI score for Long Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long is a small and moderately deep lake in Kandiyohi County with good water quality andclarity. Aquatic vegetation stands were abundant in the near shallow shoreline areas andshallow bays. Hardstem bulrush stands were moderately abundant within the shallow bay areasof Long Lake. Experimental regulations for largemouth bass (allowable harvest of largemouthbass less than 12 inches only) were implemented on Long Lake during the 1997 summer. It ispart of a statewide study to evaluate the effectiveness of experimental regulations forimproving largemouth bass size structures. Long is a popular recreational (boating, swimming,skiing) and fishing (bluegill, crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike) lake in KandiyohiCounty. The most recent fish stocking was 365 large walleye fingerlings (146 lbs.) in 1998.     Largemouth bass were abundant (75.65 fish/hour) in the 1999 spring electrofishingsurvey. The historical average largemouth bass catch rate was 65.92 fish/hour. The 1999largemouth bass average size was moderate (12.02 inches) from spring electrofishing, butabove the historical average (10.35 inches). The largest largemouth bass captured in the 1999spring electrofishing survey was 21.61 inches and 5.07 lbs. Largemouth bass growth rates wereslightly below average compared to other local lakes. There were a variety of largemouth bassyear classes present in Long Lake.     Northern pike were abundant (7.17 fish/gillnet) in 1999 compared to the historicalaverage (3.65 fish/gillnet). The 1999 northern pike average size was moderate (23.23 inchesand 3.07 lbs, gillnets). The largest northern pike captured was 30.55 inches. The 1996 yearclass comprised 44% of the 1999 total northern pike catch.      Walleye were moderately abundant (3.33 fish/gillnet) in 1999 compared to the historicalaverage (1.33 fish/gillnet). The 1999 walleye average size was large (20.84 inches and 3.46lbs., gillnets). The largest walleye captured in the 1999 gillnets was 27.28 inches and 7.71lbs. Walleye growth rates were average to good for ages 6 and younger. The two most prevalentwalleye year classes were from 1996 (33% of the 1999 total walleye catch) and 1992 (24% ofthe 1999 total walleye catch) of which both years were stocked with walleye fingerlings.     Bluegill were moderately abundant (30.30 fish/trapnet) in 1999, but below the historicalaverage (47.20 fish/trapnet). The 1999 bluegill average size was small (5.16 inches, gillnetsand trapnets) and slightly below the historical average (5.45 inches, gillnets and trapnets). A greater proportion of large bluegill (> 6 inches) appeared to be suspended in the openwater areas of Long Lake in late June as evident by the gillnet catch compared to the trapnetcatch of smaller fish in the near shore areas. Bluegill growth rates were slightly belowaverage compared to similar lakes. The 1995 year class comprised 43% of the 1999 totalbluegill catch.     Hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish were present in moderate to low numbers (7.10 hybridsunfish/trapnet, 2.90 pumpkinseed sunfish/trapnet). The 1999 average sizes were moderate forhybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish (0.18 lbs for both species, trapnets).     Black crappie was moderately abundant (4.00 fish/trapnet) in 1999 compared to thehistorical average (2.40 fish/trapnet). The 1999 black crappie average size was moderate(7.75 inches, trapnets). Black crappie growth rates were average compared to other locallakes. The 1996 year class comprised 91% of the 1999 total black crappie  catch.     Yellow bullhead were abundant (8.10 fish/trapnet) in 1999. The 1999 yellow bullheadaverage size was large (10.63 inches, trapnets).     It appears that the fishery in Long Lake is in good condition. Local anglers had goodsuccess for northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie in recent years. Local anglers alsoreported that the average bluegill size caught appears to have improved in Long Lake duringthe last few years. The largemouth bass population average size appears to be respondingfavorably to the experimental regulations. Walleye fingerlings or yearlings will be stockedevery other year in Long Lake. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office will continue to monitor adultfish populations by summer test netting every other year until 2003 and spring electrofishingevery other year until 2007. The experimental regulation for largemouth bass will beevaluated in 2008 to determine if it will become permanent, modified, or removed.</p>",

Some locations were not seine-able due to dense aquatic vegetation. During the survey, 21 different species of fish were captured, of which 7 were gamefish. The gamefish species consisted of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Walleye and Yellow Perch. The 5 most numerous species of fish captured by electrofishing consisted of: Largemouth Bass, Green Sunfish, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow and Banded Killifish. The 5 most numerous species of fish captured by shoreline seining consisted of: Bluegill, Blackchin Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow, Largemouth Bass, and Green Sunfish.  Other fish captured during IBI sampling include Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Brook Stickleback, Central Mudminnow, Least Shiner, Tadpole Madtom, and Yellow Bullhead. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Long Lake was conducted in late-June of 2023. An aquatic vegetation transect survey was also conducted in 2023. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nLong is a small (286 acres) and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 46 feet. Invasive species recently found in Long during 2023 include Starry Stonewort (near southwest public access) and Zebra Mussel. Residential development (110 homes/cabins, 2013 resurvey) has occurred around the entire lake except for some south shoreline areas. There are three resort/campgrounds located adjacent to Long Lake. Hardwoods and adjacent wetlands are the dominant cover types within the immediate watershed. Nutrient runoff is limited primarily residential to lawn runoff. The outlet connects to the Middle Fork Crow Reservoir. A new four lane highway will slightly alter the outlet area once completed in 2024. There are two public access sites adjacent to the lake. Various emergent and floating-leaf vegetation (i.e. yellow and white water lilies, hardstem bulrush, cattails, and wild rice) species were present in Long during 2023 and were especially abundant in bay and south shoreline areas. Submergent vegetation consisted mostly of coontail, sago pondweed, muskgrass, northern milfoil, clasping-leaf pondweed, bladderwort and bushy pondweed in the lake during 2023. Filamentous algae densities were moderate in Long. Shoalwater substrates are primarily sand, silt, rubble, boulder and gravel. Water quality is good (total phosphorus=0.011 ppm, June 10, 2023) in Long Lake. Water clarity (secchi=16.0 feet) was excellent on June 20, 2023 for Long Lake. Dissolved oxygen levels were above 5.0 ppm down to 21 feet deep during the survey.  An experimental regulation was implemented for bass (12 inch maximum size limit) in 1997 as part of a statewide research study. A public meeting was held at the end of the 2005 fishing season to get public input whether the regulation should remain, be changed, or discontinued. The DNR decided to change the bass regulation in December 2005 to a DNR state toolbox regulation (a 12 inch maximum size limit with one bass over 20 inches allowed). The new bass regulation took effect on May 27, 2006. This regulation was monitored, and a public meeting was held at the end of September 2011 to get public input regarding the special regulation on bass. The DNR decided to change the bass regulation in December 2011 (all Largemouth Bass from 14 inches to 20 inches to be immediately released with one bass over 20 inches allowed in possession). The new bass regulation took effect May 26, 2012 and is currently in effect. Quality Sunfish Initiative \"QSI\" was recently enacted during 2021. Special regulations for several area lakes (Nest, Long, Diamond, George and Florida) including Long Lake entail reduced bag limits (i.e., 5 or 10 fish) for Sunfish in five lakes and Crappie in one lake. Special regulations for Long entail reduced bag limits of ten fish for Sunfish. These regulations are evaluated by special sampling in May with standard lake survey trapnets. Long was last surveyed by special sampling for Sunfish in mid-May of 2021. Long is a popular fishing lake for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Black Crappie, and Northern Pike. Anglers also seek Walleye occasionally.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass was not surveyed by night spring electrofishing in 2023. The most recent post spawn spring night electrofishing was conducted in 2019 (146.09 fish/hour). The 2019 Largemouth Bass average weight and length were 0.87 pounds and 11.29 inches. Largemouth Bass catch rate of quality size (12.00 inches plus) was moderate (45.52 fish/hour) in 2019. The 2019 Largemouth Bass catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches plus) was low (6.23 fish/hour). Largemouth Bass catch rate was 92.00 fish/hour (0.53 pounds and 8.90 inches) in the 2016 post spawn night electrofishing survey. A greater variety of Largemouth Bass sizes and ages were captured in a 2016 post spawn night electrofishing survey compared to 2019 and other years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was low (1.20 fish/trapnet) in 2023. The historical average trapnet catch rate is 1.91 fish/trapnet. No Black Crappie were captured in the 2023 gillnets. The 2023 Black Crappie average size was moderate (0.47 pounds and 9.37 inches) from trapnets. The 2023 Black Crappie catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches plus) was low (1.10 fish/trapnet). The largest Black Crappie captured was 11.46 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was high (13.33 fish/gillnet) in 2023. The Northern Pike historical catch rate is 5.30 fish/gillnet. The 2023 average size was small (1.53 pounds and 19.07 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike average weight is 2.43 pounds from gillnets. The 2023 Northern Pike catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches plus) was moderate (2.00 fish/gillnet). The largest Northern Pike captured was 27.95 inches. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Long in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26.0 inches; and all from 22.0 to 26.0 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22.0 and 26.0 inches or two larger than 26.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was moderate (2.00 fish/gillnet in 2023 for Long. The Walleye historical catch rate is 1.44 fish/gillnet. The 2023 Walleye average weight was moderate (1.62 pounds) from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were good for ages 1-7. Long Lake is managed as a put and take \"bonus\" Walleye fishery due to minimal/no natural reproduction. The 2019 year class comprised 38% of the total Walleye catch in 2023. The largest Walleye captured was 26.34 inches. Long Lake was recently stocked with Walleye in the fall 2018 (16 adults, 21 pounds; 1,356 yearlings, 375 pounds), 2019 (3,930 fingerlings, 255 pounds), 2020 (36 adults, 72 pounds; 254 yearlings, 169 pounds), 2021 (600 fingerlings, 127 pounds), 2023 (25 adults, 41 pounds; 250 yearlings, 95 pounds). Local anglers report occasionally catching Walleye especially during the winter months. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were not captured in the 2023 gillnets. Yellow Perch abundance was low in the 2023 trapnets (0.30 fish/trapnet). The Yellow Perch historical catch rates for Long Lake are 1.12 fish/gillnet and 0.22 fish/trapnet. The 2023 Yellow Perch average weight and length were moderate (0.14 pounds and 6.51 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was low (15.90 fish/trapnet) in 2023. The Bluegill average historical catch rate is 39.79 fish/trapnet. The 2023 Bluegill average size was large (0.27 pounds and 6.55 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from trapnets. The 2023 Bluegill catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches plus) Bluegill was low (9.00 fish/trapnet). The 2023 catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches plus) Bluegill was moderate (4.80 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were average. Multiple year classes (2019, 2017 and 2016) each comprised approximately 20% of the total 2023 Bluegill catch. The largest Bluegill captured was 9.88 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed Sunfish numbers were low (1.30 fish/trapnet) in 2023 compared to the historical average (3.75 fish/trapnet). The 2023 Pumpkinseed Sunfish average size was moderate (0.18 pounds and 5.53 inches) from trapnets. The largest Pumpkinseed Sunfish was 8.82 inches. <br> \n <br> \nHybrid Sunfish numbers were low (2.80 fish/trapnet) in 2023 trapnets compared to the historical average (4.31 fish/trapnet). The 2023 Hybrid Sunfish average size was large (0.24 pounds and 6.26 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead numbers were abundant (12.50 fish/trapnet) in 2023 trapnets compared to the historical average (7.18 fish/trapnet). The Yellow Bullhead catch rate was 9.33 fish/gillnet in the 2023 gillnets. The Yellow Bullhead historical gillnet catch rate is 3.79 fish/gillnet for Long Lake. The 2023 Yellow Bullhead average size was large (0.74 pounds and 10.76 inches) from trapnets. The Yellow Bullhead historical average weight and length are 0.61 pounds and 10.68 inches from trapnets for Long Lake. The largest Yellow Bullhead was 14.92 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Long Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, evaluating the new bass regulation, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Long Lake fishery will be surveyed in 2024 for Largemouth Bass by spring night electrofishing and Sunfish by May trapnets. A standard survey will be conducted in 2028.  <br> \n</p>",
