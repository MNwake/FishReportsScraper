Pike reproduction appears good, as the sample consisted of age-classes II+ through V+.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance was 18.9 per trap net lift, which is below the area median.  Five percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length. <br> \n      Largemouth bass abundance was 4.3 per trap net lift.  Age-classes I+ through III+ were represented in the sample. Shoreline seining provided further evidence of good largemouth bass reproduction, as bass were caught in each haul. <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance was 0.7 per gill net lift.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance was low at 0.7 per gill net lift.  All walleyes sampled were greater than 17.0 inches in length.  The average weight was 2.4 lbs. <br> \n</p>",
