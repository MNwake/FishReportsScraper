The lake is moderately developed with numerous houses and one resort. The lake does receive fairly heavy fishing pressure for most fish species.  The 2008 population assessment found northern pike numbers of 6.17/gill net, comparable to previous surveys and averaging 25.3 inches. The size range was a little larger than past surveys.  Walleye were captured at 2.0/ gill net, which is lower than normal for this lake. Normal catch rate is around 4.5/gill net. Average size was 19.8 inches.  Age classes younger than age four were basically absent, thus a large average size exists. Black crappie were captured in low numbers and averaged 8.8 inches. Bluegill was abundant and ranged up 8.2 inches with the average around 6.1 inches. Largemouth bass numbers are very similar to past surveys in numbers and size. All were less than 17.0 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

The lake is fairly well developed, with 36 homes or cottages and one resort.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse, with much of the lake shoreline having bulrush present.  Alterations of these beds would affect water quality and fish populations.The 2002 lake survey found northern pike in moderate numbers of 5.2/gill net.  Sizes ranged from 15.1 to 31.8 inches, with a average size of just over 23.0 inches.  The size range is very simalar to past suveys in the 1990'sWalleye have been stocked every third year since 1986, most recently in 2001. Catch rates have averaged about 4.5/gill net in past surveys, with a high of 9.0/gill net in 1994. Sizes in 2002 ranged from 12.9 to 29.7 inches, with an average size of 19.0 inches.  The year classes of 1997 and 1998 comprised 62.5% of the catch.  Growth rate was average. Largemouth bass were present in good numbers with sizes ranging from 5.1 to 16.2 inches. Growth rate was average.       Black crappie were absent from the trapnets, but were found in moderate numbers in the gillnet.  Sizes ranged from 6.6 to 12.2 inches, with a average size of 8.7 inches.  Numbers of black crappie have been lower since the walleye population has increased. Bluegill numbers are at record highs, but size is small, averaging 5.1 inches.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nokay Lake is a 660 acre lake located 10 miles east of Brainerd in Crow Wing County.  A small public access is located on the west side of the lake.  Nokay reaches depths of 42 feet, with 33% of the lake 15' deep or less.  The shoreline is moderately developed with one resort present.  Extensive bulrush beds are located around the lake and around Hiawatha Island.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2020 were below average when compared to similar lakes, at 1.2/gill net.  The Walleyes sampled had an average length of 18.8\".  Natural reproduction is minimal with the majority of Walleyes coming from fingerling stocking occurring every third year.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were high at 9.5/gill net.  Average length was 20.8\", with 26% in the protected 22\"-26\" slot.  Northern Pike at least 26\" in length made up 5% of the catch.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new Northern Pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were captured in average numbers at 1.3/gill net.  Average length was 7.7\" with 38% being over 8\" in length.  Largemouth Bass were sampled in high numbers at 3.0/gill net.  Largemouth Bass averaged 13.4\", with 23% measuring 15\" or greater. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Nokay Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching, lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as remove the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

However, size remained large at an average of 2.99 lbs (3.73 lbs in 1984) and median length (22 inches in 1984).  Three age classes (2, 3, and 5) were sampled in about equal numbers.  Bluegills (38.0/trapnet) remained average in abundance, although size decreased to small (0.08 lb).  Median length decreased to 4.5 inches captured in trapnet.  About 25% of the 44 fish measured from gillnets were 7.0 inches or longer.  Largemouth bass (0.5/trapnet) was caught in average numbers.  Eleven fish were aged from gillnets and trapnets, and four age classes were present.  Growth appeared to be good.  Black Crappie was present in low numbers in trapnets, but high numbers (11.5/lift) were taken in gillnets.  A combined sample was aged and five age classes were present (2-6).  The strongest was the 1986 year class, which comprised 41% of the sample.  Growth was good for all age classes sampled.  Walleye (5.5/ gillnet) rose a statistically significant 370% since 1984 (1.17/lift).  Size dropped from large (4.7 lbs) to average (1.99 lbs).  Fingerlings were stocked in 1986 and 1989.  The strongest year classes found were 1985 and 1988. Scales were difficult to age. Thus some uncertainty exists about actual contributions of stocked fish to the population.  Growth was generally good; however the 1988 fish had slow growth, suggesting these fish might actually be a year younger.  Yellow perch (18.17/gillnet) remained average in abundance, as did cisco (1.5/gillnet). Golden shiner (0.13/trapnet) remained in low numbers, while common carp (0.5/trapnet) was first sampled in 1991.  White sucker (1.0/gillnet) dropped to average abundance as did black bullheads (0.5/gillnet).  Yellow bullhead fell from 10.13/trapnet in 1984 to 1.63 in 1991, but remained in the average category.  Brown bullhead (0.17/gillnet) was again present low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nokay is a 660 acre lake located several miles east of Brainerd, in Crow Wing County.  There is a State-owned public access located on the west shore of the lake.  Development in 1984 included 33 homes/cabins and 4 resorts along the lake's 4.9 miles of shoreline.  The lake is 42 feet deep and about 33% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with moderate phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity was somewhat below average for lakes in the area in '97.  Bottom soils in water less than four feet deep were primarily sand, with varying amounts of various sized rock and muck also present.The aquatic plant community had fair diversity when last sampled, in 1984.  Emergent species help control nutrients and shoreline erosion.  Species like bulrush also enhance the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Species like cattail help stabalize shorelines.  Species like wild rice can enhance spawning habitat for northern pike.  Submerged and floating leafed species provide cover and food sources for a wide variety of aquatic species.A test netting was conducted in 1997.  When compared to similar type lakes, catches of bullheads and green sunfish were in the \"low\" category.  The rock bass catch was in the \"high\" category.  Other species were present in numbers which are \"average\" for this lake type.The northern pike catch was in the \"average\" category.  The 1994 year class was most abundant of the four sampled.  Pike growth was good.  Size averaged 22 inches and 3.0 lbs. in '97, slightly smaller than averages found in '94 but slightly larger than those from 1991.Walleyes have been stocked every third year, beginning in 1986.  Catch rates have generally been in the \"average\" category in the three netting done since then.  Six to eight year classes were present in each of those nettings.  Fish from both stocking and non-stocking years were well represented, and growth has been good.  The 1993 year class (a non-stocking year) was most abundant in the '97 catch.  Size has consistently averaged about 18 inches and 2 lbs. since 1991.The largemouth bass catch was in the \"average\" category in '97.  Several year classes were sampled and young bass appeared to have satisfactory growth.The bluegill catch was \"average\" and similar to 1991 results.  The 1994 year class was the most abundant of the six ages sampled.  Bluegill growth was slow.  About 7% of the bluegills measured from trap nets were at least 7.0 inches long in '97.  The value was less than 1% in 1991.The black crappie catch was in the \"average\" category, and was similar to catches dating to the '84 netting.  Four age classes were present in the sample from trap nets.The yellow perch catch was in the \"average\" category and was similar to catch rates dating back to 1984.  Four age classes were sampled and growth was slow.  The 1993 year class was most abundant.  Perch provide an important forage base for gamefish in the lake.  Tullibee, another forage species, was caught in \"average\" numbers.  Results were similar to past nettings.  The white sucker catch as in the \"low\" category in '94, but was, again, in the \"average\" category in '97.Other species sampled in '97 included: bowfin (dogfish), hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed.  Catch rates for these species were all in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nokay Lake is a 660 acre lake located in Crow Wing County 10 miles east of Brainerd.  A small public access is located on the west side of the lake.  Nokay reaches depths of 42 feet, with 33% of the lake 15 feet deep or less.  Water clarity is good with a secchi disk depth of 13.5 feet.  The shoreline is moderately developed with one resort present.  Extensive bulrush beds are located around the lake and around Hiawatha Island.    Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2014 were below average at 2.4/gillnet, while the average size was above average (18.8 inches and 2.6 lbs.).  Walleye up to 27.8 inches were captured.  Natural reproduction is minimal with the majority of walleyes coming from fingerling stocking occurring every third year.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was average at 7.3/gillnet.  Average size was 23 inches and 2.8 lbs.  Northern pike up to 36 inches were present with 26% measuring over 24 inches in length.   Voluntary catch and release of these larger fish will help keep a balanced northern population.  Seven year classes were present, with the 2010 year class making up 43% of the population.  <br> \n  <br> \nBlack crappies were captured in average numbers in both gillnets and trapnets.  Size was below average with only 22% being over 8 inches in length.  Two and three year olds made up 70% of the catch.  Bluegills were captured in average numbers, and were of average size.  Bluegills over 7 inches made up 17% of the catch.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled during spring electrofishing at a rate of 64.6/hr. of run-time.  Largemouth bass averaged 12.6 inches, with 30% measuring 15 inches or greater.  Bass up to 18 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Nokay Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching, lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as remove the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
