                "narrative": "<p>Little Loon is a 167-acre lake located within the Wilderness of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA).  The lake is relatively long with a north-south fetch of over a mile.  Maximum depth is 68 feet and other than the north end, the shoreline drops off quickly.  The lake has a bog-stain tint to its waters but otherwise is relatively clear (Secchi disk of 9.0 feet). Substrates are dominated by boulder and rubble-sized rock.  Like Loon Lake downstream, however, sand is also common in Little Loon.  Aquatic vegetation is  scarce. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Loon lies on a popular canoe route into the BWCAW.  The Slim Lake portage, located in the northeast corner of Little Loon is well traveled.   There are two USFS campsites on the lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the most common gamefish species caught during this survey.  The gill-net abundance (3.33/net) was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes in the same classification.  Lengths of northern pike averaged 21.9 inches.  The largest pike caught was 29.6 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net abundance (1.83/net) was below average for lakes similar to Little Loon. The walleye caught, however, were relatively large, ranging in length from 14.1 to 21.3 inches and averaging 1.9 pounds.  Fifty-five percent of the catch were longer than 17 inches.  Growth rates of Little Loon Lake walleye were slow. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were also present in Little Loon Lake.  The gill-net abundance (0.67/net) was typical for lakes in the same classification as Little Loon.  The average size of bass caught however, exceed two pounds and was exceptional.   <br> \n <br> \nSeveral other species were caught in Little Loon Lake. These species included burbot, lake whitefish and cisco.  Cisco appear to be the primary forage species in this lake.</p>",
