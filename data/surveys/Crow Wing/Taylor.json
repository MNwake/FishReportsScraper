Average weight was 2.12 lbs, and median length was 21 inches (range = 16-29 inches) of which 70% were age 3.  Growth was good.  Pumpkinseed (39.25/trap net) abundance was high.  Average size small (0.04 lb) and median length only 4.0 inches. Bluegill (84.75/trapnet) was also high.  Average size 0.15 lb, median length was 6.0 inches with 3.2% of measured fish at least 7.0 inches long. Ages 2-5 were sampled, growth was good and about 59% of measured fish were age 4.  Largemouth bass was not caught in stationary nets.  Young-of-the-year bass were sampled by shoreline seining.  Black crappie (1.75/ trapnet) was present in average numbers for the lake class.  Ages 3-6 were sampled and showed good growth.  Nine of sixteen fish were age 4. Average size was 0.30 lb and median length 7.5 inches (range = 6.5-10.5 inches) lower quartile value for both numbers (2.0/ gillnet) and average size 0.10 lb.  Fish were 5.5-7.4 inches long.  Black bullhead (25.5/trapnet) was abundant and of average size (0.32 lb) for the lake class.</p>",
