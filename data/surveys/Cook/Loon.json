                "narrative": "<p>Loon Lake is a classic deep Canadian Shield lake, managed primarily for Lake Trout and Smallmouth Bass.  This was the first of two standard surveys scheduled in the 2013 lake management plan to monitor Lake Trout and Smallmouth Bass, and to continue the evaluation of the Northern Pike special regulation on this lake.  Northern Pike in Loon Lake have been covered by a 30-inch minimum size limit since 2003.  Gunflint Lake was the control lake for that evaluation. <br> \n <br> \nOnly fair numbers of Lake Trout were found in the 2015 survey, and most were small.  The combined Lake Trout catch in deep and shallow gill net sets (0.92 fish/set) fell just below the long range goal from the 2013 plan (1.0 fish/set), and was the lowest seen in this lake since 1970.  All of the Lake Trout collected in 2015 had been produced naturally.  Fish as old as 13 years were taken (although most were younger), and six year classes contributed to the catch.  None of the year classes sampled appeared to have been strong, but some reproduction had apparently been occurring on a fairly consistent basis.  Growth of young Lake Trout had been slow; fish reached an average length of just 7.8 inches at the end of their fourth year, compared to an area average of 12.1 inches.  Slow growth was likely due to intense competition from Cisco for invertebrate forage. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass appeared to have been fairly abundant in near-shore areas in 2015, but most were small.  Few fish were found in off-shore areas, and only two fish larger than 11 inches were captured.  Similar results (large numbers of small fish) have been seen in most past surveys of this lake.   <br> \n <br> \nAs has usually been the case in Loon Lake, the Northern Pike gill net catch was low, but included several larger fish.  Northern Pike benefit from the excellent forage provided by Cisco in this lake, and from cool-water refuge areas the lake provides.  Survey data suggested the objectives of the 2003 Northern Pike regulation had been met.  However, it was impossible to say whether the regulation was the cause because the Northern Pike population in the unregulated control lake (Gunflint) also improved over the same period. <br> \n <br> \nLoon Lake has consistently supported small numbers of Walleye, and often produces some large fish of that species.  That was again the case in 2015.  The combined Walleye catch in deep and shallow gill net sets (0.42 fish/set) was below the lower edge of the normal range for this type of lake (0.58 fish/set), while the mean weight for Walleye taken in those nets (4.48 lb/fish) was well above normal.  Walleye as old as 18 years were collected, but only four year classes contributed to the catch.  Walleye reproduction in this lake has been low and sporadic, despite the presence of excellent spawning habitat in many locations. <br> \n <br> \nCisco remained abundant in Loon Lake in 2015.  The combined catch in deep and shallow gill net sets (9.08 fish/set) was high for a lake of this type, but was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1987. Cisco in Loon Lake are heavily infested with the tapeworm Trienophorus, and so are not desirable for human consumption.   <br> \n <br> \nLoon Lake is one of very few lakes in the Grand Marais area that support significant panfish populations.  The 2015 Bluegill trap-net catch was well above average for this type of lake (or for any lake in this area), and although most were small, a few exceeded six inches in length.  Rock Bass were also abundant, and few may have been large enough to have been of interest to anglers. <br> \n</p>",

Lake trout stocking had contributed to the population, but there was also substantial natural reproduction.

A few large walleye and northern pike were found, but overall abundance of these species appeared to be low.  Of the panfish species collected, only rock bass were found in sufficient numbers and size to be of much interest to anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake trout were fairly abundant, but were slow-growing, with few large fish present.  Lake trout stocked through 1993 accounted for 40% of the lake trout catch; the rest had been produced naturally.  Walleye abundance was low, but appeared to be normal for this lake.  Northern pike were fairly abundant, and most were over 25 inches in length.  Smallmouth bass were abundant but small.  No smallmouth bass larger than 12 inches were found, and most were less than 10 inches in length.  Smallmouth bass grew very slowly, and the population could be described as \"stunted.\"  Rock bass were fairly abundant, and were providing a small panfish fishery in 1996.Readers should be aware that catches of fish in gill nets listed for 1996 in the standard lake report for this lake are for shallow gill net sets only, and do not include catches in deep gill nets, which are used to sample northern cisco and lake trout.  Combined catches in deep and shallow gill nets in 1996 were:Species\t\t\tNumber/net\tAverage weightLake trout\t\t1.25\t\t0.88Northern pike\t\t0.75\t\t5.69Rock bass\t\t0.92\t\t0.23Smallmouth bass\t\t0.42\t\t0.34Northern cisco\t\t2.92\t\t0.44Walleye\t\t\t0.25\t\t3.03White sucker\t\t0.83\t\t2.30</p>",

AGE IV LAKE TROUT APPEARED OT HAVE GROWN SLOWLY COMPARED TO AGES II AND VI, WHICH SHOWED AVERAGE GROWTH FOR COOK COUNTY. ALTHOUGH SOME NATURAL REPRODUCTION HAS OCCURR- ED, IT APPEARS THAT STOCKING IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES IN LOON LAKE.  STOCKED LAKE TROUT (IDENTIFIED BY ADIPOSE FIN-CLIPS) ACCOUTNED FOR 80, 100, AND 20% OF THE 1988, 1986, AND 1984 YEAR CLASS FISH COLLECTED, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, FIELD CREWS MAY HAVE FAILED TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE STOCKED 1988 YEAR CLASS BECAUSE THEY WERE UNAWARE THAT THE FISH HAD RECEIVED A LEFT PECTORAL RATHER THAN AN ADIPOSE CLIP.  THE GILLIS LAKE STRAIN OF LAKE TROUT HAS BEEN STOCKED IN LOON LAKE SINCE 1987; IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS STRAIN MAY BE SHOWING BETTER SURVIVAL THAN THOSE PREVIOUSLY STOCKED. WALLEYE ABUNDANCE WAS LOW, BUT THEIR SIZE WAS GOOD; 67% OF THE WALLEYE COLLECTED WERE OVER 16 IN.  GROWTH WAS AVERAGE FOR COOK COUNTY. LOON LAKE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE TROPHY WALLEYE; A 17.4 LB FISH WAS TAKEN BY AN ANGLER IN 1989. BLUEGILL SHOULD PROVIDE SOME ANGLING POTENTIAL IN LOON LAKE;  44% OF THE BLUEGILL COLLECTED WERE OVER 6 IN AND ABUNDANCE WAS RELATIVELY HIGH FOR THIS AREA.  BLUEGILL ABUNDANCE HAS APPARENTLY INCREASED DRAMATICALLY SINCE THE 1987 ASSESSMENT, WHEN ONLY ONE FISH WAS COLLECTED. SMALLMOUTH BASS WERE ABUNDANT BUT SMALL; NO SMALLMOUTH BASS OVER 12 IN WERE COLLECTED. SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES WERE REPRESENTED WITH THE 1987 YEAR CLASS TEH STRONGEST, COMPRISING 39% OF THE SMALLMOUTH BASS COLLECTED.  GROWTH WAS SLOW BY COOK COUNTY STANDARDS. NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE WAS LOW; HOWEVER, 60% OF THE FISH COLLECTED WERE OVER 25 IN.  NORTHERN CISCO WERE ABUNDANT; HOWEVER, MANY WERE OF A SIZE WHICH COULD ONLY BE UTILIZED BY LARGE GAME FISH. WHITE SUCKER ABUNDANCE WAS AVERAGE FOR THIS LAKE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2003 lake trout catch was about average for a lake of this class.  All but two lake trout collected had been produced naturally, with the two stocked fish being from the 1993 yearling stocking.  Several year classes were included in the catch, although none had been exceptionally strong.  Lake trout growth had been slow, at least for young fish;  five-year-old fish averaged just 12.5 inches in length when collected in late August.  The presence of a large northern cisco population provided some trophy potential for lake trout (and northern pike) in this lake, but they also competed with small lake trout for forage, resulting in slow growth for lake trout in their early years.The 2003 smallmouth bass catch was about average for this lake.  Loon Lake is known as a producer of large numbers of small, slow-growing smallmouth bass.  Slow smallmouth bass growth was confirmed in this assessment; four-year-old fish averaged just 8.5 inches in length in late August.The northern pike catch in 2003 was average for a lake of this class.  Average size of the fish collected in 1999 was excellent.  Northern pike growth rates had been good.  A special regulation was implemented on Loon Lake in 2003.  The regulation established a minimum size limit of 30 inches for northern pike.  As per normal inland regulations, only one northern pike over 30 inches may be taken daily.  This regulation was implemented to maintain the high quality northern pike population found in Loon Lake.Rock bass and bluegill were present to provide some limited panfishing opportunity.  Few fish over 6 inches were present, but they were abundant.  Low numbers of walleye are present in this lake, and only three were caught in the 2003 assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Loon Lake is covered by a special regulation for northern pike (a 30-in minimum size limit), implemented in 2003 and designed to preserve a high quality population in this lake.  This was the second of two surveys scheduled in the 2005 lake management plan as part of the evaluation of that regulation. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake trout gill net catch in 2011 was within the normal range for a lake of this class, and was similar to catches observed in this lake since 1970.  The catch met the long range goal established in the 2005 lake management plan (a minimum of 1.0 fish/set).  The mean weight for lake trout taken in gill nets was low for a Class 1 lake, but was similar to mean weights seen in this lake historically.  Several year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the catch.  No lake trout younger than four years were taken, but that has not been unusual in assessments of natural lake trout lakes.  Lake trout growth had been slow; fish reached a mean length of 9.5 inches by the end of their fourth year, compared to an average of 12.1 inches for similar lakes in this area.  Slow growth of young lake trout may have been due to intense competition for invertebrate forage from the relatively large cisco population in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe smallmouth bass gill net catch was low for a lake of this type, and was one of the lower catches seen in this lake historically.  No smallmouth bass were taken in trap nets.  Sample sizes for smallmouth bass were too small to describe growth.  Although the bass catch was low, it is likely that they remained abundant.  Smallmouth bass in Loon Lake tend to be small, with few fish larger than 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch was also low, but walleye have never been abundant, or even common, in Loon Lake, and the 2011 catch was typical.  The lake does produce an occasional large walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch was within the normal range for a Class 1 lake, and was similar to past catches in this lake.  Most of the northern pike taken in 2011 were fairly large, and the mean weight for fish taken in gill nets was above the normal range for the lake class.  There was little evidence for a significant change in the quality of the northern pike population since the special regulation was implemented (it remained high).  Since that regulation was intended to preserve, and not necessarily improve, the quality of the fishery, it could be considered successful if it just maintains the pre-regulation status quo.  Recent legislation extended the lifetime of the northern pike regulation, mandating another ten years for evaluation.   <br> \n <br> \nCisco are probably the most important forage species available to lake trout, northern pike, and walleye in this lake.  The 2011 gill net catch was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1987.  From the length distribution of the catch, it appeared that at least two relatively strong year classes were present in 2011.   <br> \n <br> \nSeveral lakes in Cook County have been infested with spiny waterflea.  Many of those lakes have been larger lake trout lakes, like Loon Lake.  Spiny waterflea have not yet been reported from Loon Lake, and a series of vertical plankton tows done in 2011 again failed to find any. <br> \n <br> \nSampling of the nearshore fish community was done using quarter-in-mesh trap nets, a 15-ft, one-eighth-inch-mesh beach seine, and backpack electrofishing gear.  Prior to sampling done in 2011, Loon Lake was known to support yellow perch, white sucker, walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, rock bass, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, lake trout, cisco, and splake, with splake seen only rarely.   Nearshore sampling  in 2011 added Iowa darter to the list of fish species known to be present in this lake.  Although the lake has been sampled several times with gear capable of collecting small nearshore fish species (boat electrofishing and quarter-in-mesh trap nets), no minnows of any kind have ever been collected. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Loon Lake is part of the headwaters for the Rainy River system, discharging to that system via Crab and Gunflint Lakes.  It is a classic deep Canadian Shield lake, managed primarily for Lake Trout and Smallmouth Bass.  This was the second of two standard surveys scheduled in the 2013 lake management plan to monitor Lake Trout and Smallmouth Bass, and to complete the evaluation of the Northern Pike special regulation on this lake.  The first survey was done as scheduled in 2015.  Based on those surveys, the management plan for Loon Lake will be revised in March 2021.  Comments on the management of the lake will be welcome as we work on that plan. <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of Lake Trout were present in 2019, including some fish up to 30 inches in length.  The combined Lake Trout catch in deep and shallow gill net sets (1.67 fish/set) exceeded the long range goal from the 2013 plan (1.0 fish/set), and was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1970.  All of the Lake Trout collected in 2019 had been produced naturally.    Seven year classes contributed to the catch, including fish as old as 14 years.  None of the year classes sampled appeared to have been exceptionally strong, but reproduction had apparently been occurring on a fairly consistent basis.  Growth of young Lake Trout had been slow; across all age classes fish reached a mean length of just 8.4 inches at the end of their fourth year, compared to an area average of 12.1 inches.  Slow growth of young Lake Trout was likely due to intense competition from Cisco for invertebrate forage.  Larger Lake Trout would have benefited from the excellent Cisco forage base in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nAs has often been the case, sampling in 2019 yielded mixed messages concerning Smallmouth Bass abundance.  The catch in trap nets was high, while the gill net catch was low.  It was clear, however, that bass in this lake tended to be small, with just a few exceeding 11 inches in length.  In 2019 Smallmouth Bass appeared to have been fairly abundant in nearshore areas; the trap net catch exceeded the normal range for this type of lake, and was the second highest ever seen in Loon Lake.  Fewer fish were seen off shore, and the gill net catch was quite low for a lake of this class.    Most of the Smallmouth Bass taken in 2019 were under 10 inches in length, but that was not unusual for this lake.   Smallmouth Bass growth had been slow; fish reached a mean length of just 5.4 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 7.0 inches.  It took about six years for most fish to reach 10 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nAs has usually been the case, Northern Pike in Loon Lake were low in numbers but large in size in 2019.  The combined Northern Pike catch in deep and shallow gill net sets (0.42 fish/set) was within the normal range for the lake class (0.27-1.02 fish/set), and was similar to most past catches in this lake.  Although based on only five fish, the mean weight for fish taken in gill nets was above the normal range for the lake class.  Northern Pike as old as seven years were collected and growth of young fish had been somewhat faster than average for the area.  <br> \n <br> \nThe objective of the 2003 Northern Pike special regulation, to prevent a decline in relative size distribution (percent of fish over 24 inches in length) while maintaining historic proportions of 30-inch or larger fish in gill net catches, appeared to have been met by 2019.  However, improvements in the Northern Pike population in Gunflint Lake (the exprimental control) appeared to have been at least as great, suggesting the the population in Loon Lake might have done well for reasons not related to the regulation.  Fishing pressure targeting Northern Pike had been very low on Loon and Gunflint Lakes; the goal of the regulation was to maintain the quality of the fishery against possible future increases in fishing pressure on those lakes.  We do not know whether fishing pressure changed in either lake during the regulation period, since no creel survey data are available.   Results of post-regulation surveys in Loon Lake suggested the Northern Pike size distribution had remained the same or improved slightly since 2003, and that numbers of fish taken (in surveys) larger than 30 inches did not decline.  However, in Gunflint Lake similar results were observed, despite a more liberal season (continuous) and more liberal size and bag limits.   <br> \n <br> \nBased on survey results obtained through 2015, in the fall of 2018 we recommended the Northern Pike regulation on Loon Lake be dropped.  Public input indicated no interest in retaining the regulation, so on March 1 2020, Northern Pike regulations on Loon Lake reverted to the standard for the Northeast Zone - a bag limit of two fish, with a 30-40-inch protected slot, with one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in Loon Lake have always been low, and the 2019 gill net catch of just a single fish was not unusual for this lake.  Walleye recruitment in this lake has been low and sporadic, despite the presence of excellent spawning habitat in many locations. <br> \n <br> \nCisco remained abundant in Loon Lake in 2019.  The combined catch in deep and shallow gill net sets (8.83 fish/set) was at or above the average for the lake class (7.65 fish/set), and was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1987.  Almost all Cisco taken in 2019 were heavily infested with Triaenophorus, a tapeworm that forms large cysts in muscle tissue.  While Cisco still provided excellent forage for Lake Trout and Northern Pike, their value for human consumption was very limited.  <br> \n <br> \nLoon Lake is one of very few lakes in the area that support significant panfish populations.  Bluegill and Rock Bass trap net catches in 2019 were the highest ever seen in this lake; both exceeded normal ranges for the lake class.  Most fish of both species were small, but there were enough over six inches in length to have driven some angler interest.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were never abundant in Loon Lake, but since the early 1980s, when Rock Bass become established, they have all but disappeared.  White Sucker gill net catches have also declined over the same period.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 1999 lake trout catch was about average for a lake of this class, but it was one of the higher catches observed in this lake historically.  At least two thirds of the lake trout collected had been produced naturally.  Several year classes were included in the catch, although none had been exceptionally strong.  Lake trout growth had been slow, at least for young fish;  five-year-old fish averaged just 12.2 inches in length when collected in late August.  The presence of a large northern cisco population provided some trophy potential for lake trout (and northern pike) in this lake, but they also competed with small lake trout for forage, resulting in slow growth for lake trout in their early years.The 1999 smallmouth bass catch was about average for this lake.  Loon Lake is known as a producer of large numbers of small, slow-growing smallmouth bass.  Slow smallmouth bass growth was confirmed in this assessment; four-year-old fish averaged just 8.5 inches in length in late August.The northern pike catch in 1999 was high for a lake of this class, and it was the highest ever observed in this lake.  Average size of the fish collected in 1999 was excellent.  Northern pike were feeding on yellow perch, smallmouth bass, and northern cisco, and growth rates had been good.Rock bass and bluegill were present to provide some limited panfishing opportunity.  Few fish over 6 inches were present, but the rock bass, at least, were abundant.  </p>",

Growth rates for lake trout had been slow compared to similar lakes in the area.  Although many of the lake trout collected were quite old (up to 23 years of age), slow growth limited the lake's ability to produce many larger fish. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were also fairly abundant in 2007, and although there may have been some improvement in their size in recent years, most remained small.  Growth rates for smallmouth bass had also been somewhat below average for the area.  Anglers fishing smallmouth bass on this lake can expect fairly high catch rates, but few fish larger than 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLoon Lake is currently covered by a 30-inch minimum size limit for northern pike.  Although northern pike abundance in this lake was low in 2007, the average size of the fish that were taken was high.  Forty-three percent of northern pike collected in 2007 (in all sampling gears) were 30-inches in length or larger. <br> \n  <br> \nThe walleye catch in 2007 was typical for this lake - few fish, but large size.  Northern cisco remained abundant, and provided an excellent high-quality forage base for northern pike, walleye, and those lake trout large enough to take them. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
