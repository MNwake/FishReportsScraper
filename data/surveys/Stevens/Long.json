                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a shallow, 579-acre prairie lake located approximately two miles southwest of Cyrus in west-central Minnesota.  Maximum depth is 12.0 feet.  Wind-driven suspension of sediments and subsequent algal blooms can significantly reduce water clarity through summer months.  In response to seasonally poor water quality, diversity and density of submerged plants is limited.  Sight- feeding predators such as northern pike and largemouth bass struggle to maintain a population.  Numbers of bass and northern pike are very low.  Open water species such as walleye and black crappie are better able to tolerate turbid water and very limited vegetated habitat.  Even these valued gamefishes are subject to catastrophic losses from occasional summer and winterkill events.  Partial winterkills were documented in 2001 and 2004.  <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked at an alternate year frequency. Survey statistics describe a quality walleye fishery.  Gillnet catches during the 2011 survey were lower than 2006 catches, but still within the range of expected catch rates for similar lakes.  Age distribution of 2011 captures correlated well with stocking chronology.  Growth of young fish is excellent.  Age-2 walleye averaged 17.0 inches in length at the time of the August survey.  Mean size was 18.9 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Twenty-two percent of walleye captured during the 2011 survey exceeded 20.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nStocking of adult black crappie in 2002 was successful in establishing a self-sustaining fishery.  Black crappie catches during the 2011 survey exceeded expected catch rates for similar lakes. Most captures were young fish.  Average length of crappie captured was 8.0 inches.  Crappie grow quickly and the many three-year-old crappie in the population should exceed 10.0 inches in length in 2012.  The largest black crappie measured 13.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch have prospered in response to lower walleye densities and absence of severe winterkill events since 2004.   Long Lake is one of few lakes in the Glenwood Management Area that have perch large enough to stimulate angler interest and harvest.  Signs of harvest may have been evident in the length distribution of the 2011 population sample.  Twenty percent of yellow perch captured during the 2006 survey exceeded 12.0 inches in length.  No 12.0-inch or larger yellow perch were measured in 2011.  Only a few exceeded 10.0 inches, but there were many perch approaching 10.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills depend on aquatic vegetation for feeding and escape cover.  There are also not very tolerant of low dissolved oxygen concentrations, thus few if any were captured in early surveys.  In probable response to improved habitat conditions a modest population expansion was documented during the 2011 survey.  Four age groups were represented in the population sample.  Due to fast growth, approximately 14% of captures exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  The largest fish measured 11.4 inches.  In absence of significant environmental disturbances such as loss of water clarity or winterkill events, this population may finally be able to support quality fishing opportunities if harvest is not excessive. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nFishery Update........................... <br> \n <br> \nA black crappie die-off was documented on August 29, 2011.  Approximately 1,000 dead crappie were observed.  These fish ranged from 5.0 to 11.0 inches in length.   An ice-out population assessment will be completed in 2012 to determine severity of the summerkill event. <br> \n</p>",

Survey components included late-winter water quality measurement and early-spring trap netting.  Late-winter dissolved oxygen readings were low, which indicated gamefish losses due to winterkill were possible.  However, early-spring trap netting results suggested that winterkill severity was low and restorative stockings were not warranted.  Gamefish species present included Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a 620-acre lake located near Cyrus in Stevens County.  It is a shallow, turbid prairie lake with a maximum depth of 12.0 ft.  A gravel access is located on the west side of the lake. <br> \n  <br> \nWater quality and clarity can be poor during summer months in response to wind and wave-induced re-suspension of sediments and subsequent algal blooms.  Water clarity was 5.5 feet during this survey.  Turbidity causes poor water clarity and can limit aquatic vegetation diversity and coverage.  Limited water clarity also hampers feeding efficiency of sight-feeding predators such as Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass.  Open water species such as Walleye and Black Crappie fare better in fertile basins with turbid water and limited aquatic vegetation.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch made up the greatest total biomass of gamefishes captured in Long Lake in 2019.   Occasional summer and winterkill events have undermined fish community structure and fishing potential, but based on catch statistics from the 2019 standard survey, Long Lake can offer good fishing opportunities.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches were lower than past surveys, but near average for similar lakes.  Gill net catches averaged 8.2 Walleye/gill net.  A majority of the Walleye catch was comprised of two-year-olds recruited from the 2017 fry stocking.  Average length was 15.7 inches.  Age distribution extended to age 13.  The largest capture measured 25.9 inches.  Seven year classes were represented in the 2019 gill net catch.  Walleye grow exceptionally fast, reaching 17.3 inches at age 3.   Opportunities to catch harvestable size fish should be good in 2020. <br> \n   <br> \nBlack Crappies proved to be very abundant.  Most captures were two-year-old fish, thus the crappie catch was dominated by 6.0 to 8.0 inch fish.  Similar to other gamefishes in Long Lake, crappie grow fast.  The largest capture measured 14.4 inches.  Those two-year-old crappie should approach 10.0 inches late in 2020.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Yellow Perch add to panfishing opportunities.  Bluegill are not abundant, but they can grow large.  The largest Bluegill caught was an eight-year-old fish measuring 10.5 inches.   Yellow Perch are very abundant, but at present, most captures were young fish, recruits from a strong 2018 year class.  Perch grow very fast and much of the population was already between 6.5 to 8.5 inches in length.  If fast growth can be sustained, good perch fishing opportunities should develop.  The largest Yellow Perch caught measured 12.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nDaytime electrofishing took place on June 4th to target Largemouth Bass. Few Largemouth Bass were sampled. Of the few fish that were sampled, average length was 12.7 inches.  The largest capture measured 16.9 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes sampled during the 2019 survey included Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n   <br> \nLong Lake is currently not an infested water. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are easily moved from infested to non-infested waters and can negatively affect lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain water from their boat before leaving the access. For more information regarding aquatic invasive species see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a shallow, turbid, and seasonally hypereutrophic basin.  The lake has a history ofperiodic winterkill; the last occurring during the winter of 1988-89.  Dense algal blooms andwind-driven resuspension of sediment significantly reduces water clarity.  Diversity and density of theaquatic plant community is limited.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of only 5.0 feet and issparse in most areas.  Common cattail is prevalent in the bays on the north side of the lake, howeverthere is little emergent vegetation present in the main body of the lake.  These environmentalconditions provide little habitat for sunfish, bass,  and northern pike, thus the gamefish communityis limited.  However, walleye have been able to thrive under the conditions in Long Lake. Walleye catches averaged 50.5 fish/gillnet in 1996.  Gillnet catches averaged 42.0 fish/net in 1986 and114.0 fish/net in 1979.  These catch rates greatly exceed the normal range of mean catch rates fromlakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (3.2 - 15.3 fish/gillnet).  Mean weight offish captured was 1.3 pounds.  There is a correlation between fry stocking and year class strength inrecent years.  Strong year classes in 1993 and 1995 correspond to years of fry stocking and cohortsfrom the blank year in 1994 were practically non-existent.  High density fry stocking in 1992 (2500 perlittoral acre) was apparently unsuccessful.  Yellow perch catches averaged 13.5 fish/gillnet which iswithin the expected range of mean catch rates from similar lakes (3.0 - 22.5).  Gillnet catchesaveraged 19.5 fish/net in 1986.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1996 was 0.2 pounds.  There were nosunfish captured in testnets or largemouth bass in 0.75 hours of daytime electrofishing.  The twoprevious surveys also failed to capture any sunfish.  Bluegill and black crappie broodfish were stockedin 1989, however there is little indication of successful reproduction.  Orangespotted sunfish werecaptured with shoreline seining in 1996.  Black bullhead are abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 155.0fish/net.  Gillnet catches averaged 108.5 fish/net in 1986 and 83.0 fish/net in 1979.  Trapnet catchesaveraged 67.7 fish/net in 1996.  Mean weight of fish captured in gillnets and trapnets was 0.1 poundsand 0.2 pounds, respectively.  Bigmouth buffalo and common carp catches averaged 9.5 and 7.0fish/gillnet, respectively.  Trapnet catches averaged 9.3 common carp/net.  These catch rates indicaterelatively abundant populations of these non-game species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a shallow, 579-acre prairie lake located approximately two miles southwest of Cyrus.  Maximum depth is 12.0 ft.  Wind-driven re-suspension of sediments and subsequent algal blooms can significantly reduce water clarity through summer months.   In response to seasonally poor water quality, diversity and density of the submerged plant community is limited.  These environmental conditions provide little habitat for sunfishes such as largemouth bass and bluegill.  Ambush, sight feeders such as northern pike struggle to maintain a population.  Pelagic, or open water species such as walleye and black crappie are better able to tolerate turbid water and a lack of vegetation.   Even these valued gamefishes are subject catastrophic losses from occasional partial and severe winterkill events.  Partial winterkills were documented in late-February and early-March in 2001 and 2004.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite the less-than stellar description of the lake and fishery, anglers should not be too quick to dismiss Long Lake and similar shallow prairie lakes as fishing destinations.  Dependent upon restocking and frequency of winterkill, Long Lake can provide exceptional walleye fishing and unsurpassed yields of walleye fillets.   Walleye catches during the 2006 survey averaged 18.2 fish/gillnet, which approaches the upper end of normal catches for Lake Class 41.  Gillnet catches averaged 50.5 fish/net in 1996, 42.0 fish/net in 1986, and 114.0 fish/net in 1979.   Mean weight of walleye captured in 2006 was 0.60 lbs. Most captures were young, cohorts of 2004 and 2005 fry stockings.  Average size is much better than characterized by age distribution.  Growth rates are excellent.  Three- and five-year-old walleye in 2006 gillnet catches averaged 17.8 inches in length at age-3.   The walleye fishery is sustained with alternate year fry stockings. Contributions to population abundance can be very inconsistent, often resulting in boom or bust fishing experiences.  Partial winterkill can also impact population density and age distribution of walleye present. The greatest drawback to anglers may be the unpredictability of fishing next year. <br> \n <br> \nFishing opportunities extend beyond walleye.  Restorative stockings of adult black crappie in 2002 were successful in re-establishing a self-recruiting population.  Young-of-year, age-1, and age-3 crappie were captured during the 2006 fish community assessments.  Three-year-old crappie captured in 2006 had grown to 8.4 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are not abundant due to habitat limitations and predation, but perch do support fishing.  Twenty percent of yellow perch captured during the 2006 survey exceeded 12.0 inches in length.  Quality perch fishing opportunities are increasingly unique in western Minnesota.  Average size of perch in the population will likely decrease quickly with harvest.   <br> \n <br> \nLong Lake does have a public access.  Many maps don't depict the access, thus it is easily missed.  The access is located on the western side of the lake at the end of County Rd 1.  <br> \n</p>",

This survey found Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch in addition to the Walleyes and Black Bullheads. These additional species may have run up the creek from Cyrus Lake during the high water of the spring of 1986. There is a tremendous population of Walleyes in long lake (age 0) appears to have come from natural reproduction.  The 1984 and 1983 fry stockings were very successful (and/or natural reproduction was successful) and may have suppressed the effects of the 1985 fry stocking. Most of the Walleyes sampled were in the 15.0 19.0 ting excellent growth. A few larger Walleyes were also sampled. Black Bullhead populations are also high.</p>",
