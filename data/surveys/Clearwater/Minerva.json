                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minerva is a 230-acre lake with a maximum depth of 16 feet located 12 miles south of Bagley in Clearwater County.  There is a DNR public water access located on the southeast shore of the lake with an earthen ramp and parking for about 8 trucks/trailers.  Lake Minerva is managed for Walleye, Black Crappie, and Bluegill.  Statewide fishing regulations apply to all species. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes based on similarities in lake basin (depth, size) water chemistry (alkalinity, water clarity) and geographic location. Lake class can affect the type of fish community present in the lake.  Lake Minerva is in lake class 39.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Lake Minerva and other class 39 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Pine Lake, Rogstad Lake, and Lake Puposky.  <br> \n <br> \nA commonality between these class 39 lakes is they have all experienced winterkill periodically in their histories.  Lake Minerva had a history of frequent winterkill events when it had direct connection and flow through from Upper Rice Lake.  Water from shallow Upper Rice increased the oxygen depletion rate in Minerva resulting in winterkill in both basins.  Since the Upper Rice outlet was diverted for rice and waterfowl management Lake Minerva's fish community has improved and diversified.      <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Walleye catch rate was 4.33/gill net.  Walleye had a good average size of 21.75 inches and 4.12 lbs/fish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Northern Pike catch rate was 10.83/gill net.  Pike also had a good average size of 23.16 inches in length and 2.76 lbs/fish.  The largest Northern Pike captured in the 2016 assessment measured 32.09 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nCrappie, Bluegill, and Bass, all species that are sensitive to winterkill. Since reintroduction these species have now established very good fisheries.   The Black Crappie catch rate of 17.56/trap net was above the normal range found in similar lakes (0.80/trap net- 6.50/trap net).  Black Crappie captured had an average size of 8.38 inches in length and 0.33 lbs/fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Bluegill catch rate was 23/trap net.  Bluegill captured had an average size of 7.16 inches in length and 0.33 lbs/fish, with good numbers of quality-size fish present. <br> \n <br> \nAn electrofishing assessment targeting Largemouth Bass was conducted as part of the 2016 assessment of Lake Minerva.  The catch rate of 33.02 bass/hour indicates a healthy bass population.  Largemouth Bass up to 19.29 inches in length were captured, with a good average size of 15.75 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2016 assessment were Yellow Perch, White Sucker, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, and Bullhead species.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minerva is a class 39 lake and fish communities are compared with 115 other similar lakes found throughout Minnesota. Lakes of this class in the Bemidji area include Rockstad, and Moose(south of Shevlin). These lakes are typically shallow, have a high percentage of littoral area (water less than 15 feet deep) and a regular shoreline. Many of these lakes may have partial winter kills due to oxygen depletion during severe winters.      In general, the fish community in Lake Minerva has been experiencing a gradual, but steady recovery from the last severe winter kill in 1969. The first assessment after the kill, conducted in 1977, consisted of a fairly simple species  assemblage, dominated by yellow perch, white sucker, black bullhead, and northern pike (all species quite tolerant of low oxygen levels) or Walleye, (stocked frequently since winter kill), and a few pumpkinseed. In subsequent asessments the centrarchid community has continued to expand in total abundance and number of species.  Bluegill were first sampled in 1984, black crappie in 1989, and largemouth bass in 1995.  Bullhead (black and brown) abundance expanded after winter kill, peaking in 1989 at 230 per trap net, but subsided to 5 per trap net by 1995.   Centrarchids (bass/panfish) increased from 3% to 38% of the trap net catch by weight, while bullheads declined from 85% to 21% from 1989 to 1995. This indicates a positive shift in the fish community. The following is a summary of the current status of major fish species.      Walleye abundance was sampled at about three times the average for this lake class. The average weight of 1.6 pounds is slightly below average. The largest walleye sampled was about 29 inches in length, but the average was about 15 inches. Walleye fry are stocked every third year, providing the majority of the fishery but some natural reproduction is also occurring.      Northern pike are not as abundant as anticipated, by lake class averages. The sample of four northern pike per gill net is less than half that of comparable lakes. The average size of 21.3 inches and 2.3 pounds however is comparable for this lake class. There are typically 7-10 fish houses on the lake each winter with most effort directed toward the northern pike fishery.      Largemouth bass have not been sampled during previous surveys, but one large, (17\"+) bass and six others in the 5\"-7\" range were sampled during this assessment.      Bluegill have not been found during some previous assessments,  they were present in 1995, but the population was lower than that of comparable lakes. One previous assessment found lower bluegill abundance.  Bluegill that were sampled averaged more than one half pound.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were found at near average abundance though the size is smaller than average at less than one fourth pound.  Black crappie were found at about average abundance, and the size is excellent at about 1.2 pounds and twelve inches in length.       Yellow perch were sampled at higher than average abundance, with an average length of 7.1 inches.  Many of the perch have the parasites Neascus spp (black spot), or yellow grub. Black and brown bullheads were sampled in high abundance and have an average weight of more than three fourths of a pound.        At this time (March 96) Minerva Lake is experiencing very low oxygen concentrations, so populations documented above may be subject to change. Winter kills are caused by decaying of lake vegetation, a result of excessive snow cover, with flooded ice, and lack of light penetration.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minerva is a 236-acre lake with a maximum depth of 16 feet.  The size of the watershed that drains into the lake is 2,117 acres.  The lake is located 10 miles south of Shevlin in southern Clearwater County.  There is a DNR public access on the southeast corner of the lake off of county road 105.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lake Minerva is in lake class 39.  Lakes in this lake class are typically shallow with much of the lake less than 15 feet deep and also have a regular shape.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Big Pine, Three Island, Irving, Rogstad and Moose (south of Shevlin) Lakes.  Lake Minerva is mananged for walleye, bluegill and black crappie.Like many lakes in this lake class, Lake Minerva has a history of winterkilling.  A number of winterkill events were documented in the 1960's.  The lake avoided winterkill for a couple of decades allowing a diverse fish community to develop.  The last documented winterkill was a partial kill in the severe winter of 1995-96.  Walleye fry were stocked the next spring.  Spring assessments failed to sample any surviving bluegill to that species was reintroduced with adult brood stock.  Anglers now have a variety of species to fish for.  Walleye are sought after by many anglers.  They were sampled at a rate that was typical of other lake class 39 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from nine to 30 inches with an average length and weight of 18 inches and 2.2 pounds.  There is evidence that both natural reproduction and stocking are producing walleye for anglers in Lake Minerva.Northern pike were sampled at a rate that is typical of other lake class 39 lakes.  Northerns ranged in length from 13 to 36 inches with an average length and weight of 19.7 inches and 1.7 pounds.  There were five different ages identified in the sample with age 2 being the most abundant age.There are many members of the sunfish family that anglers would have success fishing for.  Largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, black crappie and bluegill were all sampled in 2002.  Bluegill size was desirable with the most common length falling between 8.5-9.0 inches.Black and brown bullhead are currently abundant in Lake Minerva.  Some are of a size that would be acceptable to anglers.  Bullheads can survive at low levels of oxygen and have an advantage in lakes that experience partial winterkill events.As with many lakes in the Bemidji area, continued shoreline development will likely impact fish habitat and water quality.  Shoreline areas are critical areas for fish production and water quality.  Overdeveloped shorelines can not support the fish, wildlife and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can greatly affect a lake's ability to produce fish and protect water quality.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting.  For more information on how to accomplish this, contact your local Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minerva Lake is located approximately 12 miles south of Shevlin in southern Clearwater County.  At 236 acres and with a maximum depth of 16 feet, the lake supports an abundance of aquatic vegetation and has a lightly developed lakeshore.  Often windswept and turbid, Minerva gives anglers the feel of a prairie lake, even though much of the shoreline is bordered by beautiful hardwood forest areas.  Minerva is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for bluegill and black crappie.  There is a DNR public access on the southeast portion of the lake just east of County Road 105. <br> \n <br> \nLike many lakes in Clearwater County, Minerva has a history of winterkill.  Several severe winterkill events were documented in the 1960's. The most recent was a partial kill during the severe winter of 1995-96.  Walleye and bluegill were reintroduced the following spring, and the fish community has remained stable since then.  A reduction in bullhead abundance is another sign that Minerva\u0019s fish community composition is stabilizing.  In the 2002 assessment, bullhead species made up approximately 65% of all fish captured in gill nets.  In 2009, they comprised only 8% of the total. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has declined gradually over the past five assessments.  This is most likely related to a more diverse fish community that has developed with the absence of recent winterkill conditions.  Walleye fry have been stocked every third year since 1985; however, the fry stocking strategy was changed in 2009 to two out of three years to augment recruitment.  The seven walleye captured in the 2009 population assessment were from six different year classes, providing evidence that both natural reproduction and stocking are producing walleye for anglers on Minerva. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2009, there was a quality bluegill population in Minerva Lake.  During the past 20 years, the bluegill population has changed from nonexistent to a density that is considered fairly typical for this lake class.  In 2009, bluegills ranged from 3 to 10 inches in length and seven different year classes were represented.  Growth rates of bluegill in Minerva Lake are considered very good and are similar or better than other Bemidji area lakes of this type.  By age 3, the average Minerva Lake bluegill is 5.6 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to walleye and bluegill, Minerva will occasionally produce catches of several other species sure to please the angler.  Northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, and yellow perch are all present at low to moderate densities, but with the opportunity for quality-sized fish. <br> \n</p>",
