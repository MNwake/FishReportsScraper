                "narrative": "<p>Wolfe Lake is a 3-acre pond located in St. Louis Park, Minnesota and has a maximum depth of 20 feet.  The pond has a fishing pier and its shoreline is encompassed within a city park.  The pond has been managed in the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program in since 2003 and is classified as a lake class 40.  Bluegill sunfish, black crappie, northern pike and largemouth bass have been stocked annually in Wolfe Lake. The last lake survey that was conducted was in 2002.  <br> \n <br> \nEight species of fish were caught during the three-day survey. Bluegills were the most abundant fish caught in trap nets at 53.7 fish per net lift.  This catch rate has significantly increased from 0.1 per net set in 2002, before the lake was being annually stocked with adult bluegill.  Bluegills measured from 3.0 to 7.1 inches in length, with a mean length of 5.1 inches.  Since the introduction of black crappie, the abundance has increased above the third quartile for class 40 lakes.  Trap net catches in this survey were shown to be 28.9 fish per net lift.  Black crappies were 4.9 to 8.1 inches, with an average length of 5.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSince initially stocking Wolfe Lake with northern pike, they have grown well in this environment.  Northern pike abundance in gill nets was 6.0 per net lift, above average for this lake type.  Northern pike ranged from 24.3 to 30.2 inches in length and averaged 26.3 inches and 3.9 pounds each.  Although gill nets are not the ideal sampling equipment for largemouth bass, the abundance of this species in gill nets was 4.0 fish per net lift, which is above the third quartile for this lake class. Largemouth bass were 7.6 to 15.0 inches in length, with a mean length of 9.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe average abundance of black bullhead has increased since the 2002 survey.  Other species sampled included pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish and one yellow perch.    <br> \n <br> \nSince becoming part of the FiN program, the City of St. Louis Park and FiN have partnered to install shore fishing blocks and have done a shoreline restoration project along 75% of the shoreline.  This has increased opportunity for angling and stewardship at Wolfe Lake. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information on Wolfe Lake visit:  http://www.stlouispark.org/. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at: www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The Fishing In the Neighborhood program and the City of St. Louis Park are partnering, beginning in 2003, to stock bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch, northern pike and largemouth bass for fishing and community and educational programs.  A project has also been planned to plant native vegetation along the shoreline to benefit fish and wildlife habitat, control erosion and deter geese from using the area in the summer.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wolfe Lake is a 3-acre pond located in St. Louis Park, Minnesota and has a maximum depth of 20 feet.  The pond has a fishing pier and its shoreline is encompassed within a city park (Wolfe Park).  The pond has been managed in the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2003, and regular stockings from a combination of Bluegill sunfish, Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass are made to provide fishing. In 2017, a Standard Survey was conducted to assess the gamefish population.   <br> \n <br> \nFive Northern Pike were captured in the gill net during this survey. Northern Pike measured from 26.7 to 33.5 inches in length, with a mean length of 29.5 inches. Northern Pike averaged 4.13 pounds. Five additional Northern Pike were collected with trap nets averaging 22.3 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nThe most abundant species sampled during this survey was Bluegill sunfish. Lengths of Bluegills ranged from 1.0 to 6.5 inches, with a mean length of 5.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed sunfish trap net catches were 46.0 per net. Lengths of Pumpkinseeds ranged from 3.2 to 6.2 inches, with a mean length of 4.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trap net catches were 6.3 per net. Black Crappie measured from 5.8 to 8.8 inches in length, with a mean length of 6.9 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nOther species captured during this survey included Black Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Largemouth Bass, White Crappie, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nThe FiN program conducts three to five fishing events a year at Wolfe Lake and although the panfish size structure is very small, the abundant numbers of fish are ideal for our fishing events. Most participants (usually first-time anglers) catch multiple fish and are extremely satisfied with their experiences.  <br> \n <br> \nFor more information on Wolfe Lake and Wolfe Park visit:  https://www.stlouispark.org/ or http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin/kidsponds/wolfe.html.  <br> \n(web link current as of March 2018) <br> \n</p>",
