Their growth rate was about average, though many quality size bluegill were present in the sample.  These are all old fish (greater than 8 years).  Black crappie numbers were good and they exhibit good growth rates.  Four year-classes of black crappie were present.</p>",

Variety Lake is 145 acres, has 2.3 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 29 feet.  Variety Lake is the source of the Pine River.  Shoal water soils are 10% boulder, 40% sand, and 50% muck.  The secchi disc reading was 10 feet and the water appeared to be clear.  The total alkalinity was 135 p.p.m.  Several emergent and submerged aquatic plants were found in Variety Lake.  The density rating was high (moderate) for most of the submerged and floating-leaved aquatic plants.Test netting indicated a good population of northern pike, yellow perch, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and largemouth bass.  The spawning areas for northern pike and centrarchids are good.  A high percentage of the northern pike, yellow perch, pumpkinseed, and bluegill were infected with black grub (Neascus).  Yellow perch were the only species examined that contained yellow grub (Clinostomum marginatum).</p>",
