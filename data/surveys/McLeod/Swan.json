                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Swan Lake in 2012. An aerator is operated during the winter to reduce the frequency and severity of winterkill. Winterkill has not been reported at Swan Lake for many years. Swan Lake is primarily managed for black crappie and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 24 walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 2.7/net, indicating low numbers were present. This represented the lowest catch rate since 1990 and was well below recent catch rates that averaged 15.5/net. Lengths ranged from 7.6 to 27.0 inches long with an average length of 17.7 inches. Ages varied from 1-14 years old with 7 year-classes present. Approximately 66% of the sample came from non-stocked years. Growth was fast. <br> \n <br> \nLike the 2007 sample, no northern pike were sampled in 2012. Catch rates have been low since 1985. Little preferred spawning habitat exists for northern pike in Swan Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 34 yellow perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 3.8/net, indicating low numbers were present. The catch rate in 2007 was 0.4/net. In 2012, lengths ranged from 5.4 to 6.8 inches long with an average length of 5.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 114 channel catfish were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 12.7/net, which was the highest ever recorded in Swan Lake. Channel catfish were first stocked in 1983 and last stocked in 2005. In 2012, lengths ranged from 10.2 to 23.0 inches long with an average length of 16.8 inches. A total of 24 channel catfish up to 21.1 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 2.7/net. Ages varied from 2-11 years old with 7 year-classes present. Approximately 92% corresponded to the 2005 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 3,284 black crappies were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 364.9/net, indicating high numbers were present. The catch rate in 2007 was 63.1/net and overall, catch rates since 2001 have increased. Gill netted black crappies were 4.1 to 9.8 inches long with an average length of 6.9 inches. A total 645 black crappies were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 71.7/net, also indicating high numbers were present. Ages varied from 1-6 years old with 6 year-classes present. Overall, 96% of the sample was 2 years old. Growth was moderate. <br> \n <br> \nJust 7 white crappies were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.8/net, indicating low numbers were present. The catch rate in 2007 was 10.8/net and was the highest ever recorded in Swan Lake. Lengths ranged from 5.5 to 9.5 inches long with an average of 7.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 58 bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 6.4/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. The catch rate in 2007 was 159.3/net and was the highest catch rate recorded in Swan Lake. In 2012, lengths ranged from 3.0 to 7.7 inches long with an average of 6.2 inches. Ages ranged from 1-8 years old with 8 year-classes present. Overall, 54% of the sample was 3 years old. Growth was poor. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 12 largemouth bass were sampled during spring night-time electrofishing for a catch rate of 9.0/hour on-time, indicating low numbers were present. Lengths were 5.8 to 8.2 inches long with an average length of 6.6 inches. All largemouth bass sampled in 2012 were 2 years old. <br> \n <br> \nOnly 7 black bullheads were sampled with gill nets in 2012 for a catch rate of 0.8/net, indicating low numbers were present. The catch rate in 2007 was 5.2/net and overall catch rates have decreased since 2001. No black bullheads were sampled with trap nets in 2012.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 53 common carp were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 5.9/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. The catch rate in 2007 was 14.2/net. Before 2007, only 1 common carp was ever sampled in Swan Lake. Lengths ranged from 14.7 to 20.6 inches long with an average of 17.7 inches. A total of 16 common carp were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.8/net, which was lower than the 2007 catch rate of 7.7/net. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nPrior to installation of a helixer aeration system, Swan Lake frequently winterkilled, and its population was composed primarily of black bullheads, northern pike and numerous small centrarchids (bluegill and crappie), especially black crappie.  The black crappie were not necessarily \"stunted\", but never had an opportunity to grow to sizes acceptable to anglers.  Subsequent to installation of helixer system, the fish population became more diverse and the average length of black crappie sampled increased.  Trap net catch per unit effort (CPUE) for black bullhead, at 13.00 fish per lift, was considerably below the lake class median of 38.04 fish per lift.  However, gill net CPUE, at 249.29 fish per lift, suggest that black bullhead are considerably more abundant in Swan Lake than was evidenced by trap net catches.  Black crappie was another species whose abundance was under represented by trap net samples.  Trap net CPUE for black crappie 0.67 fish per lift, below the normal range for the lake class, but gill net CPUE at 50.86 fish per lift, was above the normal range.  All crappie measured exceeded 7.4 inches and had an average length of 8.7\".  Yellow perch were present in the gillnet samples.  CPUE was 10.0 fish per lift, below the median of 12.80 fish per lift for the lake class.  The average size of perch sampled was 7.5 inches.  Trap net for bluegill, at 4.00 fish per lift, compared favorably with the lake class median of 3.38 fish per lift.  Channel catfish, stocked in 1983 and 1988 through 1989, were present in the gill net samples at 4.28 fish per lift.  Channel catfish sampled ranged in length from 14.9 inches to 26.9 inches, indicating that growth of stocked fish has been good.  Abundance of walleye and northern pike was low.  Gill net CPUE for both species was below the normal range for the lake class.  Walleye in the sample ranged in length from 7.0 to 19.9 inches, and pike ranged in length from 24.0 to 30.9 inches.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nImportant fish species sampled in the gillnets were northern pike, channel catfish, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch and walleye.  Net catches were compared to lake class 43 medians.  Only one northern and one largemouth bass were sampled in the gillnets for a catch per effort of 0.17/lift, which is below the normal range of the lake class for each species.  Neither species was sampled in trapnets.  Northern pike abundance appears to have been steadily declining from previous surveys.  Largemouth bass young of the year (yoy) did show up during shoreline seining in late summer.  Thirty yoy largemouth were sampled in two seine hauls.  These fish ranged in length from 1.2 to 3.3 inches.  Shoreline seining also seemed to indicate good reproduction of bluegill, black crappie and yellow perch.  Channel catfish were sampled in gillnets at a catch per effort of 4.5/lift.  No lake class medians have been established for channel catfish, but this compares favorably to catch per effort of other predators in this lake class.  Most catfish sampled ranged in length from 15 to 21 inches and should be acceptable to anglers.  Several age classes were also represented, indicating good survival of stocked fish.  Black crappie catches for the gillnets (11.8/lift) were above the median and very near the upper limit of the normal range.  Trapnet catches of black crappie (37.3/lift) were above the normal range.  Nearly 80% of the crappies sampled were age 1 and 2 fish.  Fish through age 7 were represented indicating stable recruitment.  However, past netting records indicate wide fluctuations in crappie abundance.  The yellow perch catch of 73/gillnet is a large increase from previous surveys.  This is well above the normal range of this lake.  Age 2 perch accounted for 97% of the sample.  These fish ranged in length from 6 to 8.9 inches, with most being over 7.5 inches.  These are now becoming an acceptable size and may provide an important component of the fishery within the next several years.  A walleye catch of 14/gillnet is also above the normal range for the lake.  Nearly 50% of these were age 1, probably resulting from a spring stocking of carryover yearlings.  Another 40% of the catch were age 3 and 4 fish ranging in length from 14 to 19 inches.  Previous surveys have never had walleye catches within or above the normal range.  Stocking effort through most of that time relied upon walleye fry stocking.  Recent walleye stocking has used fingerling and yearling fish, apparently with some success.  However, further assessment is needed to fully quantify the success of fingerling versus fry stocking.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that Swan Lake has probably never produced a good walleye fishery in the past.  It remains to be seen if these fish will now return to the creel.  Other fish taken in trapnets were bluegill, pumpkinseed and black bullhead.  Bluegill abundance has declined sharply from assessments done in 1985 and 1987.  At that time, trapnet catches were from 80 to 100 per lift, well above the normal range.  Most were smaller fish, not yet acceptable to anglers.  Black bullhead numbers were in the normal range for both gill and trapnets.  Nearly 60% of them were over 9 inches in length and may interest anglers or commercial fishermen.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Swan is a small lake (351 acres) located near the City of Silver Lake in McLeod County. A large county-owned access with a single cement boat ramp is located on the north shore within the Swan Lake Park. The park on the north side of the lake also has a fishing pier. A small state-owned access with a cement boat ramp is located at the southeast end of the lake along with a small fishing dock. Swan has 3 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 10 feet. A state-owned shorefishing area is present on the lake's southwest shoreline. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Swan is a class 43 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Winsted and Hook. An aeration system is operated during the winter months to provide a small refuge area for fish during severe winters. Winter anglers should stay well away from the thin ice signs.     <br> \n <br> \nSwan Lake is known for having high numbers of Black Crappie and moderate numbers of Walleye. Black Crappie numbers were moderate in 2021, but good numbers of 9 inch and longer fish were now present. The maximum length for Black Crappie was 11 inches. Historically, moderate numbers of Walleye were typically sampled at Swan Lake, but the catch was up a bit in 2021. Much of the Walleye catch was between 17 and 19 inches in length, with a maximum length of 26 inches. A bottom bouncer with a spinner and a crawler is a favorite tactic of local Walleye anglers. Swan is also known as having good numbers of Channel Catfish and this was again the case in 2021. Many of the catfish were between 14 and 16 inches in length, a size that makes excellent table fare. A piece of chicken liver laying on the bottom should catch catfish at Swan Lake. Bluegill and Yellow Perch were both present in decent numbers, but sizes were mostly small for those two species.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter include Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, White Crappie, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.     <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

Median length of bullhead was 7.2 inches.  Black crappies populations were 13.4 times higher than local values.  Gill net catch of black crappies was 152/lift.  Levels of yellow perch were slightly below local average.  Gill net catches of yellow perch were 11.667 per set.  Channel catfish were also present.  Gill net catches of channel catfish were 2 per set, which is probably lower than other lakes with channel catfish populations.  Levels of northern pike were well below local averages.  The weight of these northern pike was well above local averages.  The average weight of northern pike sampled was 3.7 pounds per fish.  Other species present but not at significant levels were white sucker, golden shiner, walleye, white crappie and hybrid sunfish.\n</p>",

Five channel catfish were sampled in this survey with fish averaging 9\" in length.  Walleye fry stocking has contributed only a very small walleye population of 0.4/gillnet lift.  The perch population is small at 3.2/gillnet lift, but is larger than previous surveys.  We have had complaints on small size of crappies (136.8/gillnet) and bluegills (83.83/trapnet).  There is a large population of black bullheads.  No carp were sampled during this survey.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Swan Lake, McLeod County, is a 343 acre lake with a maximum depth of 10 feet.  Swan Lake is located north of the village of Silver Lake.  Two public access areas are available.  A state-owned access is located on the southeast side of the lake.  Another access is located in a McLeod County Park on the north side of the lake.  The park has picnic facilities, toilets, a fishing pier and a long reach of shoreline available for bank angling.  Much of the lake is surrounded by gravel roadways that provide shore fishing opportunities.  Remember, road right-of-ways may be private land, so respect landowners rights and pick up after yourself and other less conscientious anglers.  Swan Lake has a helixor type aeration system in operation that appears to be successful at reducing the frequency and severity of winterkill.  The aeration system creates an area of open water during the winter, and caution should be used when traveling on the lake during the winter.  A fisheries population assessment conducted during the week of 7/29/96 sampled thirteen species of fish.  Swan Lake is best known as a producer of crappie, bullhead, yellow perch, walleye, and occasionally largemouth bass and channel catfish.  Black bullhead numbers have declined slightly, but are still present in good numbers.  The fish sampled in 1996, ranged in length from 4 to over 15 inches and average length was 12 inches.  These fish can provide good sport and table fare to interested anglers.  Panfish may be the biggest draw to anglers, but fish numbers fluctuate and fishing may be boom or bust.  Black crappie sometimes develop strong year classes that can provide good angling for several years.  A strong year class of two year old fish is currently providing excellent angling for 8 to 9 inch fish, that may be expected to continue for several years.  Recruitment is sporadic and after this year class declines fishing may be slow for a while.  Bluegill occasionally produce good year classes, but a lack of aquatic vegetation limits their numbers.  Presently, good numbers of pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish can provide additional panfishing opportunities.  The average length of hybrid sunfish sampled was near 6 inches.  Yellow perch numbers have increased to well above the normal range for this lake type in recent years and they grow to acceptable sizes.  The average length of perch sampled in 1996 was just under 7 inches.  Walleye numbers have increased in recent years and a gillnet catch rate of 11.4 per net was within the upper limits of the normal range for this lake type.  The average length of walleye sampled in 1996 was 18 inches and fish up to 23 inches were present.  The walleye population is maintained through fingerling stocking, but natural reproduction has been documented.  The extent this contributes to the fishery is unknown at this time.  Electrofishing gear was used to sample the largemouth bass population.  A total of 81 largemouth bass were collected electrofishing for a catch rate of 60.8 per hour.  Largemouth bass sampled ranged in length from 9 to almost 17 inches and average length was almost 13 inches.  Long reaches of undeveloped, wooded shoreline and bulrush beds provide good habitat for these fish.  The channel catfish population is maintained through stocking to provide additional angling opportunities.  Interested anglers will find good numbers of nice size fish.  Channel catfish sampled in 1996 ranged in length from 17 to 28 inches.  A variety of artificial, live, prepared or dead baits will work for these fish.  Northern pike are present in low numbers and only one was sampled during the survey.  A lack of connected wetlands and submergent aquatic vegetation limits northern pike numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Swan Lake is a 343 acre lake with a maximum depth of 10 feet.  It is located near the town of Silver Lake in McLeod County.  Swan Lake has two public boat accesses and a fishing pier.  A state-owned access is located on the southeast side and the fishing pier and another access is located in the McLeod County Park on the north side of the lake.  Shore fishing is also available around much of the lake.  Swan Lake has a helixor type aeration system that is maintained and operated by the Silver Lake Sportsmen Club.  This aeration system creates an area of open water and anglers should use caution when traveling on the lake in the winter.  Angling for panfish can be very good at times.  Black crappie are abundant and catch rates in trapnets (30.3 per net) and gillnets (60.6 per net) were above the normal range for this lake class.  Although average size was small, most were age 1 fish that will provide good angling in the future.  Bluegill are present, but catch rates were low.  Pumpkinseed sunfish catch rates were above the normal range for this lake type.  Swan Lake lacks good habitat (submerged vegetation) for sunfishes and their numbers fluctuate widely.  However, bluegill, pumpkinseed or hybrid sunfish occasionally produce a strong year class that can provide a fishery.  Yellow perch are abundant also.  The gillnet catch rate was above the normal range for this lake type and yellow perch have provided good angling on Swan Lake in the past several years.  Black bullheads are present in good numbers and their size should be attractive to anglers.  Black bullhead ranged in length from 4 to 15 inches and the average length was 11.7 inches.  Largemouth bass are present and the size structure is good.  The average size of bass sampled in the spring electrofishing was 14 inches.  Northern pike are present in low numbers, but a lack of submerged vegetation may limit northern pike spawning habitat within the lake and there are no connecting marshes.  Average size of the northern pike sampled in gillnets was 25.5 inches.  Walleye are stocked in Swan Lake and are present in good numbers.  The gillnet catch rate was well above the normal range for this lake type.  Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 10 to 23 inches and the average length was 15.2 inches.  Sampling indicates that walleye natural reproduction occurs.  Channel catfish are also stocked in Swan Lake and provide a bonus to anglers.  These fish exhibit good growth and many are in the 18 to 24 inch range and larger fish are present. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted on Swan Lake in 2007.  An aerator is operated during the winter to reduce the frequency and severity of winterkill.  Winterkill has not been reported at Swan Lake for many years.  Swan is primarily managed for black crappie and walleye.\n\nSwan's watershed was dominated (84%) by row-crop agriculture.  A thin line of trees accounted for 58% of the lakes shoreline.  A total of 6 varieties of aquatic plant were sampled and all were considered rare.  The maximum depth at which aquatic vegetation grew was 4.4 feet.  Gravel, sand and silt were classified as common shoalwater substrates.  Boulder, detritus, muck and rubble were classified as rare.  The secchi disk reading was 1.2 feet in mid-July, due to an intense algal bloom.  Shoreland owners are encouraged to protect emergent aquatic vegetation and vegetation near the lakeshore, especially on steep slopes.  Bullrush beds provide food and shelter for a number of fish and wildlife species, improve water clarity, reduce erosion and improve aesthetics.  Keeping shorelines and steep slopes vegetated also reduces erosion and runoff, while improving aesthetics.\n\nA total of 98 walleye were gill netted for a catch rate of 10.9/net which indicated that moderate numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2004 was similar at 13.1/net.   In 2007, walleye were 7.5-24.8 inches long averaging 15.2 inches.  Approximately 94% of the gill net catch was 12 inches or longer.  Trap nets sampled walleye up to 27.9 inches in length.  Walleye were 1-10 years old with 10 year-classes present.  Approximately 68% of the walleye sampled in gill nets were age 2, indicating that a large year-class was produced naturally.  The latest stocking regime (1 pound of fingerlings/littoral acre every-other-year) began in 1996.  Approximately 74% of the fish from the gill net catch came from non-stocked years.  Growth was fast. \n\nNorthern pike were not sampled in 2007.  The catch rate in 2004 was 0.1/net.  Catch rates have been low since the 1985 assessment (7.6/net).  Little preferred spawning habitat is available for northern pike at Swan Lake.  \n\nA total of 4 yellow perch were gill netted for a catch rate of 0.4/net, which indicated that numbers were low.  The catch rate in 2004 was 0.0/net.  In 2007, yellow perch were 6.9-8.3 inches long with a mean of 7.6.  Yellow perch were 2-4 years old with 3 year-classes present.  \n\nA total of 81 channel catfish were gill netted for a catch rate of 9.0/net, which was the highest ever recorded at Swan Lake.  The catch rate in 2004 was 3.6/net.  In 2007, channel catfish were 7.2-24.0 inches long averaging 12.7 inches.  Approximately 40% of the gill net sample was 16 inches or longer.  A new stocking regime of 30 fingerlings/littoral acre every-other-year began in 2005.  Aged channel catfish were 2-12 years old with 7 year-classes present.  Approximately 48% of the aged fish were from the strong 2005 year-class.  \n  \nA total of 112 black crappie were trap netted for a catch rate of 12.4/net, which indicated that moderate levels of fish were present.  The catch rate in 1995 was 30.3/net.  In 2007, trap netted black crappie were 1.5-10.9 inches long averaging 7.4 inches.  Approximately 37% of the trap net catch was 9 inches or longer.  A total of 568 black crappie were gill netted for a catch rate of 63.1/net, which indicated that high numbers of fish were present.  The gill net catch rate in 2004 was 54.8/net.  Black crappie were 1-6 years old with 6 year-classes present.  Approximately 88% of the gill net sample was from the strong 2005 year-class.  Growth was slow. \n\nA total of 1,434 bluegill were trap netted for a catch rate of 159.3/net, which was the highest ever measured at Swan Lake.  The catch rate in 1995 was 2.6/net.  In 2007, bluegill were 2.6-7.1 inches long averaging 3.4 inches.  Only 6% of the trap net catch was 6.5 inches or longer.  Bluegill were 1-7 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Growth was slow.  The lack of submergent vegetation and associated food items (invertebrates) may be limiting the bluegill size structure at Swan Lake.\n\nA total of 7 black bullhead were trap netted for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which indicated that numbers were low.  Trap netted black bullhead were 9.1-11.6 inches long averaging 10.2 inches.  The gill net catch rate (5.2/net) was also low in 2007.  The gill net catch rate in 2004 was 43.1/net.\n\nA total of 69 carp were trap netted for a catch rate of 7.7/net, which indicated that numbers were high.  Trap netted carp were 10.4-15.9 inches long averaging 12.3 inches.  Gill nets also sampled high numbers of carp (14.2/net).  Prior to 2007, only 1 carp had ever been netted at Swan Lake.  \n\nA total of 51 largemouth bass were collected during spring night-time electrofishing for a catch rate of 38.3/hour, which indicated that good numbers were present.  Largemouth bass were 7.6-18.0 inches long averaging 13.7 inches.  Largemouth bass were 2-9 years old with 7 year-classes present.  \n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey (gill nets, trap nets, and spring night-time electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass) was conducted at Swan Lake in 2016 to monitor the Lake's fish population.  A total of ten different species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in 2016.  The lake was well mixed (plenty of oxygen at all depths) on 7/18/16 and water clarity was poor (1.6' secchi disk reading), due to an intense algae bloom.  An aeration system was operated annually during the winter to reduce the likelihood and severity of winterkill at Swan Lake.  A fishing pier was available to anglers at the County Park on the north side of the lake and a shore fishing area, with picnic tables, was present on the southwest side. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (66) of Walleye for a catch rate of 7.3/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Swan.  The 2012 catch rate was much lower at 2.7/net.  Historic catch rates (n=14), from 1973 to 2016 and under various stocking regimes, were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 50.4/net with an average of 8.4.  Gill netted Walleye were 9.2 to 26.2 inches long with an average of 12.8.  Approximately 21% of the gill net catch was 15 inches or longer.  Fish (gill and trap net) were age-1 to age-12 with six year classes present, indicating inconsistent recruitment.  All (100%) of the gill net aged Walleye matched up with stocked year classes, but three age-1 fish were sampled in the trap nets, indicating that at least a some natural reproduction was occurring.  This may indicate that natural reproduction was not significant at Swan Lake, but the actual contribution from natural reproduction during stocked years was unknown.  Age-2 fish (2014 year class) made up the majority of the sample (77%) and that year class was considered to be strong in size and should provide better fishing in future years.  Overall growth was slow.  Numerous  (29) 13 to 15 inch long Walleye were observed during the 2016 fall night-time electrofishing and these fish were likely the 2014 year class, indicating that growth rates improved greatly over the summer.  The latest fingerling stocking regime (351 pounds every other year) was initiated in 1996.  Yearlings were stocked in 2012 due to a fingerling shortage.  Gill net catch rates (n=5) during this time period ranged from 2.7 to 13.1/net with an average of 8.0.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (439) of Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 48.8/net, which was above the normal range for lakes similar to Swan.  The 2012 catch rate was 3.8/net.  Historic catch rates (n=14) from 1973 to 2016 were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 91.6/net with an average of 22.4.  Gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.1 to 8.4 inches long with an average of 6.9.  Approximately 2% of the catch was 8 inches or longer.  Yellow Perch were age-1 to age-4, indicating fairly consistent recruitment.  Age-2 and age-3 fish were most abundant accounting for 64 and 30% of the gill netted fish, respectively.  Growth was moderate.  Adult Yellow Perch were stocked in 2013 (157 pounds) and 2014 (920 pounds) after several assessments with very low catch rates.  It was hoped that higher numbers of Yellow Perch would compete with Black Crappie and provide better forage for the diminished Walleye population.  Large year classes were produced both of those years in Swan Lake, but it is not 100% certain that they resulted from the stockings, as remnant Yellow Perch were still present in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (16) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 1.8/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Swan, but was the second lowest on record.  The 2012 catch rate was extremely high (364.9/net).  Historical catch rates (n=14) from 1973 to 2016 were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 364.9/net with an average of 77.2.  In 2016, gill netted Black Crappie were 5.1 to 9.8 inches long with an average of 7.9.  Trap nets also sampled low numbers (38) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 4.2/net which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Swan.  The 2012 trap net catch rate was 71.7/net.  Historical catch rates from 1973 to 2016 (n=11) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 290.2/net with an average of 55.3. Trap netted Black Crappie were 7.2 to 9.2 inches long with an average of 7.9.  Approximately 32% of the trap net catch was 8 inches or longer.  Black Crappie were estimated to be age-1 to age-7 with five year classes present.  The 2014 year class was the largest, accounting for 82% of the catch.  Growth for age-2 fish was fast.  Swan Lake Black Crappie were used as a source for the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area Kid's Ponds stockings in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 because of the super strong 2010 year class and subsequent slow growth.  It was hoped that a decrease in the population would increase growth rates due to the reduced competition.  The average length for age-2 and age-3 fish did increase, 0.3 and 0.5 inches, respectively between the 2012 netting and the 2016 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (40) of Bluegill for a catch rate of 4.4/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Swan.  The 2012 catch rate was similar (6.4/net).  Catch rates from 1973 to 2016 (n=11) were highly variable ranging from 1.5 to 159.3/net with an average of 34.1.  In 2016, trap netted Bluegill were 5.3 to 7.7 inches long with an average of 6.7.  Approximately 43% of the catch was 7 inches or longer.  Approximately 43% of the catch was 7 inches or longer.  In 2016, trap netted Bluegill were age-2 to age-5 with four year classes present.  Age-4 fish made up 60% of the trap net catch.  Growth was moderate.  Bluegill tend to do better in lakes with a moderate abundance of submergent vegetation and better water clarity. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (137) of Channel Catfish for a catch rate of 15.2/net which was the highest ever recorded at Swan Lake.  The 2012 catch rate was also high (12.7/net).  Historical catch rates, from 1973 to 2016 were variable ranging from 0.0 to 15.2/net with an average of 4.6.  Channel Catfish were 9.3 to 22.3 inches long with an average of 13.4.  Approximately 18% of the catch was 15 inches or longer, indicating a good population of eater sized fish.  The size distribution indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Channel Catfish were last stocked in 2005, likely indicating that this population was now being sustained by natural reproduction.  Channel Catfish are easily caught and can be filleted just like a Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing, targeting Largemouth Bass, sampled low numbers (10) of fish for a catch rate of 7.5/hr., which was the lowest on record for Swan Lake.  The 2012 catch rate was similar at 9.0/hr.  Historical catch rates (n=7) from 1995 to 2016 were variable, ranging from 7.5 to 60.8/hr. with an average of 34.2.  In 2016, fish were 5.8 to 17.9 inches long with an average of 14.4.  Largemouth Bass were aged using scales, so fish could be released.  Fish were age-1 to age-8 with five year classes present.  Growth was moderate.  Data indicated that recruitment was inconsistent.  Largemouth Bass tend to do better in lakes with a good amount of submergent vegetation and decent water clarity, both of which were lacking at Swan. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (69) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 7.7/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Swan.  The 2012 catch rate was also high (5.9/net).  Catch rates (n=14) from 1973 to 2016 were mostly low ranging from 0.0 to 14.2/net with an average of 2.0.  Gill netted Common Carp were 6.8 to 23.4 inches long with an average of 19.2.  Trap nets sampled moderate numbers (15) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 1.7/net, which was also within the normal range for lakes similar to Swan.  Length frequency distributions indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Common Carp have remained abundant since they showed up in the nets in 2007.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (9) Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 1.0/net, which was below the normal range for lakes similar to Swan and was the second lowest on record.  The 2012 catch rate was also low (0.8/net).  Historic catch rates (n=14) were highly variable, ranging from 0.8 to 406.8/net with an average of 121.0.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 5.1 to 10.8 inches long with an average of 7.2.  Trap nets did not sample any Black Bullhead in 2016.  Declines in relative abundance, since the mid-1990's, could be due to the increased numbers of predators (Channel Catfish and Walleye) in the lake over the last 20 years.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fall nighttime electrofishing Targeted Survey was conducted at Swan Lake on September 28, 2022, to evaluate young of the year Walleye (YOY) and yearling Walleye (YRL) abundance. A total of 539 YOY were sampled for a catch rate of 539.0/hour, which was the highest catch rate ever recorded at Swan and was within the lake's historical fourth quartile (> 10.5). The 2022 year class appears strong in abundance and was possible due to the new Walleye fry stocking regime initiated in 2022, when fry replaced fingerling stocking. The mean length for YOY was only 4.4 inches, which was within Swan's historical first quartile (< 5.4), indicating slow growth (within the first quartile) for this lake. The 2022 YOY mean length was the shortest on record for Swan Lake. In 2022, 1 yearling was sampled, for a catch rate of 1.0/hour. This was the first year that yearlings were collected during fall nighttime electrofishing at Swan Lake. The 2022 year class appeared abundant at the end of the first growing season but may not recruit to adulthood if the small average size compromises their ability to survive their first winter. Followup assessments will shed light on the fate of the 2022 year class.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Swan Lake was conducted on June 14th, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Iowa Darter) and four species that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnows, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent trap net survey was conducted on Swan Lake during the week of June 14th, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Black Crappie (77%) comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number, and Black Crappie (42%), Common Carp (30%), and Channel Catfish (10%) comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Black Bullheads sampled per net was well over the 75th quartile for similar lake class 43 lakes. Conversely, the number of Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, and White Crappie sampled per net were at the 25% quartile for similar Lake Class 43 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data from a June 2022 survey were combined with gill net data from a July 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota DNR Fisheries IBI program staff conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on Swan Lake on June 15th, 2022, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 31 survey sites evenly spaced 150 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 56.3 (?2.2) out of 100 possible, which is low and well below the statewide average score of 73. A low score indicates that sites are typically developed and have a lower than expected amount of natural habitat. Approximately 100 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 56.3 (?2.2), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 0 (?0). <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey provides supporting evidence that the fish community in Swan Lake is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score just below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the South Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
