Perch were absent from the 1979 lake survey, but they exploded to 594 per gillnet in 1984. The perch population will probably decline to a more reasonable level. Despite the very high perch population. The northern pike pop has decreased from 18.5/gillnet set in 1978 to 3.0/gillnet set in the current survey. Of the six northern pike sampled 5 were young of the year and the other one was a two year old. Growth was extremely fast with the young of the year averaging 10.2 inches last survey. There were three year classes represented in the aging, the 1980, 1982 and 1983 year classes. Since walleyes were not stocked in the lake these fish must have resulted from natural reproduction or a natural run. These fish also show extremely fast growth. Because the fish captured in the trapnets could not be properly handled, it is hard to say what the centrarchid popualtion is. It would appear from the gillnet catches that the black crappie is abundant and has good size distribution. The sunfish population is marginal. Black bullhead and common carp appear abundant and are generally unacceptable in size.</p>",

Both fish were 17.0- 17.9 inches in total length and had a mean weight of 2.0 pounds.  Shoreline seining collected the following species; common carp, fathead minnow, black bullhead, and iowa darter.  Bluegill and black crappie were not captured.

                "narrative": "<p>Cottonwood Lake is a 250-acre shallow, bowl shaped lake located about nine miles north of Donnelly.  Decades ago it was known for its excellent fishing and swimming.  However, wetland drainage, agricultural run off, and unfenced cattle made the lake unsuitable for swimming and the fish community became dominated by bullheads and carp.  The existing fish community was eliminated with rotenone, a highly selective aquatic pesticide, in the fall of 1996 as part of the Niemackl Lakes Watershed Project.  Cottonwood Lake was restocked with northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill.  A high velocity culvert was installed downstream to prevent undesirable fish from migrating into the lake.  Improved land uses within the Cottonwood Lake watershed were also a major focus of the restoration project.  Grassed filter and buffer strips were established next to wetlands, streams, and ditches to prevent sediment and nutrients from being washed into surface waters.  Drained wetlands were restored to function as biological filters and wildlife habitat.  Fencing was installed around the north shore of Cottonwood Lake and upstream wetlands to keep cattle out of surface waters.  The lake responded well to the restoration efforts.  Water clarity improved dramatically and aquatic vegetation became dense around the shoreline.  Largemouth bass and black crappie reproduction by stocked broodfish was highly successful.  Young of the year fish were abundant when the lake was sampled in 1997.  Juvenile northern pike were also common.  Walleye fry stocking was apparently unsuccessful so fingerlings were stocked in the fall of 1997.  A follow up assessment was completed in June of 1998.  Catch rates were surprisingly low.  Northern pike and walleye were the only species captured in test nets.  Dense beds of aquatic vegetation made sampling difficult and likely reduced the capture efficiency of the test nets.  Another assessment is scheduled for 1999 prior to the establishment of the dense beds of aquatic vegetation.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cottonwood Lake is 243-acre shallow, bowl-shaped basin located just north of Donnelly on the border of Grant and Stevens counties.  A relatively new public access is located along the northwest shoreline.  Typical of many shallow lakes in western Minnesota, most of the watershed is in agricultural production and residential development is very limited.  This basin was chemically reclaimed in 1996 as part of the Niemackle Lakes Watershed Project.  Purpose of reclamation was to eliminate an undesirable fish community and improve water quality and clarity.  Current survey results indicated benefits of reclamation are still evident.  Water quality and clarity remain good and the lake now supports a quality but somewhat limited game fish community.  Walleye is the dominant species in Cottonwood Lake.  This population can be characterized as abundant with an excellent size structure.  Mean size was 17.6 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Growth rates were extremely fast with most fish exceeding 15.0 inches after just three growing seasons.  Alternate year fingerling stockings maintain this population.  The only other game fish species encountered in the 2008 survey were northern pike and largemouth bass.  Abundance of both species is relatively low.  Smaller fish dominate the pike population; whereas, large fish make up most of the bass population.  Bluegill and black crappie have been documented in previous surveys but were not sampled in 2008.  Anecdotal angler reports indicated a high-quality bluegill fishery existed during the early- to mid-2000s.  Future stocking of these species, along with largemouth bass, has been proposed in attempts to bolster these populations and provide a limited bass-panfish fishery.  Anglers targeting sunfish or walleye should be aware of the following special regulations.  The sunfish possession limit is five fish.  The walleye possession limit is three fish.  Angler compliance is essential to ensure these regulations are successful.  The next DNR lake survey is scheduled for 2013.        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cottonwood Lake is a 250-acre shallow, bowl shaped lake located about nine miles north of Donnelly in Grant County.  Decades ago it was known for its excellent fishing and swimming.  However, wetland drainage, agricultural run off, and unfenced cattle made the lake unsuitable for swimming.  Bullheads and carp dominated the fish community.  The existing fish community was eliminated with rotenone, a highly selective aquatic piscicide, in the fall of 1996 as part of the Niemackle Lakes Watershed Project.  Cottonwood Lake was restocked with northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill.  A high velocity fish barrier was installed downstream to prevent undesirable fish from migrating into the lake.Improved land uses within the Cottonwood Lake watershed were also a major focus of the restoration effort.  Grassed filter and buffer strips were established next to wetlands, streams, and ditches to prevent sediment and nutrients from being washed into surface waters.  Drained wetlands were restored to function as biological filters and wildlife habitat.  Fencing was installed around the north shore of the lake to keep cattle out the water.  Cottonwood Lake responded well to the restoration efforts.  Water clarity improved dramatically and aquatic vegetation has become dense around the shoreline.  A desirable fish community has developed in Cottonwood Lake.  The only species detected in test nets were the five gamefish species stocked after the reclamation.  Northern pike and walleye are moderately abundant.  Northern pike range from 14 to 26 inches in length and average about 2.2 pounds.  Walleye range from 6 to 18 inches in length.  These species will be stocked regularly to maintain fishing opportunities.  There are a limited number of large bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass present at this time.  Hopefully, these species will flourish in upcoming years.  Adult bluegill and crappie have been stocked in recent years to increase abundance.  Special test nets indicated a large year class of bluegill were produced in 2001.  Black crappie seemed to have also successfully reproduced in 2001.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cottonwood Lake is a shallow, hypereutrophic basin with a history of dense algal blooms during summermonths.  The abundance and diversity of aquatic vegetation is limited by turbidity, algal blooms, andwater chemistry.  Sago pondweed is the predominate species of submergent vegetation, while hardstembulrush and common cattail stands along the southwest shoreline comprise the bulk of emergentvegetation.Walleye have become abundant in Cottonwood Lake.  Gillnet catches increased from 1.7 fish/net in 1993to 19.7 fish/net in 1995.  Gillnet catches ranged from 1.7 - 7.0 fish/net in previous surveys datingback to 1984.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar physical and chemicalcharacteristics is 0.8 - 3.8 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.1 pounds.  Growth ofwalleye is rapid.  Age-3 fish average 18.6 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.   Therecent expansion of the walleye population is not related to management activities.  Age-1 and age-2fish (1994 and 1993 year classes) comprised 73% of the fish captured in gillnets, yet walleyes have notbeen stocked since 1991.  However, walleye fingerlings were reared by a private firm in an adjacentpond that became connected to Cottonwood lake during high water levels in 1993.  The strong 1994 yearclass can only be explained by natural reproduction which was also documented in previous surveys. Yellow perch catch rates increased from 0.7 fish/gillnet in 1993 to 61.0 fish/gillnet in 1995.  Gillnetcatches have been highly variable in past surveys, ranging from 0.7 - 593.5 fish/gillnet.  The normalrange of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 2.0 - 22.3 fish/gillnet.  Most of the fish captured in1995 were between 5.0 and 8.0 inches in total length.  Northern pike abundance is limited.  Gillnetcatches averaged 0.5 fish/net in 1995.  Catches ranged from 0.0 to 5.0 fish/gillnet in previous surveysdating back to 1984.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 2.0 - 10.8fish/gillnet.  A fish barrier was constructed in 1989 to prevent northern pike from leaving the lakeand being stranded in upstream marshes when water levels dropped after spring run-off.  However, thismay have an adverse impact on the northern pike population by limiting natural reproduction duringyears of extended high water levels in the spring when those marshes would optimum spawning habitat. Black bullhead catches decreased significantly in the past two years.  Gillnet catches averaged 31.8fish/net in 1995, compared to 283.7 fish/net in 1993 and 286.0 fish/net in 1992.  Trapnet catchesdecreased from 179.8 fish/net in 1992 and 146.2 fish/net in 1993 to 57.3 fish/trapnet in 1995.  Theabundance of centrarchids is limited.  Bluegill were not captured in survey nets and electrofishing didnot yield any largemouth bass.  Eleven black crappie were captured in trapnets which resulted in acatch rate of 1.2 fish/net.  Black crappie were abundant in some of the past surveys.  Trapnet catchesaveraged 91.3 fish/net in 1979 and gillnet catches averaged 30.0 fish/net in 1984.  Trapnet catcheswere not recorded in 1984 due to decomposition of captured fish.          </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cottonwood Lake is a 250-acre shallow, bowl shaped lake located about nine miles north of Donnelly in Grant County.    The existing fish community was eliminated with rotenone, a highly selective aquatic piscicide, in the fall of 1996 as part of the Niemackle Lakes Watershed Project.  Cottonwood Lake was restocked with northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill.  A high velocity fish barrier was installed downstream to prevent undesirable fish from migrating into the lake.Improved land uses within the Cottonwood Lake watershed were also a major focus of the restoration effort.  Grassed filter and buffer strips were established next to wetlands, streams, and ditches to prevent sediment and nutrients from being washed into surface waters.  Drained wetlands were restored to function as biological filters and wildlife habitat.  Fencing was installed around the north shore of the lake to keep cattle out the water.  Cottonwood Lake responded well to the restoration efforts.  Water clarity improved dramatically and aquatic vegetation has become dense around the shoreline.  A desirable fish community has developed in Cottonwood Lake.  Northern pike and walleye are moderately abundant.  Most of the northern pike captured were between 22 and 29 inches in length and average about 3.5 pounds.  Walleye ranged from 13 to 20 inches in length and averaged about 1.5 pounds.  These species will be stocked regularly to maintain fishing opportunities.  There were a limited number of large bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass captured during sampling efforts.  However, bluegill and largemouth bass both produced large year classes in 2001.  Two-year old fish of both species were abundant in 2003.  These fish are growing rapidly and should provide some good angling opportunities in the near future.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cottonwood Lake is a 255-acre shallow, bowl-shaped basin located just north of Donnelly on the Grant and Stevens County line.  A public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  Typical of many shallow lakes in western Minnesota, the majority of the watershed is in agricultural production. Residential development is very limited.\n\nThis basin was chemically reclaimed in 1996 as part of the Niemackl Lakes Watershed Project.  Purpose of the reclamation was to eliminate undesirable fishes and improve water quality and clarity.  Those intended benefits have persisted for over 20 years.  Water quality and clarity remain very good, abundance of undesirable fish species remains low, and the lake continues to support a game fish community and fishery.\n\nWalleye are the dominant gamefish species in Cottonwood Lake.  Catch statistics generated from the 2018 standard survey described a moderate population of quality size fish.  Walleye growth rates and size has improved since the last survey.  Walleye captures ranged from 10.1 inches to 25.9 inches.  Average length was 18.1 inches.  Alternate year fingerling or yearling stockings have been successful in maintaining this population.  Bluegill and Black Crappie catch rates are modest when compared to similar lakes in Minnesota, but current catch rates were some of the highest recorded in Cottonwood Lake.  Most Bluegills and Black Crappies caught during the 2018 survey were two-year-old fish.  Average length of Bluegills caught during the 2018 survey was 6.7 inches.  Black Crappies averaged 7.2 inches.  Both species grow fast in Cottonwood.   Many of these young panfishes should reach harvestable sizes in 2019.  Only a few Largemouth Bass were caught during the survey.  The largest capture measured 16.8 inches.  Bluegills, Black Crappies, and Largemouth Bass have been stocked in previous years in attempts to provide a limited bass-panfish fishery.  Due to poor spawning and nursery habitat for these species, reproductive success and annual recruitment of these populations remain highly erratic.  Several Northern Pike were caught in the 2018 survey, but population abundance remains very low.  Those pike caught were small.  Black Bullhead catches remain well below pre-reclamation levels.  With an average length in excess of 13.0 inches and average weight approaching 1.5 pounds, this underutilized fish population can add to fishing experiences.\n \nAnglers should note, that the special regulations on Walleye and Bluegill daily bag limits were removed in 2015.  A lack of expected benefits from these regulations led to their removal.  Current regulations on Cottonwood Lake follow statewide regulations. \n\nAt the time of the 2018 survey, Cottonwood Lake is not known to contain any invasive species.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.  Do not dispose of any unused bait in the lake.  Updated information on invasive species infestations can be found on the MN DNR website.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catch rates have increased from 3.0 fish/net night in 1984 to 7.0 fish/net night in 1988. Mean weight of walleye captured in gillnets was 2.40 lbs and 3.80 lbs for fish caught in trapnets. Growth of walleye is fast. Fish averaged 17.4 inches in length at age 3. The 1985 year-class may have been a result of fingerling stocking. The 1983, 1984, and 1986 year- classes appear to have been established from natural reproduction. Few northern pike were captured, but they were qualtiy-size (over 3 lbs. each). Yellow perch relative abundance decreased from 593.5 fish/gillnet in 1984 to 31.67 fish/ gillnet in 1988. Despite this decline, yellow perch should still provide an adequate forage base for walleye and northern pike. With reduction of yellow perch, walleye fry stocking may be a viable alternative to fingerling stocking. Introduction of bluegill in 1988 appears to have had limited success towards establishing a viable population. Only six bluegill were sampled in eight trapnets. It is possible rockbass were stocked with bluegill. Carp were not detected in the 1988 assessment and may no longer be present in the lake. The black bullhead population has marginal sport or commercial value.</p>",

A relatively new public access is located along the northwest shoreline.  Typical of many shallow lakes in western Minnesota, the majority of the watershed is in agricultural production.  Residential development is very limited.   <br> \n <br> \nThis basin was chemically reclaimed in 1996 as part of the Niemackl Lakes Watershed Project.  Purpose of the reclamation was to eliminate undesirable fishes and improve water quality and clarity.  Current survey results indicate benefits of the reclamation are still evident.  Water quality and clarity remain good, abundance of undesirable fish species remains low, and the lake continues to support a limited game fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye is the dominant gamefish species in Cottonwood Lake.  Current survey results describe an abundant population mostly comprised of smaller fish.  Mean size was 11.8 inches and 0.6 pounds in 2012.  Walleye growth rates have slowed substantially in recent years due to an overabundant population and limited prey base.  Alternate year fingerling stockings maintain this population.  The only other game fish species encountered in the 2012 survey were northern pike and bluegill.  Abundance of both species is relatively low.  Small- to medium-size fish dominate both populations.  Black crappie and largemouth bass have been documented in previous surveys but were not sampled in 2012.  Bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass have been stocked in previous years in attempts to provide a limited bass-panfish fishery.  Due to poor spawning and nursery habitat for these species, these stockings have failed to create self-sustaining populations.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers targeting sunfish or walleye should be aware of the following special regulations.  The sunfish possession limit is five fish.  The walleye possession limit is three fish.  However, 2012 survey results suggest expected benefits of these special regulations have not been realized and may be rescinded in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species collected during the 2012 survey included black and yellow bullheads.  The next DNR lake survey is scheduled for 2018.  <br> \n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Cottonwood Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Mustinka River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nSix species were collected during this survey.  One species (Iowa Darter) was considered \"intolerant\" and two species (Black Bullhead and Fathead Minnow) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Cottonwood Lake.</p>",

Chlorophyll-a and Total Phosphorous levels were above the impairment threshold for lakes similar to Cottonwood Lake.  In  general, most aquatic plants were poorly distributed, sparse, or absent from a majority of the lake and surveyors noted that submerged plants were only sampled in very shallow water and were covered in filamentous algae. Those plants that were most common included filamentous algae, coontail, and Sago pondweed, and all three are tolerant to turbidity.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that Cottonwood Lake may be impacted by stressors, as indicated by the poor distribution of aquatic plants and water quality measurements above the impairment thresholds for lakes. Results from this survey will be considered when the biological health of Cottonwood Lake is assessed during Mustinka River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
