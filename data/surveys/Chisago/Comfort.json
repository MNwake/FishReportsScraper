                "narrative": "<p>Big Comfort Lake is managed by the DNR as a northern pike-walleye lake with largemouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie as secondary species.  Walleye fingerling stocking began in 1986, and fingerlings have been stocked four out of the last five years.  A fish population assessment was conducted in the summer of 1995, using trap nets, gill nets, electrofishing, and shoreline seining to evaluate the fishery.  Results showed an increase in northern pike numbers since 1990, a decrease in bluegill and black crappie numbers, and continued low numbers of walleye.     The northern pike catch was the highest ever recorded for this lake, due mainly to good reproductive success in 1992.  Numbers of northern pike can vary from year to year depending on water levels in the spring.  The average northern pike seen in 1995 was 2.1 pounds (about 20 inches).     Walleye numbers were low despite annual fingerling stocking.  Some of the walleyes stocked in recent years have reached 15-20 inches, providing an occasional bonus catch.  Walleye stocking rates will most likely be refined in the near future.  However, one thing that must be considered is the yellow perch population.  Perch are a main prey of both northern pike and walleye, and with the increased number of northerns in Comfort Lake, perch numbers are down.  Unless walleye can utilize other species in the lake,such as minnows, the number of perch will limit the number of walleye that the lake can support.     Bluegill and black crappie, which were both extremely abundant in 1990, have returned to more typical population levels for this type of lake.  Average sizes of these species tend to be small in this lake; most bluegills measured under seven inches, and most crappies were under eight inches.     Largemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing in late spring, since they are not easily captured by other types of gear.  The number of bass per hour of electrofishing was lower than other similar lakes nearby.  Past reports from anglers have indicated that fair numbers of bass were present.  The largest bass caught by electrofishing weighed 2.5 pounds.     Carp have been in Big Comfort Lake since the 1940's or earlier.  The carp population today consists mainly of larger fish (10+ pounds), indicating a stable (non-increasing) population.     Other fish species in Comfort Lake include bowfin (dogfish), white sucker, black bullhead, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, spottail shiner, brassy minnow, fathead minnow, and Johnny darter.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Comfort Lake is a 219 acre, moderately fertile lake in lake class 24 located in southwestern Chisago County, east of the city of Wyoming.  Land use in the watershed and along the lakeshore is predominantly residential and becoming more so.  This fishery is managed primarily for Northern Pike.  Long range management goals are to maintain a Northern Pike gill net catch rate near 4 fish per net and to maintain fishable populations of Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie and Bluegill.   A lake survey was conducted during June of 2018 to evaluate the current fish population and management goal progress.  The previous survey was conducted in 2010. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike averaged 3 fish per gill net which is typical for the lake. Size was good for a small lake with some fish exceeding 30 inches. Black Crappie are not currently very abundant and the population is comprised of small fish. The crappie population in this lake tends to be variable and it will likely be couple of years before good crappie fishing is available again. Yellow Perch and Bluegill both offer abundant panfish angling opportunity but are not exceptionally large. A few decent Bluegill were sampled but they top out at 8 inches. Largemouth Bass appear to offer the highest quality angling opportunity in the lake, electrofishing sampled them at a rate several times higher than any previous survey. They averaged 13 inches in length with the largest fish measuring 19.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOnly one Walleye was caught in gill nets although a number of smaller Walleyes were observed during electrofishing efforts targeting Largemouth Bass. These fish are believed to be migrating from Forest Lake which is connected to Comfort by the Sunrise River.  A 15 inch Muskellunge was also sampled in gill nets with one exceptionally large individual observed during the survey. Like Walleye, these fish also likely migrated from Forest Lake. Anecdotal reports of Muskellunge being caught by anglers on Comfort are not uncommon. Other species sampled include: White Crappie, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Comfort is a relatively deep, medium sized lake of moderate fertility.  Located in southwestern Chisago County, the lake has a predominantly sandy shore with moderate development.  Water clarity is good for the area with a secchi disc reading of 10 feet on June 14th.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  In the past, walleye fingerlings (135 pounds) were stocked biennially in the fall.  The stocking plan has recently been changed to an annual fall fingerling stocking of 90 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nAs in previous samples, the electrofishing catch for largemouth bass (7.9 per hour) was dramatically lower than in nearby lakes.  The factor limiting bass abundance is still unknown, but it doesn't appear to be a lack of spawning habitat or available forage as both appear abundant.  The gill net catch for walleye and northern pike fell within the normal range compared to similar lakes.  Both showed modest increases compared to the 2005 catch.  Walleye ranged in length from 13.7 to 24.7 inches with a 20 inch and 2.8 pound average.  Although smaller walleye weren't sampled in the gill nets, many between 10 and 13 inches were observed during the bass electro-fishing and reported by walleye anglers.  Sampled northerns were quality sized ranging up to 30.9 inches with a third of the catch in excess of 25 inches.  The yellow perch abundance remains high.  Although most perch were too small to interest anglers, they do provide an important forage base for walleye and northern pike.  The black crappie catch was higher than expected but few, less than 10 percent, exceeded 8 inches in length.  Similarly, bluegill abundance was good but with few fish in excess of 7 inches, size may be an issue with anglers. <br> \n <br> \nComfort Lake's fish community also included banded killifish, black bullhead, bluntnose minnow, bowfin (dogfish), brook silverside, common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, shiners (golden, spotfin, and spottail), Johnny darter, muskellunge, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Comfort is a relatively deep, medium sized lake of moderate fertility.  Located in southwestern Chisago County, the lake has a predominately sandy shore with moderate developement.  Water clarity is fairly typical for the area with a secchi disc reading of 5.5 feet on June 14th.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  Walleye fingerlings (135 pounds) are stocked biennually in the fall.  As in previous samples, the electrofishing catch for largemouth bass (5.9 per hour) was dramaticly lower than in nearby lakes.  The factor limiting bass abundance is still unknown, but it doesn't appear to be a lack of spawning habitat or available forage as both appear abundant.  The gill net catch for walleye and northern pike fell within the normal range compared to similar lakes.  Both showed modest decreases compared to the 2000 catch.  Walleye ranged in length from 15.6 to 23.4 inches with a 18 inch 2.1 pound average.  Although smaller walleye weren't sampled in the gill nets, many between 9 and 12 inches were observed during the bass electrofishing.  Sampled northerns were quality sized ranging up to 31.9 inches and averaging 4.9 pounds.  The yellow perch catch rebounded from an all time low in the 2000 gill netting to the highest catch on record (92.2/net).  Most perch were too small to interest many anglers, but they should provide a important forage base for walleye and northern pike.  Bluegill and crappie populations were asseessed with trap nets.  Catch rates and average size fell within the normal range for both species when compared to similar lakes.  The bluegill catch, 20.0/net, was very similar to the 2000 catch, but the crappie catch doubled compared to the 2000 survey.  Panfish quality may be an issue with some anglers.  Although some crappie exceeded 12 inches, only 30% of the catch was 8 inches or larger.  Bluegill 7 inches and larger accounted for only 9% of the total.  Big Comfort's fish community also included black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brook silverside, brown bullhead, common carp, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white crappie.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    In June 1990, a lake survey was conducted on Comfort Lake.  To determine the status of the fish populations, six gillnets and four trapnets were set and two shoreline stations were seined.  Based on the results of these efforts the status of the fish populations compared to previous surveys and to lakes of the same classifications statewide are as follows:\n  The walleye net catch (0.83/set) was lower than the statewide median catch (2.44/set) and falls below the first quartile (1.00/set).  The 1990 walleye net catch was lower than the net catch of the previous survey in 1985 (1.17/set).  The five walleyes that were captured measured 16.0 to 17.9 inches in total length with an average weight of 2.08 pounds.  Age analysis indicated that these fish were four years old, and thus most likely represented survival of stocked fish form the 1986 year-class.  Stocking records indicate that walleye fingerlings were first stocked in Comfort Lake in 1986 and subsequently have been stocked in 1987 and 1990.  Walleyes recorded in previous survey catches were most likely to have migrated to Comfort Lake from Forest Lake by way of the Sunrise River.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were typical for walleyes throughout the state, indicating average growth.  \n  The northern pike net catch (3.50/set) was lower than the statewide median (6.50/set) but remained above the first quartile (2.96/set).  The 1990 northern pike net catch was also lower than the net catch of the previous survey (6.17/set) and indicated a real decrease in northern pike abundance.  The 21 northern pike that were captured in length from 19.0 to 30.9 inches with a median length group of 22.0 to 22.9 inches and an average weight of 3.28 pounds.  Age analysis determined that captured fish were from three to seven years old with four and five year old fish being most abundant.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were higher than those typical for northern pike throughout the state, indicating better than average growth.  Northern pike were apparently self-sustaining in Comfort Lake as indicated by rather consistent year classes without stocking.\n  The bluegill net catch (199.50/set) was substantially higher than the statewide median (30.39/set) and was well above the third quartile (67.50/set).  The 1990 bluegill catch was the highest ever recorded for Comfort Lake. The sub-sample of bluegills that were measured (89 of 798 captured) ranged in length from 3.0 to 7.4 inches with a median length group of 5.5 to 5.9 inches and an average weight of 0.13 pounds.  Age analysis estimated that fish ranged in age from three to six years with four year old fish representing 51 percent of the catch.  Average back-calculated length for each age class were typical of bluegills throughout the state, indicating average growth.  Natural reproduction was evident from the presence of young-of-the-year and juvenile fish in seine catches.  \n  Similar to the bluegill net catch, the black crappie net catch (64.75/set) was substantially higher than the statewide median (5.25/set) and was well above the third quartile (17.18/set).  The 1990 black crappie catch was the highest ever recorded for Comfort Lake.  The sub-sample of black crappies that were measured (82 of 259 captured) ranged in length from 3.50 to 10.9 inches with a median length of 6.5 to 6.9 inches and an average weight of 0.20 pounds.  Age analysis estimated that fish ranged in age from one to six years with two and three year old fish representing 62 percent of the catch.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were lower than typical of black crappies throughout the state, indicating below average growth.  Black crappie were apparently self-sustaining in Comfort Lake as indicated by rather consist year classes.\n  The yellow perch net catch (16.50/set) was higher than the statewide median (10.25/set) but was below the third quartile (27.00/set).  The 1990 yellow perch catch was lower than the net catch recorded in the previous survey (20.17/set).  The sub-sample of yellow perch that were measured (71 of 99 captured) ranged in length from 5.00 to 7.9 inches with a median length of 5.5 to 5.9 inches and an average weight of 0.20 pounds.\n  The largemouth bass catch rate (0.75/set) fell at the third quartile.  The 1990 largemouth bass catch was higher than in the previous survey (0.25/set).  In addition, 18 young-of-the-year and 2 older largemouth bass were captured in the seine hauls.  Overall, the largemouth bass catches were consistent with the results of previous surveys.  \n  Eight other species were captured during the survey (white sucker, common carp, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white crappie).  Catch rates of these species, excluding common carp and white crappie were above their respective statewide medians but remained below the third quartiles.  Catch rates of common carp and white crappie were below their respective statewide medians but above the first quartiles.\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Comfort Lake is a moderately fertile 219 acre lake located in southwestern Chisago County just east of the city of Wyoming.  Land use along the lake margin is primarily residential followed by a small percentage of marshland and undeveloped forest or woodland.  The surrounding watershed, which is 21.2 square miles in size, is characterized by the following land uses listed in order of abundane:  lake/marshland, urban/residential, undeveloped forest or woodland, crop land, and livestock/pasture land.  The lakes fishery is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike with largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill sunfish as the secondary management species.During the open water season of 2000, a standard lake survey was conducted to evaluate the present status of the fish population, the physical, chemical, and biological factors concerning habitat, and the water quality.  The fishery evaluation used gill and trap nets, spring night electrofishing, and late summer shoreline seining.  The selected gear types were chosen based on guidelines from the MN DNR Manual for Instructions to Lake Survey.  Habitat and water quality data were also collected based on guidelines from this manual.  Walleye abundance and the average weight, at 2.4 pounds, were typical of lakes of this type.  The walleye population has consistently either been below normal or just barely within the normal range since they were first stocked in 1986 despite consecutive and biannual year stocking efforts.  Before 1986, walleye abundance was also low and most likely sustained through some reproduction in the Sunrise River.  Measured walleye ranged from 8.5 to 25.1 inches with the average size at 18.7 inches.  A total of 5 year classes were represented.  All year classes found were also years when stocking took place.  The resident walleye population in Big Comfort Lake has been primarily maintained through stocking, however, some naturally reproduced fish from the Sunrise River have supplemented the population.  Above average growth was determined at ages 1-2 and normal growth prevailed thereafter.  Northern pike numbers were at a normal level along with the average weight, at 3.1 pounds.  When compared to the survey conducted in 1995, pike numbers have decreased, but the average size has increased.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 10.5 to 32.7 inches with an average length of 22.8 inches.  Big Comfort Lake northerns showed normal growth at all ages.  Spring night electrofishing found low numbers of largemouth bass along with a small average size of 0.4 pounds, but recent reports from anglers reveal the presence of many nice sized largemouth during their fishing outings.  Black crappie were found at normal abundance levels with their lengths extending from 5.0 to 9.7 inches.  The majority of crappie sampled were between 6.5 to 8.0 inches.  Bluegill sunfish numbers were found to be at a normal level for this lake type.  Lengths ranged from 3.7 to 7.7 inches with 75% of the sample between 5.0 to 6.5 inches.  Yellow perch abundance was found at the lower end of the normal range.  The 2000 perch catch was the lowest ever recorded since the lake was first surveyed in 1955.  Good natural reproductive success was found for largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish while yellow perch showed minimal success.  Big Comfort Lakes fish community was also made up of black, brown, and yellow bullhead, bowfin (dog fish), brook silverside, common carp, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, johnny darter, muskellunge, spottail shiner, and white sucker.  When  compared to similar lakes, brown bullhead, bowfin, common carp, and white sucker were within a normal abundance range while black and yellow bullhead, and golden shiner were below normal in number.  The single 39.8 inch muskellunge sampled during spring night electrofishing most likely originated from the lakes eventual connection to Forest Lake via the Sunrise River or from an unauthorized private stocking.  This was the first time muskellunge were observed in Big Comfort Lake.An angler fishing Big Comfort Lake may encounter nice sized walleye and northern pike, an occasional nice largemouth bass, an abundance of smaller bluegill sunfish and black crappie, or maybe a lunker muskellunge or lake sturgeon.  On October 3, 1983 a 106 pound, 77 inch long lake sturgeon washed up dead on the shore of Big Comfort Lake.  Since the Sunrise River passes through Comfort Lake, this is the likely source of the muskellunge and sturgeon and other species diversity.  However, specifically targeting these two species is not a realistic or recommended goal for anglers.  Because yellow perch numbers have consistently been declining and are a primary forage species for northern pike and walleye, this may be a limiting factor for these predator species.  Anglers are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the smaller ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing larger fish will help maintain or improve the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to experience catching a quality sized fish.  Because Big Comfort Lake lies within a watershed that has a lot of  urban/residential development and is connected to the Sunrise River, which is an outlet from Forest Lake, the lake is subject to some degree of nutrient input.  Since land uses within a watershed surrounding a lake influence a lakes water quality, additional nutrient loading may decrease this lakes water quality and ultimately its overall health.  Shoreline property owners on all lakes within this watershed and other land users can prevent or maintain water quality by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips along the shoreline of lakes with native plant species, updating failing or outdated septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land, utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removel or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near lake shorelines.</p>",
