All the brook trout collected were age-2 fish from the 1996 stocking, and had exhibited average growth for the area.  It would have been unusual to have seen any fish from the 1994 stocking, since brook trout rarely survive past age-3 in lakes in this area.  Brook trout collected in 1998 were all 11 to 13 inches in length.No rainbow trout were taken, despite their regular stocking since 1991.  Rainbow trout are difficult to collect in standard gill nets, so this single failure may not have much significance.White sucker were present, and the 1998 catch was similar to past catches in fall assessments in this lake.</p>",

This lake is stocked with fingerling Brook Trout via air-drop in the fall of even numbered years. Net catches of Brook Trout were low in September 2015, with only four fish sampled in two gill net sets. An otter was seen near one of the nets and may have removed fish from it, resulting in lower catches.  All Brook Trout captured in 2015 were from the fall 2014 fingerling stocking. Failure to capture larger older brook trout from the 2012  or 2010 stockings could mean those fish were harvested by anglers or were present and simply missed by the nets.  Stocking failures can be ruled out since both these year classes were sampled in the 2013 survey in fair numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nCatches of Brook Trout in past surveys on Margaret Lake have been variable. Most past surveys have caught some Brook Trout over 12 inches, with several sampling fish in the 14 to 15 inch range. <br> \n <br> \nThe White Sucker gill net catch in 2015 was within the normal range for gill net catches in fall assessments of stream trout lakes in this area (2.0 - 11.5 fish/net).  White Sucker compete with Brook Trout for invertebrate forage, but fairly good growth for Brook Trout collected in a previous survey (2013) suggested that competition was not a limiting factor at current levels of White Sucker abundance. <br> \n</p>",
