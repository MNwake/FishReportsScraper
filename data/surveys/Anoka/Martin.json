The drainage basin of this lake is large because of the two inlets which drain from other lakes in the vicinity.  The water level in this lake is maintained by a dam at the outlet to Middle Brook which flows generally east to meet the Sunrise River.  This lake becomes thermally stratified at about 15 feet and lack of oxygen for fish life below that.  This lake is heavily utilized as home and recreational area.The northern pike population is very low at the present time.  The sunfishes are low in numbers, but black crappies are abundant.  An abnormally high bullhead population is present and in need of control.  Although the adult largemouth bass population is low, reproduction this last season was good.  The carp population is not of problem proportions.</p>",

Yellow perch, walleye, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed and bluegill were found in numbers significantly below statewide catch figures.Northern pike were found in numbers significantly above the local gillnet catch median.  The catch rate found in the 1979 survey is the highest found of six surveys/test nettings dating from 1954.  Fish aged were found from II to IV annulus.  The two age groups showing up in greatest numbers were III and IV annulus fish.  These fish correspond to large fingerling stockings in 1977 and yearling stockings in 1976 respectively.  Growth rates at these two ages were average.  The single walleye taken was from a fry stocking in 1977.  Higher numbers of walleye were taken in the 1978 netting.  Largemouth bass reproduction was verified by presence of young of the year bass in the shoreline seining.Bluegill were found in very low numbers compared to either local or statewide medians.  Few young of the year were found shoreline seining.  Adult bluegills bave been stocked in 1975, 1977, 1978, and 1979.  The bluegill catch rate has dropped steadily since 1969.  During the period from 1969 to 1979 (10 winters), a winterkill of some degree of severity has occurred in Martin Lake on five separate occassions.  Black crappie numbers are higher, judged by catch rates, than the local median.  The 1979 catch rate for black crappies was significantly lower than any catch rate since 1969.  Fish aged were III and IV annulus fish with average growth rates.  No young of the year were found.Carp are present in numbers above the local median rate.  Length frequency data indicate at least one significant year class in recent years.  Black bullheads are present in high numbers.  This has been the case since at least 1976.  A portion o the bullheads present are over 8 inches (approximately 41%) judged from the length frequency data and would likely be of interest to commercial fishermen.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Martin Lake has an abundant crappie population composed of both black and white crappie, with 67% of the 1994 crappie catch being white crappie.  Average size of crappies was good; near 9.0 inches for white crappie and 8.0 inches for black crappie.  Crappie were measured up to 10.6 inches.  Historical surveys have shown that crappie catches have varied, but abundance has generally been high.Walleye gillnet catches were low (1.3/net), and fish ranged in size from 9.3 to 25.8 inches.  Spring electrofishing showed good numbers (18.3 walleye/hour) of small walleye (6.0 to 11.8 inches).  Size and age of walleye correspond to walleye fry stockings in Martin Lake.  The last three surveys have varied in gillnet catches of walleye from 10.0/net (1989), to 1.0/net (1984), to 0.5/net (1979).Northern pike abundance was low (0.5/gillnet), and fish ranged in size from 19.1 to 27.1 inches.  Historical catches of northern pike have been low.Bluegill were sampled in low numbers (9.9/trapnet).  Size of fish was good, with an average length near 7.0 inches and fish measured up to 8.1 inches.  Excluding 1984 (42.8/trapnet), historical catches of bluegill have been low.Martin Lake has an abundant carp population.  While carp were sampled in moderate numbers during the 1994 survey, numerous carp were observed during field work and electrofishing.  Several lake shore residents complained about the high carp population.  Historical carp catches have varied, but abundance has generally been high.Black bullhead were abundant (59.3/gillnet).  Black bullhead had an average length near 8.8 inches.  Historical catches of black bullhead have been high.  The 1994 catch of 59.3/gillnet is the second-lowest catch in nine surveys going back to 1954.  Excluding 1984 (49.5/gillnet), gillnet catches have ranged from 92.0/net (1989) to 408.0/net (1979).Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers (4.0/gillnet).  Size of yellow perch was small, with an average length of 6.8 inches and with fish measured up to 8.1 inches.  Historical yellow perch catches have been low.Largemouth bass abundance is very low.  No largemouth bass were sampled in 1.8 hours of electrofishing, and only three adult bass were sampled for the whole survey.  Largemouth bass ranged in size from 5.2 to 12.2 inches.  Historical catches of largemouth bass have been low.The following species were sampled in low numbers: white sucker, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, bowfin, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

Walleye were sampled at median levels for abundance with the average fish being 14.1 inches and 0.9 pounds. The 2001 year class made up 46.7% of all Walleye captured in this survey. Northern Pike were sampled within the normal range for abundance and at the highest gill net catch rate measured on this lake since 1979. The average Northern Pike caught was 23.2 inches and 2.6 pounds. Approximately 20.0% of sampled NOP measured 25.0 inches or larger. Yellow Perch were sampled within the normal range for abundance with the average individual being approximately 8.0 inches and 0.25 pounds. Both Black and White Crappie were sampled within the normal range for abundance with White crappies comprising approximately 25% of the total catch. Black Crappies averaged 8.9 inches and 0.4 pounds, while White Crappies averaged 9.2 inches and 0.4 pounds. Bluegill were sampled in the highest abundance ever recorded for this lake. The average Bluegill measured 7.64 inches and 0.4 pounds. Growth rate for all species is average. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Martin Lake is a 232-acre, class 24 lake located in northern Anoka County, near the town of Wyoming.  The lake is primarily managed for Walleye, with Bluegill and Black Crappie as secondary management species.  Walleye fry are stocked at a rate of 2,000 fish per littoral acre (280,000 fry) annually in the spring.  An aeration system designed to prevent winter kills was installed in 1993. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch per unit effort (CPUE) was 0.25 fish per net in the gillnets, the lowest CPUE since 1984.  The average Walleye sampled in Martin Lake was 16 inches long and the largest was 19.13 inches.  No Walleyes smaller than 13 inches were sampled.  Northern Pike CPUE was 2.25 fish per gillnet, between the first and second quartiles for abundance in class 24 lakes.  The average Northern Pike sampled in 2015 was 22.42 inches long, with pike up to 31.61 inches sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill CPUE was 31.29 fish per trap net in 2015, between the second and third quartiles for class 24 lakes.  The average bluegill sampled in the trap nets in 2015 was 7.01 inches long, and the largest was 8.94 inches.  Black Crappie CPUE was 4.29 fish per trap net, down from 13.22 fish per trap net in 2009, and between the first and second quartiles for abundance in class 24 lakes.  The average length of Black Crappies sampled in trap nets during the 2015 survey was 6.89 inches, and the largest fish was 9.41 inches.  White Crappie CPUE was 0.86 fish per net in the trap nets, between the first and second quartiles for class 24 lakes.  The average White Crappie sampled in trap nets during the 2015 survey was 8.82 inches long, and the largest was 10.39 inches.  Yellow Perch were sampled at a CPUE of 11.25 per gillnet, above the median level for class 24 lakes.  The average size Yellow Perch in 2015 was 7.15 inches in length and the largest was 8.98 inches. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye were sampled at low levels during this assessment but the average size was large, 19.3 inches long and 2.84 pounds.  Northern pike were also sampled in low abundance but quality size. Bluegill numbers and their average size were down compared to the 2004 survey. The population was still within the average range for similar types of lakes. The average size of bluegills sampled was 6.36 inches in length and 0.21 pounds. Black crappies were found in high abundance. Over 40% of the black crappies sampled exceeded 8 inches, but none were over 10 inches. White crappies were sampled in record numbers. The trap net catch was nearly 25 times higher than average, but the average size was small.    </p>",

The lake is primarily managed for Walleye, with Bluegill and Black Crappie as secondary management species.  An aeration system designed to prevent winter kills was installed in 1993. The 2021 spring trap netting survey was conducted to provide baseline information on Bluegill for the new 10-fish bag limit experimental fishing regulation that went into effect in 2021. The goal of this regulation on Martin Lake is to protect the quality size structure of Bluegill that are currently found here.  <br> \nThirteen trap nets were set on May 19, 2021 and lifted on May 20, 2021 catching a total of 344 Bluegill. Bluegill ranged in size from 3.1 inches up to 7.9 inches in length, with an average size of 6.2 inches. Aging structures (otoliths) were collected from 101 Bluegill. The largest number of fish were from 2018 (3 years old) and 2015 year-class (6 years old). The oldest Bluegill sampled in 2021 was determined to be from the 2014 year-class, making it 7 years old. The size structure of Bluegill found in Martin Lake is similar to other Metro-area lakes, though it does have a history of producing larger Bluegills. During this survey 31% of the Bluegill sampled were 7 inches or larger. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is subject to periodic winterkill and has been aerated since 1993.  Walleye management was initiated in 1985 with annual fry stocking ever since.  During the winters of 1997-98 and 1998-99 210,000 pounds of carp were removed.The most abundant species sampled in this netting was bluegill sunfish.  Nearly 10% of the fish were at least 7 inches long.  Black bullhead were next most abundant, but were near the low end of the historic range of numbers.  Most were 10-11 inches long.  Walleye were moderately abundant, captured in the third highest numbers ever.  A variety of sizes were present, up to 20.75 inches.  Northern pike have maintained a low level of abundance with most fish under 25 inches long.  Largemouth bass are also low in number, with some individuals over 16 inches long sampled.  Black crappie have maintained their historic abundance.  Many of the fish sampled were small and young.  A small number were over 9 inches long.  Yellow perch numbers were near the historic high for the lake with the largest ones over 9 inches long.  Carp were taken in moderate numbers with a maximum size less than 22 inches.  Other species captured were: green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white crappie, white sucker, and bowfin.</p>",
