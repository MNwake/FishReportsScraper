                "narrative": "<p>Big McCarthy Lake is a 110-acre lake located 5 miles northeast of Nashwauk, MN.  There is a concrete access on the northwest shore and an outlet draining to Crooked Lake and the Prairie River.  The lake is long and narrow with a steep breakline around the shoreline.  Water clarity was moderate due to bog stain.  The lack of shallow water, sparse aquatic vegetation and lower water clarity result in low productivity and low catch rates typical of bog-stained lakes.  Primary fish species include northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate was 4.5/net, which was similar to average of 5.0/net for similar lakes.  Size structure was moderate with fish up to 30 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 26 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rate was 15.9/trap net, which was also similar to average of 14.3/net for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with a no fish exceeding 8 inches.  Growth was slower than the lake class average with fish only reaching 6 inches by age 7.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie trap net catch rate was 2.0/net, which was higher than the expected range and no black crappie were sampled in gill nets.  Size structure was generally poor with few fish exceeding 10 inches.  Growth was slow and less than 85% of statewide average with fish reaching 9 inches by age 7.     <br> \n <br> \nBig McCarthy Lake has historically had low yellow perch catch rates in past assessments and only four fish were sampled by gill nets or trap nets in this assessment.  Yellow perch are an important prey species and their low abundance likely reduces the ability of the lake to support predator species.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were not sampled in this assessment and have not been sampled in past assessments despite previous fry and fingerling stocking.     <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include rock bass, white sucker, brown and yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, and pumpkinseed sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \nLakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by harvesting smaller more abundant sized fish and releasing the medium to larger sizes.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
