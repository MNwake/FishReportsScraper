Eikela Lake is a designated trout lake and is stocked every other year with brook trout.     Other than brook trout no other fish have ever been caught in test nets until this year when one white sucker was sampled. The lake is land locked with no inlets or outlet so it is probable that the sucker was carried to the lake in an anglers bait bucket.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eikala is a small, deep, clear water lake managed for Brook Trout and located 11.5 miles northwest of Isabella, MN.  The lake receives minimal fishing pressure because of its remote location and difficult access.  Water temperatures and low dissolved oxygen levels can be a problem in both the winter and summer seasons on Eikala Lake.  Water quality measurements done in the summer show water temperature are often stressful for Brook Trout in the top 8 feet of the water, while dissolved oxygen tends cause stress below a depth of 14 feet.  Thus during the summer, fishing should kept to between 8-14 feet.  Water Temperature/dissolved oxygen levels were recorded five times between May and October 2013.  These reading found August temperatures place the most stress on Brook Trout with suitable temperatures at 9 and 10 feet in the water.  In the winter months, temperature does not affect the Brook Trout like in the summer.  Dissolved oxygen does limit the suitable area for fish.  In the late winter months of February and March, oxygen levels are often only acceptable at 2 and 3 feet below the ice.  For anglers trying to catch Brook Trout late in the winter season, fishing right below the ice is recommended. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers wishing to try for Brook Trout and unfamiliar with the area would be advised to stop at the Area DNR office for directions and a map. <br> \n</p>",
