A large portion of the aged sample (40%) was comprised of individuals 8 years and older, probably from a 1983 fry/fingerling stocking. Walleye continue to exhibit good growth in this lake reaching 1.0 pound in their third year.      Northern Pike catches in gillnets declined after an all time high catch in 1989, however densities are still above historical levels. The average size of Northern Pike has increased to 2.4 pounds .     Yellow Perch densities continue to be low despite several recent stockings.      The Smallmouth Bass gillnet catch of 3.5/lift is the same as the previous assessment which is about the historical average. The average size of Smallmouth Bass in gillnets was 16.9 inches, which is substantially larger than in previous years. No age IV, V or VI Smallmouth Bass were sampled in this assessment. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Delay Lake has an area of 102 acres with a maximum depth of 18 feet and has fairly clear water with a slight green tint.  The lake is located 2.5 miles east of Isabella on the Wanless Road (USFS Rd 172).  The access to the lake is an earthen back-in to the outlet channel off of the Wanless Road; there is little room to turn around or park.  It is best suited to small, light boats or canoes as there are curves in both directions along the road making backing a trailer a bit unsafe.  The shoreline is owned by the U.S. Forest Service with the exception of the south shore along the Wanless Road, which is Lake County land that is privately leased with five cabins present.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye is the primary species managed in Delay Lake.  The 2016 Walleye gill net catch in 4 sets was 7.0/net, with an average weight of 1.3 pounds; average numbers and size relative to similar lakes.  Trap net catch in 9 sets was 0.7/net with an average weight of 1.8 pounds.  The largest fish sampled in both gear types was 26.9 inches long and weighed 5 pounds.  The Walleye population is maintained through stocking.  Delay Lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings in two consecutive years followed by two un-stocked years at a rate of 100 pounds per stocking event.  In 2016, all fish aged were from stocked years.    <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass may provide some angling opportunities as well.  The Smallmouth Bass gill net catch was 4.3/net, with an average weight of 1 pound.  Trap net catch was 2.7/net, with an average weight of 0.3 pounds.  The largest fish sampled in all gear types was 17.6 inches long and weighed 2.8 pounds.  Catch rates, size and growth of Smallmouth Bass were average by Finland Area standards.  <br> \n <br> \nFour Northern Pike were sampled in trap nets for a catch of 0.4/net with an average weight of 4.7 pounds.  Average weight was greatly influenced by one fish that was 40.2 inches long. <br> \n  <br> \nRock Bass gill net catch of 1.5/net and average weight of 0.3 pounds were average by area standards.  Trap net catch of 3.0/net was double the area average, while average weight of 0.2 pounds was comparable to what has been observed in other area lakes.  Four White Sucker were sampled in gill nets with an average weight of 1.3 pounds.  <br> \n</p>",

The average size (about 1.6 pounds) was above average for this type of lake.  Northern pike were present in numbers below average for this lake class; however the average weight of 5.4 pounds was above average. There was a good smallmouth bass population in Delay Lake averaging a little less than a pound.  The average length was about 11 inches and largest smallmouth bass measured in 2008 was 17.9 inches.  The yellow perch abundance was below average for the lake class; however, 62% of the sample was greater than 8 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nDelay Lake has a small back-in public access off of USFS Road 172 into the outlet.  The outlet is narrow and shallow making the access suitable for small boats and canoes.  There is limited parking; caution should be used, as it is difficult to get totally off the road while launching. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike catch in gillnets was near the local average. Information is sketchy but apparently Northern Pike abundance was low until stockings in 1973 and 74, and has since increased. In 1971 the gillnet catch was 1/lift, in 1974 6/lift, in 1979 6/lift, and in 1983 5.5/lift. Northern Pike are apparently reproducing with good success. Walleye catch in gillnets was nearly 2 times the local average. Young-of-the-year Walleye were sampled in 1/4 inch mesh trapnets and are probably the result of 1983 fry stocking, although the presence of two distinct sizes indicate possible natural reproduction. The source of adult Walleye is unknown. In the 1971, 72, and 74 test nettings, only one Walleye was sampled, in 1979, 9 Walleye (9\"-20\") were sampled in one gillnet. In 1983, Walleye catch had risen to 15/lift. There are rumors that locals introduced Walleye to this lake. No records exist for Walleye stocking prior to 1981. Smallmouth Bass catch in trapnets was 4.6 times the area average. Yellow Perch, apparently abundant in the early 1970s were not sampled. Rock Bass catch in trapnets was 81% less than the area average. Only one Pumpkinseed was sampled. No minnows were sampled in three 1/4 inch mesh trapnets. </p>",

This strong year class is probably the result of fingerling and fry stocking in 1983. Age's-3 and 4 were not sampled, suggesting that natural reproduction is poor. Northern Pike densities remain high and show good growth after age-1. The Smallmouth Bass gillnet catch was 50%  lower than the previous assessment but still within the historical range of 2-7/lift. The Yellow Perch stocking in 1987 & 88 maybe showing some success with a catch of 8/gillnet lift and small numbers of young-of-the-year taken in 1/4 inch mesh trapnets. White Sucker, Rock Bass, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed are present in small numbers. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Test nets in this survey sampled average numbers of walleye, with an average weight of 2.6 pounds.  The largest walleye sampled was 4.3 pounds.  The average size of the walleye sampled in this survey was larger than in previous surveys; however, the number of walleye captured was substantially lower, which was due to the lack of small walleye (less than 18 inches) in the sample.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in Delay Lake on a 2-of-4 year rotation; however, the two most recent stockings apparently failed, as very few fish from these year classes were sampled.  If the number of small walleye was as low as the survey results indicate, it could be some time before an increase in walleye numbers is seen.Northern pike were sampled in below-average numbers, which differed from other assessments when high numbers were captured.  The northern pike sampled in this assessment ranged from 20.6 inches to 28.6 inches (5.3 pounds) and averaged 2.7 pounds.  The number of northern pike sampled in netting gear has declined in each of the last three assessments.Smallmouth bass were sampled in average numbers, which was normal for this lake.  They ranged in size from 5.5 inches to 15.0 inches (1.6 pounds).  The average size of smallmouth bass collected in this assessment was 0.8 pounds, which was smaller than in most of the other assessments.  Only about 10% of the fish in the sample were larger than 12.0 inches.Yellow perch were present; however, they were not very abundant.  Yellow perch were too small to interest most anglers.  They averaged 6.4 inches and the largest was only 7.0 inches.</p>",

There is a small public access with earthen ramp on the north side of the Wanless Road (Forest Service 172) with limited room to turn around or park. Backing a trailer is problematic as there are curves in the road in both directions making small, light boats or canoes the best option. Most of the shoreline is owned by the US Forest Service with the exception of a few privately owned cabins that are located on land leased from Lake County. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is actively managed for Walleye with 100 pounds of fingerlings currently stocked in two consecutive years followed by two non-stocked years. Gill net catch in 2020 was similar to previous surveys of the lake and within the normal range for similar lakes. Age analysis determined 100% of the catch was from stocked year classes. Growth is good with Walleye reaching about 14.5 inches by age-4. Results indicate the current stocking strategy has been successful at providing an average Walleye population with good numbers of quality sized fish.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass provide anglers with additional opportunities and the 2020 gill net catch was similar to previous surveys and within the normal range for the lake. Size of fish ranged from 9.8 to 17.4 inches with an average of 12.9 inches and 1.05 pounds. Age analysis determined eight year classes were present indicating a stable population with regular natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from the 2020 survey also indicate a small Northern Pike population continues to be present in the lake. Although not abundant pike can occasionally reach large size and have the potential to provide a memorable fishing experience for anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for common forage species remained low.  Few White Sucker and no Yellow Perch were sampled. Good growth rates for predator species suggest other forage fish not sampled well with standard survey gear may also be important to the fish community. Future surveys will continue to monitor these populations to understand the relationship between predator and prey species in the lake.  </p>",
