TRAPNET NUMBERS WERE 7 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN, BUT AVERAGE WEIGHT PER NET WAS CLOSE TO LOCAL MEDIANS, INDICATING SMALLER FISH.  A NUMBER OF SIZE CLASSES SUGGEST SEVERAL AGE CLASSES.  BLH LENGTH RANGED FROM 3 TO 11 INCHES, WITH MOST FISH UNDER 7 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH.  A GOOD POPULATION OF YEP IS INDICATED BY TRAPNETS, WITH AVERAGE SIZED FISH CAUGHT AT 5 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  ALTHOUGH NO YOY PERCH WERE FOUND IN SHORELINE SEINES.  FOUR SUCCESSIVE YEAR CLASSES SUGGEST THAT RECRUITMENT IS ADEQUATE FOR A SELF-SUSTAINING POPULATION. LARGE NUMBERS OF BLH MAY AFFECT RECRUITMENT, HOWEVER, THROUGH PREDATION ON EGGS AND FRY.  BLG AND PMK ARE PRESENT IN LOW NUMBERS AFTER THE SUMMERKILL, ALTHOUGH MANY BLG WERE FOUND DEAD ALONG THE SHORELINE.  RECRUITMENT FOR BOTH THESE SPECIES SEEMS LIMITED WITH NO YOY OR 1+ INDIVIDUALS COLLECTED BY ANY MEANS.  THE FUTURE OF THESE SPECIES IN CHANDLER LAKE IS QUESTIONABLE. SHORELINE SEINING REVEALED AN ABUNDANCE OF FHM WITH AN ESTIMATE OF 50,000 INDIVIDUALS IN A SINGLE HAUL.  THESE FISH WILL CERTAINLY PROVIDE A FORAGE BASE FOR THE PERCH, AND MAY BE CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING A LARGER PREDATOR.</p>",
