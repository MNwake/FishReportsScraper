Average length was 18.3\" and 87% of the fish were 12\" or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were average for this type of lake at 7.3/gill net.  Average size was 22.3\" and 33% of the fish measured 24\" or larger, with fish caught up to 32.6\".  Please be aware that if you decide to fish for Northern Pike, there is a 24\"-36\" protected slot length limit on the lake.  Any fish caught in that size range must be immediately returned to the water.  This regulation is intended to increase the average size of northern pike and improve the survival of yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass electrofishing catch rate was 87.4/hour.  Average length was 11.2\" and 41% of the fish were 12\" or larger.  Fish ranged in size from 5.5\"-18.3\".  Smallmouth Bass are also present in low numbers.  Four were caught while electrofishing ranging from 10.6\"-19.1\". <br> \n <br> \nOnly five Black Crappies were captured the entire survey.  Bluegill numbers looked decent at 22.9/trap net.  Average size was 6.1\" and 29% measured 7\" or larger.  Fish up to 9.3\" were caught. <br> \n</p>",

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Fourteen 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine.   <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey all 14 stations were sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at five stations, and the 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at two additional stations.  Seven stations had heavy vegetation and/or soft sediment which did not allow for seining.  A total of 17 species were sampled including blacknose shiner, blackchin shiner, mimic shiner, and pugnose shiner.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gillnet and trapnet survey on 6-9 July 2015, to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score.  This score will be an indicator of the health of West Rabbit Lake. <br> \n</p>",

Special spring time trap netting was done in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Spring trap netting was also completed in 2004 and 2005 to evaluate the special regulation.  The 2002 netting was mainly for Big Rabbit, due to ice conditions and the inability to get to East Rabbit.  Trap nets in 2009 were set from April 22-24, for a total of 22 sets.  A total of 84 northern pike were observed on Big Rabbit.  Sizes ranged from 9.4 to 36.0 inches, with a mean of 22.1 inches.  Mean size was 22.6 inches in 2000, 22.2 inches in 2001, and 21.8 inches in 2002. It appears that mean size has changed very little since the regulation went into effect.  A total of 29.8% of the northern pike in 2009 were 24.0 inches or greater.  The 2000, 2001, and 2002 spring trap netting (pre-regulation) had fish 24.0 inches or greater composing 23.5%, 14.9%, and 17.8% of the catch respectively.  This is an improvement over pre- regulation days.  Data from population assessments from summer gill netting should be analyzed to get a more complete picture of what changes if any have taken place in the northern pike population.  Walleye were also measured and counted. A total, of 52 were caught, and sizes ranged from 15.5 to 28.8 inches, and had a mean size of 22.4 inches.  They were very fat and robust. </p>",

There were even a handful of smallmouth bass sampled up to 18\".   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked for some time and are currently stocked at the rate of 334 lbs. of fingerlings every other year (odd years).  The 2015 catch was average at 4.2/net.  Average length was 13.8\" and 42% of the fish were 12\" or larger.  The 2013 year class seemed to be doing well as 54% of the fish sampled were aged to that year. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were average (5.2/net) and average size was good at 25.3\".  An impressive 62% of the fish were 24\" or larger, with fish caught up to 32.5\".  Please be aware that if you decide to fish for northern pike there is a 24\"-36\" protected slot length limit on the lake.  Any fish caught in that size range must be immediately returned to the water.  This regulation is intended to increase the average size of northern pike and improve the survival of yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was the highest to date at 96.9/hr.  Average length was 11.8\" and 47% of the fish were 12\" or larger.  Fish ranged in size from 6-18\".  <br> \n <br> \nThe panfish population didn't look as well for fishermen.  Only three black crappie were captured the entire survey.  Bluegill numbers were average at 14.3/net, but size was very small.  Average size was 4.9\", with only 5% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Rabbit is the smaller of the two basins which comprise Rabbit Lake.  Big Rabbit is 531 acres and is located at the City of Cuyuna, in Crow Wing County.  There is a public access on the east shore, near the channel connecting the two basins.  In 1992 there were 85 homes/ cabins located along the lake's six miles of shoreline.  Maximum depth is 50 feet and about 31% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility and water clarity which is about average for the area.  Bottom soils in water less than four feet deep is a mix of rubble sized (3-10\") rock, sand, marl and muck.  Some boulder size rock is also present.The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent species covered about 2% of the lake surface in 1992.  The emergent species help control nutrients and can reduce the amount of erosion caused by wave action.  Species like bulrush enhance the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Others, like wild rice, often provide additional spawning habitat for species like northern pike.  Submergent and floating leafed species provide cover and food resources for a wide variety of aquatic species.Test netting was conducted in 1997.  When compared to similar type lakes, catches of walleye, bluegill and pumpkinseed fell into the \"high\" category.  Catches of white sucker and yellow bullhead fell into the \"low\" category.The catch of northern pike doubled between the '92 and '97 nettings.  Statistical tests, however, did not show an actual increase in pike abundance.  The pike catch has been fairly consistent in the six nettings done, beginning in 1967.  All catches have been in the \"average\" category.  Pike growth was slower in '97 than in '92 but remained in the \"good\" category.  Three strong year classes provided the majority of the pike sample.  Because growth was slower, average size also decreased when compared to '92 results.  A similar trend was seen on the east basin.Walleye fingerlings have been stocked since the 1970's, and annual stocking has been done since 1981.  Eight year classes were sampled, most in low numbers.  The '93 and '94 year classes were most abundant in the catch and their growth bordered on slow.  Average size was 15 inches and 2.2 lbs. in 1992; 15 inches and 2.0 lbs. in 1997.The largemouth bass catch was in the \"average\" category in '97.  Most bass were from the '95 year class and had slow growth.  Bass are often difficult to catch in stationary nets.  They are \"net shy,\" especially when water is clear.Bluegills were present in numbers which fell into the \"high\" abundance category but the catch was similar to the '92 catch and appears to be typical for the lake.  Bluegill growth was in the \"slow\" category until age 8.  The strongest year classes were from 1990 and 1993.  About 23% of bluegills from trapnets were 7.0 inches or more in length.  In '92, 13% were this large.  Black crappies were caught in trapnets for the first time since the '82 netting.  Their abundance was in the \"average\" category.  Three year classes were sampled and growth appeared to be \"good.\"Yellow perch provide an important food resource for a lake's gamefish.  Catches of perch in test nettings have been quite variable.  The perch catch was in the \"average\" category in '97.  The strongest year class was from 1993 and had slow growth.  Another forage species sampled in '97 was white sucker.  It was present in \"low\" numbers but the catch was similar to past catch rates.  Tullibees were not sampled in '97 but have been caught in \"low\" numbers in most previous nettings.Other species sampled in '97 included: bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, rock bass and hybrid sunfish.  All were present in numbers considered to be \"average\" when compared to similar type lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Rabbit is the smaller of two basins that are known as Rabbit Lake.  Big Rabbit is the western basin and is a 531 acre lake located just north of the city of Cuyuna in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the east side of the lake, near the channel which connects the two basins.  The lake is heavily developed with 118 homes/cabins along 6 miles of shoreline, compared to 85 in 1992.  The maximum depth is 50' and about 31% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates are primarily sand, gravel, and rubble.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 33 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  Regular walleye stocking began in 1970 and fingerlings are currently stocked in alternate years at a rate of 1lb per littoral acre.  The 2002 catch of 7.4/gill net is above average when compared to similar lakes and the highest catch to date.  Average length and weight remained similar to 1997 at 16.8\" and 1.9lbs.  More than half of the walleyes sampled measured at least 18\".  The 2000 year class represented 31.3% of the gill net catch and was also prominent in spring electrofishing, accounting for 61% of the electrofishing sample.  Northern pike were caught in average numbers in 2002 at 6.9/gill net, which is the highest catch to date.  Past catches have ranged from 3.0 to 6.0/gill net.  The 1998 year class was strongest and accounted for 40% of the catch.  Average length and weight were 22.8\" and 2.5lbs, which is very similar to 1997.The largemouth bass catch of 2.7/trap net was above average and the gill net catch (0.2/gill net) was below average when compared to similar lakes.  About one third of all bass measured (gill nets and trap nets) were 12\" or larger.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 48.9/hr with an average length of 11.0\" and 41% measuring at least 12\".The bluegill catch of 35.8/trap net was average and 20.7% of trap netted bluegills measured 7\" or larger, compared to 23.0% in 1997.  No black crappies were sampled in 2002.Yellow perch are an important forage species for the lake's game fish with past catches ranging from 2.2/gill net (1974) to 30.4/gill net (1982).  At 3.8/gill net, the 2002 catch was average for the second consecutive netting with the 1999 year class representing 68% of the catch.</p>",

A public access exists between the two lakes in a channel that is navigable. The shoreline is heavily developed, with numerous houses around much of the lake.  <br> \nThe walleye management plan calls for stocking on an every other year basis at two pounds/littoral acre.   Walleye catch rate in 2009 was very good at 6.6/gill net.  Previous net catches have ranged from 0.0/gill net (1941, 1967) to 7.4/gill net (2002).  Size ranged from 7.8 to 27.6 inches, with an average of 16.6 inches.   Twelve different age classes were observed with good growth rate. Indications from past and present are that some natural reproduction does occur.  Northern pike in the rabbit lakes have had a special regulation of all northern pike 24.0 inches or larger must be returned to the water.  This is up for review and it may change to a protected slot of 24.0 to 36.0 inches as catch and release, and  one over 36.0 inches may be kept.   Northern pike catch rate was 5.2/gill net and that is comparable to past surveys.  Pike up to 36.2 inches were captured, with an average size of 23.0 inches.  This is a slight improvement over past surveys.   Black crappies were observed in low numbers.  Largemouth bass were found in good numbers of 49.4 per hour during spring electro fishing.  They ranged in size from 3.9 to 18.1 inches, with an average size of 11.4 inches <br> \n</p>",
