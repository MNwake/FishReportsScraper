Low numbers of larger fish were sampled. <br> \n     The size of the bluegills has gradually decreased while the numbers have increased. This trend has recently been observed in many of other area lakes as well.  No explanation can be given at the present time, but close attention should be given to this problem.  Average size in all surveys is as follows: 1961 survey - 8.2/net and 3.0/lb.; 1979 survey - 6.0/net and 4.5/lb.; 1983 survey - 27.6/net and 6.1/lb. <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance was extremely low in the gill net sample, but seining documented moderate numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lizzie Lake is a 4,035-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately six miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN.  Lizzie Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Lizzie Lake is connected to Pelican Lake and Prairie Lake via the Pelican River.  The Pelican River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline.  Lizzie Lake is also connected to North Lida Lake by an unnavigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Lizzie Lake is 66 feet; however, 75% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading at the time of the survey was 11.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 11.5 feet.  Lizzie Lake is included in class 27 of the Minnesota DNR lake classification scheme.       A majority of the north and west shorelines on Lizzie Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  The 1992 lake survey report referenced 289 homes/cottages and one resort.  A public water access is located along the west shoreline of the lake.  Shoreline development is limited in the southern portion of the lake.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent throughout this section of the lake.   Large stands of hardstem bulrush are also scattered along various shorelines of the northern portion of the lake and around several midlake islands.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and common cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.      Lizzie Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake is best known for its excellent bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye fishing.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate these species are abundant and have good size distributions.         The bluegill test-net catch rate in the recent series of surveys has consistently remained within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Forty-eight percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.8 inches at six years of age.     The test-net catch rate for northern pike has also consistently remained within the normal range.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 10.0 to 30.9 inches with an average length and weight of 18.3 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.1 inches at five years of age.     Summer test-net indices are not reliable indicators of largemouth bass and black crappie abundance; however, angler reports for these species have been positive.     The walleye test net catch rate has remained very stable over the recent series of lake surveys and is within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  The 2002 year class of walleye appears to be strong and should provide consistently good fishing for several years.  Walleye ranged in length from 11.2 to 26.0 inches with an average length and weight of 16.7 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 13.6 inches at four years of age.     The DNR stocks 2.5 million walleye fry into Lizzie Lake on a biennial basis.  This stocking supplements a limited amount of walleye natural reproduction.  The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing this lake presently has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the fish habitat.  In 1999, the DNR constructed and placed smallmouth bass spawning structures in Lizzie Lake to increase the available spawning habitat for this specie.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in Lizzie Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     Lizzie Lake is also a popular waterfowl hunting lake.  Many hunters pursue ducks and geese in the southern portion of the lake.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Lizzie Lake is a 4,035-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately six miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN.  Lizzie Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Lizzie Lake is connected to Pelican Lake and Prairie Lake via the Pelican River.  The Pelican River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline.  Lizzie Lake is connected to Crystal Lake by a navigable culvert under County Road 31.  Lizzie Lake is also connected to North Lida Lake by an unnavigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Lizzie Lake is 66 feet; however, 75% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 22.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.5 to 11.5 feet.  Lizzie Lake was designated as infested with zebra mussels in 2009.  Filtration by zebra mussels has increased the water clarity.   <br> \n     A majority of the north and west shorelines of Lizzie Lake have been developed.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located along the west shoreline of the lake.  Shoreline development is limited in the southern portion of the lake.  Hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and phragmites are prevalent throughout this section of the lake.   Large stands of Hardstem Bulrush are also scattered along various shorelines of the northern portion of the lake and around several midlake islands.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and Common Cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. Lizzie Lake is also a popular waterfowl hunting lake.  Many hunters pursue ducks and geese in the southern portion of the lake.     <br> \n     Lizzie Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-Walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present.      <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Twenty-eight percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.6 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has also remained stable.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.5 to 31.9 inches with an average length and weight of 19.8 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 20.0 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance declined in this survey and is now at the lowest recorded for this lake. Walleyes ranged in length from 12.1 to 25.6 inches with an average length and weight of 18.1 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 4.7 to 19.4 inches with a mean length and weight of 12.4 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 6.6 to 18.9 inches. <br> \n      To maintain the excellent fishing this lake presently has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the fish habitat.  In 1999, the DNR constructed and placed Smallmouth Bass spawning structures in Lizzie Lake to increase the available spawning habitat for that specie. <br> \n    Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in Lizzie Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Lizzie Lake is a 4,035-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately six miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN.  Lizzie Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Lizzie Lake is connected to Pelican Lake and Prairie Lake via the Pelican River.  The Pelican River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline.  Lizzie Lake is connected to Crystal Lake by a navigable culvert under County Road 31.  Lizzie Lake is also connected to North Lida Lake by an unnavigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Lizzie Lake is 66 feet; however, 75% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 22.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 11.5 feet.  Filtration by zebra mussels has increased the water clarity.   <br> \n     A majority of the north and west shorelines of Lizzie Lake has been developed.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located along the west shoreline of the lake.  Shoreline development is limited in the southern portion of the lake.  Hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and phragmites are prevalent throughout this section of the lake.   Large stands of hardstem bulrush are also scattered along various shorelines of the northern portion of the lake and around several midlake islands.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and common cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  <br> \n     Lizzie Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-Walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions.     <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Bluegill size structure has also remained consistently good.   Fifty-seven percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.4 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has also remained consistently stable.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.4 to 32.0 inches with an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 25.4 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has also remained very stable over the recent series of lake surveys.  The 2010 year class appears to be strong and should provide consistently good fishing for several years.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.8 to 25.1 inches with an average length and weight of 15.3 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.9 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 8.8 to 18.7 inches.  Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 6.4 to 18.9 inches. <br> \n      To maintain the excellent fishing this lake presently has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the fish habitat.  In 1999, the DNR constructed and placed smallmouth bass spawning structures in Lizzie Lake to increase the available spawning habitat for this species. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in Lizzie Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Lizzie Lake is also a popular waterfowl hunting lake.  Many hunters pursue ducks and geese in the southern portion of the lake.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Lizzie Lake is a 4,035-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately six miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN.  Lizzie Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Lizzie Lake is connected to Pelican Lake and Prairie Lake via the Pelican River.  The Pelican River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline.  Lizzie Lake is connected to Crystal Lake by a navigable culvert under County Road 31.  Lizzie Lake is also connected to North Lida Lake by an unnavigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Lizzie Lake is 66 feet; however, 75% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2019 survey was 16.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.5 to 22.0 feet.     <br> \n     A majority of the north and west shorelines of Lizzie Lake have been developed.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located along the west shoreline of the lake.  Shoreline development is limited in the southern portion of the lake.  Hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and phragmites are prevalent throughout this section of the lake.   Large stands of hardstem bulrush are also scattered along various shorelines of the northern portion of the lake and around several mid-lake islands.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Lizzie Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-Walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present.      <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 9.9 to 24.7 inches with an average length and weight of 19.6 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.7 inches at four years of age.       <br> \n    Northern Pike abundance has remained stable.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.2 to 25.3 inches with an average length and weight of 20.0 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 20.8 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing survey indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 3.9 to 18.4 inches with an average length and weight of 13.7 inches and 1.6 pounds. Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 15.0 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Catch data indicate that Smallmouth Bass abundance has been increasing.  Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 5.9 to 18.3 inches.  Smallmouth Bass attain an average length of 13.6 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Twenty-three percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length and 3% were 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at six years of age. <br> \n      To maintain the excellent fishing this lake presently has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the fish habitat.  In 1999, the DNR constructed and placed Smallmouth Bass spawning structures in Lizzie Lake to increase the available spawning habitat for that species. <br> \n    Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in Lizzie Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Lizzie Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2009.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.       <br> \n     Lizzie Lake is also a popular waterfowl hunting lake.  Many hunters pursue ducks and geese in the southern portion of the lake (Rush Lake).  Rush Lake is annually designated as a DNR waterfowl feeding and resting area from September 1 through the final day of the duck hunting season.  Operation of motorized watercraft in Rush Lake during that time period is prohibited.      <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lizzie Lake is a 4,035-acre mesotrophic lake (moderate fertility) located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately six miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN.  Lizzie Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Lizzie Lake is connected to Pelican Lake and Prairie Lake via the Pelican River.  The Pelican River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline.  Lizzie Lake is also connected to North Lida Lake by an unnavigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Lizzie Lake is 66 feet; however, 75% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading at the time of the survey was 6.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 11.5 feet.  Lizzie Lake is included in lake class 27 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.       A majority of the north and west shorelines of Lizzie Lake have been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  The 1992 lake survey referenced 289 homes/cottages and one resort.  A public water access is located along the west shoreline of the lake.  Shoreline development is limited in the southern portion of the lake.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent throughout this section of the lake.   Large stands of hardstem bulrush are also scattered along various shorelines of the northern portion of the lake and around several midlake islands.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and common cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.      Lizzie Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake is best known for its excellent bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and walleye fishing.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate these species are abundant and have good size distributions.         The bluegill test-net catch rate in the recent series of surveys has consistently remained within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Twenty seven percent of the bluegills were at least seven inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.7 inches at six years of age.     Black crappies sampled during a spring trap netting assessment ranged in length from 7.0 to 13.8 inches with an average length and weight of 9.5 inches and 0.5 pound.  Crappies attain an average length of 10.4 inches at four years of age.     Summer test-net indices are not reliable indicators of largemouth bass abundance; however, angler reports on this specie have been positive.     The walleye test net catch rate has remained very stable over the recent series of lake surveys and is within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  The 1998 year class of walleye appears to be very strong and should provide consistently good fishing for several years.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.0 to 27.4 inches with an average length and weight of 14.0 inches and 1.0 pound.  Walleye attain an average length of 13.5 inches at four years of age.     The DNR stocks 2.5 million walleye fry into Lizzie Lake on a biennial basis.  This stocking supplements a limited amount of walleye natural reproduction.  The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing this lake presently has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the fish habitat.  In 1999, the DNR constructed and placed smallmouth bass spawning structures in Lizzie Lake to increase the available spawning habitat for this specie.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in Lizzie Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     Lizzie Lake is also a popular waterfowl hunting lake.  Many hunters pursue ducks and geese in the southern portion of the lake.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Lizzie Lake is a 4,035-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately six miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN.  Lizzie Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Lizzie Lake is connected to Pelican Lake and Prairie Lake via the Pelican River.  The Pelican River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline.  Lizzie Lake is also connected to North Lida Lake by an unnavigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Lizzie Lake is 66 feet; however, 75% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading at the time of the survey was 8.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 11.5 feet.   <br> \n     A majority of the north and west shorelines of Lizzie Lake has been developed.  Homes and  cottages compose the majority of the development.  A public water access is located along the west shoreline of the lake.  Shoreline development is limited in the southern portion of the lake.  Hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and phragmites are prevalent throughout this section of the lake.   Large stands of hardstem bulrush are also scattered along various shorelines of the northern portion of the lake and around several midlake islands.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and common cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  <br> \n     Lizzie Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake is best known for its excellent bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye fishing.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate these species are abundant and have good size distributions.     <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has remained stable in the recent series of surveys.  Bluegill size structure has also remained consistently good.   Thirty-four percent of the bluegills in the trap net sample were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.8 inches at eight years of age. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance has also remained consistently stable.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 9.7 to 31.7 inches with an average length and weight of 17.7 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 21.2 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Summer test-net indices are not reliable indicators of largemouth bass and black crappie abundance or size structure; however, angler reports for these species have been positive. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has remained very stable over the recent series of lake surveys.  The  2006 and 2008 year classes of walleye appear to be strong and should provide consistently good fishing for several years.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.7 to 26.9 inches with an average length and weight of 15.4 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.0 inches at four years of age. <br> \n      To maintain the excellent fishing this lake presently has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the fish habitat.  In 1999, the DNR constructed and placed smallmouth bass spawning structures in Lizzie Lake to increase the available spawning habitat for this species. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in Lizzie Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Lizzie Lake is also a popular waterfowl hunting lake.  Many hunters pursue ducks and geese in the southern portion of the lake.      <br> \n</p>",

The average weight of individual walleye was 0.9 lbs.  There was a paucity of larger walleyes. Aging data showed good year classes of walleyes from 1984 and 1981 when no stocking took place. Walleye fry were stocked in 1983 and 1980 both of these years had strong year classes of walleyes. The yellow perch gillnet catch has been low in all nettings conducted on Lizzie Lake.  Yellow perch abundance in seine hauls has been moderate during some years and zero or nearly zero in other years.</p>",

Average weight of northern pike was 2.0lbs.  Pike ranged in age from I+ through VI+. <br> \n     Yellow bullhead abundance was well above area medians, but abundance of other rough fish species appear low. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance declined from 83.1 per trap net lift in 1986 to 31.6 per net, but still remained higher than previous surveys. Growth rates of bluegill appear to be average.  Bluegill size structure improved as 78% of the bluegill measured were greater than 7.0 inches in length. <br> \n      Yellow perch abundance increased from 2.6 per gill net lift in 1986 to 6.0 per net, but continues to remain low, which is consistent with previous surveys.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance was 6.0 per gill net lift, similar to 5.7 per net in 1986. Average weight of walleye was 1.0 lb.  Growth rates are average.  Aging information indicated that age-classes I+ through VIII+ were sampled and that walleye natural reproduction is occurring.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Lizzie Lake is a 4,035-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately six miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN.  Lizzie Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Lizzie Lake is connected to Pelican Lake and Prairie Lake via the Pelican River.  The Pelican River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline.  Lizzie Lake is also connected to North Lida Lake by an unnavigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Lizzie Lake is 66 feet; however, 75% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading at the time of the survey was 7.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 11.5 feet.  The MNDNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Lizzie Lake is included in lake class 27 of this classification scheme.  Other area lakes in this same classification include North Lida, Crystal, and Big Pelican.   <br> \n     A majority of the north and west shorelines of Lizzie Lake has been developed.  Homes and  cottages compose the majority of the development.  The 1992 lake survey referenced 289 homes/cottages.  A public water access is located along the west shoreline of the lake.  Shoreline development is limited in the southern portion of the lake.  Hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and phragmites are prevalent throughout this section of the lake.   Large stands of hardstem bulrush are also scattered along various shorelines of the northern portion of the lake and around several midlake islands.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and common cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  <br> \n     Lizzie Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake is best known for its excellent bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye fishing.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate these species are abundant and have good size distributions.     <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate has remained stable in the recent series of surveys and has consistently been within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Bluegill size structure has also remained consistently good.  Forty-two percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.8 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     The test-net catch rate for northern pike has also consistently remained within the normal range.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 12.1 to 30.2 inches with an average length and weight of 17.6 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.7 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Summer test-net indices are not reliable indicators of largemouth bass and black crappie abundance; however, angler reports for these species have been positive. <br> \n     The walleye test net catch rate has remained very stable over the recent series of lake surveys and is within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  The 2002, 2004, and 2006 year classes of walleye appear to be strong and should provide consistently good fishing for several years.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.4 to 24.2 inches with an average length and weight of 15.6 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n      The DNR stocks 2.5 million walleye fry into Lizzie Lake on a biennial basis.  This stocking supplements a limited amount of walleye natural reproduction.  The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing this lake presently has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the fish habitat.  In 1999, the DNR constructed and placed smallmouth bass spawning structures in Lizzie Lake to increase the available spawning habitat for this species. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in Lizzie Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Lizzie Lake is also a popular waterfowl hunting lake.  Many hunters pursue ducks and geese in the southern portion of the lake.      <br> \n</p>",

Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and backpack electrofishing was completed at all 18 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 15 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 2 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 1 station. Nearshore sampling captured 28 species of fish including 10 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Muskellunge, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and three species that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in August 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Lizzie Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Otter Tail River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Lizzie Lake is a 4,035-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately six miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN.  Lizzie Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Lizzie Lake is connected to Pelican Lake and Prairie Lake via the Pelican River.  The Pelican River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline.  Lizzie Lake is connected to Crystal Lake by a navigable culvert under County Road 31.  Lizzie Lake is also connected to North Lida Lake by an unnavigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Lizzie Lake is 66 feet; however, 75% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2022 survey was 15.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.5 to 22.0 feet.     <br> \n     A majority of the north and west shorelines of Lizzie Lake have been developed.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located along the west shoreline of the lake.  Shoreline development is limited in the southern portion of the lake.  Hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and phragmites are prevalent throughout this section of the lake.   Large stands of hardstem bulrush are also scattered along various shorelines of the northern portion of the lake and around several mid-lake islands.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Lizzie Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-Walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Bluegill, and Walleye are the dominant gamefish species present.      <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has remained stable.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 16.1 to 27.3 inches with an average length and weight of 20.3 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 21.6 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing survey in 2019 indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 3.9 to 18.4 inches with an average length and weight of 13.7 inches and 1.6 pounds. Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 15.0 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Catch and age data indicate that Smallmouth Bass abundance has been increasing and that reproduction is consistently good.  Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 5.5 to 20.1 inches.  Smallmouth Bass attain an average length of 13.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Forty-two percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length and 15% were 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.8 inches at eight years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has been at a lower level in recent surveys compared to historical abundance.  Walleyes ranged in length from 11.5 to 26.3 inches with an average length and weight of 17.8 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n      In 1999, the DNR constructed and placed Smallmouth Bass spawning structures in Lizzie Lake to increase the available spawning habitat for that species. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Lizzie Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2009.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.       <br> \n     Lizzie Lake is also a popular waterfowl hunting lake.  Many hunters pursue ducks and geese in the southern portion of the lake (Rush Lake).  Rush Lake is annually designated as a DNR waterfowl feeding and resting area from September 1 through the final day of the duck hunting season.  Operation of motorized watercraft in Rush Lake during that time period is prohibited.   <br> \n</p>",
