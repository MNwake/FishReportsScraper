                "narrative": "<p>Oslo is a 105 acre lake located about 30 miles southeast of International Falls, MN.  The lake is connected to Brown Lake by a small creek that flows through a marsh.  Most (55%) of the lake is less than 15 feet deep, but has very little aquatic vegetation and productivity is low.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were stocked in 1950 and 1965.  However, past investigations show no record of bass becoming established and none were captured during the 2010 assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Most pike were small and length in the sample ranged from 10.1-24.6 inches with a mean of 19.7. The mean weight was 1.65 pounds and growth was well below the area average. <br> \n <br> \nOne yellow perch was captured in 2010; previous investigations also indicate low abundance.  White sucker have been captured in the past; however, they were generally rare and none were captured in 2010.  </p>",
