Future plans call for complete removal of all the remaining piling. <br> \n     North Ten Mile Lake was last surveyed in 1968.  Since that survey, northern pike abundance, as measured by number per trap net, declined from 2.7 per net to 0.5 per net.  <br> \n     The black bullhead catch rate also declined from 80.2 per trap net to 0.2 per trap net.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased from 2.0 per trap net to 89.7 per trap net with ages-I+ to VI+ represented in the sample.  <br> \n     The black crappie trap net catch rate declined from 12.0 per net to 3.2 per net with ages-II+ to IV+ represented in the sample.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance increased from 0.1 per gill net lift in 1968 to 5.0 per gill net. <br> \n      Walleye abundance declined from 6.0 per gill net lift to 5.0 per gill net.  The average weight of walleye sampled remained stable at 2.1 lbs.  Assessment of walleye natural reproduction cannot be done as there are no barriers to fish movement from South Ten Mile Lake. Growth rates appear to be good. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     North Ten Mile Lake is located in southwestern Otter Tail County approximately four miles southwest of Dalton, MN.  North Ten Mile Lake is a 667-acre eutrophic (shallow and fertile) lake that is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The Pomme de Terre River inlet is located along the east shoreline while the outlet is located along the south shoreline.  The outlet flows into South Ten Mile Lake via an unnavigable channel under County Road 35.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of North Ten Mile Lake is 14 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline remains undeveloped.  A resort is located on the southeast shoreline.  A privately owned access is located at the resort.  Common cattail and hardstem bulrush are prevalent along the shoreline of the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> \n      A spring electrofishing survey was conducted to analyze the Largemouth Bass population.  Catch data indicate that North Ten Mile Lake has an abundant Largemouth Bass population with a quality size structure.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 3.8 to 17.3 inches with an average length and weight of 13.0 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 13.9 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     A special harvest regulation (21-inch minimum length limit) for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass was implemented in 2001 and modified in 2013 after data analysis and public comment.  The current regulation states that all bass 14.0 inches and larger must be immediately released with the exception of one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  This regulation was implemented in an attempt to improve the size structure of the bass populations.  A long-term evaluation of the Largemouth Bass population indicates that the regulation has been moderately successful. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     North Ten Mile Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2017.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.       <br> \n</p>",
