                "narrative": "<p>Number of Walleye sampled (1.33/gill net) was within the normal range, while 4.83 lbs/gill net was above the third quartile for lake class 28 of the Schupp classification system.  Mean weight of the four Walleye sampled was 3.63 lbs.  Walleye are not stocked in Williams Lake and no fish under age 5 were sampled.  Number of Northern Pike sampled (2.33/gill net) fell below the first quartile, while 8.30 lbs/ gill net was within the normal range.  These numbers result in a mean weight of 3.56 lbs.  Northern Pike exhibit slow growth the first year, but the growth rates improve after that to result in a mean length at age 4 of 21.20 inches.  Only two year classes were represented in the sample.  Largemouth Bass and Bluegill catch rates were above the third quartile for lakes of this classification.  Both species presently have slow growth rates, reflected in small size structures.  Largemouth Bass Proportional Stock Density (PSD) = 26 and mean length at age 4 is 9.23 inches.  Largemouth Bass sizes may be underestimated due to sampling gear selectivity. Mean length at age 4 for Bluegill is 3.50 inches and the PSD=24.  Black Crappie catches were within the normal ranges.  Growth rates of Black Crappie are slow for the first two years, but recover quickly after age 3. Mean length at age 5 is 10.12 inches.  Number of Pumpkinseed sampled was within the normal range, while pounds sampled was above the third quartile.  This apparent improvement in size structure over the other panfish is evidenced by the high PSD (80) and presence of some Relative Stock Density - Preferred (RSD-P) length fish (RSD-P=3).  However, the size distribution may be unbalanced if the lack of Pumpkinseed < quality length as evidenced by the sample is accurate.  Catch rates of Yellow Perch and White Sucker fell below the first quartile for lakes of this class.  Rock Bass catches were within the normal ranges.\n</p>",

There is no public access on the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Williams Lake is in class 28.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Big Bass, Emma, Gilmore, Indian, Nagel, and Thomas.Williams Lake provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  Northern pike were sampled in numbers (6.0 pike/gillnet) \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.9 inches and 2.8 pounds, with pike measured up to 30.2 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were similar to other class 28 lakes.  Williams Lake supports a good panfish population of black crappie and bluegill.  Anglers can expect to find black crappie in the 9-10 size range, while bluegill tend to run small in size with low numbers of fish over 6 inches.  Williams Lake supports a good largemouth bass population with fish in the 12-17 inch size range common.Other species sampled included low numbers of yellow perch, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and white sucker.</p>",
