                "narrative": "<p>Noma Lake is a small, moderately deep lake located just north of Wirt, MN.  The lake is only 55 acres but has a maximum depth of 53 feet.  It has relatively clear, soft water.  There are only 6 cabins on the lake.  A U.S Forest Service campground can be found on the northwest side off County Road #31.     The fish population is composed of the typical species usually found in small Minnesota bass-panfish lakes.  Northern pike are moderately abundant and of quality size.  In this survey, they ranged in length from 20.3-42.5 inches and had a mean length of 27.7 inches.  The mean weight of those sampled was 5.5 pounds.  Most of the northerns (84%) were age 3-5.  Growth was very good, exceeding the statewide averges.     Yellow perch were small and not abundant in this survey.  This was the lowest catch in any of the past assessments.     Black crappie although not large were sampled in good numbers.  The mean length in the gill net was 7.7 inches while those in the trap nets were 6.9 inches.  A four year old black crappie in the gill nets were 7.3 inches compared to the statewide average of 8.3 inches.     Bluegill were abundant in Noma Lake.  Of the 261 sampled, however, none were over 8 inches.  The mean length of those sampled in the trap nets was 5.9 inches compared to those sampled in the gill net of 6.6 inches.  Growth was very good but slowed in older fish when compared to the statewide averages.     Largemouth are not adequately sampled in summer survey gear but were sampled in the spring electrofishing survey.  Most were small with a average size of 10.1 inches.  The largest largemouth sampled was 18.4 inches.     Walleye were stocked several times in the late 1980's and again in 1996 and 2000 in an attempt to create a bonus walleye fishery.  As in many other bass-panfish lakes like Noma, stocking results were poor.  Although walleye have been caught by anglers in the past years and a few sampled in this assessment, this type of stocking is not cost effective and should be discontinued.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Noma Lake is a small bass-panfish lake located just north of Wirt, MN in the Big Fork River watershed.  The lake is 55 acres with a maximum depth of 47 feet and relatively clear water.  This is a soft water lake with a total alkalinity of only 12 ppm.  An earthen ramp public access is located at the southwest corner of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Lake Management Plan (LMP) was last revised in 2003.  Northern Pike and Bluegill were considered primary management species, with Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass as secondary management species.  A standard lake survey was conducted in July 2022 to assess the status of the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 gill-net catch for Northern Pike exceeded the LMP goal but was identical to the previous survey.  Size structure of pike declined from previous surveys but was still favorable.  Pike ranged from 18.8 to 31.6 inches and averaged 24.4 inches in 2022.  Ages 3 through 8 were represented in the sample with average growth.  Pike averaged 23.7 inches after 5 years of growth.  The presence of fish exceeding 30 inches is rare in such a small lake.  Small lakes are often vulnerable to overharvest.  Anglers are encouraged to release fish over 26 inches to maintain quality angling opportunities.  <br> \n <br> \nNoma Lake has typically produced Bluegill in moderate to high numbers with poor size structure.  The 2022 trap-net catch was below average for the lake and lakes with similar habitat.  Size structure remained poor.  Sampled Bluegill ranged from 3.4 to 8.1 inches with an average length of 6.0 inches.  Ages 2 through 10 were represented in the sample with ages 3 and 7 the most frequently sampled.  Growth was typical for this type of lake; Bluegill averaged 6.4 inches after 6 years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches for Black Crappie have been highly variable in Noma Lake.  The 2022 gill-net catch was above average compared to similar lakes, while the trap-net catch was below average.  Size structure was poor as only two fish exceeded 9 inches.  Ages 2 through 6 were represented in the sample with average growth.  Crappie averaged 8.4 inches after 5 years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nAs in previous surveys, low numbers of Largemouth Bass were sampled in gill nets and trap nets.  Sampled bass ranged from 5.6 to 20.5 inches.  Two fish exceeding 20 inches were sampled, indicating the opportunity to catch a trophy.  Anglers are encouraged to release bass exceeding 15 inches to maintain quality angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n</p>",

The mean length of the bluegills caught in the trap nets was 6.8 inches.     Very few largemouth bass were caught in the nets.  Bass are difficult to net though, so they may be more abundant than this assessment would indicate.     There are some walleyes in Noma Lake, but the population is very small.  The fish that were sampled were large.  The walleyes captured in the gill nets had a mean weight of 3.4 pounds.     Northern pike also aren't very common, but the fish that were sampled fish had a mean weight of 5.2 pounds.     Yellow perch are fairly abundant, but the population is dominated by smaller fish.  The average size of the sampled perch was 6.6 inches long.     Black crappies and pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish are also present in low numbers.   </p>",
