                "narrative": "<p>Skogman is a fertile 226-acre lake in Isanti County.  The nearest town is Cambridge.  Of the 226 acres, 135 (60%) are shallower than 15 feet (littoral area).  Maximum depth is 36 feet.  The shoreline length is 6.1 miles.  Shoreline development is high, and water clarity is typically low due to frequent algae blooms. <br> \n <br> \nSkogman is a bass-panfish lake managed primarily for walleye.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing have been assigned classifications based on their physical, chemical and biological similarities.  Skogman is assigned to lake class 34.  Various stockings have occurred through the years of mainly northern pike and walleye.  The present fisheries management plan calls for walleye fingerlings to be stocked every other year at a rate of one pound per littoral area.   <br> \n <br> \nIn order to compare the present fish population to others in this lake class and to evaluate management goals, Skogman Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2006.  Gear sampling types for fish consisted of standard gillnets, standard trapnets and night electrofishing for largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (1.0 per net) was below normal compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Skogman has historically had a low walleye population.  The stocking of fingerlings has maintained the walleye population in the lake.   Past surveys though have indicate limited migration is possible from downstream sources as far as Rum River.  Average weight per fish was high at 2.9 pounds.  All fish sampled were greater than 18 inches in length.  Fish age five, six, and eight were present in the sample.  The lack of younger fish indicates that the success of recent stocking events has been limited.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 1.3 fish per net which was also below normal compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average weight was high though at 4.3 pounds.  The northern pike that were sampled ranged from 21.5 to 31.4 inches in length with an average of 27.3 inches.  Fifty percent of the northern pike captured were over 28 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nNighttime electrofishing was used to sample the largemouth bass population.  The sample (36.9 bass/hour) ranged in length from 8.3 to 19.3 inches, averaging 14.6 inches.  The number of bass sampled was down from what was sampled in 1996 (63.5 bass/hour), but average length increased from 12.2 inches.  Bass ages three through ten were well represented in the sample with good distribution.  Growth was normal.    <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnet catch o 27.9 fish per net was within the normal range when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and typical of catches in past surveys.  Bluegill ranged from 4.4 to 6.7 inches with an average of 5.6 inches.  About eighty-five percent of the bluegills sampled were less than six inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBoth trapnets and gillnets sampled black crappies.  The trapnets caught an average of 0.8 fish per net.  The gillnets caught an average of 6.5 fish per net.  Black crappies ranged in size from 4.8 to 8.3 inches in length.  The average size was 6.3 inches.  Black crappie abundance is normal but size is small when compared to similar lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nSeven other species were sampled in the netting gear: brown bullhead, black bullhead,  yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, carp, and bowfin.  With the exception of black bullheads, these species have historically been sampled in fairly low numbers on Skogman Lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Skogman is a bass-panfish lake managed primarily for Walleye.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing have been assigned classifications based on their physical, chemical and biological similarities.  Skogman is assigned to lake class 34. The present fisheries management plan calls for annual fall Walleye fingerlings stocking at a rate of one pound per littoral area (135 pounds).  In order to compare the present fish population to others in this lake class and to evaluate management goals, a population assessment was conducted in July of 2013.  Compared to other class 34 lakes, catch rates were high for Northern Pike, low for Walleye, and normal for Bluegill, Black Crappie and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nSkogman has historically had a low Walleye population maintained by fingerling stocking.  The 2013 catch rate of 1 Walleye per net lift is very similar to the previous two assessments.  Sampled Walleye were large, averaging 3.3 pounds, with all fish exceeding 19 inches.    Walleye ages ranged from 5 to 9 years.  Growth was fairly typical but the absence of younger fish indicates limited success of more recent stockings, possibly due to Northern Pike predation. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gillnet catch, 9.7 per net, exceeded the lake class norm and the historic lake mean.  Average weight remains high though at 3.1 pounds.  Sampled northerns ranged from 17.9 to 32.7 inches in length with a 23.9 inch average.  The bulk of the catch was comprised of fish between 4 and 6 years of age.  Pike growth was slower than the statewide rate. <br> \n <br> \nThe abundance of both Bluegill and Black Crappie was similar to previous assessments and other lakes in class 34.  While neither species had a particularly high size structure, crappies over 8 inches in length and some Bluegill greater than 7 inches were present.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite high Northern Pike levels, Yellow Perch numbers rebounded from a historic low in the previous assessment to normal levels.  Harvestable size perch were not present in the catch.  Although their abundance increased, perch were essentially forage size ranging from 5.5 to 6.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the netting gear included Brown Bullhead, Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and Bowfin.  These species were present in low or normal abundance.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Skogman lake was surveyed to assess the current fish population and evaluate the lake management goals.  A moderate winterkill occured in 1997.  Largemouth bass, bluegill, and walleye were absent from in the spring testnetting and were therefore stocked in May and June of 1997.  Survey netting data will also be used to assess the effectiveness of reestablishing these populations.Minnesota lakes that are managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Skogman lake is assigned to lake class 25.Black bullhead had the highest gillnet catch rate at 21.5 per net.  All the bullheads in the catch were between 5.6 and 6.9 inches.  The only higher recorded catch was in 1981.  The catch rate was also high compared to other lakes in class 25.Yellow perch were also sampled at their highest rate since 1981.  Eleven perch were caught per gillnet with a range of 5.2 to 6.3 inches.  While this catch was high for the lake it was normal for the lake class.  Eighty eight percent of the catch was represented by the 1997 and 1998 year classes.  These 3 and 4 year olds were the first year classes following the winterkill.Northern pike were sampled at an all time high abundance.  Northerns were quality sized ranging from 18.2 to 31.7 inches and averaging 3 pounds.  The catch rate of 9.3 northerns per gillnet lift and the three pound average exceeded management goals and lake class norms.  The 1997 year class, which immediately followed the winterkill, accounted for 59% of the sample.  These four year olds averaged 23.3 inches and grew quickly following the winterkill but slowed to normal after the first two years. Based on both the gillnet and trapnet catch, black crappie were sampled at a normal rate for the lake class.  The  combined catch ranged in length from 5.3 to 9.7 inches with a 6.5 inch mean.  The crappie age structure was dominated by the 1998 year class which averaged 6.6 inches and should soon contribute significantly to the creel.  Walleye, bluegill, and largemouth bass were absent in the testnetting following the 1997 winterkill.Although walleye fry were stocked in the spring of 1997 and fingerlings were stocked in the fall of 1998 and 2000, only one walleye was sampled during the survey.  Obviously, the catch rate is below both the management goal and the lake class norm.  Depending on the growth of the stocked walleye, some year classes may not have been susceptible to the netting.  The lakes drainage alows fish passage to several other lakes and eventually the Rum River.  Skogman lake has had a historically low walleye population.One hundred adult blugill were stocked in May of 1997.  Although they averaged only 5 inches, the 2001 bluegill trapnet catch rate (16.4/set) was back to normal for lake class 25.  Three and four year old bluegill represented 90% of the catch.  Growth was rapid for two years then slowed to a rate similar to the statewide norm. In the spring of 1997, forty eight adult largemouth bass were stocked to restore the winterkill depleted population.  The 2001 electrofishing sampled 63.5 bass per hour, an increase from the pre-winterkill rate of 50.6.  Largemouth ranged in length from 3.1 to 18.4 inches with a 12.2 inch and 1.2 pound average.  Bass were well distributed from the 1993 through the 1999 year classes.  Growth was normal compared to the statewide average.     The 2001 survey results indicate that the fishery recovered well from the 1997 winterkill with the exception of the walleye population.  Species that survived the winterkill were sampled in high abundance, most notably northern pike, black bullhead, and yellow perch.         Other species present during the survey included bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, common carp, green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiner, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Skogman Lake is a 215 acre lake characterized by a long and narrow basin with several small bays.  This largemouth bass-panfish lake is managed primarily for walleye, largemouth bass, northern pike, and panfish.  The maximum depth is 36 feet.  During most summers, the lake is subject to moderately-heavy algal blooms and thermal stratification, making dissolved oxygen concentrations very low in depths of 15 feet and below.  Past survey records have not documented winterkill or summerkill.  Various stocking has occurred through the years.   Present management plans call for walleye fingerlings stocked on an alternate year basis.During July 8-12, 1996, a population assessment was conducted to evaluate the present fish population in Skogman Lake.  Gear types consisted of: six standard gillnets and nine standard trapnets, night electrofishing for largemouth bass on May 31, 1996, and standard seining natural reproduction checks on September 13, 1996.  Skogman Lake is in lake class 25 and fish abundances are based on the mean ranges observed in other lake class 25 lakes.Walleye abundance was normal for this type of lake.  Historically having a low population, this was the first time they were sampled in normal abundance.  The consistency of stocking fingerlings has no doubt maintained this level of walleye in the lake but, as in past surveys, some migration is possible from downstream sources as far as Rum River.  Natural reproduction of walleye is very limited in this lake due to lack of suitable gravel/rock spawning habitat.  The walleye sampled ranged from 10.9 to 24.4 inches with an average of 17.9 inches.  The average weight was 2.3 pounds.  These sizes were very similar to the fish caught during the Fannie Lake assessment, which was conducted in 1996.Northern pike abundance was also normal but was the highest recorded catch in eight survey years since 1951.  Like the walleye, they were usually sampled in low abundance for this type of lake.  Their lengths ranged from 19.4 to 28.0 inches with an average of 23.5 inches.  The average weight was 3.1 pounds.  These were very nice sized fish.  Ages 2-6 were sampled by the catch with strong year-class representation for each age.  This would indicate good natural  reproduction over the last six years.The 1996 sampling indicated the bluegill abundance was normal for this lake type, which was typical of catches in past surveys, however, the last two surveys in 1987 and 1991 found their numbers to be rather high.  This year's catch sampled bluegill from 2.7 to 7.3 inches with the average being 5.1 inches.  Seining sampled a good catch of this year's natural reproduction which averaged 1.35 inches in September.Black crappie catches were high in both gillnets and trapnets.  Their abundance has varied through the survey years from being high to very high.  That alone shows how well crappie are suited for this lake.  The 1996 catch sampled crappie ranging from 3.4 to 8.7 inches with the average being 6.4 inches.  This was much like the average size recorded from Fannie Lake.  It is somewhat true that Skogman Lake may not commonly produce large crappie, but it appears the lake holds a consistent amount of many fair-sized crappie.  In other lakes where crappie numbers are more cyclic, they seem to have occasional years when the crappie run larger, but they also have years when crappie seem non-existent.The largemouth bass were sampled in very good abundance by night electrofishing techniques.  This method momentarily stuns the fish so they can be dipped into the boat for measurements.  The sample of bass ranged in length from 4.1 to 18.7 inches, averaging 11.7 inches.  Ages 1-10 were sampled indicating good natural reproduction and exhibiting normal growth.  This was the first time Skogman Lake was electrofished by the DNR, and this will also continue on a 5-year rotation.Yellow perch abundance was normal but this year's sample was the highest recorded since 1951.   They have in the past carried abundance levels from either low to normal numbers.   The 1996 perch ranged from 4.8 to 7.5 inches and averaged 5.9 inches.  It was good to see their numbers at least at normal levels while their predators, the northern pike and walleye, were holding a normal population.Common carp were sampled in some past surveys.  We only observed seven adults during the spring electrofishing study for bass and did not see or capture any during the regular summer assessment.  The last of the carp trap/barrier (between Skogman and Fannie Lakes) was removed in 1987.  Currently, if carp removal were attempted, it would be done by a contracted commercial fisherman.  Judging by the number of years carp have been in the system, it seems apparent that they have not caused major shifts in game fish abundance nor have they exploded to excessive levels.Nine other species were represented in the netting gear: bowfin, black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and emerald shiner.  The bowfin and brown bullhead were at above normal levels while the yellow bullhead was below normal.  There was no large black bullhead population in Skogman Lake as evidenced in Fannie Lake this year.  All other species were sampled at normal abundance levels for this lake type.Prepared by: Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

The walleye at 0.50 per set was very low and is the result of a moderate stocking in 1978.  The yellow perch was very low at 5.83 per set and has been extremely low since a high of 32.30 in the 1951 survey.  The bluegill was slightly high at 31.00 per set while the pumpkinseed was low at 2.25.  The black crappie was about average at 20.75 in the trapnet but was extremely high at 44.17 per set in the gillnet.  The largemouth bass at 0.25 was slightly low.  The black bullhead was extremely low at 2.00 per set (trapnet) but was extremely high at 50.50 in the gillnet.  The brown bullhead was slightly low while the yellow bullhead was slightly high.  The white sucker at 0.33 and the golden shiner at 0.83 per set were both very low.  The bowfin and carp at 0.75 per set were slightly high and low respectively.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  Skogman Lake has been surveyed every two to five years since 1973 and during 1960 and 1951.  During August of 1991, Skogman Lake was surveyed with five gillnets, four trapnets, and four shoreline areas were seined.  The gamefish populations in Skogman Lake are described with comparisons to past surveys and lake class medians in the following paragraphs.\n  Skogman Lake is managed as a largemouth bass- centrarchid lake.  The lake maintains a good population of these species by virtue of numerous spawning areas throughout the lake.  A low northern pike population is maintained by limited natural reproduction and a low walleye population is maintained by stocking.\n  Only one walleye was captured during the survey for a gillnet catch of 0.20/set which is below the first quartile (1.00/set).  Historically, the walleye net catch is low in Skogman Lake.  The walleye captured was 21.0 inches and weighed 3.10 pounds.  The walleye population in Skogman Lake relies solely on stocking, however some fish (very few) may enter the lake from the adjoining lakes and/or the Rum River.\n  The largemouth bass catch in trapnets (0.25/set) and gillnets (0.40/set) was near the lake class median for both gears (0.25/set and 0.37/set, respectively).  The catch rates have remained relatively consistent when compared to past surveys.  The two largemouth bass captured in gillnets were 8.0 and 15.0 inches, and the one captured in trapnets was 12.0 inches.  Back-calculation identified slow growth rates when compared to statewide averages, however the weights of the largemouth bass were above the lake class median values.  Age analysis indicated the largemouth bass ranged in age from two to seven years old.  Seventeen young of the year (YOY) largemouth bass were captured with seines.\n  The northern pike net catch have historically been below the first quartile (1.75/ set).  The 1991 gillnet catch was (0.40/set).  The two fish captured were in the length group 29.0 to 30.9 inches.  Age analysis indicated five and seven year old fish.  Comparison of fish ages and stocking records identify limited natural reproduction, although YOY northern pike were not captured.\n  The bluegill net catch (42.75/set) was higher than the third quartile (37.19/set) indicating a high population.  Historically, the bluegill net catch is high falling near the third quartile for lakes of this type.  The bluegill are relatively small, ranging in length from 3.5 to 7.4 inches with a median length group of 6.0 to 6.4 inches.  Back-calculation indicated a slow growth rate when compared to statewide averages.  However, the average weight (0.17 pounds) was normal when compared to the lake class median, and has remained relatively consistent from survey to survey.  The bluegill naturally reproduce with many (323) YOY seined.  The bluegill aged from one to eight years old.\n  The black crappie net catch (4.50/set) was near the lake class median value (5.86/set).  The black crappie net catch has been erratic in past surveys ranging from 0.75/set to 66.83/set.  The black crappie ranged in length from 4.0 to 9.4 inches with a median length group of 7.0 to 7.4 inches.  Back-calculated lengths indicated a slow growth rate compared to statewide averages, while the average weight (0.23 pounds) falls between the first quartile (0.21 pounds) and the median (0.28 pounds) for this lake class.  The black crappie ranged in age from two to eight.  YOY were not captured in seines.\n  The yellow perch net catch (4.40/set) is low, below the first quartile (4.91/set) for this lake class.  The yellow perch ranged in length from 5.5 to 7.9 inches with a median length group of 6.0 to 6.4 inches.  Yellow perch weights on average (0.10 pounds) were low when compared to the lake class quartiles (first quartile = 0.10 pounds), but have remained relatively consistent from survey to survey.  Yellow perch naturally reproduce in Skogman Lake, but YOY were not captured with seines during the 1991 survey.\n  Six others species were captured during the 1991 survey (bowfin, white sucker, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and pumpkinseed).  Bowfin and pumpkinseed net catches were low when compared to lake class values, and the remaining species net catches were near the lake class medians.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Skogman is a bass-panfish lake managed primarily for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass.  The current fisheries management plan, revised in 2017, calls for spring Walleye fry stocking when surplus is available. In order to evaluate management goals, a lake survey was conducted in July of 2022.  Compared to previous Skogman Lake assessments, catch rates were lower for Northern Pike, but similar for Walleye, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nSkogman has historically had a low Walleye population maintained by fingerling stocking.  Despite the change to surplus fry stocking, the 2022 catch rate of 1.3 Walleye per net lift is very similar to the previous three assessments.  Sampled Walleye were large, averaging 4.5 pounds, with all fish exceeding 20 inches. Aged Walleye were either 9 or 11 years old, both year classes correspond to fall fingerling stockings. Growth was typical, but the absence of younger fish indicates limited success of the 2017 and 2019 fry stockings. <br> \n <br> \nSince peaking in the 2013 assessment, The Northern Pike gillnet catch, 1.3 per net, is back near the historic lake mean. Average weight remains high though, at 4.7 pounds.  Sampled northerns ranged from 24 to 32 inches in length with 60% of the catch exceeding 26 inches.  The 2022 catch rate for Northern Pike fell short of the management goal. <br> \n <br> \nThe abundance of both Bluegill and Black Crappie was similar to previous assessments. While neither species had a particularly high size structure, one fourth of the crappies were over 8 inches in length and half the Bluegill exceeded 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing the evening of June 6th yielded a catch rate of 51.3 per hour. Thirty eight percent of adult bass were 12 inches or greater in length with individuals over 19 inches present.  The 2022 catch rate met the management goal, however the average weight of 0.9 pounds fell short of the 1.5-pound target.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the netting gear included Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, Yellow Perch and Bowfin.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers visiting Skogman Lake should expect light pressure due to limited parking and the public access.  Opportunities are very good for quality sized Largemouth Bass and harvestable size Bluegill.  Larger Northern Pike and Walleye are a possibility though their abundance is not currently high. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

It remains well below the local median (3.52/set).  The current walleye population is primarily the product of a 1984 fingerling stocking.  Survival has been less than anticipated but growth rates are above average.  Actual survival may be greater than data indicates due to migration of some fish to adjoining lakes.  Northern pike (1.00/set) remain at the 1981 level (1.00/set) that is below the local median (3.88/set) but consistent with historical levels.  Past stocking of fingerlings and winter rescue fish in an effort to improve the northern pike population has proven unsuccessful and has been discontinued.  The current population apparently sustains itself through occasional spawning success and/or migration from adjoining lakes.  Yellow perch (0.67/set) show a real decline from 1981 (5.83/set) to a level far below the local median (24.27/set).  Despite the decline in test nets, yellow perch are well represented in shoreline seining with 126 young of the year and 33 others recorded.  Eight largemouth bass were taken in test nets, ranging in size from 8 to 15 inches.  Shoreline seining recorded 60 young of the year and 14 other largemouth bass.  Bluegills (58.00/set) have increased significantly from 1981 (31.00/set) to a level well above the local median (25.67/set).  Bluegills tend to be small with a median length group of 6.0 to 6.4 inches.  Over 1500 young of the year bluegills were recorded in shoreline seining.  In contrast to bluegills, black crappies (0.75/set) have declined significantly from 1981 (20.75/set) to a level far below the local median (18.45/set).  Black crappies tend to be very small with a median length group of 5.5 - 5.9 inches.  Bluegills and black crappies have a history of inversely related population fluctuations.  Black bullheads remain far below the local median in the trapnets and show a large decline in the gillnets where they had previously been high, from 50.50/set to 7.17/set.  Other species taken in test nets (golden shiner, white sucker, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed) do not appear to be remarkably above or below local medians nor undergone any noteworthy changes from the previous survey.</p>",
