This species is made up mostly of young fish with 96% of the samples taken being age class IV and below.Rough fish populations vary slightly over time with bullhead abundance always remaining low and shorthead redhorse populations increasing from a CPUE of 1.0 in 1980 to a CPUE of 3.5 in 1990.Black crappie CPUE's swing widely through the years sampled but size has remained constant with small fish and slower growth rates.Populations of yellow perch dropped considerably in the late 1970's from a gill net CPUE of 18.6 in 1975 to a CPUE of 3.6 in 1980.  The abundance has remained low since that time.Walleye abundance is fairly constant compared to past netting information although average size has steadly increased from 1.0 lbs./fish in 1955 to 2.2 lbs./fish in 1990.  Both fry and fingerling stocking done before 1982 failed to show any recognizable year classes.  Stocking from 1982 to the present has been done every year with a mixture of fry, fingerling, and yearling making evaluation of stocked fish and natural reproduction difficult.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Prairie Lake is a 1,064 acre reservior located just north of Grand Rapids, MN. off State Highway #38.  Although it has been managed for walleye, the lake has a diverse fishery.  Walleye fry and fingerlings have been stocked many times over the years.  The current lake management plan recommends that the lake be stocked with walleye fry in two of four years.  This assessment evaluated stocking that took place in two of the previous seven years.     Although walleye have never been sampled in high numbers in past assessments, the lake at times can produce excellent fishing.  Of the 27 walleye aged from this assessment, only 12 were from stocked years.  They varied from 9.0-26.8 inches, had a mean length of 17.6 inches and a mean weight of 2.0 pounds.     Northern pike abundance was among the highest ever sampled at 4.5/gill net.  They varied in length from 6.5-34.5 inches and had a mean length of 20.4 inches.       Yellow perch, at only 5.9/gill net, remain close to what has historically been observed.  This is an important forage species for both walleye and northern pike.     Black crappie were sampled above the lake class median in both trap net and gill nets.  The size of those sampled were generally small varying from 4.5-9.8 inches.  One 13.5 inch black crappie was sampled in the trap net.  Two year classes (1995 and 1998) dominated the catch (73%) of 97 crappie.     Of the 72 bluegill sampled in the trap nets in this assessment, only 5 (7%) were over 8.0 inches.  The catch of 4.8/trap net was down from the previous assessment but very similar to other assessments.     Although only one largemouth bass was sampled, 3 smallmouth bass were captured in the gill net.     Species sampled that are unique to river systems were shorthead redhorse and silver redhorse.  Other species sampled were yellow and brown bullhead, white sucker, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish and bowfin.          </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye were sampled in gill nets within the normal range for lakes similar to Prairie Lake.  The 2006 catch rate was lower than historical rates but similar to the previous assessment.  Sampled fish averaged almost 17 inches and lengths varied from 9.3 to 26.7 inches.  The average weight (1.9 lbs/fish) was within the lake class expected range.  Despite missing year classes, the population size structure appears to be moderate.  Ten year classes were identified from scale analysis with fish present from one to 15 years old.  This assessment evaluated a period of fingerling stocking (two consecutive years out of four), 39% of sampled fish were from the 2003/2004 stockings.  Prior to 2003, fry were stocked with mixed results.  Growth rates were similar to the statewide average for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in gill nets within the lake class expected range and was the highest recorded catch rate.  The average length was 21.6 inches, and the longest fish sampled was 33.1 inches.  The average weight was 2.3 lbs/fish.  The population size structure was moderate with 21% of the northern pike sampled over 24 inches.  Anglers can help the size structure by releasing northern pike over 24 inches, allowing these fish to reach a larger size which will help maintain a balanced population.  Eight year classes were identified and growth rates were similar to the statewide average for all ages.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled in both gill nets and trap nets.  Both catch rates were within the expected range for the lake class.  The trap net catch rate was similar to historic rates while the gill net catch rate was above the previous assessment but has fluctuated historically.  The average length was 6.4 inches and ranged from 4.1 to 10.8 inches for gill net sampled fish.  Five year classes were identified, with only one fish (age eight) over age four.  Growth rates were similar to or below the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled within the lake class expected range and above the previous assessment.  The average length was 5.4 inches, ranging from 3.4 to 7.9 inches.  Only 5% of the fish sampled were above seven inches.  Ages one through five were present and growth rates were similar to the statewide average for most ages. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, a very important prey species, were sampled in gill nets within the lake class expected range.  Catch rates have fluctuated historically, but the 2006 catch rate was similar to the previous assessment.  The lengths ranged from 5.1 to 10.8 inches with an average length of 6.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFour largemouth bass were sampled in gill nets, ranging in length from 9.8 to 13.8 inches.  Fourteen smallmouth bass were also sampled in gill nets, the lengths ranged from 5.8 to 17.1 inches with a mean length of 14.6 inches.  The previous assessment sampled one largemouth bass and three smallmouth bass in gill nets.  Other species sampled included bowfin, brown and yellow bullhead, golden shiner, golden redhorse, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agriculture, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water\u0019s edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems, and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Prairie Lake is located about four miles north of Grand Rapids, MN and within the Mississippi River Watershed.  The 1,064 acre lake is about 80% littoral (853 acres) with 18 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 31 feet.  There are two accesses, one on the northwest shore and the other on the south end (Lower Prairie).  Prairie River passes through the lake and a small hydro-electric dam at the outlet acts as a fish barrier while upstream facilitates fish migration.  Most of the shoreline is privately owned and relatively developed.  Past management included stocking walleye fingerling at a rate of 0.5 pound per littoral acre (426 pounds) during two consecutive years out of four in an attempt to achieve the management goal of 3.0/net. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a historically low rate of 0.6/gill net, below what was expected for lakes similar to Prairie.  Past catches have typically been within the expected range.  The continued evaluation of the walleye stocking regime suggests fingerling stocking has been unsuccessful at achieving management goals.  Lengths from the nine sampled fish ranged from 7.9 to 26.1 inches with an average length of 17.1 inches.  No meaningful conclusions of size structure can be drawn from such a small sample size.  Age analysis identified four ages of fish with fish up to age-15 present.  Most of the fish sampled (55%) were age-4 while 78% of the sample corresponds to a stocked year class.  However, other stocked year classes were not present in the sample.  The low number of year classes present combined with the low catch rate suggests limited stocking success which is similar to past assessments. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 4.5/gill net near the expected range and similar to the historically high catch from the previous assessment (5.1/net).  Catches have been traditionally at the low end of the expected range.  Lengths ranged from 12.4-31.3 inches with an average length of 21.8 inches.  Size structure was moderate with 25% of the sample exceeding 24 inches.  Black spot (Neascus) was observed on 36% of the 55 examined northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were the most numerous species observed in gill nets at a rate higher than expected while the trap net sample was within the expected range.  Both catches were similar to previous assessments.  Lengths from the gill net sample ranged from 4.1-10.0 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches and lengths from the trap net sample ranged from 3.6-8.5 inches with an average length of 6.0 inches.  Size structure was poor in the trap net sample, while the gill net sample was only slightly better.  Scale analysis identified ages 1-7 present in the sample indicating relatively consistent recruitment.  Growth was determined to be below the statewide average by age 2.  Crappie typically exceed eight inches by age 5, but are only 7.2 inches by age 5 in Prairie Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled in gill nets and sampled in trap nets at a rate within the expected range.  Catches have historically been variable.  Lengths from the trap net sample ranged from 3.2-8.0 inches with an average length of 5.2 inches, while the gill net lengths ranged from 3.6-8.5 inches with an average length of 5.6 inches.  Size structure was poor in the trap net sample, while the gill net sample was only slightly better.  Scale analysis identified ages 2-8 present in the sample indicating relatively consistent recruitment, however year class strength was variable.  Ages 2, 5, and 6 comprised 71% of the sample.  Back-calculated length-at-age determined growth was similar to the Ecological Lake Class 35 average.  Bluegill typically exceeded six inches by age 7. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled at a historically low rate of 2.4/gill net, below the lake class expected range.  Past catches have typically been variable but within the expected range.  Lengths ranged from 5.3-8.7 with an average length of 6.2 inches.  Size structure was poor and not likely to interest most anglers.  External examination identified black spot on 97% of the 32 examined perch and yellow grub was also identified in two fish. <br> \n <br> \nGill netting sampled one smallmouth bass, 17.3 inches.  Trap netting sampled three largemouth bass, two about 5 inches and one 16.7 inches.  Past netting has sampled largemouth and smallmouth bass at relatively low numbers.  Both populations are believed to be relatively small and naturally occurring. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included bowfin, brown bullhead, golden redhorse, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAs part of IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) near shore sampling, Iowa darter, blackchin shiner, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and yellow perch were sampled in seven seine hauls.  Backpack electrofishing sampled black crappie, bluegill, burbot, central mudminnow, largemouth bass, mottled sculpin, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tadpole madtom, and yellow perch in 11 stations. <br> \n <br> \nExperimental daytime electrofishing was conducted as a comparison/compliment for near shore IBI sampling.  The special sampling was conducted with a Smith-Root GPP 5.0 electrofishing boat equipped with a spider array anode using pulsed DC current operating at 4amps and 200 volts.  Sampling occurred on 8/14/2012 with a water conductivity of 150 S/cm and surface temperature of 75 degrees F.  Visibility was variable between stations.  All ages and species of fish were targeted and sampled species included Iowa darter, blackchin shiner, bluegill, brown bullhead, golden redhorse, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow perch.  Bluegill, yellow perch and young-of-the-year largemouth bass were the most numerous species sampled. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Prairie Lake is located about four miles north of Grand Rapids, within the Mississippi River Watershed.  The 1,064-acre lake is about 80% littoral (853 acres less than 15 feet deep) with 18 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 31 feet.  The water is bog-stained with transparency ranging from 3.2 to 7.0 feet in summer surveys.  There are two accesses, one on the northwest shore and the other on the south end (Lower Prairie).  The Prairie River passes through the lake and a small hydro-electric dam at the outlet acts as a fish barrier while upstream facilitates fish migration.  Most of the shoreline is privately owned and relatively developed.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Fisheries Lake Management Plan (LMP) was last revised in 2013.  Northern Pike were considered the primary management species because they are well suited to the lake.  Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Walleye were considered secondary species.  Walleye are actively managed via stocking of surplus fry from the Grand Rapids State Fish Hatchery.  A gill net targeted survey was conducted in July to determine the status of select gamefish species and provide information to anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 5.1/gill net, which was tied for the highest observed and within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catches have been traditionally near the low end of the expected range but lower numbers are desirable because they contribute to faster growth and better size quality.  Lengths resembled previous surveys and ranged from 14.2 to 30.7 inches with an average of 20.4 inches.  Size structure was relatively poor with only 3% of the sample exceeding 28 inches.  Pike were not aged in this survey but previous surveys noted frequent recruitment and average growth rates.  <br> \n <br> \nPrairie Lake has a history of producing relatively high numbers of small crappie.  Black Crappie were the most numerous species observed in gill nets and the catch was higher than typical for lakes with similar habitats.  Lengths were similar to past surveys and ranged from 4.1-10.7 inches with an average of 7.0 inches.  Only 2% of the sample exceeded 10 inches.  Nine year-classes from ages 1 through 10 were estimated from scales.  Recruitment appeared inconsistent with ages 2 and 5 the most frequently sampled.  Growth appeared slow.  Crappie averaged 8.4 inches after 6 years. <br> \n <br> \nLakes with similar habitats are poorly suited for Walleye and Prairie Lake has a long history of producing a marginal fishery.  Walleye were sampled at a historically low rate of 0.4/gill net despite fry stocking in 2021.  Lengths from the six sampled fish ranged from 11.6 to 20.4 inches with an average of 15.0 inches.  No meaningful conclusions of size structure can be drawn from such a small sample size.  Conditions for Walleye management continue to appear poor as Northern Pike catches were the highest observed and Yellow Perch catches remained low. <br> \n   <br> \nBluegill catches have historically been variable.  Lengths ranged from from 3.7 to 7.4 inches with an average of 6 inches.  Size structure was poor.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the sample and growth was average.  Bluegill averaged 6.2 inches after 6 years. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled in low numbers compared to previous surveys and below the expected range for similar lakes.  Past catches have typically been variable but within the expected range.  Lengths ranged from 5.5 to 9.3 inches with an average of 6.5 inches.  Size structure was moderate and not likely to interest most anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Golden Redhorse, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help slow the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed, and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.   <br> \n</p>",

The walleye gill net catch rate in this assessment was within the range observed in past assessments and within the expected range for this type of lake.  Walleye sampled in gill nets ranged from 8.5 to 25.7 inches in length (mean = 15.4 inches) and had a mean weight of 1.4 pounds.   Growth rates appear to be average.  Walleye were sampled from both stocked and nonstocked years suggesting that natural reproduction does occur in Prairie Lake.       Northern pike were also sampled in gill nets at a rate similar to past assessments and within the expected range.  Gill net captured northern pike had a mean length of 19.0 inches and a mean weight of 1.9 pounds.     The yellow perch gill net catch rate is also within the expected range.  The perch that were captured ranged from 5.3 to 8.6 inches in length.     Both the gill net and trap net catch rates for black crappie are within the expected range.  Crappies captured in gill nets ranged from 3.7 to 10.1 inches in length.     The bluegill trap net catch rate was within the expected range.  These fish ranged from 4.3 to 8.1 inches in length.     Other species sampled include:  largemouth and smallmouth bass, rock bass, shorthead, silver and golden redhorse, white sucker, yellow and brown bullhead, bowfin and pumkinseed sunfish.</p>",
