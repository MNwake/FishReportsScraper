                "narrative": "<p>Five Island Lake is a 175-acre lake in northeastern Itasca County located six miles northwest of Togo, MN.  A county administered public access is located on the northeast side of the lake on Five Island Lake Road (off County Road 542), with parking for one rig.  The access is at the bottom of a steep hill that is approximately 100 yards long and four-wheel drive is necessary to drive up the hill.  Five Island Lake has a maximum depth of 33 ft and 63% of the lake is 15 ft or less.  The lake has low fertility.  The water color is clear to light brown, resulting in visibility to a depth of 17 ft in mid-summer.  The depth of water at which oxygen levels limit fish presence was 18 ft in mid-summer.  Other area lakes with similar habitat include Guile, Jay Gould, Little Sand, and Little Split Hand. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 survey was the fifth survey of the fish community since 1961.  Surveys occur to monitor for changes in species composition, number, length distribution, and growth.  Gamefish species that are best suited for the lake are Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass.  No special regulations are present.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population had a low catch rate, with above average length distribution and growth.  Gill net catches were average for the lake, but low compared to lakes with similar habitat.  Higher catches are undesirable because they are usually associated with higher density populations having poor size structure and slow growth.  The sampled pike ranged from 21 to 36 inches and averaged 25 inches.  The length distribution was above average, as 100% of pike exceeded 21 inches and 18% exceeded 28 inches.  Pike over 28 inches were sampled in four of five surveys.  The largest fish sampled was a 36-inch fish in 2020, indicating the potential exists for producing larger pike.  Pike ranged from age 2 to 7.  Growth rates were above average.  On average, pike took four years to exceed 21 inches.  The pike population may interest anglers and spearers due to its length distribution.  However, due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release pike over 26 inches and harvest up to 10 less than 22 inches to help maintain and improve size structure.  Spearers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike also. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie population had below average catch rates, above average length distribution, and below average growth.  Gill net catches were below average, while trap net catches were average.  The sampled crappie ranged from 5 to 10 inches and averaged 9.0 and 7.8 inches in gill nets and trap nets.  The length distribution was above average, as 62% of crappie exceeded 8 inches and 15% exceeded 10 inches.  Ten-inch fish were sampled in all surveys.  The largest fish sampled was a 12-inch crappie in 1982.  Crappie ranged from age 2 to 9.  Four year-classes were sampled, with a similar number of fish sampled from each year class.  Growth was below average.  Crappie took six years to exceed eight inches.  Although the crappie population is lower in number, fish over 10 inches have been consistently sampled and may interest anglers.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population had above average catch rates and length distribution, and average growth.  Spring nighttime electrofishing targeting bass has not occurred.  This method is the most appropriate way to evaluate a bass population.  Bass were sampled in both gill and trap nets in all five surveys, indicating a relatively high number of fish has been consistently present.  Gill net and trap net catches were below average for the lake, but have consistently remained higher than catches from lakes with similar habitat.  The sampled bass ranged from 5 to 19 inches and averaged 13 inches.  Bass over 15 inches have been sampled in all surveys, while 19-inch bass have been sampled in two.  Growth was average.  Bass ranged from age 1 to 8.  Recruitment appeared consistent, as aged fish were from seven different year classes.  Bass took five years to exceed 12 inches.  Due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release bass exceeding 15 inches to help maintain or improve size structure.     <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population had a low catch rate, with average length distribution and growth.  Trap net catches were the lowest observed.  However, higher catches are undesirable because they are usually associated with higher density populations having poor size structure and slow growth.  The sampled Bluegill ranged from 3 to 8 inches and averaged 6.8 and 6.0 inches in gill nets and trap nets.  The length distribution was average, as 64% of Bluegill exceeded 6 inches but only 2% exceeded 8 inches.  However, this survey occurred in August when larger Bluegill occupy deeper depths offshore.  Bluegill over 8 inches were sampled in 4 of 5 surveys, but no fish over 9 inches have ever been sampled.  Growth was average.  Bluegill ranged from age 2 to 9, with eight year-classes sampled.  Recruitment appeared consistent.  Bluegill took seven years to exceed 6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population had a moderate catch rate, with below average length distribution and growth.  Gill net catches have declined in each of the five surveys.  Declining perch numbers are consistent with statewide trends that have occurred since the 1970s.  Lower perch numbers limit the number of gamefish the lake can support.  The sampled perch ranged from 5 to 8 inches and averaged 6.8 inches.  Although 8-inch perch have been sampled in 4 of 5 surveys, no 10-inch perch have ever been sampled.  Growth was below average.  Perch ranged from age 3 to 6, with all four year-classes represented.  Recruitment appeared consistent.  Yellow Perch took seven years to exceed 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Tullibee (Cisco) population had above average catch rates.  Gill net catches the past two surveys have been the highest observed.  Sampled Tullibee ranged from 12 to 14 inches.  Two age-classes were sampled, with ages 5 and 11 having similar representation.  Recruitment appeared to be infrequent, which commonly occurs in Tullibee populations.  Smaller Tullibee provide an important prey source for larger gamefish and can provide predation relief to the perch population.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help slow the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Five Island Lake is a small, clear water lake located in the northeast corner of Itasca County about 15 miles east of the town of Effie.  A poor access is located on the east shore of the lake with very limited parking.  The previous population assessment on this small bass-panfish lake was conducted in 1982.     The northern pike gill net catch declined from 6.4/set in 1982 to 3.7/set in 2001.  The fish were of quality size.  They ranged in length from 19.3 to 32.6 inches and had a mean length of 23.4 inches. Five year classes were identified with fish aged from age 2 to 7.  The northern pike in this assessment averaged 22.2 inches at age 4.     Tullibee (cisco), an excellent forage species for northern pike, were sampled at 6.3/gill net in this assessment compared to only 0.6/gill net in 1982.  Lakes with good tullibee populations generally produce quality northern pike.     Bluegill were sampled above the median at 28.3/trap net.  Of the 256 bluegill measured from the trap nets in this assessment, only 6 or 2.3% were over 8 inches.  They ranged in length from 3.3 to 8.3 inches and had a mean length of 6.1 inches.       Largemouth bass were sampled at 2.8/gill net and 2.7/trap net, both well over the 3rd quartile for this lake class.  Although bass are not readily captured in either gear type, the number captured in this assessment indicate that a good population exists in Five Island Lake.  The largemouth captured in the trap net ranged in length from 5.0 to 15.4 inches and had a mean length of 9 inches.  Similar results were observed in the gill nets where the bass ranged in length from 5.5 to 15.8 inches with a mean length of 9.8 inches.  Of the 38 largemouth aged in this assessment, 25 or 66% were age 2 and 3. Growth was a little slower than the statewide averages.          Black crappie were sampled at 1.5/gill net and 1.4/gill net, below the lake class median for this lake class.  Mean weight in both gear types was 0.4 pounds.  Growth was below the statewide averages.     Other species sampled in this assessment were golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker.    </p>",
