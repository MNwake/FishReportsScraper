Prior to this survey, Ugstad Mine Pit had never been surveyed by DNR Fisheries.  Ugstad Mine Pit was surveyed during the summer of 2016 to gather baseline information about fish populations and aquatic habitat.   <br> \n <br> \nNo game fish were sampled and only Fathead minnows were captured during the survey.  The fish community of Ugstad Mine Pit is reflective of a small, shallow lake that is subject to winter oxygen stress and is of little recreational fishing value.</p>",
