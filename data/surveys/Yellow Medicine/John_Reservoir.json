                "narrative": "<p>John Lake is a 20 acre flood control impoundment created in 1981 by the Yellow Medicine Watershed District.  Fisheries management has been primarily for black crappie and walleye.     Black crappie were moderately abundant in 2002.  Most crappie measured less than 7.5 inches, but several 9-10 inch fish were also sampled.  Growth rates were near normal for John Lake.  Considering normal growth, there should be a good number of 8-10 inch crappie present in John Lake over the next couple of years.  Adequate spawning habitat has allowed for consistent reproduction of black crappie in John Lake.  Numerous young-of-year were sampled in 2002.      Approximately 10,000 walleye fry have been stocked annually since 1999.  Available data suggests that fry stocking has been primarily responsible for maintaining the walleye population in John Lake.  Walleye were moderately abundant in 2002.  All but one walleye sampled were from the 2001 year class and measured 8.5-9.5 inches.  The majority of the existing walleye population will require another year of growth to reach quality size.     Bluegill and northern pike were also moderately abundant, but their catch was the highest recorded in John Lake.  Although the majority of pike measured less than 17 inches, individuals up to 27 inches were also sampled.  Bluegill measured 5-7 inches.  Numerous young-of-year bluegill were also sampled, an indication the population may further expand.  Increased abundance of northern pike and bluegill is due to improved spawning habitat.  Northern pike spawning habitat was greatly enhanced during spring flooding in 2001.  Most pike sampled were from the 2001 year class.  A long term expansion of the pike population will require frequent high water springs.  Bluegill spawning habitat has improved with increased submergent vegetation abundance.  Future assessments will further monitor the bluegill and northern pike populations.     Other species anglers may wish to pursue at John Lake include black bullhead, largemouth bass and yellow perch.  </p>",

Management activities are directed at creating opportunities for black crappie, black bullhead, walleye, and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nFishing opportunities exist for several species in John Reservoir.  Black crappie and black bullhead were the most abundant game fish observed.  Anglers should expect good success, but size was only 6-8 inches long for both species.  Only a small number of yellow perch were observed, with size being seven inches.  Walleye were not as abundant as in the past, with fish from 14-23 inches long being present.  Numbers should increase, however, as stocking in the spring of 2008 resulted in a large number of young-of-year fish.  Largemouth bass abundance was also low, with fish being 12-13 inches long.  Anglers may find limited success for northern pike, but fish are large at almost 30 inches in length.  Bluegill abundance was low, with fish only averaging 6 inches.  Other fish sampled were white sucker, green sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, and tadpole madtom.  Future management activities include winter dissolved oxygen monitoring and fishing pressure counts, and evaluation of fish stockings.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>John Reservoir is a 20-acre flood control impoundment on a tributary to Mud Creek that was constructed by the Yellow Medicine River Watershed District in 1981.  It is located approximately 3 miles west of Porter in Yellow Medicine County.  A concrete boat ramp and public property surrounding almost the entire lake make this water body very accessible.  Fishing opportunities exist for Black Crappies, Bluegills, Yellow Perch, Walleyes, Northern Pike and Black Bullheads.  This targeted survey in 2021 was conducted to collect routine fish population data using standard trap nets, electrofishing and quarter-inch trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from John Reservoir. <br> \n <br> \nIn the 2021 survey, Black Crappie were abundant with many from 9 to 10 inches and some over 11 inches.  Bluegill were more numerous than in previous surveys.  More than half of those netted were longer than 7 inches with several over 8 inches.  Yearling and/or adult Walleyes are stocked annually and they can range from 12 to 20 inches.  Eight Walleyes were caught during the survey measuring 12 to 21 inches.  Northern Pike numbers have usually been low, but large fish are typically present.  Four pike were netted and the largest measured 29 inches.  Black Bullheads were present in moderate numbers and they averaged 10 inches.  Yellow Perch numbers were low in 2021 and the largest measured just over 9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBeginning May 2018, new regulations for Northern Pike are in effect.  John Reservoir is in the Southern management zone meaning anglers/spearers are allowed to possess 2 pike with a minimum size of 24 inches. See the regulations booklet for more details. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities include fish population assessments, fish stocking, winter dissolved oxygen monitoring, and fishing pressure counts. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>John Lake is a 20 acre flood control impoundment created in 1981 by the Yellow Medicine Watershed District.  Fisheries management has been primarily for black crappie and walleye.     Black crappie have experienced consistent natural reproduction and recruitment in John Lake and their population has remained stable in the past several assessments.  Anglers have reported good crappie fishing in recent years.  Most sampled crappie in 2005 measured over 9 inches.  Growth of black crappie in John Lake is relatively fast and anglers should expect good numbers of 8-10 inch crappie in 2006.     The 2005 trap net catch of walleye was the highest sampled in John Lake.  Available data suggests that fry stocking has been responsible for maintaining the walleye population.  Although most walleye measured 12-13 inches, fish up to 21 inches were also sampled.  Walleye growth was fast and most the 12-13 inch walleye should measure 15-17 inches by the end of 2006.     A low abundance of bluegill was sampled in survey nets.  However, late summer natural reproduction test nets and fall night electrofishing indicated good numbers of bluegill up to 7 inches were present.      Largemouth bass and northern pike were caught in low abundance, although trophy individuals of each specie were sampled.  Good numbers of young-of-year largemouth bass were observed during fall electrofishing, indicating a potentially strong 2005 year class.  With good survival, anglers may expect these fish to measure 8-12 inches in one or two years.     Other species anglers may pursue in John Lake include black bullhead and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>John Reservoir is a 20-acre flood control impoundment constructed by the Yellow Medicine River Watershed District in 1981.  It is located approximately 3 miles west of Porter in Yellow Medicine County on a tributary stream to Mud Creek.  A concrete boat ramp and public property surrounding almost the entire lake make this water body very accessible.  Fishing opportunities exist for Black Crappies, Yellow Perch, Walleyes, Northern pike and Black Bullheads.  This targeted survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using standard trap nets and quarter-inch trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from John Reservoir. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were abundant and measured up to 11 inches, though most were 7-9 inches.  Yellow Perch were also abundant, but the majority were 5.5 to 6.5 inches, with a few larger perch present.  Walleyes are stocked annually, with most measuring 7-12 inches, but larger ones up to 20 inches have also been included.   <br> \nFour Walleyes were caught during this survey measuring 15-17 inches.  Northern Pike numbers have usually been low, but fish up to 30 inches have typically been present.  Black Bullheads were present in moderate numbers with many fish around 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities include fish population assessments, fish stocking, winter dissolved oxygen monitoring, and fishing pressure counts. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>John Lake was constructed in 1981 as a flood control reservoir by the Yellow Medicine Watershed District.  It is 20 acres with a maximum depth of 12 feet, and contains a heavy silt load due to run off from a largely row cropped watershed.  The majority of the lake's bottom is composed of muck and silt, and the water is extremely turbid.     DNR Fisheries manages John Lake for black crappie and walleye.  Black crappie were abundant in 1998 and most fish measured 7-9 inches.  John Lake has good crappie spawning habitat and crappies experience good natural reproduction.  However, suitable walleye spawning habitat doesn't exist, and the walleye population is maintained by stocking.  A moderate number of walleye were present in 1998, and most of them measured 10-15 inches.  Other species that anglers may consider pursuing at John Lake include northern pike, black bullhead, and largemouth bass.</p>",

A concrete ramp exists to launch boats and abundant public property is present for shore fishing.   <br> \n <br> \nAssessment netting was difficult during this assessment due to rapidly fluctuating water levels which likely caused lower than realistic catch rates of most species.  Primary species providing fishing opportunities include black crappie, walleye, northern pike and black bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie and black bullhead measuring up to 11 inches were present, and should provide decent angling opportunities.  Moderate numbers of northern pike were present, but most fish caught were less than 20 inches.  Although not caught during sampling, considerably larger pike were likely present based on previous assessments.  Pike growth has been fast, and many of pike sampled in 2014 should measure near 25 inches in 2015.  Adult, fingerling, and yearling walleye were stocked in 2013 and 2014.  Although most stocked fish mostly measured 7-12 inches, several fish from 16-20 inches were also stocked.  These fish are expected to grow well and provide future angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities include fish population assessments, walleye stocking, winter dissolved oxygen monitoring, and fishing pressure counts. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>John Lake was constructed in 1981 as a flood control reservoir by the Yellow Medicine Watershed District.  It is about 20 acres in size, has a maximum depth of 12 feet, and contains a heavy silt load due to run off from a largely row cropped watershed.  The majority of the lake's bottom is composed of silt, and the water is extremely turbid.  Habitat conditions are less than optimal for populations of desirable game fish species.     Since 1981 John lake has been stocked sporadically with bluegill, black crappie, walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  The only stocked species that has managed to produce a substantial population is black crappie, and the lake is primarily managed for them.  A moderate number of black crappie were present in 1995, with fish ranging from 3-13 inches in length.  A low level population of northern pike was also present.  This population is not expected to increase substantially due to limited spawning/nursery habitat.  A moderate population of black bullhead existed, with most fish measuring about 8 inches.  This species is well suited to habitat conditions in John Lake, and should not be overlooked as an angling opportunity.     The habitat quality of John Lake will continue to be degraded due to siltation/nutrification from watershed run-off.  These habitat changes will favor black bullhead and black crappie, and these species, especially black bullhead, will likely become even more dominant over time.</p>",

It is a 20 acre flood control impoundment created in 1981 by the Yellow Medicine Watershed District.  A concrete ramp exists to launch boats and abundant public property is present for shore angling. <br> \n     Primary game fish species present are black crappie, walleye, northern pike, and black bullhead.  Black crappies were abundant in 2011.  Black crappie growth tends to be slow in John Reservoir and anglers should expect most crappies to measure 6-10 inches, with a few fish up to 12 inches also present.  Decent sized walleye and northern pike were present, but in lower numbers.  Black bullheads were present in adequate numbers and sizes to provide additional angling opportunities. <br> \n     Future management activities include fish population assessments, walleye stocking, winter dissolved oxygen monitoring and fishing pressure counts.</p>",
