                "narrative": "<p>Silver is a 90-acre lake located 5.5 miles WNW of Longville, Minnesota in northern Cass County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet with 77 percent of the lake less than 15 feet deep. A county-owned public access is located on the NE shore of Silver off of Chippewa National Forest Road No. 2312. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has categorized Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on each lake's physical and chemical characteristics.  Silver is in Lake Class 21.  Other local lakes in this classification include Stocking (5 miles west), Louise (12 miles south) and Heffron (6 miles southeast).  Silver was sampled by the DNR in 1968, 1977, 1981, 1990, and 1995, and by Leech Lake Reservation biologists in 1987.  In August 1968, DNR treated Silver Lake with rotenone to kill existing fish population. This would then allow the lake to be managed for muskellunge or walleye. Fish collected in Silver in 1995 were northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, yellow perch, and walleye.  The gill net catch rate of northern pike in 1995 was 11.0 fish/net, which is above the average for lakes of this type.  Sampled northern pike averaged 22.6 inches and 3.0 lbs. They ranged in length from 13.0 to 32.9 inches. Both abundance and average size of northern pike in the 1995 survey was similar to surveys done in 1981 and 1990.  Silver Lake northern pike grew faster than in other local Class 21 lakes.  An average northern pike from Silver was 24.1 inches when it became five years old.  Black crappie in Silver Lake were abundant but small.  The 1995 trap net (29.4 fish/net) and gill net (7.0 fish/net) catch rates were above average for this type of lake. The average size of black crappie in 1995 was similar to 1990. However, they were sampled at a rate almost twice as high. Black crappie ranged from 3.5 to 9.9 inches in the 1995 survey and grew at a rate similar to other local Class 21 lakes. At age five an average black crappie was 7.9 inches long.  A total of 14 largemouth bass were sampled that ranged in length from 4.0 to 14.9 inches and had an average length of 10.7 inches. The average largemouth in Silver was 10.9 inches at age five.The 1995 gill net catch of yellow perch (52.8 fish/net) was well above average for this lake class and indicated an abundant population.  Sampled yellow perch ranged in length from 4 to 10 inches.  To help maintain quality fish populations in Silver Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife. They also help protect shorelines from erosion and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young. Protection of the Silver Lake watershed is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Silver Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake is an 89-acre lake located southeast of Whipholt, Minnesota.  A public access is located on the northeast shore of Silver Lake and is accessed by a minimum maintenance road that goes south off of Old Grade Road. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Silver Lake is in Lake Class 21; lakes in this class generally are very small, have soft water, and have a high amount of lake area less than 15 feet deep.  This lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass and black crappie, and secondarily for northern pike and yellow perch.  Silver Lake has a good population of largemouth bass, and fish up to 17 inches were sampled.   Black crappie abundance was about average for this type of lake, and fish up to 11 inches were sampled.  Northern pike abundance was similar to other lakes of this type. Northern pike up to 25 inches were sampled, however the average length of northern pike was 21 inches.  Both largemouth bass grew more slowly in Silver Lake than in other Walker area Lake Class 21 waters, while the growth rate of northern pike was similar to that found in other lakes in this class.  Pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow perch are also available for anglers.  Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Silver Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake is a 121-acre lake located southeast of Whipholt, Minnesota.  A public access is located on the northeast shore of the lake. The access road goes south off of National Forest Road 2312. The lake is entirely within the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Reservation. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Silver Lake is in Lake Class 21; lakes in this class generally are very small, have soft water, and have a high amount of lake area less than 15 feet deep. Similar Lake Class 21 lakes in the Walker area include Blind (11-0155) and South Stocking (11-0297). This lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie, and secondarily for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch. This survey was a standard fish population assessment. <br> \n <br> \nSilver Lake has a good population of largemouth bass that averaged 12 inches long with fish up to 20 inches sampled.   Black crappie abundance was below average for this type of lake, and averaged 7 inches long with fish up to 11 inches sampled. Northern pike abundance was similar to other lakes of this type. The average length of Northern Pike was 26 inches and fish up to 35 inches long were sampled. Bluegill were sampled for the first time in 2017. Bluegill were introduced to the lake sometime within the last ten years and their origin is unknown. Bluegills were mostly small and averaged 4.5 inches long. A small percentage of these fish were over 8 inches long. Yellow perch are also available but all the fish sampled were less than 8 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Silver Lake.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

SINCE THE RECLAMATION, VARIOUS FISH SPECIES HAVE BEEN RE-ESTABLISHING THEIR POPULATIONS DUE THE INCOMPLETE RECLAMATION AND/OR RE-INTRODUCTION BY ANGLERS.  NOP WERE SAMPLED AT THE RATE OF 8 PER GILLNET.  MOST OF THE FISH SAMPLED RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 20 TO 24 INCHES. THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF GROWTH IS EXCELLENT; AN AGE 3 NOP AVERAGES 20.5 INCHES LONG.  CONSIDERING THE TYPES OF SAMPLING GEAR, A FAIR NUMBER OF LMB WERE SAMPLED, INDICATING AN ABUNDANT POPULATION. FISH UP TO 15 INCHES LONG WERE COLLECTED.  THE GROWTH RATE FOR LMB IS EXCELLENT.  THE TRAPNET CATCH OF BLC WAS 11.5 PER NET, WHICH IS GREATER THAN WHAT IS USUALLY ENCOUNTERED IN MOST AREA LAKES.  SIX YEAR CLASSES OF BLC WERE SAMPLED; II+ AND IV+ FISH DOMINATED THE SAMPLE COLLECTED.  THE GROWTH RATE FOR BLC IS EXCELLENT.  YEP WERE SAMPLED AT THE RATE OF 18.3 PER GILLNET.</p>",
