                "narrative": "<p>Stony Lake is the middle basin in a chain of three lakes located between Brophy and Cowdry Lakes in Douglas County.  None of basins have public landings, but anglers can utilize access sites on Cowdry and Brophy Lakes and navigate small watercraft throughout the chain of lakes via flowage channels.  Large boats will be restricted by undersized road culverts.  The lakes are relatively unique in that shoreline development is limited and much of the natural shoreline remains intact.  Water quality and clarity are very good.  Near-shore areas of each lake contain lush vegetative growth including bulrushes and water lilies.  Habitat attributes comprise an ideal environment for northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \nOver the past 20 years, northern pike populations have been stable, with little variation in abundance and size distribution.  Gillnet catches averaged 6.8 per gillnet.  Average size was about 20.0 inches, but individuals approaching 30.0 inches in length were recorded during the 2008 survey.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are abundant and comprise most of total catch during netting surveys.  Trapnet catches averaged 17.0 bluegill/net in 2008.  Average length was 6.2 inches.  A few 8.0 bluegill were captured, but these are old fish.   <br> \n <br> \nNavigation restrictions prevented utilization of electrofishing equipment to sample the largemouth bass population.  Habitat is excellent and prior survey statistics have described a moderately abundant population.  Growth is relatively slow.  Most bass are 12.0 - 15.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow and black bullhead carry unique importance in terms of water quality.  Yellow bullheads prefer and do best in lakes with good water quality, while an abundant black bullhead population is indicative of poor water quality conditions.  Presently, the North Union/Stony/Lottie chain has a ratio of about 2:1 yellow to black bullheads.  Black bullhead abundance can be projected to increase should cumulative pressures of land use, shoreline development, and recreational boating increase.  Thoughtful, low-impact residential development practices and environmentally-sensitive surface water use will help to ensure the long-term sustainability of these quality lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThose anglers without the advantage of boats can still enjoy fishing Brohpy, Stony, and North Union lakes.  The Central Lakes Trail crosses portions of shorelines of these three lakes.  They are a fairly short hike or bike ride from downtown Alexandria.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stoney Lake is a small, relatively shallow basin in a chain of three lakes that connect Lake Brophy toLake Cowdry.  Stoney Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Submergentvegetation grows to a depth of 14 feet and is dense throughout the littoral zone.   Common cattail iscommon in shoreline areas and there are beds of wild rice near the inlet area.  Dense beds of plantsin shoreline areas likely reduced the capture efficiency of trapnets.  The fish communities in allthree lakes are typical for small, densely vegetated basins.  Northern pike catches averaged 9.5 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches averaged 6.5 fish/net in 1992, 5.5fish/net in 1987, and 8.0 fish/net in 1966.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes withsimilar physical and chemical characteristics is 2.8 - 8.7 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish capturedin 1997 was 0.9 pounds.  Total length ranged from 15.4 to 19.2 inches.  Age-2 and age-3 fish comprised95% of the fish captured in gillnets.  Bluegill catches averaged 9.1 fish/trapnet in 1997, compared to4.7 fish/trapnet in 1992.  However, gillnet catches decreased from 14.0 fish/net in 1992 to 1.0fish/net in 1997.  Trapnet catches were likely not indicative of actual bluegill abundance in 1992. Trapnet catches were much higher in previous surveys, averaging 91.0 fish/net in 1987 and 61.6 fish/netin 1966.  Size structure of the bluegill population is relatively unchanged since 1992.  About one-fourth of the fish captured were 6 inches in length or greater.  Bluegill likely experienced poorreproductive success during the unusually cool summers of 1992 and 1993.  Age-4 and age-5 fish werepoorly represented in trapnet catches.  The status of the largemouth bass population is unknown. Electrofishing was not conducted because the boat is to large to navigate the culverts that provide theonly access to Stoney Lake.  Prior surveys with a smaller, handmade boat depict a moderate populationdensity with a balanced size structure.Four walleye ranging from 14.4 to 20.1 inches in total length were captured in gillnets.  Mean weightof fish captured was 1.9 pounds.  Walleye likely move freely through this chain of lakes from LakesBrophy and Cowdry.  Tullibee, black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and yellow perch wereother sportfish of interest captured in survey nets.  Underutilized species captured included bowfin,white sucker, common carp, black bullhead, and yellow bullhead.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Stoney is within a chain of lakes West of Alexandria which also includes lakes Lottie, North Union, and Brophy.  These lakes support abundant and diverse communities of submergent and emergent vegetation.  Fish communities present in these lakes are similar and best described as typical Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Northern Pike assemblages.  Northern Pike catches averaged 6.5 fish/gill net which is within the normal range of mean catch rates (2.7 - 9.0 fish/gill net) for lake class 33.  Unlike many other area lakes, Lake Stoney has not experienced a decline in Northern Pike abundance.  Catch rate was 5.5 fish/net in 1987.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1992 was 1.2 pounds.  PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 15.4% and 7.7%, respectively.  PSD was calculated at 36.4% in the 1987 population assessment. Growth rate of Northern Pike in Stoney Lake exceeds the mean growth rate of Northern Pike in other area lakes within lake class 33.  Age 4 fish average 22.6 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Daytime, DC electrofishing yielded 14 stock-size Largemouth Bass per hour. A similar catch rate was recorded in 1987 during daytime, AC electrofishing.  Bright sunlight and exceptional water clarity may have reduced capture efficiency in 1992.  The survey crew noted that many Largemouth Bass were observed avoiding the effective electrical field.  PSD of captured fish was calculated at 35.7%, however one fish exceeded 15.0 inches in total length.  Growth of Largemouth Bass in Stoney Lake is slightly less than the mean growth rate of Largemouth Bass from other area lakes within lake class 33.  Age 5 fish averaged 12.1 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Bluegill catch rate decreased from 38.5 fish/trap net in 1987 to 4.7 fish/trap net in 1992.  Similar declines in trap net catches were observed for the other lakes within the chain.  However gill net catch rate averaged 14.0 fish/net compared to 0.0 fish/net in 1987.  The cause or causes for the recent decline in trap net catch rates are unknown.  Age analyses indicate poor recruitment of age 3 fish (1989 year class).  Abundant submergent vegetation in the littoral zone may have reduced trap netting efficiency.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1992 was 0.1 pounds.  PSD was calculated at 21.4%. This reflects a downward shift in the size structure of Bluegill. PSD was calculated at 51.8% in the 1987 survey.  The current size structure is similar to the size structure of Bluegill populations found in Lake Lottie and Brophy.  Bluegill growth in Stoney Lake is similar to the mean growth rate of Bluegill from other area lakes within lake class 33 and similar to other lakes within the chain.  Age 5 fish averaged 4.9 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Four Walleye were captured in gill nets during the population assessment which represents a catch rate of 2.0 fish/net.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.2 pounds.  Lengths of fish captured ranged from 16.0 to 21.0 inches in total length.  Fish migration from Lake Brophy is the likely source of these Walleye.  Other fish species captured included Cicsco (Tullibee), White Sucker, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Black Crappie, Yellow Bullhead, Black Bullhead, and Brown Bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stoney Lake is a small, relatively shallow basin in a chain of three small lakes that connect Lake Brophy to Lake Cowdry.  The other lakes in this chain include Lottie and North Union.  Total surface acreage of the three lakes is 253 acres.  The three lakes are treated as one in terms of fish management.  Management activities on this chain of lakes have been limited to periodic fish population surveys.  The Division of Fisheries has not stocked fish into any of these lakes because there is no legal public access.  Access to these lakes must be gained through culverts from lakes Brophy and Cowdry.  Culvert size and water level can restrict the size of boats that can access these lakes.All three lakes support abundant and diverse aquatic plant communities.  Submergent vegetation is dense in most shallow areas and the shoreline is fringed with common cattail.  These lakes also support beds of hardstem bulrush and wild rice.  Water lily is also common throughout the three lakes.  These aquatic plants provide valuable fish habitat and help maintain water quality in lakes.The fish communities present in these three lakes are quite similar and typical of small, densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and sunfish provide most of the fishing opportunities in this chain of lakes.  These species are all relatively abundant, but average size tends to be small.   Anglers tend to target these lakes when high winds force them off of the larger lakes.  Anglers also fish for black crappie on these lakes in the spring, prior to the walleye opener.  Walleye likely move throughout the chain from the other lakes and are present in low numbers.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Union, Stony, and Lottie (Taylor) lakes form a chain of lakes between Brophy and Cowdry lakes in Douglas County.  Stony Lake is the middle lake within the chain of lakes.   Stony Lake discharges to Lottie Lake.  None of these three small basins have public access sites, but anglers can utilize access sites on Cowdry and Brophy lakes and navigate small watercraft throughout the chain via flowage channels. Access to these lakes with larger, high profile boats is constrained by bridge crossings and road culverts.    <br> \n <br> \nThe lakes are small and relatively unique in that shoreline development is limited and much of the natural shoreline remains intact.  Water quality and clarity are very good. Water transparency at time of the August survey was measured at 19.0 feet.  Near-shore soils support lush vegetative growth including bulrushes and water lilies. These habitat characteristics are ideal for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are moderately abundant in Stony Lake and accounted for most of the total gamefish catch.  Most of the Bluegills caught in the survey were small, but some fish over 8 inches were observed.  Average length of Bluegill captures was 5.4 inches.  Black Crappie catches were low, but crappies are typically difficult to catch in mid-summer surveys.  Crappies are likely more abundant than reflected in survey catch statistics.  Northern Pike are abundant.  Most pike captured during the survey were less than 22 inches in total length.  Several pike exceeded 26 inches.  Navigation restrictions prevented access with an electrofishing boat to survey the Largemouth Bass population.  Only a few Largemouth Bass were caught in the survey nets, but habitat conditions are excellent for Largemouth Bass and bass are likely abundant. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and other outdoor recreationists looking for a quiet lake should check out the North Union, Stony, and Lottie lake chain.  This chain of lakes provides a remote lake setting in close proximity to the city of Alexandria. <br> \n <br> \nStony Lake was designated as an infested water in 2011 after discovery of zebra mussels in upstream lakes. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.  Updated information on invasive species infestations can be found on the MN DNR website. <br> \n</p>",
