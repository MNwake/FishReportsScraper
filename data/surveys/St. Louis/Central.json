                "narrative": "<p>Central is a 75 acre lake with 62 (83%) acres of littoral area and maximum depth 19 feet.  Central Lake is located adjacent to State Highway #53, just South of Central Lakes.  Central Lake has no developed public access.  Fish population investigations have been conducted in 1975 and 1999. Due to the small size of Central Lake, only one experimental gillnet was set during the 1999 survey.  Because of this limited gillnet effort, trapnet catch rates will be used to evaluate abundance for all species.     Northern pike abundance indexed with assessment nets was 0.8 per lift in 1999.  Size and growth of northern pike were both good.  Mean length of sampled northern pike was 27.2 inches and length at the beginning of their fourth year of life was 25.0 inches.     Bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish abundance indexed with assessment nets were both typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of sampled bluegill was small but growth was fast.  Bluegill mean length was 4.6 inches and length at the beginning of their fourth year of life was 6.2 inches. Size of sampled pumpkinseed sunfish was small with a mean length of 4.5 inches.     Black bullhead and brown bullhead abundance indexed with assessment nets were both typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of black and brown bullhead was 6.4 and 9.1 inches from the 1999 investigation.  Yellow bullhead were also sampled at low abundance.     </p>",
