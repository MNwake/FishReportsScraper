A fishing pier located on the west shore provides access beyond the vegetation for fishing. Bluegill were the most abundant fish species sampled during the 2005 survey. The average size of bluegill was small, 4.6 inches with the largest sampled fish measuring 6.5 inches. Black crappie were also abundant but small with less than 10% exceeding 9.0 inches.  Northern pike are moderately abundant and all but one exceeded 20.0 inches. Other fish sampled included green sunfish, pumpkinseed, yellow and black bullheads, a white sucker and one walleye.</p>",

The Fishing in the Neighborhood Program manages the lake for shore fishing, primarily for panfish species such as bluegills and black crappies. A fishing pier is located on the west shore of the lake and much of the shoreline is accessible for fishing from a path that follows the perimeter of the lake. Other recreational opportunities at the lake and within the park include a swimming beach, playground, and picnic areas. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were the most abundant species sampled in the 2010 survey. The average size was larger than those sampled in past surveys at 7.2 inches and the largest fish measured 9.3 inches. Bluegills were not sampled in this survey but hybrid sunfish were moderately abundant and had an average size of 6.0 inches. One northern pike was caught in the gillnet and measured 31 inches. Looking at historic catch rates in survey nets for northern pike, they appear to be declining in abundance since the original survey in 1996.  <br> \n</p>",

At the end of June 2001 it was stocked with 1458 adult bluegills. In addition to bluegills, black crappies have also been stocked in the past. In addition to bluegills, black crappies have also been stocked in the past. Other species such as black bullheads, largemouth bass, walleye, and northern pike are present in the lake but are not stocked here by the Mn DNR. Northern pike are relatively abundant. The average size of pike sampled during the survey was 23.8 inches in length. The lake has ample shoreline fishing opportunities. Although dense aquatic vegetation can make angling difficult at times. A fishing pier is located on the west shore.  </p>",
