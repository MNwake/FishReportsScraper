                "narrative": "<p>Whitefish lake is a small (226 acre), fertile lake with a maximum depth of 18 feet.  It experiences low dissolved oxygen concentrations during severe winters that can occasionally produce partial winterkills.  The most recent documented winterkill occurred in 1991.  Trapnetting in the spring of 1991 found only large numbers of bullheads, some black crappies and yellow perch.  Walleye fry were subsequently stocked in 1992, 1993, and 1994.The outlet of Whitefish Lake is a tributary to the Poplar River and many fish species are able to repopulate the lake, following winterkill, by this route.  Although the outlet flows intermittently, the presence of carp in the lake confirms it as an immigration route.  Northern pike, in addition to being a relatively winterkill resistant species, are adept at repopulating a lake where there is an available immigration route like the one that exists at Whitefish Lake.  It is probably for these reasons that northern pike have historically been the primary gamefish in the lake.  Contrary to this history, the current survey sampled only three northern pike.  They were two and three years of age and exhibited a fast growth rate.  Northern pike do not appear to have had much reproductive success since the winterkill of 1991.  Given the high water levels of recent years this seems unusual.  It is expected to turn around because high water levels generally make more spawning habitat available to northern pike.A small walleye population that was present in 1989 was eliminated in the 1991 winterkill.  The walleyes sampled in the current survey are the result of fry stocking in the aftermath of the 1991 winterkill.  The current 1.5 walleye per gillnet is considered to be in the normal range of abundance for lakes of this ecological type.  The walleyes in Whitefish Lake are exhibiting a fast growth rate; two year old fish average nearly 14 inches in length.Yellow perch is a relatively winterkill resistant fish species which is abundant in Whitefish Lake.  Although they too, were probably reduced by the winterkill of 1991, they have rebounded because they didn't have competition or predation.  The gillnet catch in the current survey was 76 per gillnet.  Ages one through six were sampled in test nets and growth rate is normal.  It is no wonder that the few northern pike and walleyes present exhibit fast growth with this ample forage base of yellow perch.Largemouth bass were present in the 1989 survey and adult bluegills were stocked in 1990.  Both species are quite sensitive to low oxygen levels and were apparently eliminated from the fish community by the 1991 winterkill.  Given the tendency of Whitefish Lake to experience low winter oxygen levels, it is unlikely that either largemouth bass or bluegill would do well over the long term.Black crappie is a species more suited to this type of lake.  They are one of the more winterkill resistant fish in the sunfish family.  Black crappie were able to survive the winterkill of 1991 in Whitefish Lake.  The current survey sampled crappies up to six years old.  The majority of crappies sampled were one to three years old and showed somewhat above average growth.  These young crappies should provide good angling in the next few years.As with most winterkill lakes, bullheads are abundant in Whitefish Lake.  Both black bullheads and brown bullheads are present with the blacks far out-numbering the browns.  The trapnet catch of black bullheads in the current survey was an exceptionally high 224 per trapnet.  Thirty-three percent of the black bullheads were over eight inches in length and may be of interest to bullhead anglers or commercial fishermen.Carp have immigrated into Whitefish Lake and were taken in trapnets at a rate of 1.6 per trapnet in the current survey.  They ranged from 11 to 27 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whitefish Lake is a eutrophic, 226-acre, class 38 lake with a maximum depth of 18 feet.  Blue-green algal blooms are common during most summers and dissolved oxygen can become low during severe winters leading to periodic winterkills.  Low winter dissolved oxygen levels were reported in 1994, 2004, 2006 and 2013.  A moderate to heavy winterkill occurred in 2004, while light winterkills may have occurred in 2006 and 2013.  Walleye fry and Black Crappie brood fish were stocked following the winterkill in 2004.  The outlet of Whitefish Lake is a tributary to the Poplar River and several fish species are able to repopulate the lake following winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have historically been the primary gamefish species in Whitefish Lake, although their population numbers have fluctuated greatly.  The Northern Pike gill net catch rate in 2015 was 8.7 fish per net compared to the lake's historical average of 9.7 per net.  The historical high catch rate of 19.5 fish per net occurred in the previous survey in 2005.  Northern Pike sampled in gill nets in 2015 averaged 22.1 inches and 2.4 pounds.  No Northern Pike older than five years old were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 Walleye gill net catch rate set a historic high of 4.0 fish per net.  The next highest catch rate was 1.5 fish per net, recorded in both 1989 and 1995 assessments.  Sampled Walleyes ranged 8.6-25.6 inches in length with an average length of 19.2 inches.  The Walleye population is maintained primarily by stocking of fry in odd years, and Walleyes averaged 16.3 inches by the time they are four years old. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are a relatively winterkill resistant species and they were found to be more abundant in Whitefish Lake than in other similar lakes in the state.  The 2015 gill net catch rate of 54.2 fish per net was near the lake average of 53.2 fish per net.  The average length of Yellow Perch was 6.8 inches and lengths ranged from 5.3-9.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were present in the 1989 survey and adult Bluegills were stocked in 1990.  Black Crappies were found in several previous studies and were stocked as adult brood fish in 2004.  However, no Bluegills or Black Crappie were sampled in this survey.  One young of the year Largemouth Bass and two hybrid sunfish were captured suggesting at least some adult fish from the sunfish family are present in Whitefish Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads are very abundant in Whitefish Lake.  Bullhead abundance is typically indexed with trap nets, but the 2015 trap net catch rate of Black Bullheads was 0.1 fish per net while 155.8 Black Bullheads were caught per gill net.  Black Bullheads averaged 7.6 inches in length. Comparatively, the gillnet catch of Brown Bullheads was only 0.33 fish per net. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp have migrated into Whitefish Lake and catch rates have fluctuated from 0.0-1.56 per net.  Only one Common Carp was captured in 2015 for a catch rate of 0.11 per trap net.  The captured Common Carp was large at 34.5 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help to maintain balance in fish populations by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium and large fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.  This is particularly true for Northern Pike and Bluegill.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, by taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and by using wise land management practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whitefish Lake is a shallow (18 ft), fertile lake located in southeastern Polk County approximately four miles east of Fosston.  This lake is vulnerable to occasional winterkill.  Most recently, the lake experienced partial winterkill in 2004.  Winterkill resistant species like northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker, and bullhead seem to sustain their populations in this lake better than most other fish species.  These species generally repopulate the lake quickly and naturally after winterkill.  Other fishing opportunities are created by stocking walleye fry on a regular basis and black crappie brood fish following winterkills.In the 2005 lake survey, northern pike and yellow perch were most abundant and likely to provide the highest potential for angling over the short term.  Catch rates for northern pike were higher than during any previous survey.  Sampled pike were generally young and small with an average length of 18.8 inches.  However, with good growth rates and an ample supply of forage fish in Whitefish Lake, larger pike should be available soon.  A few large pike are already present.  The largest pike found during the 2005 survey was over 30 inches.  Some perch over 11 inches were sampled, and the average length was 8.2 inches.Barring another winterkill in the near future, walleyes should also provide modest fishing opportunities in the next couple of years.  Catch rates were not high, but walleyes stocked as fry in 2003 and 2004 were found in test nets even though they are not particularly vulnerable to these nets at such young ages.A problem for angler access on this lake is the presence of floating cattail bogs that tend to plug the boat ramp frequently.  These floating islands move around the lake with any strong wind and have put a halt to both anglers and fisheries workers in the past.</p>",
