Pickerel Lake is 57 acres, has 1.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 18 feet.  Shoal water soils are 95 percent sand, 3 percent silt, and 2 percent gravel.  Secchi reading was 8.5 feet. Total alkalinity was 142.5 p.p.m.  Several emergent and submerged aquatic plants were present and the denisty rating was sparse to scattered for all species except Chara.Test netting indicated a good fish population of northern pike, but the average individual size was only one pound.  Good spawning areas exist for northern pike.  Black grub (Neascus) and yellow grub (Clinostomum Marginatum) were the only parasites found.  Northern pike and yellow perch had a high infection of Neascus.</p>",
