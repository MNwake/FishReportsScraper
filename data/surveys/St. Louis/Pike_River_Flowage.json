                "narrative": "<p>The Pike River Flowage is located five miles west of Tower with its main access via a gravel ramp off State Highway 1 just upstream of the impounding dam.  This 254-acre reservoir is fed by the Pike River from the West and exits over a dam into Pike Bay on Lake Vermilion. The reservoir has a maximum depth of 23 feet, Secchi disk reading of 3.5 feet, and brown-colored water. The deeper, channelized basin north of the HWY 1 bridge had a surface temperature of 69.8 F and contained dissolved oxygen sufficient for fish down to 9 feet where the temperature was 68.7 F. The shallow flooded basin south of the bridge was weakly stratified with a surface temperature of 68.4 F and a bottom temperature of 67.5 F. Dissolved oxygen levels were sufficient for fish to the bottom.  <br> \n <br> \nThis population assessment consisted of six gill net and nine trap net sets. The overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was above average at 20.0 fish/net.  Gill net catches were dominated by walleye, white sucker, and northern pike.  The overall trap net catch rate for all fish combined was below average at 8.9 fish/net. Trap net catches were primarily white sucker, northern pike and black crappie. Bluegill were sampled in low numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (5.0/net) was the second highest in all surveys of the flowage. Lengths ranged from 7.5 to 24 inches with an average of almost 14 inches. Walleye ages ranged from 1 to 15 years, though most of the catch was age 5 or less. Recruitment of years 2 through 5 was consistent. Walleye growth was average for the Tower area. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance (1.7/net) was below average. Lengths ranged from 12.0 to almost 30 inches with a mean of 20 inches. Most of the northern pike sampled appeared skinny and had pronounced neascus infestations. This parasite, also known as black spot, is not a health hazard. Fish should be thoroughly cooked. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance (1.7/net) was below average for the PRF but average for similar area lakes. Lengths ranged from 5 to 12.5 inches with an average of 9 inches. Black crappie growth was near average. Only 2018 stood out as a stronger year class, although natural reproduction was consistent. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance (0.9/net) was low, but the fish present were quality. Lengths ranged from 5.5 to 9.8 inches with a mean of 7.6 inches. Growth was notably fast for the area. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were present in both gears. One 15 inch smallmouth was present in a gill net and trap nets captured two at 11.5 and 17.5 inches. Standard survey gear underrepresents smallmouth bass numbers, and anglers may find more bass than our nets suggest. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey scheduled for 1999 was changed to a special assessment when low dissolved oxygen (D.O.) was discovered on 7/20/99 on Pike River Flowage and miles upstream on the Pike River and the Sandy River (a tributary to the Pike River).No fish were caught in three gillnets lifted on 7/21/99 or 7/22/99.  A total of six trapnets were set.  Three trapnets contained no fish and all fish were dead when the three trapnets containing fish were lifted on 7/21/99 or 7/22/99.  A total of 18 fish were caught in the three trapnets including: 7 white sucker, 6 pumpkinseed sunfish, 2 rock bass, 1 bluegill sunfish, 1 northern pike, and 1 yellow perch.Subsequent evaluation by the MDNR and MPCA indicated the likely cause of the low D.O. was a high BOD load resulting from the large amount of decomposing organic material flushed into the Pike and Sandy Rivers from adjacent bogs and wetlands following the heavy rains from the July 4th storm, an influx of low D.O. water from adjacent bogs and wetlands, or a combination of these factors.  The water color in the rivers and Pike River Flowage was dark chocolate brown with lots of suspended particulates.  There was a strong odor at Pike River Flowage and many of the bridge crossings where D.O. was checked on the Pike and Sandy Rivers.  D.O. readings of 0.20 mg/l were recorded on the Pike and Sandy Rivers.  There was a silver sheen on the water at some locations.A fish kill in Pike River Flowage was reported on 7/28/99.  During investigation of the fish kill on 7/28/99 dead fish were only observed in the southeast bay of Pike River Flowage and the dead fish were concentrated in the back end of the bay.  The dead fish were floating and badly decomposed.  A sample of 197 fish were identified by species as follows: white sucker - 146 (74.1%), walleye - 21 (10.7%), yellow perch - 13 (6.6%), rock bass - 9 (4.6%), northern pike - 3 (1.5%), madtom - 3 (1.5%), and sunfish (appeared to be bluegill) - 2 (1.0%).  The estimate for dead fish not identified was 750.  The identified sample appeared representative of the remaining dead fish that were counted.  Estimated length of walleye in the identified sample ranged from 6\" to 28\" with a fair number of fish between 10\" and 14\".  Most of the white sucker were fairly large.  The two sunfish were about 10\".Three gillnets were set in Pike River Flowage on 9/14/99 to determine if any fish survived the low D.O. period.  This netting caught low numbers of most fish species that were caught in prior assessments of Pike River Flowage indicating the low D.O. period did not result in a complete fish kill.  A total of 22 fish were caught in the three gillnets including: 8 northern pike, 5 white sucker, 4 rock bass, 2 bluegill sunfish, 2 yellow perch, and 1 walleye.  Compared to historical net catch data white sucker and yellow perch numbers/lift were down considerably.  White sucker comprised over 74% and yellow perch 6.6% of fish identified during the 7/28/99 fish kill investigation.  Although walleye comprised 10.7% of the fish identified in the 7/28/99 fish kill investigation, numbers in four assessments from 1986 to 1994 average 0.6/lift.</p>",

Low numbers of bluegill and golden shiner were also present.Fish sizes were generally small, although a few quality sized bluegill (over 8\") and walleye (over 17\") were present.  Yellow perch, sucker, and northern pike recruitment appeared to be good.  Bluegill growth was fast by area standards, while perch growth was average.  Walleye growth was difficult to ascertain due to hard-to-read scales and the small sample size.The total number of fish captured in gillnets (13.8/net) and trapnets (11.7/net) was low.  The total weight of fish captured in gillnets (13.1 lbs/net) and trapnets (13.8 lbs/net) was also low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Pike River Flowage is located five miles west of Tower with its main access via a gravel ramp off of State Highway 1.  This 254 acre reservoir is fed by the Pike River on its far west side and outflows over an aged power dam into Pike Bay on Lake Vermilion.  It has a maximum depth of 23 feet and the water color is brown. <br> \n <br> \nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 17.2 fish/net.  Fish species sampled in gill nets were white sucker (37%), rock bass (20%), northern pike (17%), black crappie (11%), yellow perch (7%), walleye (6%), and smallmouth bass (2%).   <br> \nThe overall trap net catch rate for all fish combined was 27.9 fish/net, this is the highest catch on record.  Fish species sampled in trapnets were bluegill (35%), rock bass (23%), black crappie (19%), northern pike (6%), white sucker (6%), walleye (4%) pumpkinseed (3%), yellow perch (3%), and hybrid sunfish (1%).   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gillnet catch on the flowage was 1.0 fish/net and the trap net catch was 1.2 fish/net.  Historically, both gear types have an average catch rate of 0.8 fish/net on this lake.  Trapnet caught fish ranged in size from 7 to 26 inches with an average of 13 inches.  Gillnetted walleye sizes were more compressed with a range of 8 to 15 inches and an average of 12 inches.  Growth was slow when compared to other lakes in the area.   Ages ranged from 1 to 6 years old.  The largest individual at 26 inches was not aged as it was captured in a trap net and aging structures were not taken.  The flowage has not been stocked since 2002 so it appears walleye are naturally reproducing. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch rate was 3.0 fish/gill net which is above the historic average of 2.8 fish/net for the flowage.  Sizes ranged from 13 to 27 inches with an average of 19 inches.  The growth rate is near the average for lakes in the area.  The oldest fish were five years old.  Of sixteen pike examined for diseases and parasites, fourteen contained neascus, also known as black spot, and of those, several of the infestations were quite severe. <br> \nTwo smallmouth bass were sampled for the first time.  They were 14 and 15 inches apiece and ages 3 and 4 respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at a rate of 5.2 fish/trapnet.  This was higher than the previous survey and very good when compared to other similar lakes throughout the state.  Lengths ranged from 4 to 12 inches with an average of 7 inches.  Growth rates appeared good when compared to other lakes in the area.  The oldest fish were five years old.  The 2011 year class was exceptionally strong, nearly 66% of all the crappies sampled came from this year class.  These exceptional year classes can be typical of boom-and-bust species such as crappie. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers have increased in the flowage.  This assessments catch rate was 9.8 fish/trapnet which is better than the previous high mark which came in 2004 at 7.3 fish/net.  This catch rate was also higher than 75% of other similar lakes throughout the state.  Sizes ranged from 4 to 10 inches with an average of 6 inches.  Growth was good when compared to other lakes with bluegill in the area.  Fish up to age 11 were sampled and similarly to the crappies, a large percentage of the fish (74%) came from the 2011 year class.   <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate of 1.2 fish/gillnet is low when compared to historic data for the lake and when compared to other similar lakes throughout the state.  Sizes ranged from 6 to 11 inches with an average of 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOne rusty crayfish was captured in a gill net.  This is the first documentation of this invasive species in the Pike River Flowage. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pike River Flowage is in Ecological Lake Class 19, which consists of 66 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and shallow, and have turbid (bog stained) water.  Pike River Flowage is larger and has a more convoluted shoreline shape than most of the lakes in this lake class.  Pike River Flowage ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.The Pike River is a flashy stream, with high flows during spring runoff and heavy rain events, and low flows during dry periods.  The 2004 Fisheries Lake Survey was conducted during a period of low flow.  A rain event in the summer of 1999 caused a flood and oxygen depletion which resulted in a major, but not total, fish kill.  The cause of the oxygen depletion was likely biological and chemical oxygen demand from decomposing plant material and from humic and tannic acids washed into the river from the abundant lowlands and marshes upstream.Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained through most of the reservoir on July 26, 2004.  There was oxygen depletion below 10 ft in the small, deep portion of the reservoir from the dam upstream to Hwy 1.  Bottom substrates along the shoreline were mostly muck in the shallow bays and rocky substrates elsewhere; there was a fine layer of silt and periphyton covering the bottom throughout the reservoir.  Aquatic plants grew to a depth of 4 ft and were concentrated in the shallow protected areas.  Filamentous algae was quite common; arrowhead, burreed, white and yellow waterlily, Robbins and largeleaf pondweed, and bladderwort were also commonly found. Pike River Flowage is an impoundment of the Pike River and was formed by a power generating dam at a natural constriction of the river just upstream of Lake Vermilion.  This dam has not been used for power generation since the 1920's.  The dam appears to be sound except for some wood stoplogs which are on the verge of failure.  Taconite mining has occurred in the headwaters of the Pike River and it's major tributary, the Sand River, since about 1960.  Seeps from the Minntac tailings basin north of Mountain Iron contributes about 3,000 gallons per minute of water laden with sulfates, chlorides, and other metals and minerals to the Sand River.  The high sulfate levels may be responsible for the decline of wild rice beds along the Sand and Pike rivers in recent years.There is a public access with a gravel ramp just upstream of the State Hwy 1 bridge.  There were 16 homes and cottages on the Flowage in 2004, up from 3 homes and cottages in 1977.  Summer boat fishing pressure was estimated by a 1988 aerial survey at 10.2 angler-hours/acre, which was considered to be moderate pressure at the time.  There is a fish consumption advisory on Pike River Flowage due to mercury.Fish populations in the 2004 Fisheries Lake Survey were sampled with nine standard survey trapnets and six standard survey gillnets.  Young-of-year fish populations were sampled with four small mesh (1/4\" bar mesh) trapnets.  Eight previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1977, used 4-6 trapnets and 3-5 gillnets.  Shoreline seining was done during the initial investigation in 1977.Fish populations in 2004 were dominated by northern pike, white sucker, yellow perch, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie.  Crappie were first observed in this reservoir in 2004.  Few walleye were captured in 2004 despite fry stockings in 2000 and 2002.  Four of the five walleye captured were from the fry-stocked 2000 year class.Northern pike numbers in 2004 (2.8/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were near the median catch of 2.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes averaged 21.7\" (2.7 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 18.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike (caught in a trapnet) was 30.7\".  Pike scales were difficult to read, but most pike appeared to be ages three and five, and pike growth appeared to be normal by area standards.Yellow perch numbers in 2004 (4.7/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were at the median catch for all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes averaged 6.4\" (0.12 lb), which was at the first quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 8.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch was 8.9\".  Perch scales were difficult to read, but most perch appeared to be age four, and perch growth appeared to be somewhat slower than normal by area standards.Bluegill sunfish numbers in 2004 (7.3/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 3.2/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes averaged 7.0\" (0.29 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 7.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill was 9.1\".  Bluegill scales were difficult to read, but most bluegill appeared to be ages three and six, and bluegill growth appeared to be faster than normal by area standards.  Black crappie were first captured in the 2004 investigation.  Crappie numbers (2.9/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class.  Crappie sizes averaged 8.7\" (0.35 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class.  Most crappie were age three and the sole age four crappie may have been aged incorrectly, as it was smaller than the age three fish.  This means that crappie were introduced to this reservoir in 2001.  Good numbers of young-of-year crappie were present in the small mesh trapnets in 2004.  Crappie growth appeared to be faster than normal by area standards.A few of the bluegill and northern pike examined in 2004 had neascus, and a few of the yellow perch had yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting the fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",
