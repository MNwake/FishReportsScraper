                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake, located in Pine County, is managed primarily for northern pike and secondly for largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill sunfish.  Lake class 37 has been assigned to Fox Lake based on seven different parameters.From August 3-6, 1998, a population assessment was conducted to assess the current status of the fish population in Fox Lake.  Sampling gear consisted of night electrofishing, three gill nets, nine trap nets, and three shoreline seine hauls.Northern pike abundance was normal when compared to similar lakes of this type and an average weight of 3.3 pounds was also found to be at a normal level.  The 1998 abundance and average weight have increased since the 1993 survey.  Lengths ranged from 18.6 to 30.4 inches with an average length of 23.0 inches.  Fox Lake northern pike growth was typical of normal when compared to statewide averages.       On May 03, 1998, night electrofishing was utilized to sample for largemouth bass.  Bass were sampled at a rate of 1.9 fish/hour (on-time), which appears to be low.  In 1993, no largemouth bass were sampled during night electrofishing.  Lengths of the two fish sampled were at 4.8 and 10.7 inches.  Growth rates were found to be typical of normal for this type of lake.The black crappie population was found to be normal in numbers and average weight.  Lengths ranged from 4.2 to 11.2 inches with 68% of the crappies captured between 7.0 to 8.5 inches in length.  The 1998 catch remains consistent with the catch determined in 1993, while the average weight has slightly increased.Bluegill sunfish numbers were below normal for this type of lake, while the average weight was found to be within a normal range.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.0 to 8.9 inches with an average length of 5.1 inches.The abundance of yellow perch along with the average weight was found to be at a normal level.  Lengths of sampled fish ranged from 5.3 to 9.2 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches.   According to the previous survey done in 1993, the yellow perch catch has increased while the average weight has decreased.On August 6, 1998, three shoreline seine hauls were conducted to assess natural reproduction success.  Bluegill sunfish showed very successful reproduction, while black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch showed some reproductive success.Other fish species found during the 1998 survey included black bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, yellow bullhead, emerald shiner, Johnny darter, and tadpole madtom.  Black bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker were normal in abundance, while yellow bullhead numbers were above normal for this type of lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox is a 239 acre lake in northwest Pine County 3 miles west of Willow River.  The lake lacks a designated public access but boat launching is possible from the township road on the west shore.  Despite a maximum depth of only 14.5 feet, a significant winterkill has never been recorded.  On a per acre basis, angling pressure is moderate to high in both summer and winter with anglers typically targeting northerns and crappies.  Water clarity and lake shore development are both low.  Submerged aquatic vegetation is not common but there is a good amount of floating bog on the lakes north end.  Northern pike are more abundant than in the past but retain an acceptable size, averaging 2.3 pounds and 21.9 inches.  The black crappie catch rate decreased in both the gill and trap nets but was normal compared to similar lakes.  Twenty percent of measured crappies exceeded 9 inches in length.  Yellow perch, with an abundance typical of the lake class, serve as a forage fish and rarely exceed 8 inches.  Bluegill should provide a nice bonus to crappie anglers with a trap net rate near the lake class median and 38% of the catch over 7 inches.  Largemouth bass are available in harvestable numbers with a mean of 13.8 inches and 1.9 pounds.  The bass catch rate has improved with every assessment since the first sample in 1993.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake has only recently become known as a gamefish lake.  Prior to the early 1980's, water levels were too low to support a fish population, although records from the 1930's show that it had previously been a fishing lake.  Within the last 15 years the lake has naturally developed a fishery consisting of northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, yellow perch, bullheads, and white sucker.          Northern pike do not appear to be highly abundant in Fox Lake, but there is a relatively good population of quality-size northerns; nearly 2/3 of the northern pike seen during the survey were over 25 inches.  Ages up to 8 years were present during the survey and there appears to be fairly consistent spawning from year to year.        Black crappie and bluegill are the two main panfish species in this lake.  Numbers of both species are average for this type of lake.  Many of the black crappies sampled in 1993 were in the 7.5-8.5 inch range.  Bluegills seen during the 1993 survey tended to be large; average length was 7.2 inches, with many up to 8.5 inches.        One species notable for its absence in Fox Lake is the largemouth bass.  This lake has characteristics suitable for bass, but none were found during a night electrofishing survey that covered the entire length of shoreline.  However, several young-of-year bass and one yearling were found during shoreline seining.  Apparently bass have not been able to migrate into the lake enough to establish a population since water levels became suitable.        Other species present in Fox Lake include black, brown and yellow bullheads, white sucker, golden shiner, common shiner, and pumpkinseed sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox is a 239 acre lake in northwest Pine County 3 miles west of Willow River.  The lake lacks a designated public access but boat launching is possible from the township road on the west shore.  Despite a maximum depth of only 14.5 feet, a significant winterkill has never been recorded.  On a per acre basis, angling pressure is moderate to high in both summer and winter with anglers typically targeting northerns, Bluegill, and crappies. Water clarity and lake shore development are both low. Submerged aquatic vegetation is not common but there is a good amount of floating bog on the lake's north end.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were less abundant than in the past but averaged a very similar 2.6 pounds and 21.9 inches. The Black Crappie catch rate changed little since the previous assessment and remains normal compared to similar lakes. Forty two percent of measured crappies exceeded 9 inches in length. With an abundance typical of the lake class, Yellow Perch serve as a forage fish and rarely exceed 8 inches. The Bluegill catch rate exceeded previous assessments but remains within the lake class norm. Thirty seven percent of Bluegill were 8 inches or longer. Largemouth Bass are available in fishable numbers with a mean of 13.1 inches and 1.6 pounds. The bass catch rate and average size decreased for the first time since the initial survey in 1993. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox is a 239 acre lake in northwest Pine County 3 miles west of Willow River.  The lake lacks a designated public access but boat launching is possible from the township road on the west shore.  Despite a maximum depth of only 14.5 feet, a significant winterkill has never been recorded.  On a per acre basis, angling pressure is moderate to high in both summer and winter with anglers typically targeting northerns and crappies.  Water clarity and lake shore developement are both low.  Submerged aquatic vegetation is not common but there is a good amount of floating bog on the lakes north end.  Northern pike are less abundant than in the past but are good sized with 2.7 pound average and half the catch exceeding 23 inches.  Two thirds of sampled crappies were over 8 inches with 23% over 9 inches.  The crappie trapnet catch was higher than most similar lakes and past catches on Fox Lake.  Yellow perch, with an abundance typical of the lake class, serve as a forage fish and rarely exceed 8 inches.  Bluegill should provide a nice bonus to crappie anglers with a trapnet rate near the lake class median and 44% of the catch over 7 inches.  Largemouth bass are available in harvestable numbers for the first time since surveying began in 1993.  Bass average 13 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Their catch rate has progressed from 0 in 1993 and 1.9/hour in 1998 to 31.6/hour currently.  Fall shoreline seining found reproduction of northerns, bass, and bluegill. </p>",
