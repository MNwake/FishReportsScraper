However, Little Vanose can also provide good fishing for walleye, northern pike, bluegills, and, more recently, black crappie in-between winterkills.In 2005, test net catches showed near normal populations of northern pike and black bullhead compared to other class 39 lakes.  Walleye catches were modest and all those caught were from the same 2003 year-class, which was stocked after the most recent partial winterkill.  Black crappies were more abundant than during any previous survey.  Most were small with and average length 6.5 inches and young at two to three years, but a few larger crappies were also found.  Barring another winterkill in the near future, crappie fishing should be very good in another two to three years, when the majority of black crappie should reach one-half pound.Walleye fry are stocked every other year and in years after winterkill.  The near future of the walleye fishery in Little Vanose hinges not only on winterkill, but also on the abundant black crappie.  In lakes similar to this one, black crappies are believed to be a major predator on small walleyes and abundances of crappie can result in declines in walleye numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Vanose is a 144-acre, class 39 lake located in north central Mahnomen County.  Maximum depth of this fertile lake is 28 feet and it is subject to occasional winterkill.  Most recently, the lake experienced winterkills of unknown severity in 2013 and 2014.  This lake is considered eutrophic with a mean Carlson's trophic state index in the fifties.  In addition to frequent winterkills, there was a heavy summerkill during the summer of 1993 as a result of a heavy blue-green algal die-off after several consecutive days of hot, still weather.  The north, west, and south shorelines are primarily state-owned, as part of the Vanose WMA.  Historically, the fishery in Little Vanose has been dominated by Black Bullheads. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish caught during the 2017 survey were typical of a lake which experiences significant winterkills.  Only one gill net was used during this survey due to the extreme number of Walleye caught.  The Walleye catch rate was 132 fish per net.  Only Black Bullhead and Largemouth Bass were the other species caught in gill nets.  Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed Sunfish were also caught in trap nets.  The Hybrid Sunfish capture is intriguing as it was only one large individual and there were no other sunfish species sampled to create a hybrid other than Pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nDespite suspected severe winterkills in 2013 and 2014, all of the caught Walleye were from the 2013 year-class.  The winterkill in 2014 appears to not have been severe enough to kill off the large 2013 year-class of Walleye.  The success of this year-class has likely suppressed the successive Walleye fry stockings.  Interestingly, all of the Largemouth Bass were from the 2014 year-class.  What is unknown is whether some brood fish remained through the 2013 winterkill or some non-permitted stocking occurred in 2014.  Length frequencies of the Black Bullhead and Pumpkinseed Sunfish suggest only one year-class is also present of these.  <br> \n <br> \nThe extended winter of 2017-2018 likely will result in some extent of winterkill in Little Vanose Lake.  Assessments completed after the publication of this report will aid in determining the amount of winterkill and future management of the Lake.</p>",
