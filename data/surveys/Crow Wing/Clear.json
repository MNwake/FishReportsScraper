                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Clear Lake was conducted on June 12-14, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured seventeen species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured eleven species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Bluegill, Bowfin, and Hybrid Sunfish comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Clear Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Pine River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nTemperature-dissolved oxygen profiles were also collected in the deepest basins on Clear Lake on August 1st, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile from the deepest basin, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 20 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 20.6 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 17.6?C (63.7?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations near the thermocline indicate that oxythermal habitat was adequate for Cisco at limited depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. However, low dissolved oxygen concentrations (i.e., less than 3 mg/L) below the thermocline and warm surface temperatures would likely limit available Cisco habitat within the water column to an extent. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress.  <br> \n</p>",

The catch rate was average, when compared to similar lakes, at 2.2/gill net.  Average length was nice at 19.3\" with Walleye up to 28.2\" sampled. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were high at 9.8/gill net.  Northern Pike had an average length of 20.4\" with 19% in the protected 22\"-26\" slot.  Northern Pike at least 26.0\" made up 10% of the catch.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass had a spring electrofishing catch rate of 30.6/hr.  Average length was 13.8\" and 65% of the fish were 12.0\" or larger.  Largemouth Bass were sampled in high numbers in gill nets at 1.8/net.  Average length was 14.8\". <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were average for this type of lake (17.6/trap net).  Average length was 6.2\" with 28% of the fish measuring 7.0\" or larger.  Only 2 black crappie were captured during the survey. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) and Yellow Perch are two important forage species that were caught in this survey.  The Tullibee (Cisco) catch was high for this type of lake at 10.7/gill net, with an average length of 9.3\".  The presence of Tullibee, a sensitive species, in this relatively small lake is indicative of good water quality. The Yellow Perch catch was average (3.2/gill net), with an average length of 7.5\". <br> \n <br> \nZebra Mussels are present in Clear Lake.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on August 25, 2022, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 3 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 3 stations.  Soft bottom and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at the other 4 sampling sites.  Twelve species were sampled, including 6 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mottled Sculpin, Rock Bass and Smallmouth Bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on June 27-30, 2022, to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is a 220 acre lake located 5 miles east of Jenkins in northern Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the north side of the lake.  It has a maximum depth of 63 feet and 27% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  The lake is moderately developed with 62 homes/cabins along mainly the north and east sides of the lake, most of which are set back off the lake.  The south side of the lake is virtually undeveloped with a good deal of emergent vegetation.  The aquatic plant community consists of 24 species of which muskgrass and hardstem bulrush are the most common.  Aquatic plants are important in providing food, cover, and spawning habitat for fish and other aquatic species.  The shallow water substrate is predominately sand and marl.Walleye have been stocked regularly since 1962 and are currently stocked as fingerlings in alternate years at the rate of 1 pound per littoral acre (59lbs.).  Walleye were caught in average numbers in 2004 when compared to similar lakes (3.2/gill net).  Average length and weight were 21.5\" and 3.7 lbs.  The 1996 year class represented 42% of the catch with most of these fish measuring 18.1\" to 24.1\".  Twenty five walleyes were also captured while spring electrofishing for bass.  The average length of these fish was 9.5\" and 80% were from the 2002 year class.  Stocking could account for all but 2 fish.  Growth of all fish was normal and 52% were 12\" or larger.Northern pike were caught in above average numbers when compared to similar lakes (15.0/gill net).  The 2000 and 2001 year classes represented 57% of the catch with most of these fish measuring 14.4\" to 25.7\".  Average length and weight were 20.0\" and 1.7 lbs.  These fish had average growth with only 9% measuring 24\" or larger.Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 129.0/hr.  The average length of these fish was 10.2\" and 21% were 12\" or larger.  Growth was slow.  One smallmouth bass was also captured during spring electrofishing measuring 12.9\".The bluegill catch rate was the highest ever at 67.3/trap net.  Average length of these fish was 5.3\" with only 8% measuring 7\" or larger.  Growth was slow when compared to other Minnesota lakes.Yellow perch were captured in average numbers at 3.0/gill net.  The average length was 6.4\" with none larger than 8\".  The 1998 year class represented 78% of the catch.  Growth was slow.Other fish species captured included black crappie, bowfin (dogfish), green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), white sucker, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye fingerlings are currently stocked into Clear Lake in odd numbered years.  The catch rate was above average in the 2016 survey at 6.8/gill net, however, the majority of the population was dominated by older fish.  This resulted in a large average size (22.3\") with 83% measuring 20\" or larger.  Anglers are reminded that the current statewide regulation only allows one walleye over 20\" in possession.  Some younger fish were sampled indicating recent over-winter survival of stocked fingerlings, a critical bottleneck for walleye populations. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were healthy as well at 8.5/gill net.  Size was a little smaller, with an average length of 21.4\" and 24% of the fish were 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were decent as well, with a spring electrofishing catch rate of 92.0/hr.  Average size was 12.0\" and 52% of the fish were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish were not attention-drawing for anglers.  Bluegill numbers were average for this type of lake (19.4/trap net).  Size was small, with an average length of 5.2\" and only 9% of the fish measuring 7\" or larger.  Only 2 black crappie were captured during the survey. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (cisco) and yellow perch are two important forage species that were caught in this survey.  The tullibee (cisco) catch was normal for this type of lake (6.3/gill net), with an average length of 12.2\".  The presence of tullibee, a sensitive species, in this relatively small lake is indicative of good water quality. The yellow perch catch was low (1.2/gill net), with an average length of 7.4\". <br> \n</p>",
