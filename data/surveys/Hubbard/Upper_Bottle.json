                "narrative": "<p>Upper Bottle Lake is a 465-acre, hard-water lake located about six miles northwest of Nevis, Minnesota.  The shoreline is mainly sand with some clay and gravel present.  It has a maximum depth of 55 feet with a very shallow flat area found on the northeast corner of the lake.Walleye, white sucker, yellow perch, yellow bullhead, rock bass, and pumpkinseed were taken during the test netting in numbers exceeding the statewide median catch per set.  The walleye taken ranged in length from 8.5 to 21 inches, indicating good natural reproduction within this lake.There are three resorts with thirty units and 10 privately owned cabins and homes on this lake.  There are 48 boats located on this lake.There is no public access on this lake at the present time.Fish Stocking:From 1915 to 1945 the Bottle Lakes (Upper and Lower Bottle were considered as a Unit) received bass, walleyes, crappies, sunfish, muskies, and northern pike in various amounts.

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Bottle Lake is located eleven miles northeast of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Upper Bottle has a surface area of 465 acres and a maximum depth of 55 feet.  Upper Bottle is connected to Lower Bottle Lake and there are no barriers to fish or boat traffic.  These lakes are really one body of water and share the same fish populations, but have been treated as separate lakes over the years.  Upper and Lower Bottle Lakes have a combined acreage of 1,117 acres.  There is a public access located on the north shore of Upper Bottle.  Upper Bottle is known for it's walleye fishery, but also provides angling opportunities for northern pike, and black crappie.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Upper Bottle is in lake class 27.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Fish Hook, Garfield, and George.Walleye were sampled in high numbers (19.6 walleye/gillnet), above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and above the management goal of 12.0 walleye/gillnet.  Past surveys have shown Upper Bottle to have an excellent walleye population.  Anglers will find good numbers of walleye in the 14-16 inch range.  Upper Bottle has a plentiful forage base of yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) which are reflected in good walleye growth for this area.  The walleye population in Upper Bottle is maintained through a combination of natural reproduction and fingerling stocking.  Upper Bottle is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Moderate numbers of northern pike (6.6 pike/gillnet) were sampled, similar to past surveys and \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.0 inches and 2.0 pounds.  The number of larger northern pike (> 28.0 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes.  The panfish fishery in Upper Bottle is known mainly for black crappie and is known more for size than numbers.   Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate levels.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed numbers were up with trapnet catch rates within the \"typical\" range for this lake class.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys.  Anglers will find bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-7 inch size range.  Upper Bottle as both a largemouth and smallmouth bass population and is known more for quality than numbers.  Present and past surveys have shown low to moderate largemouth bass and smallmouth bass numbers in Upper Bottle.  Anglers have reported catching some large bass in recent years.  Other species sampled include moderate numbers white sucker, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.  Brown and black bullhead were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Bottle Lake (29-0148-00) is a 459.15-acre lake with a maximum depth of 55 feet located 4 miles north of Dorset, MN.  A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on July 11 - 12, 2018 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, five sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and four sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at one site.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish including three species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Blacknose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Stickleback, Brown Bullhead, Central Mudminnow, Common Shiner,  Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Mimic Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Spottail Shiner, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on August 13, 2018, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Upper Bottle Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Upper Bottle Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Bottle Lake is located eleven miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Upper Bottle has a surface area of 465 acres and a maximum depth of 55 feet.  Upper Bottle is connected to Lower Bottle Lake and there are no barriers to fish or boat traffic.  These lakes are really one body of water and share the same fish populations, but have been treated as separate lakes over the years.  Upper and Lower Bottle Lakes have a combined acreage of 1,117 acres.  There is a public access located on the north shore of Upper Bottle.  Upper Bottle is known for it's walleye fishery, but also provides angling opportunities for northern pike, panfish, and bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Upper Bottle is in lake class 27.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Fish Hook, Garfield, and George. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (12.3 walleye/gillnet) was at the current management goal of 12.0 walleye/gillnet and above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have shown Upper Bottle to have an excellent walleye population.  Anglers will find good numbers of walleye in the 16-18 inch size range.  Upper Bottle has a plentiful forage base of yellow perch and tullibee (cisco), which are reflected in good walleye growth for this area.  The walleye population in Upper Bottle is maintained through a combination of natural reproduction and fingerling stocking.  Upper Bottle is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Northern pike abundance (8.3 pike/gillnet) was up slightly from past surveys, but still within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.3 inches and 2.5 pounds, with pike measured up to 33.3 inches.  The number of larger northern pike (> 28.0 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes.  The panfish fishery in Upper Bottle is known mainly for black crappie and is known more for size than numbers.  Black crappie were sampled in low to moderate numbers, similar to past surveys.  Bluegill abundance (4.8 bluegill/trapnet) was at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Upper Bottle has both a largemouth and smallmouth bass population and is known more for quality than numbers.  Present and past surveys have shown low to moderate largemouth bass and smallmouth bass numbers in Upper Bottle.  Anglers have reported catching some large bass in recent years.  Other species sampled include moderate numbers of white sucker, yellow bullhead, rock bass and low numbers of black bullhead and common shiner. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Bottle Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, five miles north of Dorset.  Upper Bottle is separated by a narrows from Lower Bottle Lake, with both lakes having similar fish communities and are generally managed together.  Upper Bottle has a surface area of 459 acres and a maximum depth of 55 feet.  A state-owned public access is located on the north end of the lake off County Road 24.  Upper Bottle provides multi species opportunities to the angler with good populations of Walleye, Northern Pike, panfish, and bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Upper Bottle is in lake class 27.  Class 27 lakes are generally very large, deep, hard water lakes, with very regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 27 lakes in the Park Rapids management area includes Fishhook, Garfield, and Lake George. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance remained strong in Upper Bottle, with gill net catch rates similar to past surveys.  Sampled Walleye ranged in length 8.1 to 21.6 inches with an average length of 14.0 inches.  Good numbers of smaller Walleye (8 to 14 inches) were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye, were sampled in low numbers.  Yellow Perch were small in size with an average length of 6.5 inches.   <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant Northern Pike population in Upper Bottle.  Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 20.8 inches and 2.2 pounds with fish measured up to 36.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile not known as a bass - panfish lake, Upper Bottle does provide angling opportunities for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass.  Present and past surveys have shown the population of these species to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of Rock Bass, and moderate numbers of White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Golden Shiner.  Brown Bullhead were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nFaucet snails, an aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Upper Bottle.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

The mean weight of walleyes sampled was 1.3 pounds and 42% were more than 15 inches.  Natural reproduction is contributing to the population as 39% of the walleyes sampled were from non stocked year classes.  Northern pike abundance is also comparable to similar lakes in the area.  The northern pike average size sampled during 1993 was 21.7 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Largemouth bass and black crappies have not been sufficiently sampled with standard survey gear to assess their abundance or size structure.  The bluegill trapnet catch indicated a low density population with size structure of a fishable population with 44% of the bluegills sampled more than 6 inches.  Yellow perch are abundant in Upper Bottle and should provide an excellent forage base for northern pike and walleye and also a yellow perch fishery.  Forty-six percent of the yellow perch sampled were over 8 inches.</p>",

Upper Bottle Lake has a surface area of 459 acres and a maximum depth of 55 feet.  A DNR public access is located on the North end of the lake off County Road 24, and is also used to access Lower Bottle Lake that is connected by a channel between the lakes.  Upper Bottle Lake provides multi species opportunities to the angler for Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Upper Bottle Lake is in Lake Class 27.  Class 27 lakes are generally very large, deep, hard water lakes, with very regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 27 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Fishhook, Garfield and George. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate was higher than similar lake class lakes.  Six year classes of Walleye were sampled.  Most ranged from 10 to 19 inches long, but Walleye were sampled up to 21 inches.  Yellow Perch are an important forage species for Walleyes and Northern Pike in Upper Bottle Lake.  They were sampled in very low numbers and were small, with very few perch an acceptable size for angling.  Anglers can expect to find an abundant population of Northern Pike in Upper Bottle Lake. Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 22 inches and 2 pounds, with fish measured up to 37 inches. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Bottle Lake has both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass present.  Largemouth Bass were more abundant than Smallmouth bass, and numbers were in line with past samplings.  The average size was good with Largemouth averaging 14 inches, and Smallmouth averaging 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not known as a panfish lake, Upper Bottle Lake does provide angling opportunities for Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed.  Only one black Crappie was sampled in 2018, but it was over 11 inches in length.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed abundance was on the low end of the range for similar type lakes, with fish ranging from 3-8 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Upper Bottle Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Bottle Lake is located eleven miles northeast of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Upper Bottle has a surface area of 465 acres and a maximum depth of 55 feet.  Upper Bottle is connected to Lower Bottle.  These lakes are really one body of water and share the same fish population, but for some reason have been treated as separate lakes over the years.  If you combine Upper and Lower Bottle they total 1,117 acres.  There is a public access located on the north shore of Upper Bottle.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Upper Bottle is in lake class 27.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Fish Hook, Garfield, and George.  Upper Bottle is known for it's walleye fishery, but also provides fishing for northern pike and black crappie.Walleye were sampled in high numbers (15.8/gillnet), above the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  The walleye catch rate was lower in 1993 (7.9/net), while historical surveys have shown walleye abundance similar to the 1998 survey.  Sampled walleyes had an average length and weight of 14.3 inches and 1.0 pound.  Upper Bottle has a plentiful forage base of yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) which are reflected in good walleye growth rates for this area.  Strong 1994 and 1995 year classes (14 to 17 inches) accounted for half of the walleye sample.  Natural reproduction appears to be contributing significantly to the walleye population as 64% of the sample (54 fish) were from non-stocked years.  Fall electrofishing also documented walleye natural reproduction.  Twenty-one walleye from the 1998 year class were sampled (21 fish/hour).  Upper Bottle was stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd years until 1993, then switched to even years starting in 1996 to correspond with other walleye stockings in this chain of lakes.Northern pike were sampled within the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have shown that northern pike abundance has generally been at the middle to low end of the \"normal range\".  Northern pike were small, averaging 20.1 inches and 1.8 pounds.  The largest northern pike sampled was 24.4 inches.Upper Bottle has both a largemouth bass and smallmouth bass population, but provides more of a quality than quantity bass fishery.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time and the catch rate for largemouth bass was surprisingly low (3.6 bass/hour).The panfish fishery in Upper Bottle is limited mainly to black crappie.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Like bass, the black crappie fishery is known more for size than numbers.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed abundance was low.  Average size of bluegill was poor (5.0 inches), however, a 10.0 inch bluegill was sampled.  Rock bass are abundant.  The yellow perch population in Upper Bottle not only provides an important forage base for the walleye and northern pike population, but are of an acceptable size to provide a limited fishery.Other species sampled include tullibee (cisco), common shiner, and white sucker.  An abundant white sucker population is found in Upper Bottle.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Upper Bottle and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Bottle Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, 5 miles north of Dorset. Lower Bottle is separated by a narrows from Upper Bottle, but both lakes have a similar fish community and are generally managed together.  Upper Bottle has a surface area of 459 acres and a maximum depth of 55 feet. A DNR public access is located on the North end of the lake off County Road 24. Upper Bottle provides multi species opportunities to the angler, with good populations of walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, bass and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Upper Bottle is in Lake Class 27. Class 27 lakes are generally very large, deep, hard water lakes, with very regularly shaped shoreline. Other class 27 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Fishhook, Garfield, George and Plantagenet. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was the highest ever recorded, and well above management goals. Multiple year classes of walleye were sampled with most walleye in the 12 to 17 inch range. Upper Bottle is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Yellow perch are an important forage species for walleyes and northern pike in Upper Bottle.  They were sampled in good numbers but were small in size, with very few perch of acceptable size for angling.  Anglers can expect to find an abundant population of northern pike in Upper Bottle. Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.4 inches and 2.7 pounds, with pike measured up to 35.5 inches.  While not known as a panfish lake, Upper Bottle does provide angling opportunities for black crappie, bluegill and pumpkinseed. Anglers can expect to find a fair number of black crappie around 10 inches in length. Bluegill and pumpkinseed abundance was on the low end of the range for similar type lakes, fish were sampled up to 8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Upper Bottle. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",
