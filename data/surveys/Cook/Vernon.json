                "narrative": "<p>The 1998 assessment used a combination of deep and shallow gill net sets.  By themselves, neither would be comparable to historic catches in this lake, or to catches in other lakes in this class; however, the combined catch in deep and shallow nets is comparible.  The catch in six gill net sets (deep and shallow combined) in 1998 was:Lake trout   0.33 fish/net  mean weight 0.58 lbLake whitefish   11.00 fish/net  mean weight 0.95 lbNorthern pike   1.50 fish/net   mean weight 1.44 lbSmallmouth bass   0.83 fish/net  mean weight 1.43 lbWalleye   0.17 fish/net  mean weight 3.08 lbWhite sucker   0.33 fish/net  mean weight 2.11 lbCompared to lakes in this class (Class 3), combined catches for lake trout, walleye, and white sucker were lower than normal.  Only one walleye was collected, an 8-year-old, 20 inch fish.  Walleye catches in this lake have never been high, but the 1998 catch was the lowest observed to date.The presence of lake trout meant that the attempt to reintroduce lake trout by stocking in the 1990's had met with at least some success, although survival of stocked fish appeared to have been low.  The two lake trout collected were both from the 1995 yearling stocking, and were about 12 inches in length.  Lake trout growth was slow, probably due to intense competition for invertebrate forage from the dense lake whitefish population.Combined catches for lake whitefish, northern pike, and smallmouth bass were within normal ranges for lakes of this class.  All the northern pike collected were less than 23 inches in length, while all the smallmouth bass collected were 12 inches or longer.</p>",
