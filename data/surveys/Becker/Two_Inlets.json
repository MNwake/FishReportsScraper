                "narrative": "<p>Boot Lake is located in northeastern Becker County, six miles northwest of the town of Two Inlets.  Boot Lake is a narrow, deep-water lake with a surface area of 348 acres and a maximum depth of 109 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the north shore of the lake.  Boot Lake is best known for its walleye population, but it also provides angling for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Boot Lake is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Big Bass, Benedict, Blue, East Crooked, Spearhead, and Tripp. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2006 was the highest recorded for all surveys on Boot Lake and above the current management goal.  Walleye abundance in recent surveys has generally fluctuated around the management goal.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 16.3 inches and 1.7 pounds with fish measured up to 27.0 inches.  Boot Lake is currently involved in a research study to evaluate various sizes and rates of walleye stocking.  Future walleye stocking in Boot Lake will be based on recommendations from this research project. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled at their highest abundance, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Perch abundance in past surveys has been at low levels, generally below or the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Higher perch abundance in 2006 may be responsible for better survival and higher abundance of walleye.  Yellow perch are generally not an acceptable size for angling in Boot. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, and similar to past surveys.  Small, \"hammer handle\" pike with an average length and weight of 18.0 inches and 1.3 pounds dominated the northern pike sample.  The northern pike population in Boot Lake is limited by high reproduction and recruitment of young pike and very slow growth rates.  Past surveys have sampled very few larger pike, and reports from anglers have been limited. <br> \n <br> \nBoot Lake is not really known as a bass - panfish lake because of its limited shallow water habitat and productivity.  However, Boot does support moderate numbers of bluegill and largemouth bass, and low numbers of black crappie.  Sampled bluegills were small in size, with an average length of 4.5 inches and low numbers of fish sampled over 7.0 inches.  Bluegill growth rates are very slow in Boot Lake.  Black Crappie were not sampled in 2006, but have been sampled in past surveys in low to moderate numbers.  Past surveys have shown the black crappie to be an acceptable size for angling.  Largemouth bass have been sampled in low to moderate numbers in surveys on Boot. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included abundant numbers of yellow bullhead and moderate numbers of rock bass.  White sucker and hybrid sunfish were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Boot Lake was conducted on June 28-30, 2021, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured nine species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number and biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Boot Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boot Lake is located in northeastern Becker County, six miles northwest of the town of Two Inlets.  Boot Lake is a narrow, deep-water lake with a surface area of 378 acres and a maximum depth of 109 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the north shore.  Boot Lake is best known for its walleye population, but it also provides angling for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Boot Lake is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Big Bass, Benedict, Blue, East Crooked, Spearhead, and Tripp. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (5.2 walleye/gillnet) was at the current management goal of 5.0 walleye/gillnet.  Past surveys have also shown good walleye numbers, with gillnet catch rates at or above the current management goal.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 18.7 inches and 2.5 pounds, with fish measured up to 24.9 inches.  Boot Lake is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in low numbers (1.7 perch/gillnet).  Yellow perch abundance in past surveys have fluctuated from low to moderate numbers.  Yellow perch are generally not an acceptable size for angling in Boot. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (9.2 pike/gillnet) was up slightly from past surveys, just above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike numbers in past surveys has been stable, with gillnet catch rates within the \"typical\" range.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 18.1 inches and 1.4 pounds, with fish measured up to 35.2 inches.  The number of larger northern pike (> 28.0 inches) sampled was low when compared to other area lakes.  The northern pike population in Boot Lake is limited by high reproduction and recruitment of young pike and slow growth rates. <br> \n <br> \nBoot Lake is not really known as a bass-panfish lake because of its limited shallow water habitat and productivity.  However, Boot does support moderate numbers of bluegill, pumpkinseed, and largemouth bass, and low numbers of black crappie.  Present and past surveys have shown the bluegill population in Boot to be dominated by small fish, with few bluegills over 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegill growth rates are very slow in Boot Lake.  Black crappie were not sampled in 2011, but have been sampled in past surveys in low to moderate numbers.  Past surveys have shown the black crappie to be an acceptable size for angling.  Boot Lake supports a low to moderate largemouth bass population when compared to other area lakes.  Largemouth bass up to 19.0 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead, and moderate numbers of rock bass and hybrid sunfish.  White sucker and brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boot Lake (03-0030-00) is a 385-acre lake with a maximum depth of 109 feet located northwest of Two Inlets, MN.  A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on 12 July 2017 to assess populations of non-game species and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, four sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and five sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at one site. Backpack electrofishing was done at all ten sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured several species of fish including five species intolerant of disturbance such as Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Least Darter, and Mimic Shiner. Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Common Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid sunfish, Iowa Darter, Largemouth Bass, Northern Redbelly Dace, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a survey on 15 August 2017, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Boot Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. Boot Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boot Lake is located northwest of Two Inlets, MN in eastern Becker County. Boot has a surface area of 385 acres and a maximum depth of 109 feet. A Department of Natural Resources (DNR) owned public access is located on the northwest shore of the lake. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Boot Lake is in lake class 23. Class 23 lakes generally are very deep, with low littoral area, and very clear but hard water. Other class 23 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Big Bass, Benedict, Blue, East Crooked, Spearhead, and Tripp. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has varied through the years, but has generally been at the high end of other class 23 lakes. Many Walleyes are a great size for anglers of 14-21 inches, with some smaller fish for the future. The average length was 17.5 inches, with the largest sampled at 26 inches. Yellow Perch are important forage for Walleye and Northern Pike, and their abundance was low compared to other class 23 lakes. Perch had an average size of 6.5 inches and were sampled up to 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was average compared to class 23 lakes, and similar to past surveys on Boot. Pike ranged from 8 inches to 34 inches in length, with an average size of 18 inches and 1.5 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nAngling opportunities for panfish include Black Crappie and Bluegill. Black Crappie are not sampled well in nets on Boot Lake. Bluegills abundance was similar to recent years, with fish ranging from 3-8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance was similar to past surveys, and to other lake class 23 lakes.  Fish ranged from 5 to 18 inches, with an average size of 11 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Boot Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

Largemouth bass and bluegill was high, but fish were small.  Rough fish no problem at this time.  Walleye aging shows a perfect match between year classes present and years stocked.Management Recommendations:Spawning habitat for walleye and northern pike is poor to fair.Management recommendations are to stock in alternate years with the above predator species.  Walleye fingerlings to be stocked at the rate of 1.5 pounds per littoral acre, fish to be 50 per pound or larger.  Northern pike from rescue operations, at the rate of 2.0 pounds per littoral acre, fish should be 5 fish per pound or larger.Walleye fingerlings were stocked in the fall of 1981.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boot Lake is located in northeastern Becker County, six miles northwest of Two Inlets.  Boot Lake is a narrow, deep-water lake with a surface area of 378 acres and a maximum depth of 109 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the north shore of the lake.  Boot Lake is best known for its Walleye population, but also provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Boot Lake is in lake class 23.  Class 23 lakes are generally deep, very clear, have hard water and are irregularly shaped.  Other class 23 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include Benedict, Big Bass, Blue, East Crooked, Eleventh Crow Wing, and Spearhead. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in Boot has remained stable the past several surveys with catch rates at the high end for this lake class.  Walleye sampled had an average length of 16.8 inches, weighed 1.8 pounds, and measured up to 25.2 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage for Walleye were small in size and sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in high numbers for this lake class.  Northern Pike abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from moderate to high numbers.  Anglers will find the Northern Pike population dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike averaging 18.3 inches in length and 1.3 pounds.  The Northern Pike population in Boot is limited by high reproduction and recruitment of young pike and slow growth rates.  Past surveys have sampled very few larger Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nBoot Lake is not really known as a Bass - Panfish lake because of its limited shallow water habitat and productivity.   However, Boot Lake supports moderate numbers of Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Largemouth Bass, and low numbers of Black Crappie.  Bluegill sampled were small in size, with an average length of 5.2 inches and very few over 7.0 inches.  Bluegill growth rates are slow in Boot Lake.  Past and present surveys have shown the Black Crappie population to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers.   Largemouth Bass have been sampled in low to moderate numbers in past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Boot Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boot Lake is located six miles northwest of the town of Two Inlets in northeastern Becker County.  Boot Lake has a surface area of 348 acres and a maximum depth of 109 feet.  The public access is located on the north end of the lake and is owned and maintained by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR).  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Boot Lake is    in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Bass (3 miles northeast of Akeley), Benedict (1.5 miles southwest of Benedict), Blue (7 miles north of Park Rapids), East Crooked (5 miles north of Nevis), Spearhead (6 miles east of Becida), and Tripp (11 miles southeast of Nevis).     The walleye gillnet catch of 6.9/net is above the range typically found for lake class 23 (1.0/net - 5.0/net).  Previous surveys in 1981, 1986, and 1991 had similar walleye gillnet catches, while catches were lower in 1951 (0.3/net) and 1974 (2.8/net).  Sampled walleye were in excellent condition and large in size, with a average length and weight of 18.4 inches and 2.8 lbs.  Walleye up to 27.8 inches were measured, with 44% of the sample 20.0 inches or larger.  Walleye growth rates were similar to other class 23 lakes.  Recruitment of walleye through natural reproduction is sporadic, with only three of the fifty-five walleyes aged coming from years of no walleye stocking.  Boot Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even calendar years.  Tullibee (TLC) have not been sampled in standard survey sets, but have been reported in the stomachs of walleye sampled in past surveys.    Tullibee provide and excellent forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations.The northern pike gillnet catch of 8.3/net is within the range typically found in lake class 23 (2.2/net - 8.7/net).  The two previous surveys in 1991 and 1986 had similar gillnet catches, while historical catches were lower, ranging from 2.8/met (1974) to 3.8/net (1981).  Average size of the northern pike sample was small, 19.5 inches and 1.8 lbs, however, pike up to 29.8 inches were sampled.  Northern pike growth rates were slow and below   the average lengths of other class 23 lakes.     Bluegill abundance was high (40.7/trapnet), but within the range typical for this lake class 97.7/net - 43.4/net).  Historical trapnet catches have ranged from 12.7/net (1986) to 50.6/net (1981).  Bluegill were small is size, with an average length of 5.2 inches and with the largest fish measuring 7.0 inches.  Bluegill growth rates were similar to other class 23 lakes.     Black crappie were sampled at 0.8/gillnet and 0.2/trapnet, similar to past surveys.  Black crappie up to 11.9 inches were sampled.  Black crappie abundance and size distribution might better be assessed by conducting trapnetting during the spring time.     Sixteen largemouth bass were sampled using standard survey gear.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 5.7 to 14.6 inches. Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective methods to assess largemouth bass abundance or size distribution.  To adequately assess a largemouth bass population special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted on Boot Lake.  Boot Lake has good water quality and aquatic vegetation that will insure a healthy largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass growth rates were similar to other class 23 lakes.     Yellow perch abundance was low (0.6/gillnet), and below the range typical for lake class 23 (1.5/net - 13.8/net).  Historical yellow perch gillnet catches have been similar.  Yellow perch are primarily a forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations and are not of an acceptable size to provide a fishery for the angler.     Both yellow and brown bullhead were sampled, with yellow bullhead being the more abundant of the two species.  Historical catches have been similar for both species.     Pumpkinseed, rock bass, and hybrid sunfish were sampled in numbers similar to past surveys.  Pumpkinseed were small in size, with a mean length of 5.2 inches, however, fish up to 7.6 inches were sampled.  One green sunfish was sampled.     White sucker were sampled in low numbers (0.3/gillnet), below the range typical for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but to release medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Boot Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Numbers of walleye sampled (4.00/gillnet) fell within the normal range, while 13.86 lbs/gillnet was above the third quartile for Lake Class 25 of the Schupp Classification System.  These numbers result in a high mean weight of 3.47 lbs.  These catch rates show a decrease from 1981 and 1986, when both numbers and pounds sampled were above the third quartile.  The present PSD (100), RSD-P (78), RSD-M (6) and RSD-T (6) indicate an unbalanced size structure.  Of the 20 walleye sampled, only two were less than 15 inches (quality length) and one greater than 25 inches (memorable length).  Walleye growth rates are good, averaging 13.67 inches at age 4, but growth is variable among year classes.  This variability may be the result of stocking different sizes of fingerlings as a complement to natural recruits.  Walleye stocking success in Boot Lake has been inconsistent, but walleye in the lake are capable of natural reproduction, as evidenced by the 1985 and 1987 year classes.Catch rates of northern pike (7.80 fish/gillnet and 9.92 lbs/gillnet) were within the normal ranges for lakes of this classification.  Mean weight of northern pike sampled was 1.27 lbs.  Northern pike abundance has been increasing since 1951, despite ending the stocking program in 1985.  Northern pike exhibit slow growth, averaging 16.77 inches at age 4.  This slow growth results in a very small size structure for the northern pike (PSD=19).  Yearling northern pike were stocked until 1985, however, natural reproduction in maintaining the population, as recruitment was strong for all year classes sampled in 1991.Bluegill and pumpkinseed catch rates were within the normal ranges in 1991 and have been since the initial survey in 1951.  Growth rates of both bluegill and pumpkinseed are slow.  Average length at age 3 for bluegill is 2.68 inches and for pumpkinseed is 2.75 inches.  The slow growth results in small size structures for both populations (bluegill PSD=26, pumpkinseed PSD=33).  Catch rates of largemouth bass were above the third quartile in 1991 and have fluctuated little since 1951.  The size distribution of largemouth bass sampled in the trapnets was good, with fish ranging from 6.5 to 16.9 inches long.  Like the other panfish, largemouth bass exhibit slow growth, averaging 6.68 inches at age 3.  Yellow perch catch rates fell below the first quartile in 1991 for the first time since 1951.  No black crappie were sampled, but they have been present in low densities in the past and are reported in anglers catch.White sucker have been sampled in small quantities since 1951 and catches were below the first quartile in 1991.  The number of rock bass sampled was slightly above the third quartile, increasing from a low year in 1986.  Yellow bullhead and brown bullhead catch rates have generally remained within the normal ranges for lakes of this class since 1951.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boot Lake is located in northeastern Becker County, six miles northwest of the town of Two Inlets.  Boot Lake is a narrow, deep lake with a surface area of 348 acres and a maximum depth of 109 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the north shore of the lake.  Boot Lake is best known for it's walleye population, but also provides angling for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Boot Lake is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Bass, Benedict, Blue, East Crooked, Spearhead, and Tripp.Walleye abundance (4.1 walleye/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and near the current management goal of 5.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has been slightly higher, fluctuating from within to just above the \"typical\" range.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 17.3 inches and 2.1 pounds.  A successful DNR stocking program is maintaining the walleye population in Boot Lake as age analysis showed minimal contribution from natural reproduction.  Boot Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd years.  The walleye forage base is a concern in Boot Lake as the abundance of yellow perch (0.3 yellow perch/gillnet) was very low.  Yellow perch are an important forage species for walleye, and there numbers in Boot Lake have been declining since the 1991 survey.  A tullibee (cisco) population is also present in Boot Lake and provide an important forage base for large walleye and northern pike.Northern pike numbers were up, with the gillnet catch rate of 9.3 pike/gillnet above the \"typical\" range for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance has been increasing in Boot Lake, with earlier surveys at the low end of the \"typical\" range and recent surveys at the upper end of the range.  The northern pike sample was dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike with an average length and weight of 18.6 inches and 1.4 pounds.  The northern pike population in Boot Lake is limited by high reproduction and recruitment of young pike and very slow growth rates.  Boot Lake with it's deep water and tullibee (cisco) forage base would seem to have the potential of producing large northern pike, however, past surveys have sampled very few large pike and reports from anglers have been limited.Not really known as bass - panfish lake, Boot Lake does support moderate numbers of bluegill and largemouth bass and low numbers of black crappie.  Bluegill were small in size with an average length of 4.7 inches and with low numbers of fish sampled over 6.0 inches.  Bluegill growth rates are very slow in Boot Lake.  Black crappie are more of an acceptable size for angling with fish sampled up to 10.6 inches.  Moderate numbers of largemouth bass were sampled with bass measured up to 19.4 inches.  Largemouth bass are slow growing in Boot Lake.Other species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead and moderate numbers of rock bass and hybrid sunfish.  White sucker and green sunfish were sampled in low numbers.</p>",
