                "narrative": "<p>Results of the 1995 Lower Comstock Lake population assessment indicate a system most suited to northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie and bluegill.  Abundance indices for northern pike and bluegill were within accepted ranges compared to lakes of similar type.  Black crappie abundance was slightly below accepted ranges.  Largemouth bass were well represented in shoreline seining samples, but abundance of adult bass was not obtained due to lack of proper sampling equipment.  Quality of size structure for black crappie and bluegill was good with 100% of sampled crappie longer than 8 inches and 67% of sampled bluegill longer than 6 inches.  Twenty three percent of the sampled northern pike were longer than 21 inches.     Stocking of walleye fry in Lower Comstock Lake appears to have been moderately successful in establishing an incidental fishery.  Walleye abundance indices were at the low end of the range when compared to lakes of similar type.  Four of the six aged walleye correlated to years of fry stocking.  Quality of walleye size structure was good, with 88% longer than 15 inches.     Other fish species documented in Lower Comstock Lake include yellow perch, white sucker, shorthead redhorse, pumpkinseed sunfish and common and spottail shiner.  Yellow perch abundance was within the accepted range for this type of lake, but had poor size structure and very slow growth.  White sucker were common and quite large, while shorthead redhorse were low in abundance but also quite large.  Pumpkinseed sunfish, which were recorded from trapnet samples, were found exclusively in the Lower Comstock basin of the system.</p>",

The 1955 survey combined Upper and Lower Comstock and is probably a true indicator of Lower Comstock walleye abundance that year.  Year class analysis indicates walleye stocking in Upper Comstock is almost the sole source of fish for Lower Comstock.  Like Upper Comstock, yellow perch increased (8.8 per gillnet lift) and no individuals smaller than 5 inches were taken.  Northern pike catch rate was 5.0 per gillnet lift.  One 38-inch individual was seen.  White sucker were collected at 3.0 per gillnet lift, a catch rate similar to previous years.  Bluegill expanded by 1977, and the 1989 catch rate of 7.25 per trapnet lift is unchanged.  Pumpkinseed and black crappie had expanded by 1989 when 5.0 and 4.5 respectively were taken per trapnet lift.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Results of the 2000 Lower Comstock Lake survey indicate a system most suited to northern pike, black crappie and bluegill.  Abundance indices for northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill were within or above accepted ranges compared to lakes of similar type.  Largemouth bass were well represented in shoreline seining samples, but abundance of adult bass was not obtained due to scheduling conflicts.  Quality of size structure for black crappie and bluegill was fair to good with 53% of sampled crappie longer than 8 inches and 47% of sampled bluegill longer than 6 inches.  Twenty percent of the sampled northern pike were longer than 21 inches.  Stocking of walleye fry in Lower Comstock Lake appears to have been moderately successful in establishing an incidental fishery.  Walleye abundance indices were at the low end of the range when compared to lakes of similar type but have increased slightly since the last assessment (1995).  Only five of the 14 aged walleye correlated to years of fry stocking.  Quality of walleye size structure was good, with 71% longer than 15 inches.      Other fish species documented in Lower Comstock Lake include yellow perch, white sucker, shorthead redhorse and pumpkinseed sunfish.  Yellow perch abundance was within the accepted range for this type of lake, but had poor size structure.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were found in both basins (Upper and Lower Comstock Lakes) for the first time during the 2000 investigations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Comstock is a 160 acre lake located about 6 miles south of Markham, MN. The lake is accessed through a DNR administered public access on Upper Comstock Lake, then navigating up the channel to Lower Comstock Lake.  Maximum depth is 30 feet, with about 76% of the lake less than 15 feet deep.  Lower Comstock was last assessed in 2000.  Lower Comstock was surveyed during the summer of 2018 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nLower Comstock is stocked with 121,000 Walleye fry every even year.  Walleye abundance of 2.5 per gillnet lift is average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length was large at 18.0 inches.  Ninety percent of the Walleye aged corresponded to stocked year-classes suggesting limited natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill population densities were average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Black Crappie average length was 7.0 inches, but angling success and size should improve in 2019 and beyond with strong 2015 and 2016 year-classes maturing.  Quality Bluegill angling opportunities exist with nearly 25% of the trapnet sample exceeding 8 inches in length.  Bluegill average length was 6.6 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 4.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length from the gillnets was only 19.7 inches, but some large Northern Pike are present in Lower Comstock.  The trapnets captured two large specimens that approached 40 inches in length.</p>",
