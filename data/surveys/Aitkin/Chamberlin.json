                "narrative": "<p>Chamberlin Lake is a very small two-basin lake surrounded by a spruce and alder bog.  There is only one home and no public access on the lake.  There are heavy mats of muskgrass or Chara spp., which probably thrive due to the hardness of the water.  This dense algal growth impedes boat travel, particularly between the channels.  The northern pike population size structure may be changing.  The average weight of northern pike caught in the assessment gill nets has decreased from 3.1 pounds in 1984 to 1.9 in 1999, while relative abundance has increased from 4 to 9.5 fish per net over the same time period.  The 1999 catch rate is still within the normal range for this type of lake.  It is not uncommon to observe a shift from a population of balanced-sized northern pike with lower abundance to a high abundance of only smaller pike where selective taking of larger northern pike has been a factor.  This change in size structure may also be the result of variable year-class strength of northern pike.  Also observed in the 1999 netting were bluegill and largemouth bass.  Two and three-year-old fish made up the bluegill catch, which was at a lower than average level.  One two-year-old and two yearling largemouth bass were caught giving an abundance index in the normal range for this type of lake and also marked the first assessment that largemouth bass were caught.  The presence of largemouth bass and bluegill may be the result of an angler introduction.  The yellow perch abundance has declined from around 5 fish per gill net lift to a below normal level of 2 fish per net.  Declining numbers may be in response to increasing northern pike abundance.</p>",
