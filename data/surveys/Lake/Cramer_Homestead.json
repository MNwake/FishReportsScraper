Yellow perch were sampled in fairly high numbers and averaged about 6.5 inches; however, several fish over 10 inches were sampled with fish up to 12.2 inches observed.  Brook trout were air stocked into this lake in 2002; however, it appears that this stocking was not successful as none were taken in the assessment.  There is no developed public access to this lake; however, the lake can be accessed from Lake Twenty Three via a connecting channel then across public land.  There is no marked trail.</p>",

It is probable that a variety of minnow species also inhabit the lake.     The lake has poor access, and management is not justified at present. With the poor temperature/oxygen conditions for trout, and migration of roughfish from the inlet and outlet preclude reclamation.</p>",
