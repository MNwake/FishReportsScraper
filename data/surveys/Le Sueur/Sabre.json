                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nSabre Lake is a 263 acre lake located in Le Sueur County west of the town of Kilkenny. A public access is located on the north side of the lake off Le Sueur County road 2. Sabre Lake has a maximum depth of 13.0 feet. Based on limnological variables and lake characteristics, Sabre Lake is placed in Lake Class 43. Other area lakes with this classification include Cody Lake (Rice County), Ida Lake (Blue Earth County), and Loon Lake (Waseca County). Sabre Lake is managed primarily for walleye and is stocked with walleye fry three out of every four years at a target rate of 1,500 fry per littoral acre. A contingency stocking plan calls for adult northern pike, yellow perch, black crappie, and bluegill to be stocked after winterkill events. Sabre Lake was surveyed the week of June 17, 2014 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying gill nets and trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nWalleye catch rates in Sabre Lake have remained relatively stable throughout the survey history, averaging 3.3 fish/gill net. The 2014 survey yielded 3.5 fish/gill net, which is an improvement from 2009 when walleye abundance was at a record low of 1.3 fish/net. However, walleye were small, ranging from 7.4 to 18.8 inches and averaging 9.4 inches. The population was comprised of young individuals , as twenty of the twenty-one walleye collected were determined to be age-1. This strong year class is the result of a stocking event in 2013, when nearly 400,000 walleye fry were stocked. Walleye fry were stocked in 2012, 2013, and 2014 at a target rate of 1,500 fry per littoral acre. Since walleye are stocked three out of every four years, fry stocking will not occur again until 2016. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nYellow perch was the most abundant fish species in the 2014 survey at Sabre Lake. The gill net catch rate was 10.5 fish/net, which is above the long-term average (5.1 fish/net). Yellow perch lengths ranged from 4.9 to 10.8 inches and averaged 6.4 inches, indicating a relatively small size structure.  The yellow perch population is sustained through natural recruitment and is an important prey source for predators in Sabre Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has remained variable throughout the survey years, ranging from 1.0 fish/net in 1986, 1989, and 1994 to 6.7 fish/net in 2009. The 2014 catch rate was 2.2, which was right below the long-term lake average of 2.5 fish/net. With lengths ranging from 12.1 to 29.3 inches and averaging 22.3 inches, northern pike size structure is small. Compared to other similar lakes in southern Minnesota, northern pike in Sabre Lake had relatively slow growth rates. Since northern pike are only stocked following severe winterkill events, no stocking has taken place in recent history. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nHistoric black crappie catch rates in Sabre Lake have been variable, ranging from zero fish in 2009 to 9.2 fish/net in 1999. The 2014 catch rate was 2.3 fish/net, which is right below the long-term average of 2.7 fish/net. Black crappie lengths ranged from 3.9 to 10.1 inches and averaged 5.7 inches, indicating a small size structure in Sabre Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nBluegill abundance has been low throughout the survey history of Sabre Lake. The 2014 catch rate was 4.7 fish/net, which was just above the long-term lake average of 4.6 fish/net. The lengths of bluegill ranged from 3.0 to 8.8 inches and averaged 7.4 inches, indicating a good size structure of bluegill. Although bluegill size structure is favorable in Sabre Lake, overall abundance appears to be low compared to other lakes in the Cannon River chain.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead <br> \nBlack bullhead catch rates have steadily decreased since the peak in 1968 (186.0 fish/net). The 2014 catch rate was only 1.3 fish/net, which is well below the long-term average of 55.1 fish/net. Black bullhead from gill and trap nets ranged in length from 9.1 to 15.0 inches and averaged 11.6, indicating a good size structure. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nOther fish species sampled from the 2014 survey included freshwater drum (N = 53), white sucker (N = 20), common carp (N = 21), bowfin (N = 12), channel catfish (N = 6), yellow bullhead (N = 4), and bigmouth buffalo (N = 3). <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sabre Lake in Le Sueur County is a 263 acre lake located west of the city of Kilkenny. A public access is located on the north side of the lake, next to the Cannon River inlet. The turn to the public access is located off Dodd Road/Le Sueur County Road 2/440th Street.  <br> \n <br> \nSabre Lake was surveyed the week of June 15th, 2009 to monitor the fish community. Northern pike were the most abundant fish in the gill net catches at 6.7 fish per lift. Average northern pike weight was 3.6 pounds and average pike length was 24 inches. Pike ranged between 15 and 35 inches. Northern pike abundance has picked up since 2004 test netting, when pike averaged 2.2 fish per gill net. Pike have many prey options in Sabre Lake, including an abundance of white sucker (4.5 per gill net lift), yellow perch (4.7 per gill net lift), or young freshwater drum (sheepshead). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye continue a low level of abundance in Sabre Lake. Walleye averaged 1.3 fish per lift. Better angling options for walleye exist in the area, as well as within the Cannon River chain of lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills also hold a low level of abundance in Sabre Lake. Bluegill averaged 2.5 fish per trap net. A few large individuals are scattered throughout the lake; one bluegill measured 9.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \n No crappies were caught in the assessment. Crappie abundance has historically been low on this lake, but large (greater than 10 inches) individuals have been captured during netting assessments in the past thirty years. <br> \n <br> \nSeven channel catfish were caught during the assessment. Size was large; channel catfish ranged between 26 and 32 inches with an average of 28 inches, a memorable fish by length-based stock indices. Channel catfish occur throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass averaged 5.2 fish per gill net lift. White bass averaged 14 inches in length but fish up to 16 inches were netted. White Bass are found throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes but their abundance can fluctuate wildly due to inconsistent recruitment.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch fit into the interquartile range for lakes within Sabre's classification (class 43). Perch averaged 4.7 fish per gill net lift. Average length was 8.2 inches and ranged from 6.2 to 9.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nMost of the total fish numbers and biomass netted in 2009 consisted of nongame underutilized species, including black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, freshwater drum (sheepshead), highfin carpsucker, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. Many of these fish are well adapted to riverine environments, so a river-influenced lake like Sabre is a good fit for these species. This lake may be a good destination for \"rough fish\" niche anglers or, given its clear water, bowfishermen. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Sabre Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sabre Lake and its fish populations are strongly influenced by the Cannon River, which acts both as its major inlet and outlet.Black crappies have increased from 2.00/trap net in 1981 to 9.50/trp net in 1986.  Sabre has a low black crappie population compared to other similar lakes; the area median is 15.00/trap net.  A good distribution of black crappies is present and made up of I-VI year classes.White crappies were sampled in low numbers averaging 0.75/trap net, compared to none sampled in the 1981 assessment.Bluegills have increased from 1.75/trap net in 1981 to 10.00/trap net in 1986.  Three age classes, III, IV, and V, are present with III and IV age classes showing the most strength.  The bluegill population in 1981 was represented by smaller II age class fish.White bass were not sampled in 1981 but now average 1.33/gill net.  The white bass are represented by I age class fish.Northern pike have shown a large decline since the 1981 netting, now averaging 1.00/gill net, compared to 4.75/gill net in 1981.  Northerns are represented by II, III, and IV age class fish, with II age class fish showing the most strength.  The northern pike sampled in 1981 had a dominant II age class with fewer I, III, and V age classes.A moderate walleye population is present averaging 2.33/gill net, compared to 3.50/gill net sampled in 1981.  The present walleye population is fairly evenly distributed with 13.00-23.9 inch fish, with II-VIII+ age classes represented.Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers averaging 2.33/gill net, compared to the area median of 8.83/gill net.Black bullheads have declined significantly from 205.50/trap net in 1981 to 67.83/gill net in 1986.  Black bullheads are of average size and acceptable to local and non-resident anglers.Other species present in relatively low numbers include freshwater drum, carp, white sucker, and bigmouth buffalo.</p>",

Black crappie are represented by good numbers of 3 and 4 year olds and fewer one year olds.White crappie increased from 0.75/trap net in 1986 to 12.75/trap net.  White crappie were represented by abundant 2 and 3 age classes with fewer 7 year olds.Bluegill abundance remain unchanged, averaging 10.25/trap net compared to 10.00/trap net in 1986.  Bluegills are represented by ages 1-4 compared to the 3-5 year olds sampled in 1986.White bass were sampled in low numbers, averaging 3.75/trap net compared to 0.25/trap net sampled in 1986.  White bass are represented by large fish, 10.5-13.9 inches.Northern pike remain unchanged in low abundance, 1.00/gill net.  Northern pike are represented by 1-4 year olds with 3 year olds most abundant.Walleye catch rates increased from 2.33/gill net in 1986 to 5.17/gill net.  Walleye are well distributed with 1 and 3-8 age classes sampled.  Walleye sampled may be from natural reproduction along with migration from Tetonka Lake.  Walleye fry were stocked in 1979, 1988, and yearlings in 1981.Yellow perch remain in low abundance, averaging 1.83/gill net compared to 2.33/gill net in 1986.Black bullhead catch rates decreased from 67.83/gill net in 1986 to 25.50/gill net.  Black bullheads are evenly distributed from 3.0-11.0 inches.Freshwater drum were sampled in moderate numbers, averaging 5.17/gill net compared to 1.83/gill net sampled in 1986.Other species present in relatively low numbers include white sucker, carp, bowfin, quillback, yellow bullhead, and largemouth bass.</p>",

A fishery survey was conducted on Sabre Lake in 2004 to assess the fish community and aquatic habitat.  Walleye catch per gill net has been consistent at a moderately low level over the past several surveys.  Most walleye were 12 to 19 inches long.  Most of the walleye were age 3, from the 2001 year class when walleye were not stocked in the Cannon River chain of lakes.  Black bullhead were the most abundant species in both the gill net and trap net catches.  The black bullhead caught in 2004 were relatively large with fish between 8 and 11 inches long.  Northern pike, while present in moderate numbers, were fairly large with most fish between 20 and 33 inches long.  Panfish abundance were at moderate levels.  Most yellow perch were around 9 inches.  Black crappie were mainly 6 to 9 inches long, while most bluegill were small at around 4 inches with a few up to nearly 8 inches.  Some channel catfish are present with the largest up to 26 inches.  A gravel boat launch is located on the north side of the lake adjacent to where the Cannon River flows into Sabre Lake.  This launch may be rather shallow during times of low water.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sabre Lake is a 263-acre lake located in Le Sueur County west of the town of Kilkenny. A public access is located on the north side of the lake off Le Sueur County Road 2. Sabre Lake has a maximum depth of 13 feet. Sabre Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and is stocked with Walleye fry each year at a rate of 500 per littoral acre as part of a Walleye strain evaluation study. A contingency stocking plan calls for Northern Pike adults (200 pounds), Yellow Perch adults (100 pounds), Black Crappie adults (258 pounds), and Bluegill adults (258 pounds) to be stocked after winterkill events.  <br> \n <br> \nSabre Lake was surveyed the week of 17 June 2021 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying six gill nets and nine trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in Sabre Lake have remained relatively stable throughout the survey history, averaging 3.7 fish/gill net. The 2021 survey yielded 6.7 fish/gill net, which was a historic high for Walleye catch rate in Sabre Lake. Walleye were moderate sized, ranging from 10.4 to 25.6 inches and averaging 16.4 inches. Forty of the 47 Walleye aged were determined to be 2 or 3 years of age. These strong year classes were the result of stocking events in 2018 and 2019.  <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-two Yellow Perch were sampled in the 2021 survey at Sabre Lake. The gill net catch rate was 3.1 fish/net which was below the long-term average of 4.9 fish/net. Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 6.9 to 10.8 inches and averaged 9.3 inches. The Yellow Perch population was sustained through natural recruitment and is likely an important food for predators in Sabre Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has varied throughout the survey years, ranging from 1.0 fish/net in 1986, 1989, and 1994 to 6.7 fish/net in 2009. The 2021 Northern Pike catch rate was 9.1, which was the highest on record for Sabre Lake. Northern Pike lengths ranged from 15.6 to 34.5 inches and averaged 21.7 inches. An additional 15 Northern Pike were sampled in trap nets and ranged in size from 15.8 to 41.9 inches in length. Northern Pike ranged in age from 1 to 7 years with 7 year classes represented. Growth was relatively slow as Northern Pike averaged only 25.7 inches at age-4. The Northern Pike population is improving and may be of high quality soon. Sabre Lake is included in the Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations. Anglers are limited to 2 Northern Pike daily and fish must be at least 24 inches to harvest. <br> \n <br> \nHistoric Black Crappie catch rates in Sabre Lake have been variable, ranging from zero fish in 2009 to 9.2 fish/net in 1999. The 2021 Black Crappie catch rate was 19.0 fish/net. Black Crappie ranged from 1.0 to 13.3 inches and averaged 9.7 inches in length. Black Crappies ranged in age from 1 to 8 years with the majority being 3 or 4 years old. Black Crappies grew relatively fast and averaged 10.5 inches at age 4. The Black Crappie population in Sabre Lake is of high quality at this time. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance has been low throughout the survey history of Sabre Lake. The 2021 Bluegill catch rate was no different, at 2.3 fish/net, which was below the long-term lake average of 4.4 fish/net. Bluegills ranged from 7.5 to 9.8 inches and averaged 8.9 inches in length. Although Bluegill size structure was favorable in Sabre Lake, overall abundance appeared to be low compared to other lakes in the Cannon River watershed. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead catch rates have steadily decreased since the peak in 1968 (186.0 fish/net). Only 2 Black Bullheads were sampled in 2021, which was well below the long-term average of 49.6 fish/net. Black Bullheads from gill nets and trap nets ranged in length from 7.7 to 12.3 inches and averaged 10.0 in length.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled from the 2021 survey included Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), White Sucker, Common Carp, Bowfin (dogfish), Channel Catfish, Yellow Bullhead, and Bigmouth Buffalo. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
