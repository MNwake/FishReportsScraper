The fish community if composed of northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, pumpkinseed, white sucker and yellow perch.     Results of the 1996 survey indicated very good numbers of black crappie.  Average length was 8.8 inches with many crappies over 10 inches.  Northern pike were also present with an average size of 20.6 inches and ranging from 18.3 to 30.1 inches.  Average numbers of pumpkinseed were present although their average length was only 4.5 inches.     Anglers also might encounter largemouth bass (up to 16.3 inches) and white sucker (up to 21.5 inches).</p>",
