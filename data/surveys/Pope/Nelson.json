                "narrative": "<p>Nelson Lake is a shallow, hyper-eutrophic basin with a history of low dissolved oxygen during winter months.  Winterkill events have likely occurred, however, they have been poorly documented.  The lake has been classified as a Marginal Game-Fish Lake since the early 1950's and designated as a Migratory Waterfowl Feeding and Resting Area in 1989.  Fish management activities have been limited.  Improved water clarity has resulted in expansion of submergent vegetation.  Water transparency at time of the summer survey was 7.5 feet.  The shallow, gravel public access may require a four-wheel drive vehicle to launch a boat. <br> \n <br> \nQuality gamefish populations currently exist in Nelson Lake.  Largemouth bass, bluegill, walleye and northern pike abundance has increased.  Largemouth bass captures ranged from 3.2 to 19.5 inches in length.  Over one-third of the bass catch exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Bluegill catch rates were the highest recorded for Nelson Lake.  Mean length of sampled bluegill was 5.6 inches.  Several fish exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  Growth is rapid with age-3 fish averaging 6.2 inches.  The abundant 2007 year class should provide quality fishing opportunities in the near future.  In response to alternate-year maintenance stockings, walleye abundance has increased.  Age distribution of walleye captured in 2010 corresponded well to stocking chronology.  Over three-fourths of walleye captures exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  The largest fish measured 24.5 inches in length.  Northern pike proved to be abundant.  Mean length of sampled fish was 22.9 inches.  Several pike exceeded 28.0 inches in length.  Yellow perch catches averaged 24.6-fish/gillnet.  Average size remains small.  Mean length of sampled fish was 6.5 inches.  An abundance of 5.0 to 6.0 inch perch are currently present and should provide quality angling opportunities in the near future. <br> \n</p>",

The stunted population offers no value to the sport or commercial fishery Northern Pike adults were stocked in the lake in 1984, 1985, and 1986. It appears some of the Northern Pike have recruited to larger sizes and some natural reproduction and/or fish runs occur. No Bluegill were found in the nets despite having been stocked in 1985. Bowfin, White Sucker, Yellow Perch, and Pumpkinseed may have entered the lake during the high water of 1986. Yellow Perch may reach a harvestable-size in 1989.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nelson Lake is a shallow, hypereutrophic basin with a history of low dissolved oxygen levels during winter months.  Winterkill events have likely occurred, however they have been poorly documented.   The lake has been classified as a Marginal Game-Fish Lake since the early 1950's and was designated as a Migratory Waterfowl Feeding and Resting Area in 1989.  Fish management activities have been limited.  At present, poor water clarity and lack of submergent vegetation limit waterfowl use.A partial winterkill likely occurred during the winter of 2000-2001.  Dissolved oxygen levels fell below 0.5 ppm in early March of 2001.  Electrofishing was conducted after ice-out to quickly assess the remaining fish community.   Black crappie, northern pike, bowfin, and common carp were observed. The fish community in Nelson Lake is typical of a shallow lake that experiences winterkill.  Black bullhead dominate the fish community, comprising 97% of the total number of fish captured in gill nets.  Most of the fish ranged between 5.5 and 7.0 inches in total length.  Mean weight was 0.15 pounds.Black crappie and largemouth bass numbers have increased in recent years and may provide angling opportunities.  Both species were present in relatively abundant numbers, yet average size was small.  These fish are experiencing rapid growth rates and size structure is likely to improve. Northern pike and walleye were present in limited numbers.   Adult brood fish are usually stocked following winterkill events.  Walleye fry have been stocked in alternate years since 1998.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nelson Lake is a 293-acre, shallow basin located in south-central Pope County.  A small, unimproved public access is located on the northeast corner of the lake.  This shallow, gravel access may require a four-wheel drive vehicle to launch a boat.  Nelson Lake was designated as a migratory waterfowl feeding and resting area in 1989.  Only electric motors are allowed on this basin during the waterfowl hunting season.\n  \nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in June 2018 to assess the fish community.  Survey findings documented sustained expansion of gamefish populations and notable changes in habitat conditions.  Habitat changes included greater water transparency and resultant expansion of submergent aquatic plants.  From the early-1980s to early-2000s, this basin was turbid, lacked submerged aquatic plants, and was prone to fish kill events due to low dissolved oxygen levels.  The fish community was dominated by Black Bullheads and other tolerant fishes.  In response to severe winterkill and prompt gamefish stockings that may limit expansion of surviving roughfish populations, water clarity started to improve and submerged aquatic plants became more abundant.  Improved habitat conditions led to increased gamefish diversity.  Further improvement in habitat conditions and continued evolution of the gamefish community were evident during the 2018 survey.  Water clarity was measured at 8.0 feet.  Submerged aquatic plants were common throughout the basin.  Species dependent on aquatic vegetation (i.e., Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch) were more abundant.  Bluegill and Largemouth Bass populations will likely generate the most angling interest because of the enhanced size structure of these populations.  The majority of Northern Pike and Yellow Perch that were sampled were smaller individuals.  Northern Pike captures averaged 18.9 inches.  Most Yellow Perch were young fish.  Average size of perch captures was 6.0 inches.  Black Crappies and Walleyes were captured, but catch rates were low.  Black Crappie captures ranged from 4.8 to 9.4 inches in length.  Walleye captures ranged in length from 18.0 to 22.8 inches.  Other species sampled during the 2018 survey included Bowfin (dogfish), Brown and Yellow Bullheads, Common Carp, Golden Shiners, Pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfishes.\n  \nThere is growing potential that this fishery may be degraded by partial or severe winterkill during the harsh winter of 2018-19.  A targeted winterkill assessment may be necessary in early 2019 to determine if or how severe fish losses might be.\n \nIn absence of severe winterkill, the next standardized lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2028.  Based on 2018 survey findings, Nelson Lake supports a surplus of small Northern Pike.  Anglers are reminded of expanded bag limits for 21.9-inch and smaller pike with changes in statewide Northern Pike harvest regulations.  Nelson Lake is located in the North-central Zone.  Anglers can now keep up to 10 pike but not more than two can be over 26 inches in length.  All pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released.  Harvest of small pike is encouraged to help improve size structure of this population. \n</p>",

Other species present in low numbers were Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, and Golden Shiner.  Adult Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass were stocked in spring 2023 to help restore this fishery.</p>",

Winterkill likely occurs; however, no fish kills have been documented.  The lake wasclassified as a semi-permanent waterfowl lake in the early 1950's and was treated with toxaphene in1967 for waterfowl management.  The present fish community is characteristic of a winterkill lake.Northern pike are abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 16.5 fish/net in 1997.  Gillnet catches averaged21.0 and 0.0 fish/net in 1988 and 1983, respectively.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.2 pounds. Nelson Lake has received winter-rescue northern pike, when available.  Yellow perch catches averaged37.0 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches averaged 16.0 and 0.0 fish/net in 1988 and 1983, respectively. Total length of the fish captured in gillnets ranged from 4.2 to 10.6 inches, however most were between5.0 and 6.0 inches.  Black bullhead catches averaged 29.0 fish/gillnet and 58.0 fish/trapnet.  Gillnetcatches averaged 74.5 and 36.0 fish/net in 1988 and 1983, respectively.  Trapnet catches averaged 86.0and 15.0 fish/net in those years.  Fish are too small to have any commercial value.  Bowfin, whitesucker, pumpkinseed sunfish were also captured in limited numbers.</p>",
