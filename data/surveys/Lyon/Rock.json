                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake, located near the town of Russell in Lyon County, is a 439 acre lake.  It is managed primarily for walleyes and secondarily for yellow perch and black crappie.  Rock Lake has a history of winterkill and a partial winterkill occurred during the winter of 2001, which mostly killed carp and bullheads.  During the week of June 24, 2002 a population assessment was conducted using 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets.The walleye catch rate was nearly 23/set which was almost equal to the 1998 survey.  Fish of various sizes were captured and averaged 16.0 inches.  Net catch data indicates a healthy \"plump\" population of various sizes is available to the angler.  The take home message for walleye anglers is that this population would be worth some angler hours, as many \"eaters\" are available.The yellow perch catch rate was within the expected range, with fish from 7 to almost 12 inches present.  The population has good numbers of \"keeper\" fish.  Based on historical surveys, the population has remained fairly stable since 1987 and could be a mainstay for perch fishermen.  It is likely that the relatively consistent perch population is providing the forage base for the walleyes which is not uncommon.  This healthy predator-prey scenario is an expected result and something fisheries professionals strive for in lakes.If walleyes or perch are not what you are targeting, the black crappie population is respectable.  The black crappie catch rate was also within the expected range, however the fish averaged over 10 inches in length.  Most of the fish were \"plump\" and in good condition.  Growth was average to above average as an Age 2 was 9 inches in length.  There are other lake systems with larger crappie populations but the large average size would be difficult to match.Unfortunately, the black bullhead and common carp catch rates were relatively high and may provide some unexpected action between gamefish bites.Other species captured during the survey were bluegill, green sunfish, northern pike, orangespotted sunfish, and white sucker.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Rock Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

                "narrative": "<p>Rock is a 439-acre lake located near the city of Russell in Lyon County.  The lake has 3.6 miles of shoreline, and has a maximum depth of 7.2 feet.  Rock Lake is managed for walleye primarily while yellow perch and black crappie are managed secondarily.    <br> \nAlthough walleye numbers have been historically higher in Rock, they are what we would expect when compared to lakes similar to Rock Lake.  The gill net catch rate was down from catch rates observed in 2002 and 2006.  Lengths of walleye caught in gill nets ranged from 9.7 to 23.6 inches and averaged 16.7 inches.  Eight different year classes of walleye were caught and aged during the 2010 survey, which indicates some sporadic natural reproduction of walleye in Rock Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch rates were the highest ever recorded on Rock Lake.   The gill net catch rate of 33.7 fish/net was over three times the catch rate in 2006.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in gill nets ranged from 5.8 to 12.0 inches and averaged 8.6 inches.  There were a fair number of yellow perch in the 11 to 12 inch range. <br> \n <br> \nBased on historical catch rates of crappie on Rock Lake, black crappie have never been excessively high.  Although barely within the expected range, crappie numbers in Rock Lake are a little on the low side and are down some from the survey in 2006.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 4.3 to 12.3 inches and averaged 8.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers are the lowest ever observed in Rock Lake.  Although black bullhead numbers are low, some larger fish still can be caught.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in our trap nets ranged from 5.4 to 14.4 inches and averaged 10.2 inches.  Common carp numbers are what we would expect for lakes similar to Rock.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during the assessment included northern pike, white sucker, and green sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Rock Lake; we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

WALLEYES ARE DISTRIBUTED OVER A WIDE RANGE OF AGE CLASSES, (AGES 1 THROUGH 7)  WERE ALL REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE), INDICATING NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS OCCURRING IN ROCK LAKE.  ROCK LAKE IS ANOTHER LAKE IN THE AREA WHICH SEEMS TO PRODUCE SUCCESSFUL YEAR CLASSES FROM FRY STOCKING. YELLOW PERCH GILL NET CATCH RATES (25.0) ARE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN (18.5), BUT FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN THE STATE MEDIAN. GROWTH RATES ARE ABOUT AVERAGE FOR YELLOW PERCH IN AREA LAKES.  ALL AGE GROUPS (EXCEPT FOR AGE 1 YELLOW PERCH) WERE PRESENTED IN THE SURVEY. NO YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR YELLOW PERCH WERE COLLECTED DURING THE SHORELINE SEINING PORTION OF THE SURVEY THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT EITHER REPRODUCTIVE EFFORTS HAVE FAILED IN RECENT YEARS OR PREDATION, PRIMARILY BY WALLEYES, IS HIGH ENOUGH TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT RECRUITMENT.  ADDITIONALLY, MANY OF THE YELLOW PERCH SMAPELD WERE AGE 2 AND 3, AND MAY NOT YET RECRUITED TO REPRODUCTIVE AGE. YELLOW PERCH HAVE INCREASED IN ABUNDANCE SINCE THE 1987 SURVEY.  THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE 1985 STOCKING OF ADULTS, WHICH APPEAR TO HAVE PRODUCED THREE STRONG COHORTS (AGES 2 THROUGH 4). BLACK BULLHEAD TRAP NET CATCHES (11.25) WERE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  THIS IS ALSO LOWER THAN 1987 CATCH RATES.  MOST OF THE BLACK BULLHEADS SAMPLED (GILL NETS) WERE BETWEEN 9.5 AND 12.0 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH. BLACK CRAPPIE TRAP NET CATCH RATES ALSO DECLINED FROM 1985, HOWEVER, CATCH RATES WERE BELOW STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS AT THAT TIME ALSO.  A LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL COMMON CARP (4-6 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH) WERE CAPTURED IN GILL NETS. IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THE FISH COMMUNITY OF ROCK LAKE HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake is a 439-acre lake located approximately 3 miles south of the City of Russell in Lyon County.  Rock Lake has a relatively small watershed to lake ratio of 8 to 1, with much of the watershed being comprised of agricultural lands.  Rock Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Black Crappie.  A standard survey was conducted the week of July 9, 2018 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nSince 2010, Walleye catch rates have not exceeded 6.3 per gill net.  The trend continued in 2018 as the Walleye catch rate was 6.0 per gill net, below the long term average of 16.8, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Walleye lengths ranged from 10.3 to 26.6 inches and averaged 15.6 inches.  The 2016 year class (age-2) represented 53 percent of the sample, and corresponded to the 2016 stocking of Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye.  Five additional year classes were sampled including 2015, 2014, 2013, 2009, and 2002.  The 2015 year class was not stock and was likely the result of natural reproduction. Mean lengths at age-1, age-2, age3, and age-4 were 8.3, 11.2, 14.8, and 16.8 inches, respectively, indicating normal growth.  Despite the low catch rates during the last decade, Walleye angling has been good on Rock Lake the last couple of years. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2018 was 23.7 per gill net, greater than the long term average of 16.8 per gill net, and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 7.0 to 11.5 inches and averaged 10.3 inches.  Good Yellow Perch angling should be in store for Rock Lake in the near future.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance has not exceeded 5.6 per trap net in survey history, as they occur at a relatively low abundance.  In 2018 the Black Crappie catch rate was 3.9 per trap net, slightly above the long term average of 2.3 per trap net, and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 4.7 to 9.5 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance remained low in 2018 as the catch rates were 1.3 per trap net and 3.7 per gill net.  Common Carp abundance increased from 1.7 per trap net in 2014 to 5.3 per trap net in 2018.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, White Sucker, Channel Catfish, Green Sunfish, and Orangespotted Sunfish. <br> \n</p>",

Average size per fish is slightly smaller than both state and local medians.  The walleye population is represented by age 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 fish.  Gillnet indices for yellow perch are about the state median but substantially lower than the local median.  Netcatch indices for carp and black bullhead are greater than state and local medians.  Trapnet indices for black crappie are less than both state and local medians.  Shoreline seining results indicate substantial natural reproduction by black bullhead, carp, green sunfish, and fathead minnow, and good natural reproduction by black crappie.</p>",

Rock Lake is managed for walleye primarily while yellow perch and black crappie are managed secondarily.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers are high when compared to lakes similar to Rock Lake according to the survey conducted in 2006.  Surveys in 1998 and 2002 had similar catch rates as the survey in 2006.  Lengths of walleye caught in gill nets ranged from 10.9 to 28.3 inches and averaged 15.5 inches.  Four year classes of walleye were observed during the survey all of which were produced from years walleye fry were stocked. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were similar to other lakes like Rock Lake.  The population, as of 2006, was comprised of some very nice sized yellow perch.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in gill nets ranged from 9.5 to 15.6 inches and averaged 11.4 inches.  Four successive year classes starting in 2000 were observed during the survey. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie numbers were also similar to lakes like Rock Lake.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 4.8 to 11.0 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  Four year classes of black crappie were sampled during the survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead and carp numbers are down in Rock Lake.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in trap nets ranged from 5.4 to 13.4 inches and averaged 11.8 inches.  Shoreline seining results indicated natural reproduction of black bullhead, black crappie, carp, green sunfish, and orangespotted sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Rock Lake; we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nRock Lake is a 439-acre lake located approximately 3 miles south of the City of Russell in Lyon County. Rock Lake has a relatively small watershed to lake ratio of 8 to 1, with much of the watershed being comprised of agricultural lands. Rock Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch and black crappie. The yellow perch and black crappie populations in Rock Lake are self-sustaining as they have not been stocked in recent history. The walleye population is maintained primarily through fry stocking 2 out of 3 years (2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016), with limited natural reproduction contributing occasionally. A population assessment was conducted the week of June 23, 2014 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nHistorically, Rock Lake has had an abundant walleye population, with catch rates often exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net). More recently, catch rates have declined to historic lows, as walleye were captured at a rate of 6.3 per gill net in 2010 and 6.0 per gill net in 2014. The 2014 catch of 6.0 per gill net is still within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net), but is well below the long term average of 17.9 per gill net for Rock Lake. The walleye stocking strategy and quota have remained stable since 1992, so it is difficult to identify why catch rates have declined in the last two surveys in 2010 and 2014. A wide range of lengths were present, as walleyes ranged from 12.5 to 26.1 inches (mean=16.0 inches) in gill nets and from 6.8 to 13.4 inches (mean=8.0 inches) in trap nets. Six year classes of walleye were present including fish from 2004 (age-10), 2005 (age-9), 2008 (age-6), 2010 (age-4), 2011 (age-3), and 2013 (age-1), all of which corresponded to years that walleye fry were stocked. Age-3 walleye were the most prevalent, accounting for 52 percent of the fish aged. When compared to growth of walleye from similar lakes, growth was slow for Rock Lake walleye, as back calculated mean length at age-1 was 8.0 inches, age-2 was 11.4 inches, and age-3 was 13.4 inches. Growth of Rock Lake walleye beyond age-3 was similar to growth for similar lakes as mean lengths were 17.5 inches at age-4, 18.7 inches at age-5, 20.4 inches at age-6, and 22.5 inches at age-7. Slow growth and skinny fish may indicate that prey resources for walleye may be limited in Rock Lake. Rock Lake's walleye population is stable with many year classes of walleye present. The current stocking strategy (fry, two out of three years) will be continued because it has proven to be successful in previous years, and is effective at maintaining multiple year classes of walleye in the population.    <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nRock Lake's yellow perch population has historically been stable with catch rates ranging from 2.5 per gill net in 1985 to 33.7 per gill net in 2010. Since 1987, catch rates have been above the median catch rate for similar lakes (8.0 per gill net), and this trend continued in 2014 with a catch rate of 12.7 per gill net. Yellow perch have not been stocked in Rock Lake, indicating that this population sustains itself through natural reproduction. Yellow perch ranged in length from 5.2 to 10.5 inches and averaged 6.6 inches. Most of the yellow perch were small with 81 percent being between 5.2 and 6.5 inches in length. Yellow perch were plump, indicating that yellow perch are successfully foraging in Rock Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \nBlack crappie have historically occurred in low abundance in Rock Lake with catch rates ranging from 0.0 per trap net in 2014 to 5.6 per trap net in 1998. Since 1998, trap net catches of black crappie have steadily declined from 5.6 per trap net in 1998 to 4.7 per trap net in 2002 to 2.9 per trap net in 2006 to 1.4 per trap net in 2010 to 0.0 per trap net in 2014. The 2014 catch rate of 0.0 per trap net is the lowest observed catch rate for Rock Lake since surveys began, and is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net). Although not sampled in the survey, black crappie are present in Rock Lake. A near shore survey conducted on July 10, 2014, captured 1,151 young-of-the-year (YOY) black crappie, suggesting that a strong year class was produced in 2014. Black crappie recruitment tends to be highly variable and is often characterized as cyclic, with strong year classes reoccurring every three to five years. This variable and cyclic recruitment often results in a \"boom-or-bust\" crappie fishery, where years of increased angler catch rates are followed by years of decreased angler catch rates. If the strong 2014 year class survives through the winter, the crappie population should be on the upswing in Rock Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nCHANNEL CATFISH <br> \nFive channel catfish were sampled in 2014, marking the first time that this species has been captured during a survey in Rock Lake. Channel catfish ranged in length from 13.4 to 19.2 inches and averaged 15.5 inches. Channel catfish were not stocked by MNDNR, therefore it is likely that they were illegally stocked by an angler. To avoid unintended introductions, anglers should be diligent about disposing of unused bait in the trash, and should report unpermitted movement of fish. More information on how channel catfish respond to this new environment will be available after the next scheduled population assessment in 2018.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance remained below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net) at 27.7 per trap net. The majority (87 percent) of black bullheads were less than 7.5 inches in length. Black bullhead lengths ranged from 5.0 to 10.9 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of white sucker in 2014 was 3.3 per gill net. This is the highest observed catch rate for this species, but is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.8 to 6.5 per gill net). White suckers ranged in length from 8.5 to 19.1 inches and averaged 17.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp abundance has historically been low in Rock Lake. The 2014 catch rate of common carp (3.7 per gill net) was below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 13.8 per gill net). Common carp ranged in length from 9.1 to 27.6 inches and averaged 19.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike occur in low abundance in Rock Lake. Two northern pike were sampled in the 2014 survey and measured 15.9 and 17.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included orangespotted sunfish.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

Rock Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Black Crappie. Rock Lake is part of an effort to introduce a unique strain of Walleye to area lakes.  The strain of Walleye (Lower Mississippi Strain; LMS) is the same strain that is found in Lake Sarah, which has one of the only Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction. A recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  Further genetic testing has shown that this strain of Walleye has persisted in some other southern Minnesota lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  Rock Lake was stocked with the Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fry in the spring of 2016 in an effort to get this strain established in additional waterbodies.  Rock Lake was selected because it has traditionally supported a good Walleye population, has habitat that is conducive to Walleye reproduction, and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction.  A Walleye fry stocking evaluation using night electrofishing was conducted on October 18, 2016 to determine if the 2016 fry stocking was successful. <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye were captured at a rate of 574.7 per hour, which is an extremely high catch rate, and indicates that the fry stocking was successful, natural reproduction occurred, or a combination of the two.  Walleye fingerlings ranged in length from 4.8 to 7.8 inches and averaged 5.5 inches.  If they survive the winter, the 2016 year class should be a very strong year class in the Rock Lake Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake is a 422 acre lake located near Russell, Minnesota.  The lake is presently managed for walleye as the primary species while northern pike and yellow perch are managed as a secondary species.  The lake has had a history of good walleye fishing.The walleye catch rate during the 1998 survey was high compared to other lakes like Rock.  Walleye lengths ranged from 11 to just over 23 inches and had an average length of just over 14 inches.  The majority of fish were in the 13 to 14 inch range which could mean some good fishing opportunities for area anglers next summer and winter.  The average weight of walleye sampled during the survey was just over one pound.The yellow perch catch rate was also high compared to similar lakes.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 6 to 10 inches and averaged about 9 inches.  Many of the fish sampled during the survey were in the 8 to 10 inch range.  The average weight of yellow perch sampled in 1998 was 0.4 pounds.One of the big surprises of the survey was the increase in the black crappie population.  The population has gradually increased since 1994 and would now be considered an average black crappie lake.  Lengths of black crappie ranged from 6 to 13 inches and averaged 8 inches.  The average weight of black crappie sampled during the 1998 survey was just over 1/3 of a pound.Other fish sampled during the survey included black bullhead, common carp, northern pike, and white suckers.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Rock Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.     </p>",

Rock Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Black Crappie.  Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye were stocked in Rock Lake in 2016, 2018, and 2021.  Walleye were not stocked in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, so Walleye were stocked in 2021 despite being an \"off\" year.  A Walleye fry stocking evaluation using daytime electrofishing was conducted on September 21, 2021 to determine if the abundance of Age 0 Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye were captured at a rate of 277.3 per hour, which indicates that the fry stocking was successful or natural reproduction occurred in Rock Lake.  Walleye fingerlings were 4.3 to 7.0 inches in length and averaged 5.4 inches.  Assuming survival to Spring of 2022 of the Fall Age 0 Walleye in Rock Lake, the 2021 year class should be a strong year class in the Rock Lake Walleye population.   <br> \n</p>",

Rock Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Black Crappie.  Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye were stocked in Rock Lake in 2016 and 2018.  Rock Lake has traditionally supported a good Walleye population, has habitat that is conducive to Walleye reproduction, and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction.  2019 was a non-stocked year, so a natural reproduction check using day time electrofishing was conducted on September 19, 2019 to determine if natural reproduction occurred.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye were captured at a rate of 4.0 per hour, which is a low catch rate, and indicates that the natural reproduction was limited in Rock Lake. Walleye fingerlings were 6.1 and 6.2 inches in length.  Age-1 Walleye were captured at a rate of 90.0 per hour, indicating that the 2018 fry stocking was successful. Age-1 Walleye ranged in length from 7.4 to 10.2 inches and averaged 8.3 inches.   The 2018 year class should be a strong year class in the Rock Lake Walleye population.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake is a 439-acre lake located south of the City of Russell in Lyon County.  Rock Lake has a relatively small watershed to lake ratio of 8 to 1, with much of the watershed being comprised of agricultural lands.  Eight species of fish were sampled during the survey which should be considered a pretty simplistic low diversity lake.  Rock Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Black Crappie.  A standard survey was conducted the week of July 11, 2022 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in Rock Lake have ranged from 6.0 per gill net in 2018 to 30.8 per gill net in 1987 and have averaged 16.1 per gill net since 1985.  Prior to 2010, it was common to have catch rates higher than 17.5 per gill net (6 out of 7 surveys).  In the recent three nettings before this survey, catch rates have been below 6.3 per gill net.  In 2022, the catch rate of Walleye increased to 9.3 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Gill net catch rates were expected to be higher because fall electrofishing catch rates of Walleye fingerlings were high in 2016 (574.7 per hour) and 2021 (277.3 per hour).  It is possible that the gill net catch rate was lower than expected, because there was a dense algae bloom occurring during the survey, which increases the visibility of the net and is thereby avoided by the fish. Walleye lengths ranged from 7.3 to 28.9 inches and averaged 15.5 inches.  The Walleye population in Rock Lake is stable, as six year classes of Walleye were sampled including Age-1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 fish.  The presence of Walleye from years where no stocking occurred is an indication that some limited natural reproduction occurs as the age-2 (N=1) and age-5 (N=2) Walleye were from non-stocked years.  All other year classes sampled were from stocked years.  The average length at age-1, age-4, and age-6 was 8.2 inches, 17.2 inches, and 20.5 inches, respectively, which are similar to average length at age estimates for other Walleye populations in similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates have ranged from 2.5 per gill net in 1985 to 33.7 per gill net in 2010 and have averaged 16.1 per gill net since 1985.  In 2022, the Yellow Perch catch rate was 8.7 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 6.4 to 9.7 inches and averaged 8.7 inches.  Yellow Perch are feeding successfully, as fish in the sample were plump.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie have historically occurred in low abundance in Rock Lake, with catch rates being near the lower end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 per trap net) since surveys began in 1985.  The 2022 catch rate remained low at 3.2 per trap net.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 4.4 to 12.8 inches and averaged 9.7 inches.  Although abundance was relatively low, 65 percent of the Black Crappie sampled were 10.0 inches or larger.     <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were first sampled in Rock Lake in 2014 and Bigmouth Buffalo in 2018.  In 2022, the Bigmouth Buffalo catch rate was 1.7 per gill net and zero Channel Catfish were sampled.  Black Bullhead abundance remained very low at 0.8 per trap net.  Other species sampled included Common Carp, Orangespotted Sunfish, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>An assessment of lakeshore habitat on Rock Lake was conducted on 8/10/2017.  The assessment consisted of 29 survey sites evenly spaced about 2 football field lengths with end zones apart around the lake.  The average lake wide habitat score was 71.6(+/- 3.2), indicating overall lakeshore habitat quality was moderate (66-84).  Sites with moderate habitat quality have a high percentage of unaltered habitat but at least one zone has lower habitat quality than a high scoring site.  Undeveloped sites may score moderate if they naturally lack a habitat component.  Developed sites that retain a high percentage of natural habitat areas may score in this range.  Approximately 62 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 60.7(+/- 2.3), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 89.2(+/- 3.2).  This habitat survey was designed to provide a means to quantify and compare lakeshore habitat between lakes.  The Rock Lake shoreline habitat score is lower than the statewide lake score average of 73.6.</p>",
