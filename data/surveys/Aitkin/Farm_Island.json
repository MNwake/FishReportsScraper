                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Farm Island Lake was conducted on July 10, 2017. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all twenty-four stations. A 50-foot seine was used to sample thirteen stations, a 15-foot seine was used at six stations. Soft sediments with emergent vegetation, abundant woody debris, and/or deep water prevented the use of seines at five sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 24 native species of fish including species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Banded Killifish, Mottled Sculpin and Rock Bass). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey was combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in August 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Farm Island Lake based on this survey was above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

The TDO3 (temperature at 3 mg/l dissolved oxygen) was determined to be 22 degrees C similar to previous profiles. The overall oxy-thermal habitat suitable for Tullibee was limited to the epilimnion, which is typical for this lake, yet still better than many years. Often many, if not all, of the data points fall below the critical threshold curve for Tullibee. Data collected from 2009-2022 indicate only marginal thermal habitat for Tullibee in most years, with the best conditions having been found in 2009, 2013, 2015, and 2018. Although even then, conditions were still \"poor\" compared to other lakes in the area that are monitored. Because the Aitkin Area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's Tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of Coldwater habitat. Typically, only a few Tullibee are caught in each gill net assessment survey.</p>",

Comparison of the age class structure of the sample and the stocking record indicates that there is successful natural reproduction.  Farm Island Lake was stocked annually from 1976 until 1988 with walleye fry, a social decision, limiting the evaluation of natural recruitment over this time frame.  Growth rates for annual increments were normal.

Annual monitoring of the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye will continue on Farm Island Lake.  This year sampling was conducted on October 3, 2017. Sampling time was 1.53 hours and resulted in a YOY walleye catch rate of 29.4/hour (run time), with an average size of 7.1\". The catch rate for age 1 walleye was 4.5/hr. Results from the seven electrofishing surveys conducted since 2010 suggest that years with fry stocking have significantly higher catch rates of YOY (mean of 54/hr) than the non-stocked years (<mean of 2.4/hr). Due to the lower contribution of natural year classes, Farm Island will be stocked on an annual basis.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted the week of 7/30/2018.  Per current management plan guidelines, Farm Island Lake is usually surveyed every three years, however this survey was added due to poor conditions surrounding the 2016 standard survey.  During the period of that survey there were flood conditions (including a no wake zone throughout the lake) coupled with exceedingly warm and calm weather.  Statewide, during the week of the 2016 survey, Walleye catches in most other surveys were well below previous catches.  Survey gear included only gill nets and although all species were recorded, assessing the Walleye fishery was the primary goal.\n\nPrimary management is for Walleye, with Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass listed as secondary species.  Walleye stocking dates back to 1922, and the current strategy calls for stocking Mississippi River strain Walleye fry annually at a rate of 1000/LA (883,000), beginning in 2017. This is a change from stocking 1500 fry/LA in 3 of 4 years.  Gaps in stocking were added in to the management at Farm Island in 2010 and 2014, to identify the extent of natural reproduction in this system.  Fall electrofishing and gill net assessments have shown low recruitment of natural fish in comparison to fry stocked year classes, suggesting natural reproduction was still occurring, but would likely be inadequate to maintain the fishery.  \n\nWalleye catch rate (5.7/gill net) was just slightly higher compared to the 2016 (4.7/gill net) population assessment and was just below the current management goal of 6-8/gill net.  Walleye catch rates had declined steadily since 2007, likely in part due to stocking gaps in 2010 and 2014.  Walleye ages 2 and 6 combined typically account for about 2 fish per net. In 2018, those age classes produced a catch rate of 1.7 fish per net, which is an increase compared with only 0.7 fish per net that was observed in 2016.  As fish from those gap years exit the fishery, catch rates should continue to improve and will likely fluctuate near the goals for the lake.  \n\nWalleye ranged from 7.4 to 24.0\" and from age 1 to age 12, with 11 year classes represented.  Limited natural reproduction was detected from the most recent non-stocked year (2014).  It is expected that the elimination of stocking gaps will produce more consistent year classes on the lake. In future, if it is important to check the status of natural reproduction, contingent fingerling stockings should be considered if fall electrofishing catches of the natural year class are low.\n\nThe special regulation requiring a 16-19\" protected slot for Walleye continues to maintain a favorable size structure. Size averaged 15.4\" and 1.4 pounds in 2018, similar to the last 2 surveys.  The regulation has been in place since 1996, when it was adopted as an \"experimental\" regulation, and was then converted to a \"special\" regulation in 2011. \n\nA temperature - dissolved oxygen (TDO) profile was collected on July 31, 2018 to measure the amount of thermal habitat available for Tullibee. The TDO3 (temperature at 3 mg/l dissolved oxygen) was determined to be 21 degrees C. The water was warm from the surface to about 9 feet deep. The overall oxy-thermal habitat suitable for Tullibee was limited and found from approximately 9 to 21 feet deep. Data collected from 2009-2018 indicate only marginal thermal habitat for Tullibee in most years, with the best conditions found in 2009, 2015, and 2018 although still \"poor\" compared to other lakes in the area that are monitored. Because the Aitkin Area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's Tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of coldwater habitat.</p>",

Night electrofishing in the fall was used to evaluate this strategy.  It was concluded that non-stocked years did not appreciably contribute to the fishery compared to stocked years.  However, annual monitoring of the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye will continue on Farm Island Lake.  Unfortunately, fall sampling was delayed due to weather and time constraints and was not able to be conducted until October 24, 2018.  By this time water temperatures had cooled in to the mid-40 degree range and fish had already moved off shore to deeper wintering areas.  Sampling time was 0.8 hours and resulted in the catch of only one adult Walleye measuring 20.1 inches in length.  In order to better assess the 2018 year class, a special targeted assessment will be conducted in the spring of 2019, shortly after spawning, to determine relative abundance and size structure of this year class.  While not directly comparable to fall electrofishing, it will give some measure of their presence in the system.</p>",

Night electrofishing in the fall was used to evaluate this strategy.  It was concluded that non-stocked years did not appreciably contribute to the fishery compared to stocked years.  Annual monitoring of the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye will continue on Farm Island Lake.  This year sampling was conducted on October 1, 2019. Sampling time was 1.8 hours and resulted in a YOY walleye catch rate of 14.02/hour (run time), with an average size of 6.8\". No age 1 walleye were sampled in 2019. Results from the eight electrofishing surveys conducted since 2010 suggest that years with fry stocking have significantly higher catch rates of YOY (mean of 43/hr) than the non-stocked years (<mean of 2.4/hr). Due to the lower contribution of natural year classes, Farm Island will be stocked on an annual basis.</p>",

Fall electrofishing was done for the first time on Farm Island September 9, 2010 to look for young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye.  The overall walleye catch rate was 30.3/hr run time with fish ranging from 6.5 to 22.3 inches.  A total of 6 YOY and 7 age 1 walleye were sampled with run time catch rates of 3.0/hr and 3.5/hr, respectively.  While this provides evidence of natural reproduction, because there is no baseline for comparison, it is difficult to determine to what extent the contribution is.  The relatively low catch rate for YOY walleyes suggests that fry stocking is probably contributing significantly to this fishery and will resume in 2011.  Fall electrofishing should continue in the immediate future to develop a baseline index for YOY abundance and further determine the need for fry stocking.

The catch rate for age 1 fish was 5/hour with size averaging 9.7\", and the catch rate for fish age 2 and older was 6/hour with size ranging from 13.7 to 19.8\". <br> \n <br> \nResults from the four electrofishing surveys conducted since 2010 suggest that years with fry stocking produced  significantly higher catch rates (123/hour in 2011, 50/hour in 2013) than the non-stocked years (3/hour in 2010 and 2014). Catch rates of age 1 walleye have been low and ranged from 0-5/hour. More data is needed to evaluate whether the catch rate of either YOY or age 1 walleye is a meaningful predictor of recruitment to harvestable size on this lake. Fall electrofishing should continue as staff time permits to evaluate fry stocking success and determine the extent that natural reproduction contributes to the fishery. <br> \n</p>",

The overall oxy-thermal habitat suitable for Tullibee was very limited with all except a couple of the data points falling outside of the critical threshold. Data collected from 2009-2021 indicate only marginal thermal habitat for Tullibee in most years, with the best conditions found in 2009, 2015, and 2018 although still \"poor\" compared to other lakes in the area that are monitored. Because the Aitkin Area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's Tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of Coldwater habitat. Typically only a few Tullibee are caught in each survey.</p>",

Night electrofishing in the fall was used to evaluate this strategy. It was concluded that while some natural reproduction was observed, non-stocked year classes did not appreciably contribute to the fishery compared to stocked year classes, but that annual monitoring of the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye should continue on Farm Island Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThis year, sampling was conducted on October 7, 2023. Sampling time was 2 hours and resulted in a YOY Walleye catch rate of 13.5 per hour (run time), with an average size of 6.2 inches. While this catch is below the long-term average of 26.6 per hour, it is substantially higher than for years that have not been stocked (1-3 per hour) and comparable to the 2019 year class, which has shown to be relatively abundant in subsequent gill net surveys. The catch rate for age 1 Walleye was 1 per hour, which is also below the long-term average of 2.4 per hour. These modest catch rates suggest modest recruitment for the 2022 and 2023 year classes, although electrofishing catch rates can be quite variable.  The standard gill net survey in 2026 will offer the best picture of these year classes after they recruit to the fishery. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike abundance in Farm Island Lake has increased steadily since 1986 to over 11 fish per gill net in 2000.  The increase to this high abundance coupled with the small size, an average of 20 inches long, represents an undesirable change in the fish community.  Heavy harvest of these smaller northern pike is encouraged.  Removal of these fish by anglers coupled with the release of fish over 22 inches long will help restructure the fish community and ease predation pressure on the overextended yellow perch population.  The yellow perch abundance remains depressed relative to this lake type.  Decreasing the abundance of smaller northern pike and increasing the abundance of larger northern pike through selective harvest is important to maintaining an adequate yellow perch population, which is the preferred forage species for northern pike and walleye.  Largemouth bass abundance was above the median for this lake class and the average size was over 11 inches.  The largest bass observed in the spring electrofishing sample approached 17.5 inches long.  The abundance of walleye has remained stable with 7.5 fish per gill net lift, a level that is quite good for this lake type.  The average size of walleye caught was 16.5 inches.  Walleye fry stocking has occurred at a steady rate of almost a million fry per year with gaps in stocking occurring in 1998, 1993, 1991, and 1989.  Only one walleye was observed from a year when walleye were not stocked.  Nearly all walleye sampled came from year-classes when fry stocking occurred.  Therefore, natural reproduction doesn't appear to be very important and fry stocking appears to be a successful strategy for maintaining a walleye population in this lake.  An experimental size regulation on walleye has been in place on Farm Island Lake since 1996.  The regulation is a protected slot size limit, where anglers must not take walleye between 16 and 19 inches.  The objective is to increase the catch rates of 16 to 19 inch fish.  Nearly 31 percent of the walleye sampled in the gill nets were within the experimental slot limit in 2000.  This is up from 20 percent in 1998 and 12 percent in 1991.  The final evaluation of the effectiveness of this regulation will occur in 2005.  Bluegill and black crappie abundances were within the normal range for this lake class, while rock bass appeared to be very abundant with a gill net index 5.7 fish per net.  Almost 42 percent of the rock bass sampled were over 10 inches indicating a lightly exploited species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Farm Island Lake is a 2,054 acre lake located about 7 miles south of Aitkin.  There are two state owned public access with concrete ramps on the lake - one each on the north and south side of the lake.  The lake is heavily developed with 22.6 homes/cabins per shoreline mile based on 2000 data.  The maximum depth is 56' and about 43% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel, although areas of rubble, boulders, detritus, and silt are also present.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 46 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are common along much of the shoreline.  It is essential to protect and maintain these plants as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide critical spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  Although the invasive species curly leaf pond weed is present in abundance, Eurasion water milfoil is likely to become established within the next several years due to its abundant presence in Tamefish Lake, just upstream on the Ripple River. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population in Farm Island is largely the result of the annual fry stocking program, although some natural reproduction does occur. In 2010, a gap in stocking was created to allow for more detailed evaluation of walleye reproduction in Farm Island as per the current management plan. The 2010 walleye catch of 7.9/gill net is average when compared to similar lakes and is typical of catches since the 16\"-19\" protected slot limit was implemented in 1996.  Ten different year classes were represented with the 2005, 2006, and 2007 year classes accounting for 75% of the current population.  Many of these fish were within the protected size range and provide quality angling opportunities.  The very strong 2005 year class is likely to grow past the protected slot in the near future, and had an average size of 18 inches already in July with some fish already over 20 inches.  Average length and weight of all walleyes was similar to 2007 at 16\" and 1.4lbs.  Information compiled in recent years suggests that the protected slot regulation has enhanced overall walleye abundance, improved the size structure of the walleye population, and increased angler catch rates of larger fish.  The regulation was made permanent following public review and support in 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in above average numbers for the fifth consecutive netting at 9.1/gill net.  Average length and weight were 20.4\" and 1.8lbs.  Only 7% of these fish measured at least 24\", however several fish over 30 inches were observed in the survey.  The 2007 year class was most abundant, representing 69% of the catch and measuring approximately 17-23\".  The Farm Island Lake Association has been encouraging a voluntary release program for fish between 24 and 36 inches.  These sizes of fish in Farm Island are likely female and do have good growth potential, with fish up to 35 inches observed in the spring trap net assessment. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance in both trap and gill nets was somewhat lower than past catches at 0.4/trap net and 0.5/gill net. Past trap net catches have ranged from 0.5-1.7 per net making the 2010 catch the lowest to date.  Past gill net catches also tended to be higher ranging from 0.3-1.9/gill net.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 bluegill catch of 10.7/trap net, is average when compared to similar lakes, although it is lower than most previous catches.  The size structure was relatively well balanced with 18% of trap netted bluegills measuring 7\" or larger compared to only 9% in 2007. Black crappies were present in good numbers and size structure when compared to catches on similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Tullibee abundance was average and similar to past catches at 0.7/gill net.  Yellow perch abundance continues to be low compared to other lakes, but at 1.0/gill net, is typical of past catches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Farm Island Lake is a large and popular lake located about seven miles south of Aitkin. There are two public accesses with concrete log ramps, one in the northeast and one in the southwest portion of the lake.  Sand is the primary substrate around much of the lake, but scattered muck, silt, gravel, and rubble areas create diverse aquatic habitats. Consequently, aquatic vegetation is also diverse with a variety of emergent, floating-leaf, and submerged species present. The invasive species Curly-leaf pond weed is also present. Healthy aquatic plant communities help to break wave action and prevent erosion, stabilize bottom substrates, maintain water clarity, and provide adult spawning and juvenile rearing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms. Zebra mussels are also present in Farm Island Lake, which was added to the infested waters list in 2020.  Farm Island Lake is surveyed every three years with special surveys added in occasionally. Due to agency safety reasons concerns stemming from the Coronavirus pandemic the only survey gear used for this assessment allowed at the time of this survey was gill nets, so no trap net catch data is available from this survey. Additionally, the approval for Bass electrofishing came too late in the spring to include in this survey.  Primary management is for Walleye, with Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass as secondary species.   <br> \n <br> \nFarm Island Lake has a history of Walleye stocking dating back to 1922. Fall electrofishing and gill net assessments have shown low recruitment of natural fish in comparison to fry stocked year classes, suggesting natural reproduction is inadequate to maintain the fishery, therefore, the current strategy calls for annual stocking of Mississippi River strain Walleye fry annually, although no fry were available for stocking in 2020. The Walleye catch rate (6.6/gill net) was just slightly higher compared to thethan in the 2018 (5.7/gill net) survey and met the current management goal of 6-8/gill net.  Walleye catch rates have increased by about 1/gill net the last three surveys after declining from 2007 to 2016. The long term average catch is 6.7/ gill net. Walleye ranged from 7.5 to 15.3\" and from age 1 to age 1217, with 11 13 year classes represented.  Limited Some natural reproduction was detected from the most two most recent non-stocked years, 2014 and 2010 (2014).  While the 2010 year class has contributed little to the fishery in the last 10 years, the 2014 year class is of moderate strength and has contributed substantially to the fishery in the last several years.  While unplanned, the 2020 stocking gap will allow further evaluation of natural reproduction in Farm Island Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe special regulation requiring a 16-19\" protected slot for Walleye continues to maintain a favorable size structure. Sizes ranged from 7.5 to 25.3\" and averaged 15.4\" and 1.4 pounds in 2020, which is similar to recent surveys. The regulation has been in place since 1996, when it was adopted as an \"experimental\" regulation, and was then converted to a \"special\" regulation in 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has increased over survey history peaking in 2007 at 12.1/gill net. Catch rates have leveled off since then, averaging 9.1/net from 2010 -to 2020. A catch rate of 9.9/gill net in 2020 is above the normal similar lake types and above management goals for the lake. As is typical for this lake, size structure was poor with a mean of 19.9\" and 1.7 pounds. Only 6 of the 120 fish sample were over 26 inches, with a maximum size of 31.1 inches. To help improve the size structure, we encourage anglers to release larger pike and harvest the smaller, under 22 inch sized fish, as per the statewide north-central zone regulations.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catches have been fairly stable, ranging from 0 to 3.8 per gill net, with the exception of an outlier in 1957 at 14.4/gill net. The gill net catch rate has been below 1.0/gill net the three previous surveys and was 0.4/gill net in 2020. Size structure was favorable in 2020, with an average length of 9.7\" and two thirds were 10 inches or more, but keep in mind the sample size was small and no trap nets were used. Black Crappie were sampled up to 11.2 inches were caught. <br> \n <br> \nSince trap nets were not used no measure of abundance for Bluegill was documented. Being a later summer survey there are typically some Bluegill sampled in the gillnets. There were 4.1/net which was similar to previous surveys, and the historic average for this lake is approximately 3.0/net. Size structure of Bluegills has traditionally been favorable and in 2020 the average size was 6.5 inches with fish sampled up to nearly 10 inches sampled 9.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance catches in gill nets has been very stable over time. The long term average is about 1.0/gillnet and was 0.4/net in 2020. Not known for a high abundance of Largemouth, it is known to have good bass fishing with some quality sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nJuvenile Smallmouth Bass were documented in 2010, which was the first time in any previous Farm Island assessments. Adults have been present in each of three surveys since then and showed a strong increase from 0.07/gill net (in 2018) to 0.9/gill net in(2020). It is unclear how Smallmouth Bass have found their way into the lake, possibly via migration from the Mississippi River or by anglers, but it was not from DNR activities. The size structure was good as well, with an average length of 14.4 inches and fish up to nearly 18.0 inches present. It will be interesting to see how the Smallmouth Bass fishery evolves in Farm Island Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nFarm Island is known to have a healthy population of Rock Bass with good size structure. Rock Bass catch rates increased from 3.1/gill net (2018) to 6.9/gill net (2020). The average size for Rock Bass was 8.8 inches with individuals measuring up to 11.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are known to be an important prey species for Walleye and Northern Pike. Other than an outlierthe unusual catch of 50.3/gill net in 1957, they have averaged 1.7/gill net. Numbers did increase from 0.6/gill net in 2018, to 1.7/net in 2020, but have always been below normal compared to similar lake types. A high abundance of Northern Pike coupled with good Walleye numbers likely keep the adult perch population at a lower level.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were sampled at levels typical for Farm Island Lake, with a catch rate of 0.3/gill net. A temperature - dissolved oxygen (TDO) profile was collected on July 20, 2020 to measure the amount of thermal habitat available for Tullibee. The TDO3 (temperature at 3 mg/l dissolved oxygen) was determined to be 22.5 degrees C and was similar to previous profiles. The water was warm from the surface to about 15 feet deep. The overall oxy-thermal habitat suitable for Tullibee was very limited with all of the data points falling outside of the critical threshold. Data collected from 2009-2020 indicate only marginal thermal habitat for Tullibee in most years, with the best conditions having been found in 2009, 2015, and 2018, although still \"poor\" compared to other lakes in the area that are monitored. Because the Aitkin Area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's Tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of Coldwater habitat.  <br> \n</p>",

Night electrofishing in the fall was used to evaluate this strategy. It was concluded that while some natural reproduction was observed, non-stocked years did not appreciably contribute to the fishery compared to stocked years. Annual monitoring of the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye will continue on Farm Island Lake. This year, sampling was conducted on September 28, 2022. Sampling time was 2 hours and resulted in a YOY Walleye catch rate of 52/hour (run time), with an average size of 6.1 inches. This catch is above average and comparable to the 2013 year class. The catch rate for age 1 Walleye was 4/hour, which is also above long-term average. Results from the electrofishing surveys, conducted since 2010, suggest that years with fry stocking have significantly higher catch rates of YOY (mean of 42/hr) than the non-stocked years (mean of 2.1/hr). Due to the lower contribution of natural year classes, Farm Island will be stocked with fry on an annual basis. It's important to note that no fry were available to be stocked in 2020 due to restrictions from the Covid-19 pandemic. Extra fry (200,000) were stocked in 2021, to help make up for the 2020 gap. It's important to note that only 1 netter was used in 2020 and 2021, but given that catches were not super high, catch rate data probably would have been similar with 2 netters. Two netters were used again in 2022.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Farm Island Lake is a large and popular lake located about seven miles south of Aitkin.  There are two public accesses with concrete log ramps, one in the northeast and one in the southwest portion of the lake.  Sand is the primary substrate around much of the lake, but scattered muck, silt, gravel, and rubble areas create diverse aquatic habitats.  Consequently, aquatic vegetation is also diverse with a variety of emergent, floating-leaf, and submerged species present.  Curly-leaf pond weed is also present.  Healthy aquatic plant communities help to break wave action and prevent erosion, stabilize bottom substrates and maintain water clarity, and provide adult spawning and juvenile rearing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked regularly since 1922, at a variety of sizes and frequencies.  The current strategy calls for high density fry stocking in three of four years, leaving a non-stocked year to evaluate the amount of natural reproduction.  A special regulation protecting walleye 16\"-19\" has been in place since 1996 to improve angler catch rates of those sizes of fish, and has largely been successful.  The walleye assessment catch rate of 6.1 per gill net was slightly lower than the previous survey, but was within the expected range for similar lakes and within the goals for the current management plan.  The 2013 walleye catch was composed of 53% less than 16\", 30% within the protected slot, and 17% greater than 19\".  Age analysis found eleven year-classes and revealed that limited natural reproduction still occurs, as some fish in the sample were from the most recent non-stocked year.  The 2011 year class appeared strong as young of the year in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey and continued to be strong in the 2013 gill net assessment.  These fish averaged 11 inches at the time of the survey, which resulted in a slightly smaller average size for the sample (14.5\" and 1.2 pounds) than the previous survey.  This year class will also likely influence angler catches for the next several years. Given normal growth rates, they should be of sizes anglers prefer by the end of the 2014 open water season.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches continue to be above the expected range for similar lakes.  Size was poor, but also similar to previous surveys, averaging 20.6\" and 1.8 pounds with just 8% greater than 24\".  Larger pike play an important role in regulating survival and growth of various species.  Anglers should consider releasing fish greater than 24\" to help protect the vital function these fish provide, and allow additional opportunities for others. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass anglers will find ample habitat to fish.  While bass are not typically sampled in high numbers by standard survey gear, several year classes were identified and fish up to 19\" were captured.  In addition, an adult smallmouth bass was captured for the first time on Farm Island Lake in 2013.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and black crappie populations displayed better growth and lower abundance than the previous survey.  Black crappie tend to be relatively short-lived and reach harvestable size in about four years, while bluegill can live for over a decade and require at least six years to reach 7\".  The lake does produce quality-sized fish of both species. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake also supports a small population of tullibee (northern cisco), a species that requires adequate coldwater habitat to survive.  Temperature and oxygen monitoring conducted from 2009 to 2013 indicate only marginal habitat is available to tullibee in most years.  Only one tullibee was captured during the 2013 survey.  The lake will continue to be monitored for any changes to thermal habitat that could impact the fish community.</p>",

Night electrofishing in the fall was used to evaluate this strategy.  Sampling was conducted on October 3, 2016, to monitor abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye. Sampling time was 2.2 hours and resulted in a YOY walleye catch rate of 20.5/hour (run time), with an average size of 6.8\". The catch rate for age 1 walleye was 1.4/hr.  Results from the five electrofishing surveys conducted since 2010 suggest that years with fry stocking have significantly higher catch rates of YOY (123/hour in 2011, 50/hour in 2013, 40/hr in 2015, 20.5/hr in 2016) than the non-stocked years (3/hour in 2010 and 2014).  Due to the lower contribution of natural year classes, Farm Island will again be stocked on an annual basis.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Farm Island is a large, hardwater lake with good clarity and is located 7 miles south of Aitkin.  It is 2,054 acres with a maximum depth of 56 feet.  There are several islands on the lake, which also has a complex bottom structure.  There are two state owned public accesses, with concrete ramps, on the lake.  One is on the north side of the lake and the other on the south end.  The one on the north side was recently completed in the fall of 2007. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population in Farm Island is looking good again this year.  There is a strong 2002 year class that is just entering the 16 to 19 inch protected slot and two strong year classes, 2004 and 2005, coming up.  The average length of the 2004 year class sampled in this survey was almost 14 inches so they should be showing up in the harvest as 14 and 15-inch walleye in 2008.  Most of the fish from the strong 1999 year class will have now grown out of the protected slot.  The males should be 19 to 20 inches long and the females up to 26 or 27 inches in length.  Although there has been a modest increase of fish within the protected slot, it appears more fish are surviving to larger sizes.  Whereas the mean gill net catch rate for walleye over 19 inches was 1.1 per net prior to the special regulation (ranging from 1.8 per net in 1970 trending down to 0.5 per net in 1991), it now averages 2.2 per net (ranging from 1.7 per net in 2000 to 2.6 per net in 2007). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike, while abundant, are still exhibiting normal growth rates.  The average length is down slightly from that seen in the last few surveys, but there are still some large fish out there.  While there are no special regulations in effect on northern pike in Farm Island, the lake association encourages anglers to harvest the smaller northern pike, while releasing fish greater than 24 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nFor those anglers who are interested in catching panfish, Farm Island has abundant populations of black crappie and bluegill.  There are two strong year classes of black crappie, the 2005 year class, which are 8 inches to 9 inches long, and the 2003 year class, which are about 11 inches long.  There appears to have been very little changes to growth rates of either species in the last sixteen or more years.  However, based on the trap net length frequency distribution and age distribution, it appears that most larger bluegill are being harvested before they have a chance to reach 8 inches, or age 7. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers targeting largemouth bass will find a good population of fish with a wide range of sizes available. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee have been decreasing in abundance since the first survey nets were set in 1957; however, this was the first year that none were sampled in the assessment gill nets.  Without tullibee in the fish community, it is feasible we will observe future decreases in growth rates for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Farm Island Lake is a large and popular lake located about seven miles south of Aitkin.  There are two public accesses with concrete log ramps, one in the northeast and one in the southwest portion of the lake.  Sand is the primary substrate around much of the lake, but scattered muck, silt, gravel, and rubble areas create diverse aquatic habitats.  Consequently, aquatic vegetation is also diverse with a variety of emergent, floating-leaf, and submerged species present.  Curly-leaf pond weed is also present.  Healthy aquatic plant communities help to break wave action and prevent erosion, stabilize bottom substrates, maintain water clarity, and provide adult spawning and juvenile rearing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms.\n\nThis survey was delayed by one week due to flood conditions on the lake. Water levels were still very high and an emergency \"NO WAKE\" restriction was in place to protect the shoreline from erosion during the course of the survey. An important item to consider when reviewing the data associated with this survey is that the survey took place in late summer during a period of extreme heat, calm winds, and high humidity, with unusual water level conditions.  These kinds of environmental conditions can have adverse effect on fish metabolism and movement, which may affect catch rates.\n\nWalleye have been stocked regularly since 1922, at a variety of sizes and frequencies.  The current strategy calls for stocking walleye fry annually beginning in 2017. This is a change from fry stocking in three of four years, while leaving non-stocked years to evaluate the amount of natural reproduction.  Fall electrofishing and gill net assessments have shown lower recruitment of natural fish in comparison to fry stocked year classes, suggesting natural reproduction is still inadequate to maintain the fishery. Age analysis found 10 year-classes and revealed that limited natural reproduction still occurs at a low level. A special regulation protecting walleye 16\"-19\" has been in place since 1996 to improve angler catch rates of those sizes of fish, and has largely been successful.  Recently, walleye assessment catch rates have fallen to 4.7/net (2016), which is below the desired threshold for the current management plan. The two year classes not stocked (2010 and 2014) would typically account for an additional 2 fish per net, whereas they tallied only 0.7/net in 2016. The new stocking strategy should remedy the current situation by reducing the chance for a weak year class, which should boost catches back above the 6 per net range by the next survey.\n\nNorthern pike catches decreased from (11.8/gill net) 2013 to (6.8/gill net) 2016 and are within the normal range for lake type, this marks the first survey that pike have been below 8/gill net since 1995.  As is typical for this lake, size was poor with a mean length of 20\" and mean weight of 1.6 pounds.   There is a small contingent of larger pike in the lake that can play an important role in regulating survival and growth of various species.  Anglers should consider releasing fish greater than 24\" to help protect the vital function these fish provide, and allow additional opportunities for others.\n\nLargemouth bass anglers will find ample habitat to fish.  While bass are not typically sampled in high numbers by standard survey gear, several year classes were identified and fish up to nearly 18\" were captured.  Low numbers of adult smallmouth bass can also be found in Farm Island Lake.  \n\nBlack crappie and bluegill catches did not vary much from recent surveys.  Black crappie catches have been fairly stable, ranging from 0 to 2 per gill net in the last 3 decades.  The catch rate of 0.7/gill net, in 2016, was slightly less than the previous survey, but was well within the normal range for this lake.  Size structure was favorable in 2016, with a mean length of 8.5\" in gill nets and 10.5\" in trap nets.  Bluegill trap net catches were 10.9/net, which is similar to three previous three surveys, back to 2010.  Bluegills had a mean length of 5.5 inches and fish up to 10 inches were sampled. The lake does produce quality-sized fish of both species.\n\nThe lake also supports a small population of tullibee (northern cisco), a species that requires adequate coldwater habitat to survive.  Temperature and oxygen monitoring conducted from 2009 to 2016 indicate only marginal habitat is available to tullibee in most years.  The lake will continue to be monitored for any changes to thermal habitat that could affect the fish community.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Farm Island Lake is a large and popular lake located about seven miles south of Aitkin. There are two public accesses with concrete log ramps, one in the northeast and one in the southwest portion of the lake.  Sand is the primary substrate around much of the lake, but scattered muck, silt, gravel, and rubble areas create diverse aquatic habitats. Consequently, aquatic vegetation is also diverse with a variety of emergent, floating-leaf, and submerged species present. The invasive species Curly-leaf pond weed is also present. Healthy aquatic plant communities help to break wave action and prevent erosion, stabilize bottom substrates, maintain water clarity, and provide adult spawning and juvenile rearing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms. Zebra mussels are also present in Farm Island Lake, which was added to the infested waters list in 2020.  Farm Island Lake is surveyed every three years, with various other surveys added in, occasionally.  Primary management is for Walleye, with Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass as secondary species.   <br> \n <br> \nFarm Island Lake has a history of Walleye stocking dating back to 1922. Fall electrofishing and gill net assessments have shown low recruitment of natural fish in comparison to fry stocked year classes, suggesting natural reproduction is inadequate to maintain the fishery at a desired level; therefore, the current strategy calls for annual stocking of Mississippi River strain Walleye fry.  No fry were available for stocking in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic protocols. The Walleye catch rate (8 per gill net) was just slightly higher than in the 2020 (6.6 per gill net) survey and met the current management goal of 6-8 per gill net.  Walleye catch rates have increased by about 1 per gill net the last three surveys, after having declined from 2007 to 2016. The long-term average catch rate is 6.8 per gill net. Walleye ranged from 7.2 to 24.6 inches, with 11 year classes represented in the sample.  Limited natural reproduction was detected from the two most recent non-stocked years, 2020 and 2014, but the majority of the sample was from fry stocked years. The 2019 and 2021 year classes appeared to be quite strong, accounting for the bulk of the fish between 11 and 18 inches.  The special regulation, requiring the release of fish 16-19 inches, continues to maintain a favorable Walleye size structure. Fish ranged from 7.2 to 24.6 inches and averaged 14 inches and 1 pound in 2023, which is similar to recent surveys. The regulation, which was implemented in 1996, was adopted to maintain and improve Walleye catch rates at Farm Island Lake. A creel survey will be conducted in 2024, to assist with continued review of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance appears to be at its highest level observed since we began assessing the population in 1946.  In 2023, the gill net catch rate was 15.9 per gill net, which is above the normal level for similar lake types and above management goals for the lake. As is typical for this lake, size structure was poor with a mean of 19.5 inches and 1.4 pounds. Only 4 of the 239 fish sample were over 26 inches, with a maximum size of 29.6 inches.  Age analysis again suggested the large increase in abundance was specifically due to a single year class from 2020, which made up nearly 70% of the sample.  Those fish were between 15 and 21 inches in length.  Because of their high abundance, the 2020 year class is also experiencing slower than normal growth rates than what is typical for Farm Island Lake.  To help improve the size structure, we encourage anglers to release larger pike and harvest the smaller, under 22 inch sized fish, as per the statewide north-central zone regulations.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catches have been fairly stable, and were once again near median for this type of lake. Size structure was also favorable, with an average length of 8.6\" and 43 percent that were 10 inches or more, and with fish up to 11.2 inches observed in the sample. Growth rates were excellent with fish reaching 10 inches in less than 4 years.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catches were low for Farm Island Lake, yet were within the normal range for similar lakes.  This lower density appears to have resulted in excellent growth rates, with fish now reaching 6 inches in 4 years.  Bluegills in the trap net sample had a mean length of 5.5 inches, with fish up to 8.6 inches that were sampled.   Some larger Bluegill were also sampled in the gill nets.  They had an average size of 7.5 inches, with fish sampled up to 9.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFarm Island is a \"go to\" lake for Largemouth Bass, which have had a very stable population. Bass electrofishing was also conducted in May of 2023.  Largemouth Bass sampled by electrofishing ranged in size up to 18.2 inches. Farm Island is known to have good bass fishing with some quality sized fish available for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass have also been observed in Farm Island in each survey since juveniles were first observed in 2010. Adults have have shown a strong increase in abundance and are now high relative to other similar lakes. While they were about equal to Largemouth Bass in the gill net sample, they were much less abundant in the electrofishing survey. The size structure was good as well, with an average length of about 13 inches and fish up to 16.8 inches present in the samples. It will be interesting to see how the Smallmouth Bass fishery evolves in Farm Island Lake as they provide anglers with another great fishing opportunity with their sporty nature.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were sampled at low levels,which is typical for Farm Island Lake.  A temperature - dissolved oxygen (TDO) profile was collected on July 31, 2023 to measure the amount of thermal habitat available for Tullibee. The TDO3 (temperature at 3 mg/l dissolved oxygen) was determined to be 19 degrees C, which is slightly colder than previous years. The overall oxy-thermal habitat suitable for Tullibee was limited to the upper layer of the water column, which is typical for this lake, yet it was the best in recent years. Data collected from 2009-2023 indicate only marginal thermal habitat for Tullibee in most years, with the best conditions having been found in 2009, 2013, 2015, 2018 and 2023. Although, even then, conditions were still \"poor\" compared to other lakes in the area that are monitored. Because the Aitkin Area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's Tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of Coldwater habitat. Typically, only a few Tullibee are caught in each gill net assessment survey. <br> \n <br> \n\t <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Special sampling was conducted in the spring of 2010 on Farm Island Lake to estimate the walleye population and evaluate spawning activity in the Ripple River and other areas around the lake.  Trap nets and electrofishing were used to mark the walleyes (spine clip) and electrofishing and short term mono gill nets were used to recapture fish and examine them for marks.  Recapture sampling was also conducted in lakes located immediately downstream (Little Pine, Hickory, and Spirit).  Although a number of different estimates were generated, the most straightforward and comparable to past estimates is a simple Peterson estimate using trap nets as the marking gear and short term gill nets as the recapture gear.  This yielded estimates of 10,288 (SE=1,167) walleyes greater than 12 inches and 7,215 (SE=879) walleyes greater than 16 inches.  Past estimates were also done in 1994 (3,100 walleyes greater than 16 inches) and 1995 (9,614, SE=2,052, walleyes greater than 12 inches; 3,476, SE=714, walleyes greater than 16 inches).  Additional information can be found in the 8/02/2010 population assessment report for Farm Island Lake.</p>",

Night electrofishing in the fall was used to evaluate this strategy. It was concluded that non-stocked years did not appreciably contribute to the fishery compared to stocked years. Annual monitoring of the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye will continue on Farm Island Lake. This year, sampling was conducted on September 29, 2021. Sampling time was 1 hour and 40 minutes and resulted in a YOY Walleye catch rate of 26.4/hour (run time), with an average size of 7.3 inches. This mean size was the largest that we have observed (6.5 inches is more typical) and bodes well for their survival. The catch rate for age 1 Walleye was 0/hour, which is the lowest catch rate for 1-year old's, but not surprising given that 2020 was a non-stocked year that yielded a low YOY catch from natural reproduction. Results from the electrofishing surveys conducted since 2010 suggest that years with fry stocking have significantly higher catch rates of YOY (mean of 41 /hr) than the non-stocked years (mean of 2.1/hr). Due to the lower contribution of natural year classes, Farm Island will be stocked with fry on an annual basis. It's important to note that no fry were available to be stocked in 2020 due to restrictions from the Covid-19 pandemic. Extra fry (200,000) were stocked in 2021 to help make up for the 2020 gap. It's important to note that only 1 netter was used in 2020 and 2021, but given that catches were not super high, catch rate data probably would have been similar with 2 netters. </p>",

The overall oxy-thermal habitat suitable for Tullibee was very limited with all of the data points falling outside of the critical threshold. Data collected from 2009-2019 indicate only marginal thermal habitat for Tullibee in most years, with the best conditions found in 2009, 2015, and 2018 although still \"poor\" compared to other lakes in the area that are monitored. Because the Aitkin Area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's Tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of coldwater habitat.</p>",
