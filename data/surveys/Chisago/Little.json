                "narrative": "<p>Little is a 159 acre lake located in southeast Chisago County near Center City.  High fertility affects water clarity through periodic algal blooms.  The number of lake residences is fairly low considering the lakes location.  Boats can be launched via a public access on the north shore of the lake.  Parking is available for aproximately 8 to 10 rigs.  Managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, the lake is stocked with 125 pounds of walleye fingerlings biennially.  Fishing pressure is high especially given the little lakes small size.  The access was frequently filled to capacity during the summer field work.Based on 2004 field results, Little Lake anglers should be optimistic.  Electrofishing results for largemouth bass have never been better on Little Lake.  Bass were both abundant and large.  Bass averaged 14.7 inches and 1.8 pounds with more than half the catch exceeding 15 inches.  Like bass, bluegill were both abundant and of quality size.  The trap net catch for bluegill was higher than in past assessments.  Half the catch was seven inches or larger, a size easily acceptable to many anglers.  Northern pike abundance was typical of Little and other lakes with a similar nature.  Northerns averaged 27.3 inches and 5.4 pounds.  Of the 30 pike measured 7 exceeded 30 inches.  Crappies were more numerous in both the trap and gill nets than they have been in the past ten years.  Trap netted crappies averaged 8.2 inches with 32% of the catch 9 inches or longer.  Yellow perch were abundant but most were not large enough to appeal to anglers.  Walleye were scarce in the gill nets.  All six walleye captured in the trap netting were large (21.9\" to 28.6\"), mature fish.  Other species sampled included; black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and spottail shiner.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Lake is a fertile 159-acre lake located in southern Chisago County northeast of Center City.  A public boat access is located along the northeast side of the lake off Little Lake Road.  Parking for 6-8 vehicles with trailers is available at the access area.  An abundance of shallow water acreage has promoted past fish winterkills of varying intensities during favorable conditions with the last documented partial fish winterkill occurring in 1978/79.  Due to varying intensities, partial winterkills may go undetected.  Little Lake has a history of fish community fluctuations as a result of these partial fish winterkills.  Currently, the DNR Section of Fisheries manages Little Lake primarily for northern pike and walleye with largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill sunfish as the secondary management species.  Present management plans call for walleye fingerling stocking on an every third year rotation.A fish population assessment was conducted during the open water season of 1999 to evaluate the current status of the fish community.  Sampling gear types included spring night electrofishing, six gill nets, eight trap nets, and two shoreline seine hauls.  The assessment indicated that northern pike and walleye abundance, average weight, and growth rate were within a normal range for lakes of this type.  Measured northern ranged from 18.8 to 31.5 inches in length with an average length of 24.0 inches, while walleye lengths extended from 17.0 to 24.3 inches with a very nice average length of 20.0 inches.  Of the 18 walleye sampled, 100% were at 17.0 inches in length or greater.  The 1999 walleye catch rate is the highest ever recorded since they were first stocked.  The walleye present in Little Lake originated primarily from stocking efforts since sampled year classes coincide with stocked years and available walleye spawning habitat was rated as poor in past evaluations.  However, some immigration from North Center Lake may occur via the outlet channel from Little Lake.  Spring night electrofishing sampled 35 largemouth bass.  This catch rate appears to be good for a lake of this size and type.  The largemouth size structure included fish from 6.3 to 18.9 inches in length with an average length of 12.0 inches.  The 1999 largemouth electrofishing catch rate remained consistent with the catch rate determined in 1994.  Little Lake largemouth growth was determined to be normal at all ages when compared to statewide growth averages.  Both black crappie and bluegill sunfish were at normal abundance levels.  The average black crappie was 7.2 inches in length while bluegill sunfish had an average length of 5.9 inches.  Current catch rates for both species were similar to catch rates found in the 1994 survey.  Yellow perch, an important food source for northern pike and walleye, numbers were well above normal for this type of lake.  The most recent survey done in 1994 found similar numbers of perch, but preceding surveys dating back to 1981 found lower abundance levels.  Natural reproduction for black crappie, bluegill sunfish, and largemouth bass showed good success.  The fish community in Little Lake was also made up of black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead.Fishing enthusiasts who target northern pike, walleye, or largemouth bass can expect nice sized fish to be a part of their catch when these species are biting.  The lake is also known to produce some larger crappie and good numbers of larger bluegill.  Anglers are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the smaller ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to catch a quality sized fish.  Little Lake is surrounded by a watershed that is composed of, in order of abundance, agricultural crop-land, undeveloped forest or woodland, pastured land, residential land, bogs and marshland.  Because land uses within a watershed surrounding a lake influence the lakes water quality, Little Lake is subject to some nutrient input from residential development and agriculture.  Since Little Lake is already considered to be of good fertility, addtional nutrient loading would decrease this lakes water quality and overall health.  Prevention of further nutrient input can be achieved by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips of native plants along the shoreline, updating outdated or failing lake-home septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizers on surrounding lawns or agricultural fields, utilizing crop farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removal, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",

It is a relatively small (159 acre) shallow lake (maximum depth 23 feet), of which 78% (124 acres) is  15 feet or less).   This high fertility lake has been documented to experience winterkills occasionally, with previous occurrences in 2014 and 2020. In 2023 there were reports of dead fish observed after ice out.  A trap net survey in June 2023 found only Golden Shiner, Yellow Perch, and Black Bullhead. This indicates that a severe but not total winterkill did occur during the winter of 2022-2023. The current lake management plan calls for surplus Walleye fry stocking as well as restocking adult Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass following a winterkill if warranted and available.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Lake (lake class 30) is a panfish-largemouth bass lake managed primarily for northern pike and walleye.  Walleye fingerling stocking occurs on a 3-year rotation.  This lake is known for its fluctuations in fish populations associated with winterkills.  The last confirmed severe winterkill happened during the winter of 1978-79.  Minor winterkills occur erratically and may go undetected.  On June 13-17, 1994, a lake survey was conducted to evaluate the present fish population status.  Gear types consisted of 6 gillnets and 9 trapnets.  Additional fish sampling included night electrofishing for largemouth bass on May 27, 1994 and shoreline seining on August 17, 1994.The northern pike abundance was within the normal range for this type of lake.  In the 6 surveys since 1973, the catch has been either normal or above normal.  Their lengths from this survey ranged from 17.8 to 33.8 inches averaging 25.8 inches.  Mean weight was 4.1 pounds which was above the expected norm.  These were typical sizes for northern pike in Little Lake as they have always been on the heavier side of normal.  Ages 1-6 were sampled with good representation from all age classes.  Ages 4-6 made up 76% of the sample.  Growth rates were typical for lakes of this type.The walleye gillnet abundance was also within the normal range.  They ranged in length from 11.5-25.6 inches and averaged 19.0 inches.  Mean weight was 2.6 pounds.  Ages 2, 3, 5, and 8 were sampled with growth being faster than average for the first 3 years of their life.  Age 3 walleyes (1991 year class) did not match the stocking year for Little Lake.  They could be migrant fish from North Center Lake which was stocked in 1991.The largemouth bass sampled by electrofishing found their abundance levels to be similar to average levels for lakes of this type.  The lengths ranged from 6.7 to 16.8 inches averaging 11.7 inches.  Mean weight was 0.9 pounds.  It is common to sample many smaller fish than larger fish using this method.  Ages 2-7 were sampled with ages 3 and 4 making up 73% of the catch.  Growth rates were normal for this lake type.  Shoreline seining sampled 54 young-of-year (YOY) in a 0.072 acre area.  They averaged 2.91 inches.  The seining is to check on natural reproduction for that year.The yellow perch abundance was the highest catch in the past 6 surveys.  They ranged from 5.0 to 9.3 inches averaging 5.8 inches.  In previous the surveys, perch abundance was usually within the expected normal ranges for this lake.  Perch provide agood food base for the northern pike and walleye.  Shoreline seining sampled 11 YOY averaging 2.40 inches.The bluegill abundance was within the normal range.  They ranged between 3.0 to 9.2 inches with an average of 6.7 inches.  Ages 1-7 were sampled with ages 3, 4, and 5 making up 90% of the catch.  Age 4 (1990 year class) represented almost 50% of the total sample.  Growth rates were within normal ranges.  Shoreline seining only sampled 12 YOY bluegills.  They averaged 1.31 inches.  Perhaps there was poor hatching success this year which can account for the low bluegill YOY catch.The black crappie abundance was also within the normal range.  This catches was lower than the previous 3 surveys.  Crappie lengths this year ranged from 4.5 to 10.2 inches with an average of 8.7 inches.  Ages 2-5 were sampled with age 4 being 52% of the sample.  Growth rates were typical of normal.  Shoreline seining captured 66 YOY.For the first time, one common carp was caught in the trapnets.  It was 21.7 inches long and weighed 4.6 pounds.  During night electrofishing on May 27, 1994, three carp were observed ranging from 18 to 22 inches.  This was the first official DNR sighting of carp in these waters.  Their way into the lake was most likely resultant of the high water table in the mid-1980's when the Chisago Chain of Lakes were so high.  At that time, migration from the Sunrise River was apparent.     Six other species were sampled by test nets: bowfin, black bullhead, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and white sucker.  All species were within their respective normal abundance ranges except for pumpkinseed and white sucker, they had low abundance levels.Prepared by Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  In June of 1989 a population assessment was performed on Little Lake.  Four trapnets and four gillnets were set to obtain data pertaining to the present fish population.  Shoreline seining was conducted in late August to evaluate natural reproduction of the various species found in the lake. \n  Based on local medians and other pertinent data the fish population can be characterized as follows:  The northern pike net catch (9.25/set) increased from the previous survey in 1984 (6.17/set), and remained above the local median of (3.50/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 13.0 to 31.9 inches with a median length group of 26.0 - 26.9 inches.  The median length group remained unchanged from 1984, however, the mean weight dropped slightly from 5.11 pounds in 1984 to 4.54 pounds in 1989.  Thirty-nine (39) northern pike were aged representing age groups II-V. These fish displayed normal growth rates in comparison to statewide averages.\n  A walleye net catch (2.00/set) was reported for the first time in Little Lake.  Although fingerlings were stocked in 1978, walleyes have not been recorded in any previous survey.  A confirmed partial winter kill occurred during the winter 1978-79 which likely resulted in the absence of fish from the 1978 stocking.  The median length group was 15.0 - 15.9 inches and the fish ranged from 13.0 to 17.9 inches.  All ten fish that were aged fell into age group III and they displayed a normal growth rate.\n  Yellow perch net catches (7.00/set) showed a real increase from the previous survey (1.33/set), but the catch is still below the local median of (8.58/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 5.5 to 8.4 inches with 7.0-7.4 being the median length group.  The median length group in 1984 was smaller at 5.5 to 5.9 inches.\n  The black crappie (18.00/set) net catch fell from the 1984 catch of (33.25/set), however, the catch remains much above the local median (5.75/set).  A notable increase has occurred in fish size as the median length has changed from 5.0 - 5.4 inches in 1984 to 8.0-8.4 inches in 1989.  The mean weight has also increased to 0.32 pounds recently from 0.09 pounds reported during the previous survey.  Black crappies ranged in size from 6.0 to 9.4 inches in length. \n  Bluegill sunfish net catches (96.00/set) increased considerably from the previous survey (11.00/set) and were well above the local median of (20.00/set).  The median length group was 6.0-6.4 inches which is smaller than the 7.0-7.4 inch median length group of 1984.  Mean weight has also decreased from 0.37 pounds in 1984 to 0.27 pounds in 1989. The length frequency distribution ranged from 4.5 to 7.4 inches.  Normal growth rates were exhibited by the five fish that were aged. \n  The pumpkinseed sunfish (41.25/set) net catch decreased from the previous survey (58.00/set), but still remains very high in comparison to the local median of (3.00/set).  Historically, the pumpkinseed sunfish catches have been well above the local median.  The length frequency distribution ranged from 5.5 to 7.4 inches with 6.0-6.4 inches as a median length group. \n  Three largemouth bass caught by anglers were used for age and growth analysis due to the absence of the species in both the gillnets and trapnets.  The three fish ranged in size from 11.8 to 13.1 inches in length and represented age groups V and VI.  Slow growth rates were exhibited by the fish in this sample. \n  Twenty-four (24) young-of-year largemouth bass were caught in shoreline seines along with young-of- year northern pike, golden shiner, bluegill sunfish, and yellow perch. \n  Five additional species were captured during the June survey including: white sucker, bowfin, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, and hybrid sunfish.  Black bullheads and yellow bullheads showed decreases from the previous survey, however, their net catches remain above local medians.  Hybrid sunfish and white sucker were caught in numbers below the previous survey and below their respective local medians.  Bowfin were present in numbers higher than both the local median and the previous survey. \n  Golden shiner and brown bullhead were taken during test netting in 1984 but failed to be represented in the 1989 catch.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little is a 159 acre lake located in southeast Chisago County near Center City.  High fertility affects water clarity through periodic algal blooms.  The number of lake residences is fairly low considering the lakes location.  Boats can be launched via a public access on the north shore of the lake.  Parking is available for approximately 8 to 10 rigs.  Managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, the lake is stocked with 125 pounds of walleye fingerlings biennially.  Fishing pressure is high especially given the lakes small size.  The access was frequently filled to capacity during the summer field work. <br> \n <br> \nBased on 2009 field results, the high angling pressure is warranted.  Black crappies were more numerous in the gill nets than they have been in the past.  Crappies averaged just over eight inches in both the trap nets and gill nets.  Relatively few captured crappies exceeded 8.5 inches; conversely, few preceded 7.5 inches.  Largemouth bass size and abundance remains good, though lower than in 2004.  Thirty six percent of the bass captured were over 13 inches in length.  Like bass, bluegill abundance decreased.  However, bluegill size quality was high with a 7.2 inch average and few individuals less than 7 inches, a size acceptable to many anglers.  Northern pike abundance, though lower than past assessments remained typical of Little and other lakes with a similar nature.  Northerns were quality sized averaging 26.3 inches and 4.4 pounds.  Like bluegill, yellow perch numbers were down some but with a subsequent increase in size structure.  Forty two percent of the perch catch exceeded 8 inches in length, a harvestable size for many anglers.  Walleye remained scarce based on the gill net catch.  Five of the six walleye captured in the netting were larger than 20 inches.  Other species sampled included; yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish) and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little is a small, fertile lake in southeast Chisago County managed primarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. Periodic winterkills have occurred on this lake with the most recent taking place during the winter of 2013-2014. In response, Walleye fry along with adult Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass were stocked that spring. This is the first survey conducted since that winterkill with electrofishing for bass taking place in May and gill nets and trap nets set in June. The previous survey was conducted in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch was higher than average for the lake class with 6.83 fish per net. This also exceeded the long range management goal for the lake. Average weight of 2.5 pounds was near average for the lake class but fell short of the management goal. Length ranged from 12.6 to 37.4 inches with a mean of 20.9. While average size is smaller than in previous surveys, this is likely an artifact of the recent winterkill removing older fish from the population. Recruitment appears to be consistent with year classes from 2005 up to 2014 all represented. Growth does not seem to be particularly fast in this lake but it has not had a negative impact on the size distribution. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were not abundant in the previous two surveys but the fry stocking following the most recent winterkill was fairly successful. Walleye were sampled at 2.6 fish per net which is above average for the lake class. Mean weight was average for the lake class at 1.64 lbs. and mean length was 17 inches. All Walleyes aged corresponded to the 2014 fry stocking. These fish most likely took advantage of the decreased competition following a winterkill in order to reach an average size of 17 inches in three years.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch of Black Crappie was only slightly above the first quartile for the lake class at 2.22 fish per net. Abundance of crappies in this lake has been historically variable. While not especially abundant, the mean size of these fish is exceptional with fish averaging .75 lbs. and 10.8 inches, well above the third quartile for the lake class. Sampled crappies ranged from 7.1 to 12.4 inches. No crappie were aged but the structure of this population has again likely been influenced by the recent winterkill. It may take some time after a winterkill before small crappie begin to show up and the adults that survived the winterkill likely experience fast growth due to a lack of competition.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate of 10.7 fish per net was up slightly from the previous survey but below average for the lake class. Mean length was 6.1 inches which is the 75th percentile for the lake class. Lengths ranged from 3.2 to 9.5 inches with a quarter of fish exceeding 8 inches. There were very few fish between 6.5 and 8.5 inches. Fish larger than that are likely adults from the pre winterkill populations while the smaller fish may be due to reproduction after the winterkill. Mean size has historically been large on this lake and may increase as the population matures post winterkill.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rate of 5 fish per net was slightly higher than the mean for the lake class. This is a decrease from previous surveys. Similar to the other panfish species in this lake average size was large, well over the third quartile for perch in this lake class. Perch ranged from 5.7 to 10 inches and averaged 8.5 inches. Forty percent of perch exceeded 9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing for Largemouth Bass sampled them at 25.4 fish per hour. This is a slightly lower rate than the previous survey and size was slightly smaller as well. Mean length was 12 inches with the largest individual sampled measuring 16.3 inches. No fish from 7.5 to 11 inches were sampled. Reproduction may have been sporadic following the winterkill until the adult population could reestablish itself. Electrofishing on this lake posed some challenges as a majority of the sampling sites were along floating bog. Fish were often seen or heard in or going under the bog where they were unavailable to this sampling technique. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Black Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Bowfin, Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n</p>",
