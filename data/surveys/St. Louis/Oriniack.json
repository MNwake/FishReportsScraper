                "narrative": "<p>Oriniack Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 13, which consists of 84 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Oriniack Lake is larger and has a more irregular shoreline shape than many of the lakes in this lake class.  The water in Oriniack Lake is slightly brown from bog stain.Oriniack Lake does not thermally stratify during the summer and retains oxygen at saturation to the bottom.  There is an inlet from Merritt Lake that has marshes and beaver dams which prevent fish migration.  The outlet (Hilda Creek) drains to the Vermilion River and has beaver dams and drops that prevent upstream fish migration.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder and sand, but the southwest bay has a bog fringe and a muck bottom.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 7 ft; water celery is the most common plant.Oriniack Lake is entirely within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) and no motors are allowed on the lake.  The boundary line for the BWCAW follows part of the north shore of the lake.  The official public access to Oriniack Lake is by a 170 rod (0.5 mile) portage from Trout Lake, which is also in the BWCAW.  There is a 25 horsepower outboard motor limit on Trout Lake and snowmobiles are not allowed.  BWCAW permits from the U. S. Forest Service are required to visit Oriniack and Trout lakes.  There are four U. S. Forest Service campsites on Oriniack Lake.Fish populations in 2003 were assessed with 12 gillnet sets.  Two previous investigations, in 1977 and 1987, each used four gillnet sets.  Trapnets have not been used in this lake due to the difficult portage access.Fish populations in 2003 were dominated by walleye and northern pike, followed by white sucker and yellow perch.  Bluegill and rock bass were also present, but their numbers were low.  The total catch of fish (all species combined) in 2003 of 18 fish/net (22 lb/net) was near the median for this lake class.Walleye numbers in 2003 (9.4/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were the median catch for the three investigations that have been conducted on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2003 averaged 13.3\" (1.0 lb) which was in the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to walleye sizes in previous investigations on this lake. The largest walleye captured in 2003 was 24.8\", and similarly sized walleye were captured in previous investigations on this lake. Walleye scales were taken for age and growth analysis in 2003 and were somewhat difficult to read, but most walleye (62 percent) appeared to be age two and three fish from the 2001 and 2000 year classes.  Walleye growth appeared to be somewhat faster than normal (in the third quartile) by area standards. Northern pike numbers in 2003 (2.3/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were similar to their numbers in previous investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2003 averaged 22.7\" (2.9 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was similar to pike sizes in previous investigations on this lake.  The largest pike captured in 2003 was 39\", which was larger than the largest pike in previous investigations on this lake.  Pike scales were taken for age and growth analysis and were difficult to read, but most pike appeared to be ages two through four, and pike growth appeared to be faster than normal (in the third or fourth quartiles, depending on the age) by area standards.White sucker numbers in 2003 (3.2/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were similar to their numbers in previous investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes were near the median for this lake class.Yellow perch numbers have declined over time, from 15.5/gillnet in 1977, to 6.0/gillnet in 1987, and to 2.8/gillnet in 2003.  Perch numbers in 2003 were in the second quartile for this lake class.  Perch sizes in 2003 averaged 6.3\", which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was smaller than in previous investigations on this lake.  The largest perch captured in 2003 was 8.6\".  Most perch captured in 2003 (65 percent) were age three, from the 2000 year class.  Perch growth was normal by area standards.  Very few parasites were observed on fish examined in 2003.  One northern pike and one yellow perch had neascus.  Neascus (black spot) is a common parasite that is native to the area.  It cannot infect humans, is often removed by filleting, and is killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

It is approximately 14 miles north of Tower and one portage off of Trout Lake.  It has a maximum depth of 17 feet and bog-stained water.  \n\nThere is only one official access to Oriniack which is a 0.6 mile portage from Trout Lake.  There is a 25 horsepower outboard motor limit on Trout Lake and snowmobiles are not allowed.  Parties looking to access Oriniack can use a motor boat to cross Trout Lake and bring a canoe with them to use once they portage to Oriniack.  BWCAW permits are required to visit Oriniack through an official entry point and there are four U. S. Forest Service maintained campsites on Oriniack.  \n\nOn June 12, 2018 Oriniack was weakly thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 70 F and a bottom temperature of 59 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish throughout the water column.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Oriniack are dominated by boulder with a few sandy bays on the north side of the lake.   Muck bottom bays exist throughout the rest of the lake.  Aquatic plants are relatively sparse, however some aquatic vegetation was present off shore from the handful of sandy bays on the north side of the lake.  One inlet enters on the south side of the lake from Merritt Lake and the only outlet (Hilda Creek) drains to the Vermilion River out of the northwest side of Oriniack.\n\nThere are no records of stocking in Oriniack Lake.\n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 25.1 fish/net which was second highest on record for the lake.  Total yield was 34.1 pounds/net which was the highest on record.  Fish species sampled were walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker, and rock bass.\n\nOne-hundred nineteen walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 9.9 fish/gill net.  This catch rate was good when compared to other lakes in the Tower area.  Sizes were also good with an average length of 14 inches with the largest walleye measuring nearly 27 inches.  Growth rates were somewhat slow as is sometimes the case in bog-stained lakes.  Walleye were aged up to 20 years old and the 2014 and 2015 year classes appeared strong.\n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 5.3 fish/net which was higher than normal compared to past surveys on the lake.  Sizes were good with the average fish weighing nearly 3 pounds.  The average length was just over 22 inches with the largest pike measuring nearly 39 inches.  These sizes were similar to fish caught in previous surveys.      \n\nThe yellow perch gillnet catch was 5.3 fish/net which was below average compared to past surveys.  The average perch weighed nearly 1/4 of a pound with an average length of 8 inches and the biggest fish measuring nearly 12 inches.  \n\nWhite sucker and rock bass were also sampled in 2018.  Both species numbers and sizes were comparable to past surveys.  \n</p>",
