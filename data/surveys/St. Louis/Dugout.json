The landscape of north side of the lake has been altered by a prescribed burn and the south side has a forest that is primarily coniferous. Some areas of bog are also present. <br> \n <br> \nAccess was obtained by following a tributary of Pine Creek that is near the south side of Dugout Lake and crossing a ridge between the two. This access is poorly defined and should be investigated prior to making an attempt to access the lake. The only USFS designated campsite that was located on the north side has been removed. Dugout Lake appears to have little use. Only four species of fish were sampled or observed in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2015 (9.0/gill net) were above average compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average pike sampled was 19.7 inches and the largest pike was 33.3 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance in 2015 (31.5/gill net) was well above average (7.6/gill net) compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average perch sampled was 7.1 inches and the largest perch was 12.3 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOne white sucker and one 8.2 inch bluegill were also sampled in the gill nets. Two small bluegill were sampled in the minnow traps.  <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
