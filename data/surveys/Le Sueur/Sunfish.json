                "narrative": "<p>Sunfish Lake is a 119-acre lake located near the town of Kilkenny in Le Sueur County. Sunfish Lake is unique in that much of its shoreline is unaltered; however, agriculture likely impacts its water quality as much of its watershed is row crops. A county-owned ramp located on the west side of the lake provides access for the public. The game fish community is dominated by centrarchids including Black Crappie, Bluegills, and Largemouth Bass. Stocking occurs only after winterkill events. A population assessment consisting of 4 gill nets and 8 trap nets was conducted on 19 June 2023 to monitor fish populations. An electrofishing survey was conducted on 23 May 2023 to assess Largemouth Bass populations. Sunfish Lake has been designated a Tier II lake within the Waterville area and future surveys will be conducted every 6 years. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant fish captured. Bluegill relative abundance was 152.8/trap net. Bluegill catch rates have ranged from 1.5/trap net in 2001 (following a winterkill) to 152.8/trap net since 1993. Bluegills ranged in length from 3.2 to 6.3 inches and averaged 4.6 inches. Bluegills were aged using scales. Six year-classes of Bluegills were present in Sunfish Lake (2017-2022). Sixty adult Bluegill were stocked in spring 2019 following a winterkill. Fish belonging to the 2019-2022 year-classes are a result of that stocking. Management goals were partially met as catch rates exceeded the goal of 30.0/trap net, but the goal of 25% of Bluegills sampled exceeding 8 inches total length was not met. However, the Bluegill population in Sunfish Lake is young and may grow to desirable size. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were affected by winterkill in 2018-2019 and Black Crappie relative abundance (1.5/trap net) was well below the lake average of 9.8/trap net. Black Crappie were aged using scales and otoliths. Age-3 and age-4 Black Crappies accounted for 12 of the 13 aged fish with a single age-8 Black Crappie present. The age-3 and age-4 Black Crappie were the result of stocking 97 adult Black Crappie in spring 2019 following the winterkill. Black Crappies ranged in length from 5.6 to 10.8 inches and averaged 8.6 inches. Management goals were not met, likely due to the proximity of the survey to winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nForty Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets in 2023(10.0/gill net). Northern Pike were sampled at rates greater than the 2017 survey (1.7/gill net) and the 2012 survey (0.7/gill net) and were likely the result of adult fish stocked in the spring of 2019 following winterkill. Ninety percent of Northern Pike sampled were greater than the legal minimum size of 24 inches and no Northern Pike less than 23 inches were sampled. It appears that natural reproduction does not occur in Sunfish Lake, and this population needs to be maintained with stocking. Management goals were met. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one Yellow Perch was sampled in 2023 despite being restocked with 2,250 adult fish in spring 2019 following winterkill. Yellow Perch numbers have been zero, or near zero, in 4 of the last 6 surveys.  <br> \nLargemouth Bass were abundant during electrofishing in 2017 but only 2 were sampled in 2023. Largemouth Bass sampled were 14.8 inches and 15.4 inches long. Twenty-five adult Largemouth Bass were stocked during spring 2021. Any Largemouth Bass produced as a result of the 2021 stocking may be too young to appear in sampling. Repeated electrofishing may be necessary at Sunfish Lake and additional stocking of adult Largemouth Bass may be required. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were captured in very low numbers in 2012 and 2017 but rebounded in 2023 with 86.5/gill net. Common Carp numbers (1.0/gill net and 0.1/trap net) continued to be low. Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and Walleye were also present, but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Sunfish Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor  <br> \n</p>",

AGE AND GROWTH ANALYSIS INDICATES THE BLUEGILL POPULATION IS SIMILAR TO THE POPULATION SAMPLED IN 1983. FISHING FOR BLUEGILLS HAS BEEN GOOD IN RECENT YEARS AND SHOULD CONTINUE. BLACK CRAPPIE CATCH RATES INCREA- SED FROM 16.00/TRAP NET IN 1983 TO 42.50/TRAP NET IN 1988. BLACK CRAPPIES ARE WELL REPRESENTED BY LARGE FISH WITH MANY FROM 7.5'-9.9', WHICH IS EXCELLENT FOR THE AREA. BLACK CRAPPIES SAMPLED ARE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1-4 COMPARED TO AGES 2-4 SAMPLED IN 1983. ONE WHITE CRAPPIE WAS SAMPLED COMPARED TO NONE SAMPLED IN 1983. THE PUMPKINSEED CATCH INCREASED FROM 3.75/TRAP NET IN 1983 TO 44.50/TRAP NET IN 1988. THE SIZE HAS IMPROVED ON PUMPKINSEEDS SAMPLED WITH MANY EXCEEDING 6.0' COMPARED TO FEW EXCEEDING 6.0 IN 1983. PUMPKINSEEDS SAMPLED IN 1983 WERE REPRESEN- TED BY AGES 1, 2, AND 4 COMPARED TO AGES 1-5 SAM- PLED IN 1988, WHEN AGE 2 WAS MOST NUMEROUS. YELLOW PERCH WERE SCARCE IN 1983, AVERAGING 0.33/ GILL NET COMPARED TO 19.67/GILL NET IN 1988. YELLOW PERCH HAVE A FAVORABLE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION WITH ANGLERS ACCEPTING THE LARGER FISH. THERE HAS BEEN A GENERAL INCREASE IN PANFISH POPULATIONS SINCE 1983, AND THIS PROBABLY REFLECTS THE REDUCED LEVEL OF PREDATION WITH THE DISCONTIN- UANCE OF STOCKING OF NORTHERN PIKE AND WALLEYE. NORTHERN PIKE HAVE DECLINED FROM 4.00/GILL NET IN 1983 TO 2.00/GILL NET IN 1988. NORTHERNS AVER- AGED 3.50/TRAP NET IN 1983 COMPARED TO 0.25/TRAP NET IN 88. THE PRESENT NORTHERN POPULATION IS DOMINATED BY SMALL FISH, WITH MOST 16.0'-19.0'. NORTHERNS SAMPLED IN 1983 WERE WELL REPRESENTED BY 12.0'-31.9' FISH, WITH MOST OF THEM FROM CONTINUED STOCKING. WALLEYE CATCH RATES DECREASED FROM 3.67/GILL NET IN 1983 TO 0.67/GILL NET IN 1988. WALLEYE CATCH RATES DECLINED IN TRAP NETS WITH NONE SAMPLED COMPARED TO 1.25/TRAP NET IN 1983. WALLEYES SAMPL- ED APPEAR TO BE THE 1979 YEAR CLASS THAT WAS SAMPLED IN 1983, AND NO REPRODUCTION APPEARS TO BE OCCURRING. THE LARGEMOUTH BASS CATCH WAS LOW, WITH ONE FISH SAMPLED COMPARED TO THREE FISH SAMPLED IN 1983. ELECTROFISHING INFORMATION FROM 5-11-84 INDICATED A GOOD BASS POPULATION PRESENT AVERAGING 28.00 FISH/HOUR WITH FISH 8.5'-18.9' IN LENGTH. HYBRID SUNFISH WERE FIRST SAMPLED IN 1988 WITH GREEN SUNFISH X PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH AVERAGING 38.25/TRAP NET, WITH A FEW BLUEGILL X PUMPKINSEED HYBRIDS SAMPLED. HYBRID SUNFISH WERE NOT SAMPLED IN 1983 NETTING. BLACK BULLHEADS DECLINED FROM 257.00/GILL NET IN 1983 TO 59.33/GILL NET IN 1988, AND TRAPNET CATCH RATES DECLINED FROM 196.50/TRAPNET IN 1983 TO 27.50/TRAP NET IN 1988. OTHER SPECIES SHOWING LITTLE CHANGE AND SAMPLED IN RELATIVELY LOW NUMBERS INCLUDE BOWFIN, GOLDEN SHINER, YELLOW BULLHEAD, GREEN SUNFISH, AND CARP.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sunfish Lake, located north of Waterville in Le Sueur Co. experienced low oxygen resulting in winterkill of fish in the 2000 u 2001 winter.  The winterkill eliminated game fish populations.  Following the winterkill, 220 lbs. of black crappie, 80 lbs. of bluegill and 26 lbs. (13 fish) of adult largemouth bass, and 47,000 northern pike fry were stocked into Sunfish Lake to reestablish game fish populations.  Seining catches in late August 2001 showed reproduction by black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, and yellow perch occurred in 2001.  Young-of-year northern pike were caught in the July netting and August seining and were likely from the fry stocking as no adult northern pike were captured.  Netting in 2003 indicated Sunfish Lake has a large population of 18 to 28 inches long northern pike with a few fish up to 30 inches.  Most of these fish were two years old in 2003 and were from the 2001 year-class.  These fast growing pike should provide excellent angling.A few large panfish u black crappie up to 12 inches and bluegill up to 8.5 inches u were netted in 2003, although most panfish were small age 1 and 2, 3 to 5 inch fish.  Quality panfish angling opportunities should return to Sunfish Lake in a few years.  Unfortunately, increased populations of carp and bullhead may hinder the reestablishment of a quality fish community.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sunfish Lake is a small 119 acre lake located near the Town of Kilkenny in Le Sueur County. Sunfish Lake is unique in that much of its shoreline is unaltered; however, agriculture likely impacts its water quality as much of its watershed is row crops. A county-owned ramp located on the west side of the lake provides access for the public. The game fish community is dominated by Black Crappie, Bluegills, and Largemouth Bass. Stocking has not occurred at Sunfish Lake because natural reproduction is sufficient to sustain fish populations. Winterkill affected over 30 Waterville area lakes during the 2013-2014 winter, although there was no sign of a strong kill at Sunfish Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey consisting of three gill nets and 9 trap nets was conducted on June 19th, 2017 to monitor fish populations. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). An electrofishing survey was conducted on May 9th, 2017 to assess the Largemouth Bass population.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant fish captured at 30.6/trap net. Catch rates in 2017 were much lower than in 2012 (55.2/trap net). Historically, Bluegill catch rates have ranged from 1.5/trap net in 2001 (following a winterkill) to 78.5/trap net in 1988. Three year classes of Bluegill were present in Sunfish Lake (2013-2015). Age estimates indicated a young population as 2 year-old fish accounted for 90% of the Bluegill aged. Although the Bluegill population was young, Bluegill size structure was moderate with 57% being greater than 6.0 inches in length. Bluegills ranged in length from 2.2 to 8.4 inches and averaged 5.9 inches. Management goals were partially met as catch rates exceeded the goal of 30.0/trap net, but the goal of 25% of Bluegills sampled exceeding 8 inches total length was not met. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates (9.1/trap net) were much lower than in 2012 (35.3/trap net). Age estimates indicated four year classes present in Sunfish Lake (2012-2015). Three year-old Black Crappies were the most abundant and accounted for 60% of crappies sampled. Size structure of Black Crappies reflected the young population, with only 2% being greater than 10 inches long. Black Crappies ranged in length from 5.0 to 10.6 inches and averaged 7.1 inches. Management goals are being met, as catch rates have exceeded 30/trap net and size structure met the desired threshold (25% >8.0 inches). <br> \n <br> \nOnly 5 Northern Pike were sampled in 2017 (1.7/gill net). Northern Pike were also scarce in 2012, being captured at a rate of 0.7/gill net. Historically, Northern Pike have been abundant in Sunfish Lake particularly after being restocked in 2001. Catch rates have steadily declined since this stocking, going from 33.0/gill net in 2003, to 16.0/gill net in 2004, to 5.7/gill net in 2006, to 0.7/gill net in 2012. It appears that natural reproduction is limited and that this population needs to be maintained with stocking. Management goals were not met. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates were 7.3/gill net, which was less than 2012 (15.3/gill net), but greater than the lake average (6.1/gill net). The average length of Yellow Perch was 5.8 inches and lengths ranged from 5.5 inches to 6.3 inches. All Yellow Perch sampled were from the 2014 year class (age-3) except for a single fish from the 2012 year class (age-5). <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were abundant during the day-time electrofishing survey (154.9/hour). The average length of Largemouth Bass sampled was 10.1 inches and lengths ranged from 5.2 inches to 19.3 inches. Largemouth Bass up to age-12 were sampled. No previous electrofishing surveys exist to compare. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead have historically been abundant in Sunfish Lake; however in 2017 they were rare (0.7/gill net and 0.3/trap net). Common Carp had also been very abundant in this system (greater than 17.0/gill net) but were captured at a rate of 2.0/gill net in 2017, which was near the median for class 30 lakes (1.8/gill net). Bowfin (dogfish), Yellow Bullhead, and Golden Shiner were also present, but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of small and medium sized fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Sunfish Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor  <br> \n</p>",

ALL WALLEYES SAMPLED WERE 5 YEAR CLASS, WHICH WOULD INDICATE A FRY STOCKING (NO RECORD). PANFISH NUM- BERS ARE LOW COMPARED SIMILAR LAKES. BLACK CRAPPIE AVERAGE ABOUT HALF THE LOCAL AVERAGE. BLUEGILL ARE LOW WITH 1/3 THE LOCAL AVERAGE CAUGHT AND FOUR YEAR CLASSES PRESENT. FAIR NUMBERS OF PUMPKINSEED ARE PRESENT ABOUT THE SAME AS LOCAL AVERAGE. PERCH NUMBERS WERE VERY LOW AND PROBABLY REFLECT THE STRONG PRESITOR POPULATION. GOLDEN SHINERS WERE FOUND IN HIGH NUMBERS WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR THE AREA. ROUGHFISH WERE DOMINATED BY BLACK BULLHEAD THAT EXCEED THE LOCAL AVERAGE BY 3.5 TIMES.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sunfish Lake experienced low oxygen resulting in winterkill of fish in the 2000-2001 winter.  Following the winterkill, 220 lbs. of black crappie, 80 lbs. of bluegill and 26 lbs. (13 fish) of adult largemouth bass, and 47,000 northern pike fry were stocked into Sunfish Lake to reestablish game fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nUnfortunately, common carp and bullheads dominate the fish community of Sunfish Lake, hindering the re-establishment of gamefish to a certain extent.  The successful fry stocking of northern pike in 2001 resulted in a good population of this species over the past several years.  Since 2004, the population appears to be in decline.  Netting in 2006 yielded pike from 18 to 26 inches in length.  Spring trap netting for adult brood stock indicate even larger fish in the population.  Most pike captured belonged to the 2001 year-class.  The lack of younger fish may indicate poor reproduction or recruitment and may result in poor fishing for this species in the future.  Netting indicated that bluegill and crappie were present in large numbers.  Size was typically small but growth was good.  Given the current age structure of the panfish populations, quality panfishing opportunities may return to the lake within a few years.  Sunfish Lake also supports a healthy population of largemouth bass.  Bass captured during electrofishing included good numbers of quality-sized fish and should provide good angling opportunities.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sunfish Lake is a small 119.0 acre lake located near the Town of Kilkenny in Le Sueur County. Sunfish Lake is unique in that much of its shoreline is unaltered (except north shore); however, agriculture likely impacts its water quality as much of its watershed is row crops. A county-owned ramp located on the west side of the lake provides access for the public. The game fish community is dominated by centrarchids including black crappie, bluegills, and largemouth bass. Stocking has not occurred at Sunfish Lake because natural reproduction is sufficient to sustain fish populations. A population assessment was conducted on 6-25-2012 to monitor fish populations using 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nDissolved oxygen ranged from 9.8 ppm at the surface to 0.1 ppm at 22.0 feet deep. Thermal stratification of the water column occurred at 9.0 to 11.0 foot of depth as evidenced by the temperature dropping from 74.1 to 72.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The water appeared brown in color, likely due to sediment runoff, and had a secchi depth of around 1.5 ft.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant fish captured and had a catch rate of 55.2/trap net, which is high when compared to similar lakes. Historically, bluegill catch rates have ranged from 1.5/trap net in 2001 (following a winterkill) to 78.5/trap net in 1988. Post winterkill, bluegill catch rates have steadily increased from 1.5/ trap net in 2001, to 10.7/trap net in 2003, to 30.6/trap net in 2006 to 55.2/trap net in 2012. Six year classes were present in Sunfish Lake (2006 \u0013 2011). Age estimates indicated a relatively young population, as bluegills age-4 or less accounted for 82% of the sample. Although the bluegill population was young, bluegill size structure was good with 44% being greater than 6.0 inches in length. Bluegills ranged in length from 2.4 to 8.1 inches and averaged 5.5 inches. Growth of bluegills at Sunfish Lake appears to be good with lengths averaging 3.1 inches at age-1, 4.5 inches at age-2, 5.3 inches at age 3, 6.6 inches at age-4, and 7.5 inches at age-5.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates (35.3/trap net) were extremely high in Sunfish Lake. Post winterkill, catch rates have steadily increased from 1.0/trap net in 2001 to 35.3/trap net in 2012. Scale and otolith ages indicated that there are several black crappie year classes present in Sunfish Lake including 2005, and 2007-2011. Age-1 black crappies were the most abundant and accounted for 45% of crappies sampled, with the oldest sampled black crappie being age-7. Size structure of black crappies was small, with only 9% being greater than 10.0 inches long. Black crappies ranged in length from 3.3 to 11.2 inches and averaged 6.1 inches. Despite having a small size structure, black crappies appear to grow fast in Sunfish Lake, having average lengths of 4.0 inches at age-1, 6.8 inches at age-2, 7.8 inches at age-3, 9.6 inches at age-4, and 10.6 inches at age-5. Black crappies grow fast in this system, but likely do not attain greater lengths because of angling mortality. <br> \n <br> \nPrior to this survey, yellow perch had not been sampled in 3 surveys since 2001. In 2012, yellow perch were captured at a rate of 15.3/gill net, which is consistent with gill net catches prior to 2001, and is high when compared to similar lakes. Yellow perch were small with no fish exceeding 9.5 inches in length and averaging 7.2 inches. Yellow perch were present from 4 year classes, 2007-2011 (age-2 to age-5).  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were scarce in 2012, being captured at a rate of 0.7/gill net. Historically, northern pike have been abundant in Sunfish Lake particularly after being restocked in 2001. Catch rates have steadily declined since this stocking, going from 33.0/gill net in 2003, to 16.0/gill net in 2004, to 5.7/gill net in 2006, to 0.7/gill net in 2012.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead have historically been abundant in Sunfish Lake; however in 2012 they were sparse (0.3/gill net and 0.1/trap net). Common carp had also been very abundant in this system (greater than 17.0/gill net) but were captured at a rate of 5.3/gill net in 2012. Several largemouth bass (N=17) were captured (5.0 to 19.7 inches) which may indicate an abundant population because largemouth bass are typically not caught by these gears. One white sucker was captured which is the first time they have been observed in a survey. Golden shiner, white sucker, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed were also present, but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Sunfish Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sunfish Lake, located north of Waterville in Le Sueur Co. experienced low oxygen resulting in winterkill of fish in the 2000 - 2001 winter.  The winterkill eliminated game fish populations.  Following the winterkill, 220 lbs. of black crappie, 80 lbs. of bluegill and 26 lbs. (13 fish) of adult largemouth bass, and 47,000 northern pike fry were stocked into Sunfish Lake to reestablish game fish populations.  Seining catches in late August 2001 showed reproduction by black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, and yellow perch occurred in 2001.  Young-of-year northern pike were caught in the July netting and August seining and were likely from the fry stocking as no adult northern pike were captured.  Quality angling opportunities should return to Sunfish Lake in a few years.  Unfortunately, increasing populations of carp and bullhead may hinder the reestablishment of a quality fish community.  </p>",
