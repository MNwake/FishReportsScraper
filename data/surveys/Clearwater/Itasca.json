                "narrative": "<p>Lake Itasca is a 1,077-acre lake, located 30 miles southwest of Bemidji, MN and is the headwaters of the Mississippi River.  A targeted survey was completed on Lake Itasca by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during August of 2020 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 14 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community.  Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted where possible.  A total of seven sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites.  A total of 18 species of fish were sampled, which included five species (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass) that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from standard survey completed in 2020 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Lake Itasca.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Tullibee (cisco), Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nAccording to the survey, Lake Itasca is in good health with a FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Itasca is a 1065-acre lake located in Itasca State Park and famously known as the headwaters of the Mississippi River.  This historic site attracts visitors to the lake by offering hiking trails, watersport, and angling opportunities.  Lake Itasca is categorized as a moderately productive lake and is surrounded by coniferous and mixed hardwood forests.  Itasca has a mean water clarity of 5 feet and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  The main public boat access is located on the north arm and has room for 20 vehicles.  The east arm has a second access located by Bear Paw Campground and a fishing pier is maintained near Douglas Lodge, on the southernmost portion of the arm. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary gamefish species targeted by anglers include Walleye, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Muskellunge, and Yellow Perch.  A standard survey was completed on Lake Itasca in 2020 to assess the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance decreased from 2015 and was below average for the lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 10 to nearly 26 inches and averaged almost 16 inches.  Even with lower abundance the population is healthy with a strong year class from 2017.  Walleye fry are stocked on an alternate year rotation to compensate for inconsistent natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates were above average from previous surveys.  Bluegill ranged from 3 to 10 inches in length and averaged nearly 6 inches.  Six year classes of Bluegill were sampled.  Average length at 4 years of age was nearly 8 inches, indicating a healthy and fast growing population.  In addition to the special regulation (limit of 5 sunfish), it is recommended that anglers keep smaller sunfish and release the largest fish to maintain a balanced population. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 76 Black Crappie were captured and total lengths ranged from 4 to 12 inches.  Natural reproduction continues to be consistent with multiple year classes present in the lake.  Black Crappie averaged 10 inches at 4 years of age, indicating fast growth.  The current Black Crappie special regulation is a 5 fish limit to help sustain the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was similar to recent surveys but below average for the lake.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 13 to 32 inches and averaged around 21 inches.  Northern Pike averaged just under 2 pounds with 31% greater than 22 inches in length.  This should provide anglers a good opportunity to catch harvestable sized fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was below average for the lake but still considered normal compared to similar lakes in the area.  Yellow Perch are an important forage species for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Muskellunge.  Yellow Perch were generally too small to interest anglers as lengths ranged from 5 to 11 inches and averaged only 7 inches.  Less than a quarter of the sample was larger than 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOnly 7 Tullibee (Cisco) were captured and ranged from 8 to 15 inches in length.  Cisco require cold water habitat to survive and are difficult to catch with standard survey nets.  Like Yellow Perch, nutritionally rich Cisco are an important forage species for Northern Pike, Muskellunge, and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance was low and similar to previous surveys.  A 19 inch Largemouth Bass was captured, indicating the potential to catch larger sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nNo Muskellunge were captured during the standard survey but a low density population exists in Lake Itasca.  Other species sampled during the survey include Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been found in Lake Itasca.  AIS can be transferred by anglers and boats from infested to non-infested waterbodies.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake.  Please follow the current AIS regulations to avoid spreading to other lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Itasca, famously known as the headwaters of the Mississippi River, is a 1,077 acre lake with a diverse fish community.  Located within Itasca State Park, the lake receives many visitors and is a popular attraction for a variety of watersports including angling.  Fishing pressure in the summer is comprised mostly of park visitors but it's also a popular ice fishing lake for local anglers.  Besides Walleye, anglers often target Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  Walleye are stocked in the spring at 1000 fry/littoral-acre on an alternate year frequency.  There are also special reduced daily bag limits for sunfish (10 per day) and crappie (5 per day) on Itasca.  A creel survey conducted on lakes in the state park in 2016 will provide insight on angler catch, fishing pressure, angler behavior, and special regulation compliance. <br> \n <br> \nLake Itasca has two public accesses.  The main access is located near the swimming beach about a mile and a half south of the north entrance to the park.  The second public access is located on the south end of Bear Paw Campground.  There is also a public fishing pier maintained by Douglas Lodge on the southeast arm of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nTwo targeted, species-specific assessments were performed in 2015 along with a standard lake survey to evaluate the fish community in Lake Itasca.  The two targeted assessments were night electrofishing for Largemouth Bass and spring trap netting for Bluegills and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are relatively abundant and stable in Itasca.  During the standard survey, 50 were captured in gill nets resulting in a catch rate of 4.2 fish/net.  Walleye lengths averaged 16.3 inches and fish up to nearly 30 inches were observed.  The strong 2011 year class corresponds to a fry stocked year and appears to comprise the majority of \"eater\" sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are plentiful in Itasca and a commonly sought game fish for consumption.  A total of 81 were captured in gill nets with lengths up to 28 inches; however, the majority of pike were under 22 inches.  Nevertheless, they provide an excellent angling opportunity as well as excitement for young anglers visiting the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were targeted in the spring trap netting assessment when 125 were captured over four days.  Only 26% of the catch exceeded eight inches in length but fish up to 11.2 inches were recorded.  These uniquely larger fish are often targeted through the ice and summer success is not uncommon making sunfish one of the most popular species sought by anglers in Lake Itasca. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were captured more effectively than Bluegill in the spring trap netting and they appear to be thriving.  A total of 444 crappies were captured during the four day assessment resulting in a catch rate of 9.5 fish/net.  Lengths of crappies averaged 9.4 inches with fish up to 13.6 inches observed.  Black Crappie is another very popular species for anglers fishing Itasca. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were targeted during a night electrofishing assessment in early June.  A total of 31 bass were captured, measured, and released during the nearly two hours of electrofishing resulting in a catch rate of 16 fish/hour.  While not present in high densities, the bass were large, averaging 16.7 inches in length with the largest exceeding 19.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are another highly sought fish species in Itasca and also one of the most abundant.  Just over 780 perch were captured in gill nets with lengths up to 10.5 inches.  Approximately 20% were over eight inches in length and 8% were over nine inches.  Yellow Perch are also one of the main forage species in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge or \"musky\" as they are often called are present in the lake at assumed low densities because they are not stocked or actively managed.  However, neighboring Elk Lake, which is connected to Itasca via Chambers Creek, is annually stocked with musky fingerlings and allows fish passage under high water conditions.  Three Muskies were captured with lengths up to 40.8 inches during the assessments on Itasca in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) were also captured during the 2015 assessments.  This cold water species is important to a lake like Itasca because of its exceptionally high nutritional value.  Many large predator species like Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge rely on Tullibee to achieve large sizes.  Tullibee are occasionally targeted by anglers but the majority of the fish captured in 2015 were less than eight inches in length.</p>",

In the recent past, a number of anecdotal reports from anglers were confirmed by incidental captures of Muskellunge during other fisheries sampling in Itasca.  Since Elk Lake, directly upstream, is managed for Muskellunge, it was logical to assume that some stocked fingerlings or adults may have migrated down into Lake Itasca.  A targeted trap net assessment in 2018 was the first attempt to quantify the Lake Itasca Muskellunge population. <br> \n <br> \nIn early May of 2018, large frame trap nets were set into Itasca capturing 26 adult muskies.  Lengths ranged from 40.2 to 54.9 inches with an average of 46.0 inches.  Only one fish captured was larger than 54 inches but 35 percent were over 48 inches.  The females appear to be maturing at approximately 8 years of age; the oldest fish captured was aged at 16 years, and the largest fish was aged at 14 years old. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Itasca is in lake class 25, and fish communities are compared with similar lakes through-out Minnesota.  Bemidji area lakes in class 25 include; Long Lost, Balm, Pimushe, Beltrami, Movil, Big Buzzle, and Turtle River Lake.  Class 25 lakes in the Itasca State Park vicinity include Bad Medicine, Big Mantrap, Two Inlets, and Big Elbow.  Lakes of this class are typically deep, clear, hard-water, with an irregular shoreline. Walleye are abundant, with a population higher than average for the lake class.  The average weight was 1.5 pounds.  Sixty-five percent of the walleye sampled were more than 15 inches long and the largest walleye sampled was 30 inches long.  Walleye fry are stocked during alternate years, though nearly half of the walleye aged came from year classes when walleye were not stocked.  About 25% of the walleye examined had Neascus (black spot). Northern pike are nearly double the lake class average, with an average size of 21 inches, and 1.8 pounds.  Northern pike to 32 inches in length were sampled.  Twenty-six percent of the northern pike examined had Neascus Spp (black spot). Yellow perch were sampled at three times the average class abundance, with an average size of 6.8 inches, though perch to 12 inches were sampled.  Seventeen percent of the perch examined had Neascus, and about two percent had yellow grubs.  Bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie were all sampled at below average abundance.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed had average lengths of about 6 inches with weights of about 0.3 pounds.  Black crappie up to 13 inches long were sampled, but most were less than 5 inches long. Rock bass were captured at average abundance, though the mean weight of one pound was higher than comparable lakes. Brown bullhead are present, but the population has declined during recent surveys.  Other bullhead species were not sampled during this assessment. Tullibee (cisco) and a white suckers are above average in abundance and provide excellent forage for walleye and northern pike populations. Angler reports suggest muskellunge have been caught, though the population is probably low, and would be transient fish from nearby Elk Lake. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Itasca Lake on July 31, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 13 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 26 feet, which was just below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 9.6?C (49.3?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1960-2020 indicates marginal oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2008. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Itasca is a scenic 1,077-acre lake located within Itasca State Park in southern Clearwater County.  A state park vehicle permit is required to enter the park.  Itasca is in lake class 25, along with several other lakes in the Bemidji area such as Long Lost, Pimushe, and Turtle River Lake.  Itasca is popularly known as the headwaters of the Mississippi River.  There is a public access located on the northeast shore of the lake with a concrete boat ramp, parking for about 25 trucks/trailers, a bait shop, and boat rental.  Itasca is a popular fishing lake that provides consistent fishing for panfish (bluegill and black crappie), walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  Special regulations (reduced bag limits) aimed at maintaining or improving average size of bluegill and black crappie were implemented on Lake Itasca in 2007.  The daily and possession limit for bluegill is ten fish and for black crappie it is five fish.   <br> \nThe 2010 population assessment showed walleye numbers (5.6/GN) well above the median value for this lake class.  Walleye fry are stocked in alternate years in Lake Itasca, and stocking has been successful in providing a consistent walleye fishery.  Average size of walleye (1.08 pounds) declined from the last assessment (1.58 pounds) due to high numbers of age 1 to 3 fish in the sample.  Age 3 walleye (2007 year class) were particularly abundant, and this age class of fish should drive the fishery for the next few years. Growth rates for walleye are excellent; age 3 walleye averaged 15.1 inches in length.  Lake Itasca stratifies at about 18 feet in the summer months, so anglers should concentrate on water shallower than this depth.  Itasca has a reputation for producing large bluegill and black crappie.  Catch rates for these species declined from the most recent assessment (2005) and were below the median for this lake type.  Although numbers appear to be down, large bluegill and crappie are present and worth the effort in pursuing.  The largest bluegill captured in the assessment was 10.4 inches in length (over 1 pound), and the largest black crappie was 14.1 inches in length.  Largemouth bass electrofishing catch rates for Itasca (<10/hr) are lower than most lakes managed for bass in the area, but the population is fishable and there are some large bass inhabiting the wild rice beds in the lake.  Northern pike catch rates declined from the previous assessment, but approached the median for this lake class.  Average size has remained consistent over the last few surveys at 1.8 pounds (20.6 inches in length).  Northern pike can provide good fishing action when other species become inactive due to weather changes.  The largest northern pike captured in the assessment was 34.1 inches in length.  Northern pike can be found in a wide variety of habitats in Lake Itasca, and are commonly caught by anglers.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Itasca is situated in Itasca State Park and is surrounded by pine forests, floating bogs, and an abundance of clean, clear northwoods air.  Lake Itasca is popular with a variety of park visitors and is utilized for a variety of recreational pursuits.  Among the many uses of the lake, family angling is quite popular.  A State Park permit is required to use the public access and boat rentals are available on the lake.  Primary fisheries management on Lake Itasca is for walleye while secondary management is for bluegill and black crappie.The amount of contribution from natural reproduction to the walleye population has been difficult to ascertain, but gill net catch rates have made substantial improvements since walleye stocking was resumed in 1984.  Walleye catch rate in 2000 was more than twice that in any previous assessment.  The average length of the sample was 15.3 inches, and the largest fish sampled was 27.2 inches.  Aging of the 2000 sample would indicate that the catch rate was heavily influenced by good recruitment of walleye from the 1995, 1996 and 1997 year classes.  The 1995 and 1997 year classes may have been augmented by fry stocking, but any fish originating in 1996 would be attributed to natural reproduction.Northern pike assessment catch rates have remained relatively stable over seven assessments in the past 25 years.  Consistent natural reproduction results in a variety of sizes of northern pike in the lake.  The average length of the pike sampled in 2000 was 20.6 inches, and the maximum length sampled was 29.8 inches.Angling for sunfish is quite popular on Lake Itasca.  The sunfish community is composed of bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and an occasional hybrid sunfish.  Scale aging suggests a preponderance of bluegill from the 1998 year class that averaged 4.5 inches long in the 2000 assessment, but enough larger bluegill were present to spark the interest of anglers.  Pumpkinseed sunfish are also an important part of the panfish community and are equally as common as bluegill.  Their average size is smaller than bluegill, but they do reach a size acceptable to anglers.  Rock bass are common as well, and they are easily enticed to bite.  Though not generally sought by anglers, their fighting ability, for their size, is second to none.Yellow perch, tullibee, and white sucker are the primary forage fishes in Lake Itasca.  Perch are abundant and some are large enough to be acceptable to anglers.  Tullibee, a high protein prey utilized by larger fish, are less abundant now than in years past, but some variation in their population level is normal.  White sucker are another prey species utilized primarily by larger fish.  They are quite common and their population level has remained relatively constant over the assessment history.The current assessment sampled black crappie at a low level which is probably indicative of the current population level.  Black crappie trap net catch rates have never documented what local lore has indicated about the crappie population, that is, that crappie fishing was great back in the good old days.  However, with the infrequent assessment history of Lake Itasca in earlier years, and with the cyclic nature of  black crappie populations in this area, it is certainly possible that brief crappie population booms were missed entirely by netting assessments.Largemouth bass are abundant in Lake Itasca and they are important to anglers.  However, our nets sample bass with varying degrees of effectiveness and give little indication of the present status of the population.  Electrofishing targeting largemouth bass has not been attempted to date.Fish species sampled in smaller numbers in the 2000 assessment included:  Brown bullhead, black bullhead, tadpole madtom, hybrid sunfish, and golden shiner.</p>",

At one time, this 1,077 acre lake was known for producing large sunfish but heavy fishing pressure targeted at these fish in the early 2000s prompted concerns about over harvest of large Bluegill.  In 2007, a special reduced bag limit of 10 sunfish was implemented to decrease harvest rates.  A series of special targeted sunfish assessments were implemented from 2004 through 2016 to evaluate the effectiveness of the regulation.  Due to a continued decline in Bluegill size structure and abundance, further restrictions on sunfish harvest were deemed necessary, resulting in the current regulation of a 5 sunfish daily bag limit. Evaluation of this regulation is ongoing. <br> \n <br> \nIn late May of 2023, a targeted sunfish assessment was conducted in Lake Itasca. An impressive total of 1,071 Bluegills were captured during the three days of netting. Sunfish abundance appears to have greatly increased since the last surveys in 2015-16. Bluegill lengths averaged 5.8 inches and fish over 9 inches were observed and released. A follow-up assessment is scheduled for the spring of 2024. <br> \n</p>",

A total of 46 adult muskies were captured using trap nets and electrofishing.  Lengths of captured Muskellunge ranged from 40 to nearly 55 inches; 17% of the fish captured were larger than 50 inches in length. The assessment resulted in a population estimate of about 56 mature muskies in Itasca. The two largest fish captured were 15 years old.   <br> \n</p>",
