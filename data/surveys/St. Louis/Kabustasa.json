Access through private property requires permission, although taking a canoe up the outlet is a possibility.     The 1999 population assessment found high numbers of small northern pike.  Average length was 20.3 inches and only a few pike over 24 inches were sampled.  Normal numbers of yellow perch were caught and ranged up to 12.1 inches.     Anglers might also encounter an occasional black crappie, pumpkinseed or walleye in this lightly fished lake.</p>",
