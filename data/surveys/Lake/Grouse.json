Average size was about 1.1 pound, with walleye up to 22.6 inches (4.1 pounds) sampled.  Grouse Lake had been stocked every even year with walleye fry until 2000, when walleye fry stocking was discontinued.Northern pike were collected in average numbers, but the average weight was only 1.7 pounds.  The largest northern pike collected in 2004 was 27.9 inches (5.0 pounds).Bluegill numbers were in the average range, compared to other lakes in this class, including some quality size fish.  Overall size of the bluegill was small (5.1 inches); however, there were a few fish sampled that were between 8 and 9 inches.Black crappie were collected in relatively low numbers, which is typical for this lake.  In past years some quality size black crappie have been sampled, but in the 2004 assessment the fish sampled were fairly small with an average length of 7 inches and a maximum length of 7.4 inches.Yellow perch were sampled in average numbers, including a few fish between 9 and 10 inches.  The average length was about 7 inches; most of the fish were too small to interest anglers.One very small largemouth bass was sampled in 2004.  This species is know to be present in Grouse Lake; however, the carry-down access prevents suitable electrofishing equipment from being used to assess the largemouth bass population.The public access to Grouse Lake is a short foot path suitable for carrying a small boat or canoe to the lake.  There are no camping facilities at the access or around the lakeshore.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grouse Lake is located 7.5 miles northwest of Isabella, MN in the Superior National Forest.  The access road (Grouse Lake Road) is off of USFS Road 177 (Mitawan Lake Road).  There is a short 100 foot carry-in access along Grouse Lake Road suitable for small boats and canoes.  There is parking for a couple vehicles near the access.  Grouse Lake has an area of 119.23 acres and a maximum depth of 11.0 feet.  Two inlets enter the lake, and there is one outlet, the Little Isabella River.   <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was performed in the spring of 2017 for the first time on Grouse Lake to collect information on the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of ten Bluegill were caught in ten trap net sets, below average for similar lakes in the area.  The average weight was 0.34 pounds.  The size ranged from 3.82 inches to 9.49 inches.  Five year classes were found with scale aging and growth was average for the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nOnly two Black Crappie were sampled during the survey.  One Black Crappie measured 10.63 inches (0.62 pounds), and the other crappie was 11.54 inches (0.79 pounds).   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie lakes in the Finland Area tend to have small populations of fast growing fish that may have an occasional strong year class.  The spawning habitat in Grouse Lake for Bluegill and Black Crappie appears to be good, but the cool climate of the northeastern Minnesota may be a limiting factor in successful reproduction.    <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled with trap nets during the targeted survey include Northern Pike, Walleye, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  There were two Northern Pike caught which measure over 30 inches in length; one being 38.62 inches (16.09 pounds) and the other 39.61 inches (16.53 pounds). <br> \n</p>",

The designated public access requires a 75 foot carry from the Grouse Lake Road across federal land.The fish sampled in DNR test nets in 1998 were: walleye, northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow perch and white sucker.  Walleye were sampled in average numbers compared to other lakes of this type.  Walleye ranged in size from 6.6 inches to 20.4 inches with fish in the 13 inch to 14 inch range by far the most common.Northern pike were collected in average numbers and ranged from 10.5 inches to 24.8 inches.  Northern pike are mostly small averaging about 1 pound each.Bluegill and black crappie were sampled in below average numbers, which is typical for this lake.  The few panfish that were sampled were of quality size with bluegill averaging 9.2 inches and fish up to 10.2 inches observed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grouse Lake is located 7.5 miles northwest of Isabella and is 119 acres in size with a maximum depth of 11 feet.  There is a carry-in access with a 100 foot trail suitable for small boats and canoes on Grouse Lake Road a short distance west of USFS Road 177 (Mitawan Lake Road).  The water has a brown, bog-stained color that limits visibility to about 3 feet in summer.  Much of the shoreline is Forest Service land although a small number of cabins on private land are scattered along the north side of the lake.  The aquatic plant community has several submerged plant species with emergent and floating leaf plant beds distributed around the lake.  Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Walleye are the most common game fish species sampled in survey gear. <br> \n <br> \nA standard fisheries survey was conducted in July 2017 to monitor the status of the fish community and associated aquatic habitat.  Walleye catch was below average relative to similar lakes in northeastern Minnesota.  The average size was 15.6 inches and 1.5 pounds with 58% of the catch over 15 inches long.  The largest Walleye sampled was 19.7 inches long and weighed 2.4 pounds.  Analysis indicated consistent recruitment to the population with eight year classes identified in the catch.  Walleye growth was average compared to other lakes in the area. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie lakes in the Finland Area tend to have small populations of fast growing fish that occasionally produce a strong year class.  Spawning habitat in Grouse Lake is good, but the cool climate of northeastern Minnesota may limit their production.  Both species were captured within the normal range for similar lakes and exhibited average growth for the area.  Bluegill size was decent with 14% of the catch greater than 8 inches and the largest fish measuring 9.5 inches and 0.8 pounds.  While not particularly abundant, Black Crappie size was favorable with 35% of fish captured greater than 10 inches and the largest fish measuring 12.8 inches and 1.2 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch was below average for similar lakes and one of the lowest in the lakes history.  The average size was 19 inches and 2 pounds with the largest Northern Pike measuring 34.3 inches long and 11.6 pounds.  Analysis of scale samples determined year classes are produced regularly and growth is about average for Finland Area lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch was below average for similar lakes and size structure was poor.  Although not likely to be targeted by anglers, perch are an important forage species for the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker were sampled in average numbers relative to similar lakes and size averaged about 17 inches and 2pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nA single adult Largemouth Bass and handful of young of the year bass were captured during the survey.  Rock Bass and Pumpkinseed Sunfish were also sampled in standard trap nets at low numbers.  Small mesh trap nets designed to capture small bodied, non-game fish also sampled Blacknose Shiner, Common Shiner, Emerald Shiner, Sand Shiner, and Tadpole Madtom. <br> \n <br> \nGrouse Lake has a decent Walleye population with a fair number of eater size fish.  The lake also has Bluegill and Black Crappie populations that may be targeted at times by anglers.  Northern Pike have been sampled at lengths close to 40 inches which may be of interest to anglers looking to catch a trophy pike.  Grouse Lake offers a scenic setting even with the small number of cabins located along the northern shore of the lake.   <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike were present in numbers slightly below the average for this lake class. The average length was 21-inches with the largest northern pike in the sample measuring 26.3 inches.  Black crappie numbers were below average for this type of lake, the average length was 8.7 inches with one 12.6-inch crappie in the sample.  Bluegill average about a quarter-pound; their numbers were slightly above average.  Largemouth bass were found in most of the Grouse Lake investigations; the only one sampled in 2008 was 16.1 inches.  One smallmouth bass (15.2 inch) was sampled in Grouse Lake in 2008.  This was the first documented sample of the species in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nGrouse Lake has a carry-in public access, suitable for canoes and small boats.

Northern Pike are small, averaging less than 2.0 pounds each.     Yellow Perch densities historically have been low and although the 1992 catch increased over the previous catch they still are not abundant.     Black Crappie numbers appear to be very low as none were sampled in gillnets or trapnets. One Black Crappie was taken in a 1/4 inch mesh trapnet. Trapnet catches of Black Crappie have been less than 1.0/lift for the past four assessments.     Trapnet catches of Bluegill was again low although one individual in excess of 10 inches was taken. Small mesh trapnets did not sample any young-of-the-year Black Crappie or Bluegill.</p>",
