IBI data was collected in conjunction with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency watershed sampling. Twenty-four 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.  Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Nineteen fish species were represented, including young of the year gamefish species such as Walleye. Non-game species sampled included Logperch, Mottled Sculpin, Burbot, and Spottail Shiner. Young of the year White Sucker were very abundant and comprised the majority of fish sampled in many sites.</p>",

The average weight of individual pike was 3.6 lbs.  Many northern pike greater than approximately 10 lbs. were reportedly caught by anglers in Big Pine Lake during the 1986 angling season.       <br> \n     The yellow perch gill net catch rate was 99.4 per net, which is considerably higher than in 1979 and 1983.   <br> \n     The gillnet catch rate of walleyes has remained stable over the three most recent surveys.  The average weight of individual walleye was 1.2 lbs.  Walleyes up to 28.0 inches in length were sampled.  Walleye aging data for the last two surveys and seining data indicate good walleye natural reproduction in 1985, 1984, 1980, and 1979.  Aging and seining data also indicate good walleye fry stocking survival and/or natural reproduction in 1986, 1983, and 1982. Since natural reproduction and/or walleye fry stocking survival in Big Pine Lake is substantial, walleye fingerling stocking should be discontinued due to its higher cost. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Pine Lake is a 4,730-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately three miles east of Perham, MN.  Big Pine Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Little Pine and Rush Lakes via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline while the outlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake.  Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) controlled dams at the outlets of Little Pine and Big Pine Lakes impede navigability between this chain of  lakes.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwoods.  The maximum depth of Big Pine Lake is 76 feet; however, fifty percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2005 lake survey was 5.7 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 8.5 feet.  Big Pine Lake is included in class 27 of the Minnesota DNR lake classification scheme.       The shoreline of Big Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  The 1992 lake resurvey referenced nine resorts and approximately 202 homes/cottages.  DNR owned concrete public water accesses are located along the northwest and southeast shorelines of the lake.  A DNR owned earthen public water access is located along the north shoreline.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are scattered along the entire shoreline of the lake; however, the largest stands are located along the west and south shorelines.   Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush, cattail, and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     Big Pine Lake is a popular angling lake.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier walleye angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike and yellow perch are also abundant. The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       Walleye is a primary management specie in Big Pine Lake.  The test-net catch rate exceeded the normal range for class 27 lakes and the DNR long range management goal.  Walleye abundance has historically been high in Big Pine Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.6 to 27.6 inches with an average length and weight of 14.0 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2002 year class is very strong.  This year class should provide excellent walleye angling for several years.  The Big Pine Lake Association stocked 4,300 walleye fingerlings in 2002; however, this small number of fingerling most likely had a minimal effect on the strength of the 2002 year class.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction and recruitment is substantial enough to consistently sustain the walleye population at or above DNR long range management goals. Walleye attain an average length of 14.2 inches at four years of age.       An experimental walleye regulation was implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the walleye population in Big Pine Lake.  The regulation will be in effect for ten years during which time its effectiveness will be evaluated.      Northern pike population characteristics have demonstrated stability over the recent series of lake surveys.  The pike population has remained at a moderate density and natural reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 20.7 to 40.6 inches with an average length and weight of 28.0 inches and 5.2 pounds.  Pike exhibit fast growth rates with an average length of 25.8 inches at four years of age.       The yellow perch test-net catch rate indicates that perch are very abundant in Big Pine Lake.  Historical length data indicate that yellow perch size structure fluctuates.  Only two percent of the perch in this assessment were 8.0 inches or greater in length.     Other gamefish species present in Big Pine Lake include largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.       The DNR does not stock any species of fish in Big Pine Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present.  To maintain the excellent angling this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  The DNR will continue an intensive assessment program to monitor the walleye population and the extent of natural reproduction.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling in Big Pine Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   Big Pine Lake is a 4,730-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately three miles east of Perham, MN.  Big Pine Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Little Pine and Rush Lakes via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline while the outlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake. Minnesota DNR controlled dams at the outlets of Little Pine and Big Pine Lakes impede navigability between this chain of  lakes.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwoods.  The maximum depth of Big Pine Lake is 76 feet; however, fifty percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2008 lake survey was 5.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 8.5 feet.     <br> \n     The shoreline of Big Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  The 1992 lake resurvey referenced nine resorts and approximately 202 homes/cottages.  DNR owned concrete public water accesses are located along the northwest and southeast shorelines of the lake.  A DNR owned earthen public water access is located along the north shoreline.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are scattered along the entire shoreline of the lake; however, the largest stands are located along the west and south shorelines.   Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush, cattail, and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.   Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Big Pine Lake is a popular angling lake.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier walleye angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike and yellow perch are also abundant. The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Big Pine Lake.  The test-net catch rate exceeded the normal range for this class of lakel.  Walleye abundance has historically been high in Big Pine Lake.   Walleye ranged in length from 7.6 to 27.2 inches with an average length and weight of 15.6 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2005 year class is strong.  This year class should provide excellent walleye angling for several years.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction and recruitment is substantial enough to consistently sustain the walleye population at or above DNR long range management goals. Walleye attain an average length of 14.0 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     An experimental walleye regulation was implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the walleye population in Big Pine Lake.  The regulation will be in effect for ten years during which time its effectiveness will be evaluated.  <br> \n     Northern pike population characteristics have demonstrated stability over the recent series of lake surveys.  The pike population has remained at a moderate density and natural reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 19.5 to 36.4 inches with an average length and weight of 24.9 inches and 3.4 pounds.  <br> \nPike exhibit fast growth rates with an average length of 23.8 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     The yellow perch test-net catch rate indicates that perch are very abundant in Big Pine Lake.  Historical length data indicate that yellow perch size structure fluctuates.  Only five percent of the perch in this assessment were 8.0 inches or greater in length. <br> \n     Other gamefish species present in Big Pine Lake include largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.   <br> \n     The DNR does not stock any species of fish in Big Pine Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above DNR management goals.   <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling in Big Pine Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.          <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   Big Pine Lake is a 4,730-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately three miles east of Perham, MN.  Big Pine Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Little Pine and Rush Lakes via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline while the outlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake. Minnesota DNR controlled dams at the outlets of Little Pine and Big Pine Lakes impede navigability between this chain of lakes.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwoods.  The maximum depth of Big Pine Lake is 76 feet; however, fifty percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  Historical secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 8.5 feet.     <br> \n     The shoreline of Big Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  DNR owned concrete public water accesses are located along the northwest and southeast shorelines of the lake.  A DNR owned earthen public water access is located along the north shoreline.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are scattered along the entire shoreline of the lake; however, the largest stands are along areas that haven't been highly developed and are located on the east, west and south shorelines.   Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush, cattail, and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.   Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n      A reduced daily bag limit regulation for sunfish (10 per day) was implemented in 2022.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain the quality of the Bluegill size structure.  A special spring trapnetting survey was conducted to collect baseline data on the Bluegill population, which will be used for regulation evaluation purposes in future surveys.  The Bluegill population is moderately abundant and has a quality size structure.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Fifty-two percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length, while 29% was 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 8.6 inches at seven years of age.      <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.          <br> \n     Big Pine Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2020.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Pine Lake is located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately three miles east of Perham, MN.  Big Pine Lake is a 4,730-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Big Pine Lake is connected to Little Pine and Rush Lakes via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline while the outlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake.  Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) controlled dams at the outlets of Little Pine and Big Pine Lakes impede navigability between this chain of  lakes.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwoods.  The maximum depth of Big Pine Lake is 76 feet; however, fifty percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 1999 lake survey was 5.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 8.5 feet.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics of the lakes.  Big Pine Lake is included in lake class 27 of this classification scheme.  Big Pine Lake is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.     The shoreline of Big Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  As referenced in the 1992 lake resurvey, there are nine resorts and approximately 202 homes/cottages located on Big Pine Lake.  DNR owned concrete public water accesses are located along the northwest and southeast shorelines of the lake.  A DNR owned earthen public water access is located along the north shoreline.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are scattered along the entire shoreline of the lake; however, the largest stands are located along the west and south shorelines.   Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush, cattail, and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     Big Pine Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier walleye fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Data from the population assessment indicate that the walleye population is very abundant.  The test-net catch rate was the highest recorded in any survey conducted on this lake from 1958 to 1999 and was well in excess of the normal range for lake class 27.  Walleye ranged in length from 6.9 to 29.1 inches with an average length and weight of 12.7 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that the 1996 year class is very strong.  This year class should provide excellent walleye angling for several years.  Walleye growth rate estimates are slightly slower than average growth rates for lake class 27 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.  Walleye attain an average length of 14.0 inches at four years of age.       The test-net catch rate for northern pike increased from the previous two lake surveys (1992 and 1996) and was within the normal range for lake class 27 lakes.  Pike ranged in length from 9.8 to 34.1 inches with an average length and weight of 20.9 inches and 2.2 pounds.  The 1996 year class of northern pike was also strong.  Pike growth rate estimates exceed the average growth rates for lake class 27 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area with an average length of 23.6 inches at four years of age.       Other game-fish species present in Big Pine Lake include largemouth bass, black crappie, and yellow perch.       The DNR does not stock any fish in Big Pine Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present.  To maintain the excellent fishing this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the fish habitat.  The DNR will continue an intensive assessment program to monitor the walleye population and the extent of natural reproduction.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.           </p>",

The average weight is much lower than in 1979, which is due to a large sample of age-I+ fish.  This appears to be a very large year class since age-I+ walleyes are not usually sampled effectively with experimental gillnets.  Aging data indicates that natural reproduction is good.  Walleye year classes in skip years are just as strong as in years when fry and fingerlings are stocked. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Big Pine Lake is a 4,730-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately three miles east of Perham, MN.  Big Pine Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Little Pine and Rush Lakes via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline while the outlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake. Minnesota DNR controlled dams at the outlets of Little Pine and Big Pine Lakes impede navigability between this chain of lakes.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwoods.  The maximum depth of Big Pine Lake is 76 feet; however, fifty percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 4.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 8.5 feet.     <br> \n     The shoreline of Big Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  DNR owned concrete public water accesses are located along the northwest and southeast shorelines of the lake.  A DNR owned earthen public water access is located along the north shoreline.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are scattered along the entire shoreline of the lake; however, the largest stands are along areas that haven't been highly developed and are located on the east, west and south shorelines.   Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush, cattail, and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.   Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Big Pine Lake is a popular angling lake.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier Walleye angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch are also abundant. The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically been high in Big Pine Lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.1 to 27.0 inches with an average length and weight of 13.5 inches and 1.0 pound.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2014, 2015, and 2016 year classes are strong.  These strong year classes should provide excellent Walleye angling for several years.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys indicate that Walleye natural reproduction and recruitment is substantial enough to consistently sustain the Walleye population at or above DNR long range management goals. Walleyes attain an average length of 14.6 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Fall electrofishing assessments are conducted annually on Big Pine Lake to index Walleye year class strength resulting from natural reproduction.  Based on catch data collected from this assessment, the 2017 year class of Walleye in Big Pine Lake appears to be very strong. <br> \n     An experimental Walleye regulation was implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one Walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of this regulation is to improve the size structure of the Walleye population in Big Pine Lake.   <br> \n     Northern Pike ranged in length from 20.2 to 31.7 inches with an average length and weight of 24.9 inches and 3.5 pounds. Pike exhibit fast growth rates with an average length of 26.2 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Historical catch and length data indicate that Yellow Perch size structure fluctuates.  Fourteen percent of the perch in this assessment were 8.0 inches or greater in length. <br> \n     Two Lake Sturgeon were sampled for the first time in Big Pine Lake.  A sturgeon restoration plan for the Otter Tail River system began in 2002.  Data from various surveys throughout the river system indicate that the restoration plan has been successful thus far. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling in Big Pine Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    <br> \n     Big Pine Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.     <br> \n   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Big Pine Lake is a 4,730-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately three miles east of Perham, MN.  Big Pine Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Little Pine and Rush Lakes via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline while the outlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake. Minnesota DNR controlled dams at the outlets of Little Pine and Big Pine Lakes impede navigability between this chain of lakes.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwoods.  The maximum depth of Big Pine Lake is 76 feet; however, fifty percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2020 survey was 5.6 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 8.5 feet.     <br> \n     The shoreline of Big Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  DNR owned concrete public water accesses are located along the northwest and southeast shorelines of the lake.  A DNR owned earthen public water access is located along the north shoreline.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are scattered along the entire shoreline of the lake; however, the largest stands are along areas that haven't been highly developed and are located on the east, west and south shorelines.   Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush, cattail, and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.   Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Big Pine Lake is a popular angling lake.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier Walleye angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  A special gillnetting assessment was conducted to analyze the Walleye, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch populations.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically been high in Big Pine Lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 6.9 to 28.4 inches with an average length and weight of 11.9 inches and 0.7 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2018 year class is very strong and should provide excellent Walleye angling for several years.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys also indicate that Walleye natural reproduction is substantial enough to consistently sustain the Walleye population at or above DNR long range management goals. Walleyes attain an average length of 14.6 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     An experimental Walleye regulation was implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one Walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of this regulation is to improve the size structure of the Walleye population in Big Pine Lake.   <br> \n     Northern Pike are moderately abundant.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 17.8 to 29.1 inches with an average length and weight of 21.9 inches and 2.4 pounds. Pike exhibit fast growth rates with an average length of 24.4 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Historical catch and length data indicate that Yellow Perch abundance and size structure fluctuates.  Nine percent of the perch in this survey were 8.0 inches or greater in length. <br> \n     Lake Sturgeon were sampled for the first time in Big Pine Lake during the 2017 survey.  A Lake Sturgeon restoration plan for the Otter Tail River system began in 2002.  Data from various surveys throughout the river system indicate that the restoration plan has been successful thus far. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling in Big Pine Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.          <br> \n     Big Pine Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2020.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native fish species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.      <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Pine Lake is a 4,730-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately three miles east of Perham, MN.  Big Pine Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Little Pine and Rush Lakes via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline while the outlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake.  Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) controlled dams at the outlets of Little Pine and Big Pine Lakes impede navigability between this chain of  lakes.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwoods.  The maximum depth of Big Pine Lake is 76 feet; however, fifty percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2001 lake survey was 6.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 8.5 feet.  Big Pine Lake is included in class 27 of the Minnesota DNR lake classification scheme.       The shoreline of Big Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  The 1992 lake resurvey referenced nine resorts and approximately 202 homes/cottages.  DNR owned concrete public water accesses are located along the northwest and southeast shorelines of the lake.  A DNR owned earthen public water access is located along the north shoreline.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are scattered along the entire shoreline of the lake; however, the largest stands are located along the west and south shorelines.   Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush, cattail, and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     Big Pine Lake is a popular angling lake.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier walleye angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike and yellow perch are also abundant and have good size distributions as well.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       Walleye is a primary management specie in Big Pine Lake.  The test-net catch rate was the second highest recorded in any survey conducted on this lake from 1958 to 2002 and was well in excess of the normal range for class 27 lakes and the DNR long range management goal.  The highest test-net catch rate was recorded in 1999.  Walleye abundance has historically been high in Big Pine Lake.   Walleye ranged in length from 6.7 to 25.6 inches with an average length and weight of 13.1 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2001 year class is very strong.  This year class should provide excellent walleye angling for several years.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction and recruitment is substantial enough to consistently sustain the walleye population at or above DNR long range management goals. Walleye attain an average length of 13.6 inches at four years of age.       An experimental walleye regulation will be implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the walleye population in Big Pine Lake.  The regulation will be in effect for ten years during which time its effectiveness will be evaluated.      Northern pike population characteristics have demonstrated stability over the recent series of lake surveys.  The pike population has remained at a moderate density and natural reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 12.4 to 40.4 inches with an average length and weight of 23.2 inches and 3.0 pounds.  Pike exhibit average growth rates with an average length of 23.4 inches at four years of age.       The yellow perch test-net catch rate indicates that perch are very abundant in Big Pine Lake.  Twenty-three percent of the perch were at least 8.0 inches in length.     Other gamefish species present in Big Pine Lake include largemouth bass and black crappie.       The DNR does not stock any species of fish in Big Pine Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present.  To maintain the excellent angling this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  The DNR will continue an intensive assessment program to monitor the walleye population and the extent of natural reproduction.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling in Big Pine Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Big Pine Lake is a 4,730-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately three miles east of Perham, MN.  Big Pine Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Little Pine and Rush Lakes via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline while the outlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake. Minnesota DNR controlled dams at the outlets of Little Pine and Big Pine Lakes impede navigability between this chain of lakes.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwoods.  The maximum depth of Big Pine Lake is 76 feet; however, fifty percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2011 lake survey was 5.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 8.5 feet.     <br> \n     The shoreline of Big Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  The 1992 lake resurvey referenced nine resorts and approximately 202 homes/cottages.  DNR owned concrete public water accesses are located along the northwest and southeast shorelines of the lake.  A DNR owned earthen public water access is located along the north shoreline.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are scattered along the entire shoreline of the lake; however, the largest stands are along areas that haven't been highly developed and are located on the east, west and south shorelines.   Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush, cattail, and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.   Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Big Pine Lake is a popular angling lake.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier walleye angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  Black crappie, northern pike, and yellow perch are also abundant. The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Big Pine Lake.  Walleye abundance has historically been high in Big Pine Lake.   Walleyes ranged in length from 6.8 to 25.5 inches with an average length and weight of 13.1 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 year classes are strong.  These strong year classes should provide excellent walleye angling for several years.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction and recruitment is substantial enough to consistently sustain the walleye population at or above DNR long range management goals. Walleyes attain an average length of 14.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     An experimental walleye regulation was implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of this regulation is to improve the size structure of the walleye population in Big Pine Lake.  The regulation will be in effect for ten years during which time its effectiveness will be evaluated.  <br> \n     Northern pike population characteristics have demonstrated stability over the recent series of lake surveys.  The pike population has remained at a moderate density and natural reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 12.9 to 34.6 inches with an average length and weight of 21.1 inches and 2.3 pounds. Pike exhibit fast growth rates with an average length of 25.8 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Historical catch and length data indicate that yellow perch size structure fluctuates.  Eighteen percent of the perch in this assessment were 8.0 inches or greater in length. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling in Big Pine Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.          <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Big Pine Lake is a 4,730-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately three miles east of Perham, MN.  Big Pine Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Little Pine and Rush Lakes via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the northwest shoreline while the outlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwoods.  The maximum depth of Big Pine Lake is 76 feet; however, fifty percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2023 survey was 6.7 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 8.5 feet.     <br> \n     The shoreline of Big Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  DNR owned concrete public water accesses are located along the northwest and southeast shorelines of the lake.  A DNR owned earthen public water access is located along the north shoreline.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are scattered along the entire shoreline of the lake; however, the largest stands are along areas that haven't been highly developed and are located on the east, west and south shorelines.   Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush, cattail, and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.   Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Big Pine Lake is a popular angling lake.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier Walleye angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  A special gillnetting assessment was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically been high in Big Pine Lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.3 to 26.9 inches with an average length and weight of 13.7 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2020 and 2022 year classes are very strong and should provide excellent Walleye angling for several years.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys also indicate that Walleye natural reproduction is substantial enough to consistently sustain the Walleye population at or the above the DNR management objective. Walleyes attain an average length of 14.2 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     An experimental Walleye regulation was implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one Walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of this regulation is to improve the size structure of the Walleye population in Big Pine Lake.   <br> \n     Northern Pike are also abundant and reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 15.0 to 28.9 inches with an average length and weight of 21.9 inches and 2.2 pounds. Pike exhibit fast growth rates with an average length of 24.9 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Lake Sturgeon were sampled for the first time in Big Pine Lake during the 2017 survey.  A Lake Sturgeon restoration plan for the Otter Tail River system began in 2002.  Data from various surveys throughout the river system indicate that the restoration plan has been successful thus far. <br> \n     The DNR controlled Otter Tail River outlet dam was removed in 2023 and replaced with a rock-rapids structure.  This will allow water levels to be maintained at historical levels and will also allow for the passage of fish species both upstream and downstream of Big Pine Lake. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling in Big Pine Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.          <br> \n     Big Pine Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2020.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native fish species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.      <br> \n</p>",
