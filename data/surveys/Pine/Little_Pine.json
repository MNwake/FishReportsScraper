                "narrative": "<p>Little Pine is a 75 acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical and chemical similarities.  Little Pine is assigned to lake class 37.  Lake class 37 consists of small, shallow, turbid soft water lakes high in littoral area and having a regular shape.  In order to compare the current fish population to others in the lake class and to update the previous data from 1960, a lake survey was conducted on Little Pine lake in the summer of 2001.Northern pike were the most abundant species in the gillnets with a catch rate of 8.7 per net.  Both the catch rate and the 2 pound average weight where within the normal range compared to other catches in the lake class.  The 26 northerns sampled ranged from 16.1 to 24.4 inches with a 20.9 inch average.  All ages from 3 to 7 years were represented in the catch with the 1997 year class accounting for 59% of the sample.  The 1960 survey captured only 6 northerns with a catch rate of 2 per net and an average weight of 1.2 pounds.Only four yellow perch were taken in the gillnets yielding a catch rate of 1.3/set, well below the lake class norm.  While the perch size structure was nearly identical in 1960 they were far more abundant with a catch rate of 21.3 per gillnet.  This obvious decrease is likely due to the increased northern pike abundance.   Black crappie and bluegill were normal in both numbers and average weight compared to other trapnet catches in the lake class.  Both species were more abundant and of greater size in 1960.  Catch rates in 2001 for black crappie and blugill were 2.1 and 7.2 per trapnet respectively.  Crappies ranged from 6.5 to 9.7 inches with averages of 7.7 inches and 0.24 pounds.  Bluegill ranged from 3 to 8.7 inches with means of 5.1 inches and 0.13 pounds.  Seventy seven percent of sampled bluegill were 4 and 5 year olds from the 1996 and 1997 year classes.Other species present during the survey included black bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, yellow bullhead.Little Pine is a limited access lake which receives moderate fishing pressure.  Northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie are present in abundances and sizes typical of the lake class.        </p>",
