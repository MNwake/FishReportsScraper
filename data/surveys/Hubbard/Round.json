                "narrative": "<p>Round (Claussens) Lake is located 5 miles northwest of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Round Lake has a surface area of 39 acres and a maximum depth of 19 feet.  Round Lake is in the flowage (Sand River) that connects to Little Sand Lake upstream and Shallow Lake down stream.  There is no public access on Round Lake, however, boating access is possible from Shallow Lake located downstream.  Canoe access is aslo possible from Little Sand Lake located upstream.  Round Lake provides angling opportunities for bass, panfish, and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Round Lake is in lake class 37.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Brush, Crow Wing, Deadhorse, Giles, Goose, Hay, Nelson, Sweitzer, and Shinker. <br> \n <br> \nLow to moderate numbers of panfish were sampled, but within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range and black crappie in the 9-11 inch size range.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.7 inches and 2.4 pounds, with pike measured up to 26.9 inches.  Largemouth bass are also present and provide a good option to the angler.  Other species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead and low numbers of brown bullhead, rock bass, and golden shiner. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
