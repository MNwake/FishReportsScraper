                "narrative": "<p>Anne Lake is located 7 miles northeast of Cotton, Minnesota.  Anne Lake is 8 acres in area, has a maximum depth of 27 feet, and is in lake class 13.  Access to the lake is off County Road 224 right-of-way, which separates Anne Lake from Wilson Lake.  Anne Lake was sampled in 2001 to update information on fish population status since the 1991 lake survey.  The primary management species are black crappie and bluegill, with secondary management for northern pike and largemouth bass.       Black crappie abundance of 6.5 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of black crappie was 6.3 inches, but too few individuals were sampled to evaluate growth.  Age distribution was even among the 1998, 1999, and 2000 year classes.       Bluegill abundance of 2.8 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size structure was fair and mean length was 6.3 inches.  Growth was average with length at age four of 4.9 inches.  Seventy-three percent of the bluegill sampled were from the 1998 year class.     Northern pike abundance of 5 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 18.8 inches but growth was not evaluated because of low sample size.     Largemouth bass were sampled in both gill nets and trap nets.  Abundance of 0.8 per trapnet lift is within the normal range compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of largemouth bass was 6.3 inches.     Black crappie and bluegill currently provide the best angling opportunities in Anne Lake.</p>",
