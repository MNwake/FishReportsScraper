                "narrative": "<p>Duck Lake is a 326 acre oval-shaped lake located southeast of Hubbard, Minnesota.  Duck Lake has sandy shorelines with a gradually sloping bottom to a maximum depth of 23.0 feet.Walleye were sampled in high numbers, 16.0/gillnet, with an average length and weight of 15.8 inches and 1.4 lbs, respectively.  This is the highest walleye gillnet catch in seven surveys going back to 1963.  Walleye up to 28.0 inches were sampled.  Previous walleye gillnet catches have fluctuated from 7.3/gillnet (1990), to 2.7/gillnet (1985), and 10.5/gillnet (1980).  Walleye were first stocked into Duck Lake in 1977.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked into Duck Lake in odd calendar years.  The walleye population in Duck Lake is maintained through stocking.  All walleye sampled correspond to stocked years.  No walleye were sampled from non-stocked years.Duck Lake has a history of having a low northern pike population composed of large-sized fish.  The 1995 survey showed no difference with a catch of 1.3/gillnet and an average size of 4.3 lbs and 25.0 inches.  Northern pike up to 35.9 inches were sampled.  The northern pike have limited spawning areas on Duck Lake, which accounts for the low population levels.  There is an abundant white sucker population in Duck Lake which provides an excellent forage base for the northern pike.Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers (19.2/trapnet).  Size of the bluegills was fair, with an average length of 6.0 inches and with 9% of the sample greater than 7.0 inches.  Bluegill up to 8.3 inches were sampled.Black crappie and largemouth bass populations are both present in Duck Lake.  Special sampling is required to adequately assess the fishery; however, general conclusions can be made with standard survey gear.  Largemouth bass catches were similar to past surveys, with fish up to 17.0 inches sampled.  Black crappie trapnet catches were low (0.8/trapnet).  Historical black crappie catches have fluctuated, but have generally been higher.  Black crappie up to 11.5 inches were sampled.Yellow perch were sampled in moderate numbers (9.3/gillnet).  Yellow perch were small in size, with a mean length of 7.6 inches, and with fish up to 10.8 inches sampled.  Yellow perch provide a forage base for the walleye population with few perch of an acceptable size to the angler.Pumpkinseed and rock bass were sampled in moderate numbers, while yellow bullhead were sampled in low numbers. </p>",

Continued stocking every other year of rescue fish should be made due to lack of spawning area for this specie.  No other management necessary.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Duck Lake is located on the southern border of Hubbard County.  Duck Lake has a surface area of 326 acres and a maximum depth of 23 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the southwest shore of the lake.  Duck Lake has good water quality and lots of sand shoreline.  Duck Lake provides good angling opportunities for walleye, largemouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Duck Lake is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Boulder, Second Crow Wing, Fifth thru Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, Hinds, and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and the current management goal.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 15.4 inches and 1.4 pounds, with fish measured up to 25.5 inches.  Walleye stocking in Duck Lake began in 1977, and since that time walleye abundance in Duck Lake has been very good.  Walleye stocking by the DNR is contributing greatly to the walleye population in Duck Lake.  Age analysis showed the majority of the walleye sampled corresponding to years of walleye stocking.  Duck Lake is currently involved in a research study to evaluate various sizes and rates of walleye stocking.  Future walleye stocking in Duck Lake will be based on results of this research project. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled at their lowest abundance for all surveys on Duck Lake.  Yellow perch abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to high numbers. <br> \n <br> \nDuck Lake has a history of having a low northern pike population made up of large-sized fish.  Pike abundance in Duck is limited by the absence of preferred spawning habitat.  Duck Lake has excellent water quality and beautiful sand beaches, but lacks marshy areas with aquatic vegetation that pike prefer to spawn in.  Two northern pike were sampled during the 2006 survey (27 & 32 inches). <br> \n <br> \nDuck Lake has an abundant largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass were sampled in good numbers during spring electrofishing sampling (52 bass/hour).  While largemouth bass were abundant, the proportion of bass sampled over 15 inches was low when compared to other area lakes.  One smallmouth bass was sampled during the survey.  Smallmouth bass were first sampled in Duck Lake in the 2000 survey. <br> \n <br> \nDuck Lake has an abundant bluegill population made up of small, slow growing fish.  Anglers will find lots of bluegill in the 6-inch size range with a few bluegill and pumpkinseed over 7 inches.  Black crappie catch rates were at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to all surveys since 1995.  Black crappie abundance was much higher in surveys conducted in the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included white sucker, yellow bullhead, golden shiner, and rock bass.  White sucker were abundant, similar to past surveys.  Yellow bullheads were sampled in moderate numbers, while golden shiner and rock bass were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Duck Lake is located on the southern border of Hubbard County.  Duck Lake has a surface area of 326 acres and a maximum depth of 23 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the southwest shore of the lake.  Duck Lake has good water quality and lots of sand shoreline.  Duck Lake supports good populations of walleye, black crappie, and largemouth bass.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Duck Lake is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Boulder, Second Crow Wing, Fifth thru Eighth Crow Wing lakes, Hinds, and Lower Twin.Walleye abundance dropped from the previous survey in 1995, however, the walleye gillnet catch rate of 7.7 walleye/net is still above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Walleye stocking in Duck Lake began in 1978, and since that time walleye abundance in Duck Lake has been very good.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 16.0 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Walleye fingerling stocking by the DNR is contributing greatly to the walleye population in Duck Lake.  Age analysis showed 75% of the walleye sample corresponding to years of walleye stocking.  Duck Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye were sampled at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have shown that yellow perch abundance in Duck Lake has fluctuated from low to high numbers. Duck Lake has a low northern pike population made up of large-sized fish.  Pike abundance in Duck Lake is limited by the absence of preferred spawning habitat.  Duck Lake has excellent water quality and beautiful sand beaches, but northern pike prefer to spawn on areas with submerged or flooded vegetation.  The northern pike gillnet  catch rate of 0.89/net is below the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.  Sampled northern pike had an average length of 29.8 inches with fish sampled up to 37.8 inches.  Northern pike growth was fast when compared to other area lakes.Duck Lake has an abundant largemouth bass population.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time on Duck Lake and catch rates for largemouth bass were very high (178 bass/hour).  While bass were abundant, average size was small (10.3 inches).  The number of largemouth bass sampled over 15.0 inches was low when compared to other area lakes.  Smallmouth bass were sampled for the first time in Duck Lake.  Seven smallmouth bass were sampled and ranged in length from 8 to 12 inches.  The smallmouth bass in Duck Lake are likely the result of an illegal stocking.Black crappie were sampled at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Black crappie abundance is down from earlier surveys, especially in surveys prior to 1980.  The average length of black crappie was 9.0 inches with fish sampled up to 14.0 inches.  Duck Lake has an abundant bluegill population made up of small, slow growing fish.  The bluegill trapnet catch rate of 53.1 bluegill/trapnet is above the range for this lake class, but average size was only 5.5 inches. Other species sampled include white sucker, rock bass, and pumpkinseed.  White sucker were abundant, similar to past surveys, while rock bass and pumpkinseed were sampled in low numbers. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on June 24, 2019 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations. A 15-foot seine was used to sample one station and a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations. Nearshore sampling captured 15 native species of fish including five species (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass) intolerant of habitat disturbance and no tolerant species.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Duck Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

There is a state-owned public access located on the southwest shore of the lake.  Duck Lake has good water quality and lots of sand shoreline.  Duck supports good populations of Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Duck Lake is in lake class 31.  Class 31 lakes are generally hard water and have regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids area include Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Crow Wing Lakes, Boulder, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has remained high for the past several surveys.  Good numbers of Walleye in the 13 to 15 inch size range were sampled with fish measured up to 24.4 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye, were sampled in low numbers and has been very low since 2006.  Anglers will find an abundant Largemouth Bass population with high numbers of bass in the 10-14 inch size range and few fish over 15 inches.  Present and past surveys have shown the panfish population in Duck to fluctuate from moderate to high numbers.  Duck Lake can provide good fishing for Black Crappie and Bluegill.  Duck Lake has good water quality, submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation that provides excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass and panfish. <br> \n   <br> \nCurrently faucet snails, an aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Duck Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Duck Lake is located five miles southeast of the town of Hubbard on the Wadena and Hubbard County line. Duck Lake has a surface area of 326 acres and a maximum depth of 23 feet. There is a state owned public access located on the southwest shore of the lake off Township Road 108. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Duck Lake is in lake class 31.  These lakes generally have very hard water and are regularly shaped. Duck Lake provides angling opportunities for walleye, largemouth bass, and panfish. <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown that Duck Lake has an abundant walleye population, with the 2012 survey showing the highest numbers ever sampled.  Walleyes had an average length and weight of 15 inches and 1.2 pounds, with fish measured up to 28.5 inches. Duck Lake is currently involved in a research project to evaluate various sizes and rates of walleye stocking.  <br> \nYellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled at their lowest abundance for all surveys on Duck Lake. Yellow perch were sampled up to 10 inches in length and may attract some angling pressure.  <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in low numbers compared to recent surveys, but still in the normal range for similar lakes. Black crappies were sampled up to 12 inches in length in 2012. <br> \nNorthern pike have always been sampled in low abundance compared to similar lakes, but the size was fairly good in 2012. Northern pike had an average length and weight of 27.5 inches and 5 pounds, with fish up to 34 inches sampled. <br> \nDuck Lake has an abundant largemouth bass population and they were sampled in high numbers in 2012. While largemouth bass were abundant, the number of bass sampled over 15 inches was very low. Smallmouth bass were first sampled in Duck Lake in the 2000 survey, and one smallmouth bass was sampled in 2012. <br> \nBluegills were the most abundant of the panfish species, and their numbers are above average for similar lakes.  Anglers will find most of them in the 6-8.5 inch size range. <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of white suckers, moderate numbers of pumpkinseeds and yellow bullhead, and low numbers of rock bass.  <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Duck Lake.  These species are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake-shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.</p>",
