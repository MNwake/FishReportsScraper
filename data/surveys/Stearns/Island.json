However the average weight of pike decreased from the previous survey and was below average.  The catch rate of Walleye (1.3/gill net) increased from the 1985 survey (0.6/gill net) and was within the expected range of values.  Yellow Perch were sampled within the expected range for similar lakes and were similar to the previous survey despite the increase in predator species. Bluegill were sampled in numbers and weight above the average and at a rate higher than the 1985 survey. Although Black Crappie decreased from the previous survey catch rates remained above the expected range.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Channel Catfish, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, and White Sucker.  All of these species were sampled either within or below their expected ranges for similar lakes.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Island Lake is located near Richmond, in south central Stearns County. Cedar Island Lake is part of the Sauk River Chain of Lakes (SRCL). It has a surface area of 998 acres and a maximum depth of 75 feet. The fishery of Cedar Island Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, Muskellunge, and Channel Catfish, although it is also a popular destination for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and panfish anglers. There is a public access located on the east side of Cedar Island Lake off of County Road 71, however, navigable channels connect Cedar Island with Horseshoe Lake and the other downstream lakes in the Sauk River Chain. The last lake survey was conducted in 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Sauk River drains a large portion of central Minnesota before flowing through the SRCL. The Cedar Island Lake watershed is 581,461 acres with land use consisting of 52% agriculture, 25% pasture, 8% marsh/open water, 7% forest, 6% residential, and 2% grassland. Emergent plants were mapped in 2018 and found to cover approximately 9% of the lake. Species found were yellow waterlily (50 acres), cattail spp. (19 acres), and white waterlily (18 acres). Non point source pollution continues to be a concern within the watershed; however, strides have been made to greatly reduce the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous entering the system. Even with these improvements most of the lakes within the SRCL are still classified as hyper eutrophic. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been the focus of fisheries management on the SRCL. During the 1980s and 90s Walleye management consisted of Walleye fingerling stocking every other year. Since 2001, Walleye fry have been stocked every other spring in an attempt to increase the Walleye population with very good success (average: 105 young of the year (yoy)/hr during fall electrofishing from 2001 - 2017). Additionally strong year classes of naturally reproduced Walleye fingerlings were observed in 2016 and 2018. Annual fall electrofishing will be completed to further evaluate the consistency and extent of natural reproduction in the SRCL. In 2018, the Walleye catch rate (5.1/net) was higher than 2011 (4.1/ net) and above average for class 36 lakes and the second highest in lake history. Walleye ranged in length from 10 - 22 inches and averaged 16 inches and 1.4 pounds. This was similar to 2011 (15.5 inches and 1.5 pounds). Sixty two percent of the Walleye sampled were longer than 15 inches and 10% were longer than 20 inches. Twelve year classes were present in the age sample with the naturally produced 2014 and 2016 year classes making up 52% of the sample. Growth was average with both males and females reaching 16 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nSince 2011, the SRCL has been stocked every two years with 1,030 Muskellunge fingerlings. Muskellunge are not sampled well with standard summer surveys because they exist in very low numbers. Spring surveys are used to evaluate adult Muskellunge populations because the fish concentrate in the shallows for spawning. Spring surveys have not been used to sample Muskellunge on Cedar Island Lake yet because the population is still developing, however anglers have reported catching fish in excess of 40 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance which has historically been low in Cedar Island, was the highest on record (5.3/net) in 2018. As abundance increased average size decreased however, and only five percent of the Northern Pike sampled were longer than 26 inches. Northern Pike ranged in length from 9 - 32 inches and averaged 22 inches and 2.4 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were originally stocked to provide anglers with another angling opportunity as well as to control the bullhead population. By 1990, catfish had become plentiful and displaced the bullhead species within the system. Angler complaints about catfish abundance persist today, although many anglers travel to the SRCL to fish for catfish. In fact catfish were the third most popular species targeted by anglers and comprised 40% of the total yield of fished harvested in the open water creel conducted in 2015. To give anglers a chance to take advantage of a surplus of Channel Catfish the daily and possession limits were increased to 10 starting in 2015. In 2018, the Channel Catfish catch was 17.6/net, a significant decrease from the record high catch rate of 33.1/ net in 2011. Channel Catfish ranged from 10 - 26 inches and averaged 21 inches and three pounds. The largest catfish sampled was 6.5 pounds. Anglers will find many catfish in the 19 - 24 inch range as this size made up 83% of the total catfish catch. <br> \n <br> \nBass were sampled during evening electrofishing on May 23, 2018. A total of 77 Largemouth Bass were captured in 2.0 hours of effort for a catch rate of 38.5/hour. This was lower than the average night time catch rate (74/hr) for the Sauk Rapids area and less than the last survey where electrofishing was conducted in 2003 (50.8/ hr). Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6 - 19 inches with an average length of 12 inches. Of the catchable Largemouth Bass (greater than 8 inches) half were larger than 12 inches and 27 percent were greater than 15 inches. A total of 19 Smallmouth Bass were also sampled by electrofishing for a catch rate of 9.5/hour compared to 2003 when only one Smallmouth Bass was sampled. Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 8 - 18 inches with an average length of 11 inches. Of the catchable Smallmouth Bass (greater than 8 inches) 37 percent were larger than 12 inches and 11 percent were greater than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance in 2018 (3.3/net) was higher than reported in 2011 (0.2/net) and the highest since 1995. Yellow Perch ranged from 5 - 9 inches and averaged 7 inches. Prior to 2003, all other surveys reported above average catch rates for Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance has been declining since 1980, but the average size has increased. The Black Crappie catch in 2018 was similar to 2011 and was within the range of expected values for class 36 lakes Black Crappie sampled ranged from 4 - 12 inches and averaged 9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance has also showed a declining trend; however since 1995 the catches have been relatively stable. In 2018, the Bluegill catch increased from 2011 and increased to within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Bluegill from the August survey ranged in length from 3- 10 inches and averaged 6 inches. A targeted Bluegill survey conducted in May collected 305 Bluegill sampling fish up to 10 inches with an average length of 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Black and Brown Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

The chain is comprised of numerous, connected waterbodies totaling over 3,200 acres. Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the largest basins in the chain and total over 1,500 acres. Prior to 2001, the Walleye fishery had been sustained through fingerling stocking. Since then, the Walleye population has been sustained through natural reproduction and fry stocking during odd numbered years at a rate of 1,000 fry/littoral acre, supplemented along the way by surplus hatchery fry and fry stocked by the lake association. Annual fall electrofishing for young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye was initiated in 2015 and documented strong natural reproduction in 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2020 in both Horseshoe and Cedar Island lakes. Due to the strong natural reproduction, no Walleye stocking has occurred since 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nYOY electrofishing was conducted on October 7, 2021. YOY catch rates were 44.4/hr (on time) for Horseshoe and 26.6/hr for Cedar Island Lake. YOY Walleye across surveys ranged in length from 6.2 to 10.7 inches with an average length of 7.4 inches. YOY catches in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (all non stocked years) were higher than in 2021. However, YOY catches in 2021 were similar to 2017 (the last stocked year). The average YOY catch during stocked years was 131/hr for Horseshoe Lake and 106/hr for Cedar Island Lake. The average fingerling catch rate for non-stocked years was 109/hr for Horseshoe and 84/hr for Cedar Island.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rates of Walleye greater than age-1 on Cedar Island (64.1/hour) and Horseshoe (166.0/hour) lakes were higher than previous surveys. Age-1 and greater Walleye in Cedar Island Lake ranged in length from 9.5 to 28.4 inches with an average length of 14.6 inches while in Horseshoe Lake they ranged in length from 8.4 to 24.3 with an average length of 13.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA gill net survey conducted in 2021 found all time record numbers of Walleye in Horseshoe (4.7/gill net) and Cedar Island (6.3/gill net) lakes. Ageing data showed that the naturally produced year classes represented 89% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nAnnual fall electrofishing since 2015 has provided a measure of year class strength for naturally reproduced Walleye in the SRCL. Record high gill net catches in 2021 combined with the fact that 89% of the sampled Walleye were from non-stocked years, presents a strong case that Walleye stocking is not necessary in the SRCL. <br> \n</p>",

The chain is the result of a dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring, which created numerous, connected waterbodies totaling over 3,200 acres. Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the largest basins, totaling over 1,500 acres. The Walleye fishery has been managed by stocking fry biennially at a rate of 1,000 per littoral acre. This has been augmented by hatchery surplus fry and fry bought by the lake association. Strong natural reproduction has been documented for year classes from 2014, 2016, and 2018 in both Cedar Island and Horseshoe Lake. Fall electrofishing is now being conducted annually to assess fry survival from both stocked and non-stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nNo Walleye fry were stocked in 2018; however a young-of-the-year (YOY) assessment was conducted on October 17, 2018. YOY catch rates were 76.9/hr (on time) for Cedar Island and 202.8/hr for Horseshoe Lake. YOY Walleye ranged in length from 5.1 to 8.3 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches. The YOY catches in 2018 (non-stocked year) were higher than in 2017 (stocked year). The average YOY catch for stocked years is 106/hr for Cedar Island and 131/hr for Horseshoe Lake. A lake survey conducted in 2018 found good numbers of Walleye in Cedar Island (5.1/gill net) and Horseshoe Lake (4.4/gill net). Ageing data showed that the naturally produced 2014 and 2016 year classes represented 52% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nBecause natural reproduction is occurring in the SRCL, the contribution of stocked fry is unknown. This could be assessed by marking all stocked fry, although annual fall electrofishing should provide a measure of year class strength for naturally reproduced Walleye as well. Stocking could be reduced or modified if natural reproduction is consistently strong. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Prior to 2001, the Walleye fishery had been sustained through fingerling stocking.

                "narrative": "<p>The Sauk River Chain of Lakes (SRCL) is located in Stearns County near the city of Richmond. The chain is the result of a dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring, which created numerous, connected waterbodies totaling over 3,200 acres. Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the largest basins, totaling over 1,500 acres. The Walleye fishery was sustained by fingerling stocking prior to 2001. Since then, Walleye fry have been stocked biennially at a rate of 1,000/littoral acre, supplemented by surplus hatchery fry and fry stocked by the lake association. Fry survival has been assessed by fall night electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nSubstantial natural reproduction was documented in 2014 and 2016. Fall electrofishing is now being conducted annually to assess the frequency and magnitude of natural reproduction in the chain of lakes. It is unknown whether reproduction is occurring in the lakes or in the Sauk River upstream. <br> \n <br> \nThe current assessment was conducted on the night of October 3, 2017 following fry stocking in May. The Young of the Year (YOY) catch rates were 24.5/hour (on time) for Cedar Island and 30.0/hour for Horseshoe Lake. Combined lengths ranged from 5.6 to 7.5 inches with an average length of 6.8 inches. YOY Catches in 2016 without stocking were much higher (Cedar Island 127/hr, Horseshoe 95/hr). The average catch of YOY Walleye from 2001 to 2015 after fry stocking was 108/hr for Cedar Island and 144/hr for Horseshoe Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in the most recent lake survey (2011) were 4.1/gill net for Cedar Island and 3.3/gill net for Horseshoe Lake, near the management goal of 4 6/gill net. A creel survey in 2015 showed that Walleye harvest and angler pressure were modest. Relatively high fry survival has so far not resulted in corresponding net catches. A standard lake survey is scheduled for the summer of 2018. This will provide a current assessment of Walleye recruitment to the fishery, particularly whether high catches of fall fingerlings translates into fish available to anglers. The current fry stocking regime has been successful in producing fall fingerlings and will be continued for now, but stocking could be reduced if natural reproduction is found to be sufficiently robust. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n\tCedar Island\tHorseshoe <br> \nYear\tN fry stocked\tN YOY/hr\tN fry stocked\tN YOY/hr <br> \n2001\t755,000\t\t  170\t\t 280,000\t  282 <br> \n2003\t755,000\t\t    39\t\t 275,000\t      7  <br> \n2005\t758,000\t\t  102\t\t 275,000\t  138 <br> \n2007\t755,000\t\t    28\t\t 275,000\t    85 <br> \n2009\t755,000\t\t  134\t\t 275,000\t  189 <br> \n2011\t755,000\t\t  201\t\t 275,000\t   NA <br> \n2013\t1,355,000\t  170\t\t 675,000\t  258 <br> \n2015\t1,175,000\t    82\t\t 425,000\t    55 <br> \n2016\t\t0\t  128\t\t\t0\t    97 <br> \n2017\t1,505,000\t    25\t\t 275,000\t    30 <br> \n</p>",

The maximum depth of the lake is 75 feet and during mid-August adequate oxygen is present down to 8 feet.  A public access is located on Cedar Island Lake in the southeast corner of the lake, off of Stearns County Rd 71.         Cedar Island Lake is a part of the Horseshoe Chain of Lakes and receives heavy fishing pressure.  Black crappie, bluegill, walleye, northern pike, channel catfish and largemouth bass are all present in the lake.  In the summer of 1995, a population assessment was conducted on Cedar Island Lake.  The netting of the lake revealed the following information about the fish population.        The northern pike catch rate in gill nets (4.8/gill net) significantly increased from the 1990 survey (2.5/gill net) and rose to within expected levels for lakes that are similar to Cedar Island.  The average size northern caught in gill nets was 2.4 pounds and 21.4 inches.  The largest northern pike caught was over 34 inches.  Two to seven year old fish were sampled in gill nets with age three fish being most abundant.  The growth rate of northern pike was average when compared with other populations in the state.       The catch rate of walleye in gill nets (5.5/gill net) significantly increased from the 1990 survey (1.3/gill net) and rose above expected levels for this lake type.  The average size walleye caught during the assessment weighed 1.0 pounds and appeared to decline from the 1990 survey (2.0 pounds).  The cause of this decline in average weight was an influx of two year old fish from the 1993 stocking.  These fish ranged in size from 12 to 13 inches and made up 69% of the total catch.  Overall, walleye sampled in gill nets ranged in size from 11.2-24.8 inches and averaged 14.4 inches in length.  The growth rate of walleye in Cedar Island Lake was average when compared with other populations in the state.       The gill net catch rate of yellow perch in Cedar Island Lake (12.7/gill net) significantly declined from the last survey (24.5/gill net) but remained within expected levels for this lake type.  The average size yellow perch caught in gill nets was 6.5 inches in length and 0.1 pounds in weight.  While this average size may seem small, yellow perch are very important in a lake as they are a major source of food for larger predators like the northern pike and walleye.       The trap net catch rate of black bullheads in Cedar Island Lake (0.8/trap net) appeared to have fallen from the 1990 survey (12.2/trap net).  On the other hand, the catch in gill nets of channel catfish increased from 0.8/gill net in 1990, to 16.3/gill net in 1995.  This trend of the declining trap net catch of black bullhead in association with an increase in catch of channel catfish has happened throughout the entire Horseshoe Chain.  This correlation has only occurred over one fish population assessment and further netting is needed to assess the level of this effect.        The black crappie catch rate in trap nets (48.2/net) was high for this lake type.  Black crappies sampled ranged in length from 2.2-11.1 inches and averaged 7.0 inches in length.  The catch rate of black crappies was high throughout the rest of the attached Horseshoe Chain of Lakes, so the outlook for crappies in Cedar Island Lake appears to be good.       The trap net catch of bluegills in Cedar Island Lake (11.5/trap net) appeared to decline from the previous netting in 1990 (45.4/lift).  Variation in catch rates of panfish are highly dependent on the weather, therefore, a change in catch rate like this may not always mean a significant change in the fish population.  Bluegill caught in trap nets ranged in size from 3.0-8.8 inches and averaged 6.2 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Island Lake is located near Richmond, in south-central Stearns County.  This 998 acre lake is part of the Sauk River Chain of Lakes, which was formed by the construction of a dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring.  The chain is very popular for angling and other forms of recreation. The Sauk River drains a large portion of central Minnesota before flowing through the chain of lakes.  Combined with drainage from the Long Lake sub-watershed to the south, the total watershed of the chain is nearly 600,000 acres.  Although non-point sources (agricultural run-off) continue to be a concern, some major contributors or nutrients (such as municipal wastewater discharge) were greatly reduced by 1991.  Efforts are being made to address existing sources, but water quality in most of the lakes remains in the hypereutrophic range.The fishery of Cedar Island Lake is managed for walleye and northern pike, although panfish, bass, and channel catfish are also popular with many anglers.  Walleye management relied on fingerling stocking in the 1980's and 1990's.  In 2001, walleye fry were stocked in an attempt to increase the population, with very positive results.  Netting in 2003 produced catch rates that were in the range expected for lakes similar to Cedar Island, but lower than the management goal. It is expected that with continued success of fry stocking, this goal can be reached.  The 2001 year class was well represented in the catch throughout the chain, but many age 5-8 individuals were also sampled.  The average size of walleye in the 2003 survey (1.5 pounds) was higher than in 1995 (1.0 pounds), but below the expected range for the lake class.  Fall electrofishing showed strong evidence of success of the 2003 fry stocking, though less than in 2001.  Some natural reproduction may occur within the chain or in the Sauk River, but it does not appear to be a significant contribution to the walleye population.The catch rate of northern pike in 2003 was low compared to lakes similar to Cedar Island, but near the management goal.  Low densities of northern pike usually provide higher growth rates and better survival of walleye.  Mean size of northern pike sampled in 2003 was relatively high (3.1 pounds), and nearly all were greater than 20 inches.Yellow perch abundance appeared low in 2003 for Cedar Island Lake as well as the other lakes in the Sauk River chain.Bass were sampled by electrofishing in mid-May.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was near the average for lakes in this part of the state, and much higher than for smallmouth bass.  In nearby Horseshoe Lake, equal numbers of smallmouth and largemouth bass were sampled.  Largemouth bass up to 18.6 inches were sampled from Cedar Island Lake; the average was 12.1 inches.The black crappie catch rate in 2003 was lower than catch rates from the 1980's and 1990's, although the crappie fishery remains very popular.  By weight, black crappie accounted for more of the fish harvested on the chain in 1999 (open water season) than any other species.  Mean weight of crappie sampled in 2003 (0.32 pounds) was above the average for lakes similar to Cedar Island, and higher than in recent surveys.  The catch rate of bluegill in 2003 also was lower than catch rates from the 1980's and 1990's, but average size (0.28 pounds) was high.  Mean weight of bluegill was higher than reported in previous surveys, and most of the individuals sampled in 2003 were 6-8 inches in length.  Channel catfish were introduced to Horseshoe Lake in the 1980's, and first sampled in Cedar Island in the 1985 survey.  Catch rates and average weight has been variable since then.  The catfish sampled in 2003 were mostly 17-22 inches.  Catfish sampled in the lakes downstream of Cedar Island were generally smaller.  Other species sampled during the 2003 survey included white sucker, redhorse (primarily shorthead), carp and bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Sauk River Chain of Lakes (SRCL) is located in south central Minnesota, near the city of Richmond.  A dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring allows users to access over 3,200 acres by water. The fishery of the SRCL Lake is managed primarily for walleye, muskellunge, and channel catfish, although it is also a popular destination for panfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike anglers.  Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the two largest basins in the SRCL comprising 50% of the total acreage of the Chain.  The lakes are managed for Walleye and prior to 2001 were sustained by fingerling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nSince 2001 the lakes have been stocked with Walleye fry every other year.  Following each stocking, fingerlings are recovered during fall electrofishing to get an idea of fry survival. <br> \n <br> \nThe average catch of YOY Walleye on Cedar Island Lake from 2001 2015 was 108/hour.  In 2015, the catch was 82.2/hour, the lowest recorded on Cedar Island since 2007.  Walleye fingerlings in Cedar Island ranged in length from 5.6 to 8.2 inches with an average length of 6.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe average catch of YOY Walleye on Horseshoe Lake from 2001 2015 was 143.8/hour.  In 2015, the catch was 54.7/hour, the lowest recorded since 2003.  Walleye fingerlings in Horseshoe ranged in length from 5.8 to 8.4 inches with an average length of 7.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough fingerling catch rates were down in both lakes from previous years, yearling (age 1) Walleye catch rates were significant on Cedar Island (57.4/hour) and Horseshoe (116.7/hour) Lakes.  Yearling Walleyes on Horseshoe Lake ranged in length from 8.1 to 10.5 inches with an average length of 10.5 inches.  Considering there is no record of either state or private stocking in 2014 these yearling Walleye are apparently from natural reproduction which has not been found in significant numbers since bi annual fall electrofishing began in 2001.   <br> \n <br> \nNative strains have the potential to survive better in a given watershed or region than non-native strains.  In an attempt to determine if these naturally reproduced Walleye are a separate genetic strain from the Mississippi River strain which have been stocked by the DNR in the past, scale samples from these yearlings were sent to the University of Minnesota for genetic analysis.  Annual fall electrofishing will be conducted for the next five years to try and determine the extent of natural reproduction in the Sauk River Chain of Lakes during both stocked and non stocked years <br> \n</p>",

Targeted surveys using trap nets around spawning time can give a more accurate picture of Bluegill size structure than standard surveys conducted later in the summer. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 305 Bluegill were caught; lengths ranged from 3.9 to 10.0 inches with an average length of 7.1 inches. Eighty-three percent of the Bluegill sampled were six inches or longer and 22% were eight inches or longer. These results are good for overall size and for larger Bluegill. Recent targeted Bluegill surveys in the Sauk Rapids Area have found the % > 6 inches ranged from 26 to 95 and % > 8 inches ranged from 0 to 52. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill grow slowly in the Sauk Rapids Area, taking up to eight years to reach eight inches. Anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill (> 8 inches) and keep smaller fish for a meal. This can help prevent stunted populations of small fish and keep larger Bluegill available. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 2 Pumpkinseed and 3 Hybrid Sunfish were also captured during the survey. <br> \n</p>",

Nearshore data were combined with gill net and trap net data from the 2018 summer survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score for Cedar Island Lake was 36.7 which is above the impairment threshold (FIBI > 24) for aquatic life using Tool 5. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency.

                "narrative": "<p>The Sauk River Chain of Lakes (SRCL) is located in Stearns County near the city of Richmond. The SRCL is the result of a dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring, which created numerous, connected waterbodies totaling over 3,200 acres. Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the largest basins, totaling over 1,500 acres. The Walleye fishery has been managed by stocking fry biennially at a rate of 1,000 per littoral acre. This has been augmented by hatchery surplus fry and fry bought by the lake association. Strong natural reproduction has been documented for year classes from 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2019 in both Cedar Island and Horseshoe Lake. Fall electrofishing is now being conducted annually to assess fry survival during both stocked and non stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nNo Walleye fry were stocked in 2019; and a young of the year (YOY) assessment was conducted on October 17, 2019. YOY catch rates were 104.2/hr (on time) for Cedar Island and 125.2/hr for Horseshoe Lake. YOY Walleye across survey ranged in length from 4.6 to 8.9 inches with an average length of 6.2 inches. The YOY catches in 2019 and 2018 (both non stocked years) were higher than in 2017 (stocked year). The average YOY catch for stocked years is 106/hr for Cedar Island and 131/hr for Horseshoe Lake. A lake survey conducted in 2018 found good numbers of Walleye in Cedar Island (5.1/gill net) and Horseshoe Lake (4.4/gill net). Ageing data showed that the naturally produced 2014 and 2016 year classes represented 52% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nBecause natural reproduction is occurring in the SRCL, the contribution of stocked fry is unknown. This could be assessed by marking all stocked fry, although annual fall electrofishing should provide a measure of year class strength for naturally reproduced Walleye as well. Stocking could be reduced or modified if natural reproduction is consistently strong. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Island Lake is located near Richmond, in south central Stearns County. Cedar Island Lake is part of the Sauk River Chain of Lakes (SRCL). It has a surface area of 998 acres and a maximum depth of 75 feet. The fishery of Cedar Island Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, Muskellunge, and Channel Catfish, although it is also a popular destination for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and panfish anglers. There is a public access located on the east side of Cedar Island Lake off County Road 71; however, navigable channels connect Cedar Island with Horseshoe Lake and the other downstream lakes in the Sauk River Chain. The Sauk River Chain was surveyed with gill nets in 2021 and the last lake survey was conducted in 2018.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Sauk River drains a large portion of central Minnesota before flowing through the SRCL. The Cedar Island Lake watershed is 581,461 acres with land use consisting of 64% agriculture, 10% pasture, 15% marsh/open water, 7% forest, and 5% residential. Emergent plants were mapped in 2018 and found to cover approximately 9% of the lake. Species found were yellow waterlily (50 acres), cattail spp. (19 acres), and white waterlily (18 acres). Efforts continue to be made to address existing non-point pollution sources, but most of the lakes in the chain remain classified as eutrophic. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been the focus of fisheries management on the SRCL. During the 1980s and 90s Walleye management consisted of Walleye fingerling stocking every other year. From 2001 to 2017 Walleye fry have been stocked every other spring in an attempt to increase the Walleye population with very good success during fall electrofishing. Since 2015, annual fall electrofishing was completed to further evaluate the consistency and extent of natural reproduction in the SRCL. Based on those results, the decision to pause all Walleye stocking was made in 2018 and since that time natural reproduction has been observed at levels similar to when stocking occurred. In 2021, the Walleye catch rate (6.3/net) set a new all-time high and was above the expected range of values for similar lakes. Walleye ranged in length from 10 - 24 inches and averaged 16 inches and 1.4 pounds. Sixty five percent of the Walleye sampled were longer than 15 inches and 13% were longer than 20 inches. Thirteen year classes were present in the age sample with naturally produced year classes making up 89% of the sample. Growth was average with both males and females exceeding 16 inches by age four. <br> \n <br> \nSince 2011, the SRCL has been stocked every two years with 1,030 Muskellunge fingerlings. Muskellunge are not sampled well with standard summer surveys because they exist in very low numbers. Spring surveys are used to evaluate adult Muskellunge populations because the fish concentrate in the shallows for spawning. Spring surveys have not been used to sample Muskellunge on Cedar Island Lake yet because the population is still developing, however anglers have reported catching fish in excess of 40 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance which has historically been low in Cedar Island, was the highest on record (7.5/net) in 2021. As abundance increased average size decreased however, and only seven percent of the Northern Pike sampled were longer than 26 inches. Northern Pike ranged in length from 15- 32 inches and averaged 21 inches and 2.1 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were originally stocked to provide anglers with another angling opportunity as well as to control the bullhead population. By 1990, catfish had become plentiful and displaced the bullhead species within the system. Angler complaints about catfish abundance persist today, although many anglers travel to the SRCL to fish for catfish. In fact catfish were the third most popular species targeted by anglers and comprised 40% of the total yield of fished harvested in the open water creel conducted in 2015. To give anglers a chance to take advantage of a surplus of Channel Catfish the daily and possession limits were increased to 10 starting in 2015. In 2021, the Channel Catfish catch was 11.3/net, a decrease from the rate of 17.6/ net in 2018, and a significant decrease from the record high catch rate of 33.1/ net in 2011. Channel Catfish ranged from 15 - 28 inches and averaged 21 inches and three pounds. The largest catfish sampled was 7.4 pounds. Anglers will find many catfish in the 18 - 23 inch range as this size made up 80% of the total catfish catch. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing for bass was not conducted in 2021, however in 2018 a total of 77 Largemouth Bass were captured in 2.0 hours of effort for a catch rate of 38.5/hour. This was lower than the average night time catch rate (74/hr) for the Sauk Rapids area and less than the next previous survey where electrofishing was conducted in 2003 (50.8/ hr). Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6 - 19 inches with an average length of 12 inches. Of the catchable Largemouth Bass (greater than 8 inches) half were larger than 12 inches and 27 percent were greater than 15 inches. A total of 19 Smallmouth Bass were also sampled by electrofishing in 2018 for a catch rate of 9.5/hour compared to 2003 when only one Smallmouth Bass was sampled. Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 8 - 18 inches with an average length of 11 inches. Of the catchable Smallmouth Bass (greater than 8 inches) 37 percent were larger than 12 inches and 11 percent were greater than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance in 2021 (1.3/net) was lower than reported in 2018 (3.3/net). Prior to 2003, all other surveys reported above average catch rates for Yellow Perch but since that time, catches have been at or below the expected range compared to similar lakes. Yellow Perch ranged from 6 - 8 inches and averaged 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance has been declining since 1980, but the average size has increased. The Black Crappie catch in 2021 (1.1/ gill net) was still within the range of expected values for lakes with similar characteristics and similar to 2018 (0.9/ gill net). Black Crappie ranged from 7 - 13 inches and averaged 10 inches. Eight year classes of crappie were sampled but the majority (82%) were from the 2020, 2019, or 2018 year class. Growth of crappie was fast, reaching a length of ten inches in three years. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted Bluegill survey conducted in May collected 272 Bluegill that ranged in length from 4 - 10 inches with an average length of 7.6 inches. Thirty-six percent of Bluegill were greater than eight inches in length. Six years classes were represented in the sample with the 57% of the catch was from the 2017 and 2018 year classes. Bluegill growth was fast reaching seven inches in three years. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Black and Brown Bullhead, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, River Redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

A dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring allows users to access over 3,200 acres by water. The fishery of the SRCL Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, Muskellunge, and Channel Catfish, although it is also a popular destination for panfish, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike anglers. Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the two largest basins in the SRCL comprising 50% of the total acreage of the Chain. The lakes are managed for Walleye and prior to 2001 were sustained by fingerling stocking. <br> \nSince 2001 the lakes have been stocked with Walleye fry every other year. Following each stocking, fingerlings are recovered during fall electrofishing to get an idea of fry survival. In 2015, a high catch rate of age-1 Walleyes was observed. Considering there is no record of either state or private stocking in 2014 these yearling Walleye are apparently from natural reproduction which has not been found in significant numbers since bi-annual fall electrofishing began in 2001. <br> \nStarting in 2015, Annual fall electrofishing will be conducted to try and determine the extent of natural reproduction in the Sauk River Chain of Lakes during both stocked and non-stocked years. In 2016, a fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate natural reproduction during a non-stocked year. <br> \nThe average catch of YOY Walleye after fry stocking on Cedar Island Lake from 2001-2015 was 108/hour. In 2016, the catch rate of YOY Walleye (127.3/hour) indicated good natural reproduction and fry survival. Fingerlings ranged in length from 6.2 to 9.0 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches. <br> \nThe average catch of YOY Walleye after fry stocking on Horseshoe Lake from 2001-2015 was 143.8/hour. In 2016, the catch rate of YOY Walleye (95.4/hour) indicated good natural reproduction and fry survival. Fingerlings ranged in length from 5.8 to 9.2 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches. <br> \nThe catch rates of Walleye greater than age-1 on Cedar Island (71.3/hour) and Horseshoe (69.6/hour) Lakes were higher than previous surveys. Age-1 and greater Walleye in Cedar Island Lake ranged in length from 9.6 to 19.5 inches with an average length of 12.1 inches and in Horseshoe Lake ranged in length from 8.8 to 20.4 with an average length of 13.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The chain is comprised of numerous, connected waterbodies totaling over 3,200 acres. Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the largest basins within the chain and total over 1,500 acres. Prior to 2001, the Walleye fishery had been sustained through fingerling stocking. Since then, the Walleye population has been sustained through natural reproduction and fry stocking during odd numbered years at a rate of 1,000 fry/littoral acre, supplemented along the way by surplus hatchery fry and fry stocked by the lake association. Annual fall electrofishing for young of year (YOY) Walleye was initiated in 2015 and documented adequate natural reproduction to sustain the fishery in both Horseshoe and Cedar Island lakes since then. Due to the strong natural reproduction, no Walleye stocking has occurred since 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nYOY electrofishing was conducted on October 10, 2022. YOY catch rates were 68.9/hr (on time) for Horseshoe and 33.8/hr for Cedar Island Lake which is an increase from 2021 (44.4/hr and 26.6/hr, respectively). YOY Walleye across surveys ranged in length from 4.7 to 8.5 inches with an average length of 6.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rates of Walleye greater than age-1 on Horseshoe (33.3/hr) and Cedar Island (31.8/hr) lakes were lower than 2021 (166.0/hr and 64.1/hr, respectively). Age-1 and greater Walleye in Horseshoe Lake ranged in length from 9.3 to 20.7 with an average length of 14.9 inches while in Cedar Island Lake they ranged in length from 12.1 to 28.5 inches with an average length of 16.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnnual fall electrofishing since 2015 has provided a measure of year class strength for naturally reproduced Walleye in the SRCL. Record high gill net catches in 2021 combined with the fact that 89% of the sampled Walleye were from non-stocked years, presents a strong case that Walleye stocking is not necessary in the SRCL at this time.</p>",

Northern Pike were sampled at a rate below the expected range of values for lakes with similar characteristics but growth rates were fast the first two years, then slowed to normal rates. Yellow Perch were sampled within the expected range for similar lakes and Largemouth Bass were sampled below the expected range. Bluegill catch rates were greater than the state median and growth rates were good. Black Crappie catch rates in trap nets were much greater than the state median and growth rates were good.\n\nOther species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Channel Catfish, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, and White Sucker.  All of these species were sampled either within or below their expected ranges for similar lakes with the expectation of White Sucker which were higher than expected in trap nets. \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Island Lake is a 998 acre lake located near Richmond, in south-central Stearns County.  Cedar Island Lake is part of the Sauk River Chain of Lakes (SRCL), which was formed by the dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring.  The fishery of Cedar Island Lake is managed primarily for walleye and channel catfish, although it is also a popular destination for largemouth bass, northern pike and panfish anglers.  The SRCL is very popular for all type of recreation. <br> \n <br> \nThe Sauk River drains a large portion of central Minnesota before flowing through the SRCL.  The Sauk River watershed including the Long Lake sub-watershed to the south encompasses nearly 700,000 acres.  Non-point source pollution continues to be a concern within the watershed; however, strides have been made to greatly reduce the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous entering the system.  Even with these improvements most of the lakes within the SRCL are still classified as hyper-eutrophic. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2010, as part of the Long Range Muskie and Northern Pike Management Plan the MNDNR proposed stocking five new lakes with muskellunge.  There was concern about the proposed muskellunge stocking in the SRCL (Cedar Island and Horseshoe lakes) by local residents and lakeshore owners.  Their primary concerns were increased boat traffic, lack of public access facilities, and predation by muskies on other sportfish.  However, the SRCL was one of two proposals that were approved for muskellunge management.  The 2011 assessment was conducted to update data on the fishery before muskellunge stocking.  One thousand-forty-two muskellunge fingerlings were stocked into Cedar Island and Horseshoe lakes (521 fingerlings each) in October 2011. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the 1980s and 90s walleye management consisted of walleye fingerling stocking every other year.  Since 2001, walleye fry have been stocked every other spring in an attempt to increase the walleye population with very good success (average: 85 young-of-the-year (yoy)/hr during fall electrofishing from 2001 - 2009).  Some natural reproduction may occur within the Sauk River Chain, but does not appear to contribute significantly to the walleye population.  In 2011, the walleye catch rate (4.1/net) was above average for class 36 lakes and the second highest in lake history.  Walleye ranged in length from 9 - 25 inches and averaged 15.5 inches and 1.4 pounds.  This was similar to 2003 (15.5 inches and 1.5 pounds).  Forty-two percent of the walleye sampled were larger than 15 inches and 14% were larger than 20 inches.  The largest walleye was 25 inches and 4.7 pounds.  Fall electrofishing again showed that fry stocking was successful (201 yoy/hr, 2011). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance remains low (1.6/net), but the size was above average.  Forty-two percent of the northern pike sampled were longer than 24 inches, and 15% were longer than 30 inches.  Northern pike ranged in length from 17 - 33 inches and averaged 24 inches and 3.1 pounds.  The largest northern pike was 33.1 inches and 8.8 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish were stocked into Cedar Island Lake from 1976 \u0013 1988 and have become abundant.  Channel catfish were originally stocked to provide anglers with another angling opportunity as well as to control the bullhead population.  By 1990, catfish had become plentiful and displaced the bullhead species within the system.  Angler complaints about catfish abundance persist today, although many anglers travel to the SRCL to fish for catfish.  In 2011, the channel catfish catch (33.1/net) was the highest on record.  Channel catfish sampled ranged from 11 - 26 inches and averaged 16 inches and 1.4 pounds. The largest catfish sampled was 26 inches and 5.8 pounds. Anglers will find many catfish in the 14 - 17 inch range as this size made up 68% of the total catfish catch. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance in 2011 (0.2/net) was lower than reported in 2003 (1.9/net) and the lowest on record.  Only two yellow perch were sampled during the survey.  Prior to 2003, all other surveys reported above average catch rates for yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nBoth black crappie and bluegill net catches have decreased but the average size has increased.  Fifty-five percent of the black crappies sampled were longer than nine inches and 36% of the bluegills sampled were longer than seven inches.  The largest black crappie was 12.5 inches and 1.2 pounds and the largest bluegill was 9.5 inches and 0.8 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: common carp, greater redhorse, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, smallmouth bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A reduced bag limit on sunfish (10 fish daily) was enacted on Cedar Island Lake beginning March 1, 2021. In order to collect additional pre regulation data, a targeted panfish assessment was conducted on Cedar Island Lake from May 19-21, 2021. Targeted surveys using trap nets around spawning time can give a more accurate picture of Bluegill abundance and size structure than standard surveys conducted later in the summer.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 272 Bluegill were caught; lengths ranged from four to 10 inches with an average length of eight inches. Ninety-seven percent of the Bluegill sampled were longer than six inches and 36% were longer than eight inches. These results are excellent for both fish greater than six inches and eight inches. Recent targeted Bluegill surveys in the Sauk Rapids Area have found these values to have ranged from 26 to 98 percent over six inches and from 0 to 54 percent over eight inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nTwo hundred and eighteen Black Crappie were also caught in the survey; lengths ranged from five to 13 inches with an average length of nine inches. For Cedar Island Lake, 94% of the crappie caught were eight inches or longer while 31% of the catch were 10 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill grow slowly in the Sauk Rapids Area, taking up to 8 years to reach 8 inches. Anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill (> 8 inches) and keep smaller fish for a meal. This can help prevent stunted populations of small fish and keep larger Bluegill available. <br> \n</p>",
