                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 463-acre lake located in Sherburne County three miles north of the City of Big Lake. The lake has a maximum depth of 18 feet and average depth of 11 feet. A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake on County Road 75. A standard survey was completed in 1988 to update fisheries data last collected in 1982. Only gillnets were used for this survey.\n\nThe Northern Pike catch rate in 1988 (1.2/gill net) decreased from 1982 (6.2/gill net). A total of seven pike were sampled and the year classes present were from 1983 - 1985. The median length of the pike sampled was 23 inches and an average individual weight of just under three pounds. \n\nThe Black Crappie catch rate in 1988 (19.2/gill net) was similar to 1982 (21.5/gill net) and above the expected range of values for the lake class. The White Crappie catch rate in 1988 (17.0/gill net) was lower than 1982 (51.3/gill net), but was above the expected range of values for the lake class. Growth rates were good for crappies and condition appeared to be excellent.\n\nThe Bluegill catch rate in 1988 (0.2/gill net) was similar to 1982 (0.8/gill net) and at the low end of expected values for the lake class. No trap nets were used in this survey.\n\nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 1988 (12.2/gill net) was the same as 1982 (12.5/gill net) and within the expected range of values for the lake class. Individuals representing the adult stock had a median length group of 5.5 - 5.9 inches. Summer seine hauls included plentiful young of year Yellow Perch.\n\nSpring Largemouth Bass seining sampled 33 bass in four hauls. Largemouth Bass sampled were ages one - five and growth was good. \n\nOther species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Redhorse, and White Sucker.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 381-acre lake located in central Sherburne County, three miles north of the City of Big Lake. The lake has a maximum depth of 18 feet with an average depth of 11 feet. A public access is located along the northwest shore. A standard survey was completed in 1993 to update fisheries data last collected in 1988.No walleye were sampled during the 1993 survey and had not been reported in the 2 previous surveys. Walleye fry (320,000/year) were stocked in both 1984 and 1989, however, survival of these fish seems limited.        Northern Pike catch rate (1.8/gill net) increased slightly from the previous survey (1.2/gill net), however, remained low in comparison to other lakes like Eagle. Northern pike ranged in length from 18.8 - 32.4 inches and averaged 25.4 inches. The average weight of Northern Pike (4.1 pounds) was large for this lake class. The majority of pike caught were three and four year olds and the growth rate was fast when compared to other lakes statewide.       Black Crappie catch decreased slightly in the gill nets from 19.2/net in 1988 to 6.7/net in 1993, however, remained in the normal range for lakes similar to Eagle Lake. Black Crappies ranged in length from 6.4 - 9.6 inches and averaged 8.5 inches. The majority of Black Crappie sampled were three and four year olds and growth was average compared to other lakes statewide.        Bluegill catch was relatively low in the trap nets (3.3/net), however, was high in the gill nets (29.5/net) showing the lake may have had a good bluegill population. Anglers did report that Bluegill were fairly easy to catch in the summer. Bluegill sampled in nets ranged in length from 2.6 - 7.2 inches and averaged 6.5 inches. The majority of Bluegill sampled were four and five year olds and growth rates were average.        Largemouth Bass populations were estimated by spring electrofishing. A total of 34 bass were caught at a rate of 13.6 fish/hour, a relatively low figure. Anglers reported bass were fairly easy to catch and perhaps the poor water quality lowered the catch rate. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 9.3 - 20.0 inches and averaged 11.8 inches. Largemouth Bass in Eagle Lake grew near the statewide average. From summer test netting it was revealed that good natural reproduction occurred in the lake.         Yellow Perch catch rate in gill nets stayed steady from the last survey and remained well within normal levels for the lake class. Yellow Perch averaged 6.7 inches in length and the majority of the fish sampled were two and three year olds. In addition to these game fish, White Suckers (5.2/gill net) were highly abundant in the lake and weighed an average of 1.9 pounds. Black Bullhead numbers decreased slightly to 6.5/gillnet, but remained within expected levels for the lake class.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is located in central Sherburne County, three miles north of the city of Big Lake.  It has a surface area of 381 acres and a maximum depth of 18 feet.  A public access is located along the northwest shore, and has a boat ramp.A survey was conducted in 2002 to assess fish populations, and included spring electrofishing and summer netting (trap nets, gill nets, and seines).  Catch rates were compared to lakes with similar characteristics as a way to evaluate the fish populations of Eagle Lake.  Results were also compared to past surveys of Eagle Lake (most recently in 1993) to track changes over time.  The survey also included water chemistry analysis, watershed mapping, and an aquatic plant survey.Eagle Lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass and northern pike.  The bass population size appeared moderate in 2002, based on electrofishing.  Most bass were between 12-15 inches in length, and the largest was 16.5 inches.  The catch rate of northern pike was in the range expected for a lake like Eagle.  Most of the northern pike were 19-21 inches in length, but a few larger individuals were sampled, including one over 36 inches.Catch rates for bluegill and black crappie were within the normal range in 2002, although average size was low.  However, a high number of crappie were sampled in gill nets.  Many of the crappie were from the 2000 and 2001 year classes, and may provide good angling opportunities in the next few years.  White crappie are also present in Eagle Lake, but in lower abundance than black crappie.  A crappie over three pounds was reportedly caught in Eagle Lake in the winter of 2001, and it was thought to be a hybrid between black and white crappie.  Eagle Lake also has a small walleye population, supported by stocking of fingerlings.  Only one walleye was caught during the summer netting, but several others were sampled by electrofishing in the spring.  Most were from the 2000 year class, and were ten inches long, on average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 463 acre recreational development lake located 3 miles north of the City of Big Lake. The lake has a maximum depth of 18 feet and was designated as infested with Eurasian watermilfoil in 2005. Twenty one species of aquatic plants were identified with submersed plants growing to a maximum depth of seven feet. Curly-leaf pondweed grew at or near the surface on 5.8% of the surface area. The lake is primarily managed for largemouth bass and the DNR has not stocked walleye since 1991; however the lake association has stocked walleye fingerlings since 2000 and annually since 2007. There is one public access located on the NW side of the lake off of CR 75. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of northern pike was significantly higher than in 2002, but within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Northern pike sampled during the survey ranged from 16 to 32 inches with an average length and weight of 23 inches and 2.9 pounds. Growth of northern pike was similar to the statewide average with northern pike reaching 23 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry were stocked by the DNR multiple times between 1971 and 1991, but due to limited success stocking was discontinued after 1991. The Eagle Lake Association began stocking walleye fingerlings in 2000 and since 2007 have stocked walleye fingerlings annually. The catch rate of walleye was higher than 2002, but within the ranged of expected values for similar lakes. Walleye ranged in length from 8 to 25 inches with an average length and weight of 17 inches and 1.9 pounds. Growth of walleye was fast with walleye reaching 16 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled during daytime electrofishing on May 2, 2012. A total of 62 largemouth bass were captured in 1.2 hours for a catch rate of 53/hour. This was higher than the median catch rate for daytime electrofishing in the Montrose area (37.8/hr). Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6 to 19.5 inches with an average length and weight of 12 inches and 1.1 pounds. Growth of largemouth bass was average, reaching 12 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch of black crappie was below expected values for similar lakes; however, the gill net catch was over 2.5 times higher than expected values for similar lakes. Black crappie collected ranged in length from 4 to 10 inches with an average length and weight of 8 inches and 0.3 pounds. Growth of black crappie was slow, reaching 8 inches in 5 years. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch (12.7/trap net) was higher than in 2002 (4.8/trap net), but within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Bluegill ranged in length from 2 to 7 inches, with an average length of 5 inches. Growth of bluegill was slow with bluegill reaching 7 inches in 6 years. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included: black, brown and yellow bullhead, banded killifish, blacknose shiner, bluntnose minnow, bowfin (dogfish), brook silverside, common carp, fathead minnow, green, hybrid, and pumpkinseed sunfish, Johnny darter, Iowa darter, tadpole madtom, yellow perch, and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 463-acre lake located in Sherburne County three miles north of the City of Big Lake. The lake has a maximum depth of 18 feet and average depth of 11 feet. A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake on County Road 75. A standard fisheries survey was completed in 1982. \n\nNorthern Pike abundance in 1982 (6.2/gill net) was average for the lake class and was higher than the previous survey. Northern Pike ages three through five made up nearly 90% of the sample. Growth was average. Natural reproduction of pike was evident as demonstrated by strong year classes in 1977 and 1978 when spring water levels were favorable.\n\nNo Walleye were sampled in the standard survey in 1982, but were taken at the outlet trap in the spring.\n\nLargemouth Bass catch rates were low (0.2/gill net) and (0.1/trap net).\n\nBlack Crappie catch rate (21.5/gill net) was above the normal range of values.\n\nWhite Crappie catch rates (51.3/gill net) and (22.8/trap net) were also above the normal range of values.\n\nBluegill catch rate (14.7/trap net) was in the expected range of values.\n\nOther species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore and littoral fish species in Eagle Lake was conducted beginning on June 17th, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations and a 15-foot seine was used at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter), and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 24th, 2020 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-St. Cloud Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 463 acre, highly developed recreational lake located three (3) miles north of Big Lake. The lake has a maximum depth of 18 feet with relatively poor water quality and has been plagued with Common Carp problems for decades. There is one (1) public access located on the northwest side of the lake off County Road 75. A lake survey was completed August 24 - 28, 2020 to update fisheries data last collected in 2012 and included summer gill netting and trap netting. <br> \n <br> \nA floating leaf and emergent vegetation survey was completed in September. Emergent vegetation covered less than 1% of the lake area with cattail and waterlily as the main species present. Submerged vegetation was surveyed in 2012 and plants grew to a depth of seven (7) feet. Bushy pondweed and coontail were the only plants rated as common. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing is the preferred sampling method to assess Largemouth Bass populations; however Largemouth Bass sampling was not conducted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Largemouth Bass were last surveyed by day-time electrofishing in 2012 with a catch rate (53/hr) similar to the day-time average (54/hr) for lakes within the Sauk Rapids area. Sixty-two Largemouth Bass were sampled in 2012 and ranged in length from six (6) to 20 inches with an average length of 12 inches. Fifty-seven percent of the bass sampled were 12 inches or longer and 22% were 15 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry were stocked by the DNR multiple times between 1971 and 1991, but due to limited success, stocking was discontinued. The Lake Association began stocking Walleye in 2000 and has stocked fingerlings regularly ever since, most recently in 2017. The Walleye catch in 2020 was lower than 2012, but still within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Thirteen Walleye were captured and ranged in length from 17 to 27 inches with an average length and weight of 20 inches and three (3) pounds. All Walleye sampled were longer than 15 inches and 38% were longer than 20 inches. Walleye growth is fast, taking three (3) years to reach 17 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nRelatively low Northern Pike abundance offer anglers an opportunity to catch quality-sized pike. However, anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike (<22 inches) and release the medium-sized pike (>26 inches) to help protect the size structure. The Northern Pike catch in 2020 was lower than 2012, but still within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Pike sampled ranged in length from 18 to 32 inches with an average length and weight of 24 inches and three (3) pounds. Thirty-six pike were sampled and 25% were longer than 26 inches and 8% were longer than 30 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers have the opportunity for good crappie action in Eagle Lake. Although the catch in 2020 was lower than 2015, Black Crappie abundance was still high for the lake. Three hundred-one Black Crappie were sampled and ranged in length from four (4) to 10 inches with an average length of eight (8) inches. Eighty-five percent of the crappies sampled were longer than eight (8) inches, but only 1% were longer than 10 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in Eagle Lake is average, but a few quality size Bluegill are present. The Bluegill catch in 2020 was higher than 2012 and the highest on record, but still within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Five hundred thirty-one Bluegill were sampled and ranged in length from three (3) to nine (9) inches with an average length of seven (7) inches. Eighty-seven percent of the Bluegill sampled were longer than six (6) inches, but less than 1% were longer than eight (8) inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches were high from 1982-1993, but have decreased significantly since then. Only 28 Yellow Perch were caught in 2020 and none were caught in 2012. Yellow Perch ranged in length from three (3) to nine (9) inches and averaged seven (7) inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Bullhead catch in 2020 was much higher than 2012 and was the highest on record. Prior to 2020, Yellow Bullhead had been sampled in low numbers. With the boom in Yellow Bullhead abundance, anglers have the opportunity to harvest good-sized Yellow Bullhead if they choose. Yellow Bullhead ranged in length from six (6) to 15 inches with an average length and weight of 12 inches and one (1) pound.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include: Black and Brown Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
