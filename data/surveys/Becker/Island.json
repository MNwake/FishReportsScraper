                "narrative": "<p>The lake's earliest survey, conducted in 1960, found an abundance of sunfish, yellow perch, and walleyes.  Substantial populations of northern pike and largemouth bass were also present.  A population explosion of crayfish in the 1960's and early 1970's significantly reduced aquatic vegetation.  Despite some stocking efforts, northern pike and centrarchid populations were decimated by this loss of habitat.  Yellow perch, and to a lesser extent walleye, also declined.  The walleye population was bolstered by stocking nearly every year, however.  Bullheads continued to thrive under the conditions.  Not until the 1980's, when crayfish numbers were declining, did most species begin to rebound.The current northern pike gillnet catch of 1.50/GN has not changed significantly since the late 1960's.  It is well below the first quartile value for this lake class (#25).  The majority of fish are either two or three years old, indicating successful recruitment.  The growth rate appears to be average.  The northern pike population did not improve with stocking in the 60's and early 70's and stocking was discontinued in 1973.  It was likely beneficial to walleyes and yellow perch that northern pike did not respond to stocking or return naturally to their former levels.Based on commercial fishing reports, bullheads were abundant prior to 1960 and continued to thrive while other species declined.  Lake survey net catches have varied considerably from survey to survey, possibly in response to periodic commercial harvest.  The black bullhead population, subjected to annual commercial harvest since 1985, has been declining, but they are still abundant for this lake class.  Bullheads attain a large size in this lake which makes them attractive to commercial fishermen.The 1960 survey found bluegills to be very abundant at 92.13/TN.  The size structure was generally small with a few larger fish present (PSD=20 and RSD(8)=10).  Bluegills did not recover from the dramatic decline of the 60's until recently.  The current trapnet catch of 60.08/TN is once again above the third quartile for this lake class.  Current size structure is remarkably similar to that of 1960 (PSD=25 and RSD(8)=7).  Growth rate is average.  Pumpkinseeds, extremely abundant in 1960 at 191.30/TN, have failed to recover and remain at a low level (2.17/TN).The histories of smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and black crappie populations are similar to that of the sunfish.  Having suffered major declines, they are only recently recovering.  Largemouth bass and black crappie trapnet catches are currently between the first and third quartile for this lake class while smallmouth bass are actually above former levels and the third quartile value for this lake class.  All three species exhibit growth rates that are average or slightly above.Yellow perch recovered early from the decline of 60's but never to their former level of 80.00/GN.  The current gillnet catch of 19.33/GN is nearing the third quartile value for this lake class.  The reduced predator populations of the 60's and 70's undoubtedly contributed to an early recovery for yellow perch.  Fifty-four percent of the perch gillnetted in the current survey were over nine inches in length and may be of interest to anglers.  However, yellow grub is present in many of the yellow perch.Walleyes were stocked regularly in this lake from 1945 through 1985.  Stocking undoubtedly helped sustain a good population through the 60's and 70's although not near the gillnet catch recorded in 1960 (20.67/GN).  In the 80's, large numbers of walleyes were again found to be present and many were the result of natural reproduction.  Walleye stocking was discontinued after 1985.  The current walleye gillnet catch of 16.67/GN is considerably less than the record high 27.75/GN recorded in 1988, but still nearly three times the third quartile value for this lake class.  The current population shows that excellent recruitment is still occurring with large numbers of one through four year old fish present.  Growth rate appears to be normal.  The current population represents a good angling opportunity with PSD=58 and RSD(20)=6.  Anglers encountered during the survey reported excellent walleye fishing in 1992.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island is a 1,142-acre, class 25 lake located in central Becker County approximately 5.5 miles northwest of Snellman.  The lake offers a quality multi-species fishery for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Smallmouth Bass.  Water quality and fish habitat in Island Lake are also well suited for Walleyes, with natural reproduction sustaining this species.  No Walleye stocking has been done since 1985 and Island Lake is one of only three lakes in the Detroit Lakes Management Area to have a Walleye population entirely sustained by natural reproduction.  A reduced daily limit regulation of 10 Bluegill was implemented in March 2022. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch rate for Walleye in 2023 was 17 fish per net.  This is just above the lake's long-term average of 16 fish per net.  The average length of Walleyes sampled in 2023 was 16 inches and lengths ranged from eight to 27 inches.  The age frequency of sampled Walleye was mostly comprised of young fish, with several good year classes shaping up to provide quality fishing in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nGill net catches of Northern Pike have historically been quite stable.  The catch rate in 2023 was four fish per net, which was the highest on record, and well above the historical average.  Pike tend to be on the smaller side in Island Lake, and lengths of pike ranged from 17 to 27 inches with an average length of 20 inches in 2023.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets captured only nine Bluegill per net in 2023.  This catch rate was well below the lake's average catch of 31 fish per net.  Bluegill in trap nets averaged five inches in length and ranged from 3 to 10 inches.  Gill nets also captured a fair number of Bluegill, despite not being a standard method for catching Bluegill.  Their average size was bigger than trap nets at 8 ? inches.  The primary goal of the Bluegill special regulation that was implemented in March 2022 is to maintain the quality Bluegill population in Island Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther sunfish species observed during the survey in 2023 included Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Black Crappie.  Historically, the numbers of Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie captured during fish surveys in Island Lake have been quite low, and 2023 was no exception.  The size of fish that were observed was 14 to 16 inches for Largemouth Bass and 5 to 13 inches for Black Crappie.  Smallmouth Bass numbers observed in gill nets reached a new record at seven smallmouth per net.  This is also well above the historical average of two fish per net.  The mean length of Smallmouth Bass was 13 inches and lengths ranged from five to 18 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch rate declined yet again to just over two fish per net in 2023, the second lowest rate recorded.  The lake's historical average is almost 19 fish per set.  Lengths of sampled perch ranged from five to 13 inches and averaged seven inches.  Other fish species observed during the survey included Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is noted primarily for its walleye fishing although the fish community is diverse enough to support angling opportunities for northern pike, yellow perch, black crappie, bluegill, and both largemouth and smallmouth bass.  For a 1,142 acre lake, it receives a substantial amount of fishing pressure when the fishing is good.The lake is well suited to walleye natural reproduction and test net catches remained high at 18.1 walleyes per set.  There has been no stocking of walleye in Island Lake for 18 years.  Several year classes of walleye were found.  Sampled walleyes averaged just over 1.5 pounds.  In addition, fall sampling of fingerling walleyes during the past three years has shown consistently strong levels of reproduction.Bluegills and crappies were small and young.  The population of each of these species was dominated by a single year class (2000 for crappies, 2001 for bluegills).The average net catch of smallmouth bass was near its historic high for Island Lake.  Smallmouths over 17 inches were caught.  Four equally strong year classes were found (1998-2001).Information provided by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency showed that Island Lake is categorized as a mesotrophic lake.  This means that the lake is about midway in the aging spectrum between a young, clear, infertile lake (oligotrophic) and an older, turbid, fertile lake (eutrophic).Lakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging process in Island Lake by using best management practices for their landscaping activities.  For those who want to change things on their shoreline property, two excellent sources are available to help in landscaping a shoreline in ways that do the least damage and have the most benefit to the lake's water quality, fish community, and, ultimately, property values.  These sources are the book \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and the computer CD \"Restore Your Shore.\"  Both are available through the Minnesota Bookstore.</p>",

Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations with five sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample 10 stations and conditions prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 23 native species of fish including species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in August 2012 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Island Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and indicates a healthy fish community. Data from this survey will be included as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Otter Tail River watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Island Lake was conducted on July 5-6, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 11 stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample one station, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 23 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Smallmouth Bass, and Rock Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Island Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to the previous assessment which determined Island Lake fully supported aquatic life use based on the FIBI. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Ottertail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island is a 1,142-acre, class 25 lake located in central Becker County approximately 5.5 miles northwest of Snellman.  Water quality and fish habitat in Island Lake are good, and the lake is ecologically classified as mesotrophic.  As such, Island Lake is ecologically suited to Walleyes and natural reproduction of this species has sustained the population for several years.  No stocking has been done since 1985.  Island Lake is one of only three lakes in the Detroit Lakes Management Area to have a Walleye population entirely sustained by natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch rate in 2017 was 15.3 fish per net.  This was the first time the Walleye catch rate fell below the lake's long term average of 16.7 fish per net since 1986.  The mean length of Walleyes sampled in 2017 was 15.9 inches and lengths ranged from 9.1 to 24.5 inches.  The age frequency of sampled Walleye was mostly comprised of young fish, with several good year classes coming up.  Future Walleye abundances in Island Lake could be some of the highest ever seen in this lake if the 2015, 2016, and 2017 year-classes survive to catchable size.   <br> \n <br> \nGill net catches of Northern Pike have historically been remarkably stable.  The catch rate in eleven of the twelve fisheries surveys has ranged from a low of 0.8 fish per net to a high of 3.6 fish per net.  The highest catch rate for Northern Pike was recorded in 1960 at 5.3 fish per net.  The catch rate in 2017 was 3.6 fish per net, above the historical average of 2.2 fish per net.  Lengths of sampled pike in 2017 ranged from 17.4 to 28.6 inches with a mean length of 21.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch rate declined yet again to 6.1 fish per net in 2017, the third lowest rate recorded.  The lake's historical mean is 19.9 fish per set.  Lengths of sampled perch ranged from 5.7 to 12.9 inches with a mean length of 7.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catches of Bluegill remained above the historical rate of 30.8 fish per net at 39.6 fish per net in 2017.  The mean length of trap net sampled Bluegill was 4.8 inches and lengths ranged from 3.0 to 8.0 inches.  This was the first survey since 1989 that a Bluegill longer than 9.0 inches was not sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nOther sampled sunfish species included Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Black Crappie.  Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie relative abundances in sample nets have been historically quite low.  Gill nets were by far the most productive Smallmouth Bass sampling gear in 2017 with a catch rate of 3.3 fish per set, up slightly from 2012.  The mean length of gill-net sampled Smallmouth Bass was 13.8 inches and lengths ranged from 5.6 to 19.8 inches.   </p>",

Populations of perch, walleye, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, and bluegill are considerably above the median numbers for this area.No concise determination of fishing pressure has been conducted.  During the survey one carp (6.8 lbs.) was taken in a trapnet.  Except for appearing in the Red River proper carp have been authenticated to be only as far north as Lobster Lake in Douglas County and Pine Lake immediately north of Mille Lacs Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is noted primarily for its walleye fishing although the fish community is diverse enough to support angling for northern pike, yellow perch, black crappie, bluegill, and both largemouth and smallmouth bass.  For a 1,142-acre lake, it receives a substantial amount of fishing pressure when fishing is good. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is well suited to walleye natural reproduction and test net catches remained very high at 21.3 walleyes per set.  There has been no stocking of walleye in Island Lake for 23 years.  Eleven different year classes of walleye were found.  Sampled walleyes averaged a little over a pound each.  In addition, fall sampling of fingerling walleyes during six of the past eight years has shown consistently strong levels of natural walleye reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and crappie populations were slightly older and larger than five years ago.  Single year classes no longer dominated the populations of these species, and several age groups of each were found indicating more consistent reproduction during recent years. <br> \n <br> \nThe average net catch of smallmouth bass was above its historic average for Island Lake, and smallmouth bass over 17 inches were caught.  Three equally strong and four less abundant year classes were found during sampling. <br> \n <br> \nBased on data reported by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, Island Lake is mesotrophic.  The lake is about midway in the aging spectrum between a young, clear, infertile lake (oligotrophic) and an older, turbid, fertile lake (eutrophic).  Moderate algal blooms have been observed during several recent summers. <br> \n <br> \nLakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging process in Island Lake by using best management practices on their land.  For those who want to help maintain good water quality by managing their shoreline property, two excellent sources are available to help in landscaping a shoreline in ways that do the least damage and have the most benefit to the lake's water quality, fish community, and, ultimately, property values.  These sources are the book \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and the computer CD \"Restore Your Shore.\"  Both are available through the Minnesota Bookstore. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is located in central Becker County approximately 5.5 miles NW of Snellman, Minnesota along the eastern edge of the Ottertail River watershed.  The lake's immediate watershed consists of a hardwood/conifer forest inter-mixed with tamarack/black spruce swampland.  The topography is gently rolling and soils are glacial till in origin.  This scenic lake has long been a favorite resort destination with a total of four resorts currently in operation.  As with many area lakes, Island Lake has seen a dramatic increase in shoreline development.  Since the 1960s numbers of seasonal cabins and lakehomes have nearly tripled and yet the lake retains some of the most desired lakeshore in the county.Island Lake is one of eleven area lakes fitting ecological lake class 25.  Lakes within this class are some of the areas most scenic and pristine.   Other area lakes in this lake class include Bad Medicine, Elbow, Buffalo, Little Cormorant and Long.  Fish communities associated with lake class 25 are often dominated by northern pike, yellow bullhead, and bluegill but display great species diversity.  Most lake class 25 lakes support only moderate walleye populations (3.37 walleye/acre).Island Lake demonstrates the dynamic physical and biological nature of lakes.  Early lake sounding maps describe water levels much lower than those recorded during the past thirty years.  Lake islands of the past have been greatly reduced or completely submerged by rising water levels.  The lake has also experienced dramatic changes within its plant and fish communities.  A population explosion of crayfish in the 1960s and early 1970s drastically reduced aquatic vegetation which was followed by declines in most fish populations particularly northern pike and panfish species.  Black bullheads, however, took advantage of these declines with a virtual explosion in their numbers during the 1970s and early 1980s.  Black bullhead numbers have returned to normal levels possibly due to changes in the fish community and commercial fishing.  A crayfish decline during the 1980s was followed by a rebound throughout the fish community with smallmouth bass and walleye reaching or exceeding historical high catch rates.Fish stocking and removal records date back to 1920.  Since 1945 Island Lake has received 34 stockings of walleye, 11 stockings of northern pike, 5 stockings of bluegill, and 4 stockings of largemouth bass.  Stocking of all species was discontinued in 1985.  Fish removal has consisted primarily of commercial harvest of black bullhead.  Since 1958 over 133,000 pounds of black bullhead have been harvested from these waters.Island is one of the areas most popular walleye lakes often drawing large opening weekend crowds.  For the past ten years anglers have enjoyed a very prolific \"natural\" walleye population, with abundance indicies nearly nine times the lake class median.  The current walleye catch rate of 22.2/net is over seven times the lake class median and is the third highest recorded for this lake.  Ten year classes were identified.  Ages II, III, and IV comprised 84% of the sample, 14%, 37%, and 33% respectively.  The length frequency distribution describes a population rich in \"keeper sized\" walleye with few surviving beyond 20 inches in length.  Average length was 15.6 inches.   Average weight of gill net sampled walleye (1.3 lbs.) falls slightly below the lake class median of 1.7 lbs.  Growth rates appear normal through age IV but fall slightly below state wide average beyond age IV.  Though walleye recruitment has been sufficient to sustain a high quality fishery in recent years, future success may require a larger proportion of spawning age fish.Island Lake lacks several elements crucial to sustain a quality northern pike population.  Shortages of spawning habitat, midsummer cold water refuge and a high energy forage base limit both the abundance and maximum size of northern pike.  However, low abundances of pike have probably helped the walleye population.  Though the current northern pike catch rate of 2.7/set is below the lake class median (5.8/set), it represents the highest reported level since the historical high of 1960 (5.3/set).  The catch was dominated by young fish (86% three years or younger) which heavily influenced the size structure.  Average length (19.0 in.) and weight (1.4 lbs.) showed little change from previous assessments.  Average weight of northern pike was 30% behind the lake class median of 2.0 lbs.  Growth rates were slightly above average with females growing predictably faster than males.Yellow perch and crayfish were the primary forage species present.  Since 1960 yellow perch have maintained relatively normal levels (13.3 to 24.2/set).  The current gill net catch rate of 4.2/set is well below the lake class average (13.3/set) and represents a new historical low.  Current low levels of perch may be the result of predation by walleye and could lead to substantial changes in the fish community.  The size structure suggests that excessive pressure has been placed on the perch population.  Seventy-four percent were greater than 10 inches describing a size structure with large adults and few forage sized year classes.Island is one of a few area lakes supporting smallmouth bass populations.  Since 1986 smallmouth bass have maintained populations well above the average value for lake class 25.  Reports of quality size smallmouth are not uncommon.  Many of the catches are incidental while walleye fishing, often providing an exciting mixed bag for anglers.  Because of the heavy incidental fishing pressure put on smallmouth, concerns of excessive harvest of quality sized smallmouth may become an issue.  Regulations designed to improve or maintain the size structure of the smallmouth bass population may be a consideration.Bluegill have declined thirty fold since the previous assessment in 1992.  The current trap net catch rate of 2.9/set is well below the average for lake class 25 and represents the lowest level since 1975.  The size structure is dominated by small fish with only 14% of the catch over 6 inches in length.  Age I and II fish contributed heavily (75%) to the size structure.  Growth rates appear to be near normal.  No pumpkinseeds were captured during this assessment but were abundant in the past.Both largemouth bass and black crappie populations appear to be at or near historical low levels, failing to recover from declines experienced in the mid to late 1960s.  Catch rates for both species were also below their normal lake class range.Bowfin (dogfish), though never sampled from these waters prior to 1992, have established a strong presence in the fish community.  A trap net catch rate of 3.8/set is over four times the lake class average.  A known predator of panfish, bowfin may have contributed to the recent decline of those species.Lakes are a valuable and vulnerable resource requiring vigilant stewardship by both agencies and citizens.  Stewardship requires the understanding that what we do on the land and in the water has a direct impact on the lake, biologically, chemically and aesthetically.  Lake stewardship extends beyond the lake shore out into the watershed where agricultural, residential and urban land management practices can greatly impact a lake's welfare.  As a lakeshore owner, supporting your lakeshore association and adopting shoreland best management practices* can yield big dividends for the individual, the lake, and the watershed.*copies of the series \"Shoreland Best Management Practices\" are available at area DNR offices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 1,179-acre lake located in central Becker County.  The lake possesses excellent spawning habitat well suited for Walleye reproduction.  This survey was performed in early August and utilized gill nets with the intention of evaluating the Walleye population in Island Lake.   <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye gill net catch rates have remained stable in Island Lake dating back to 1986.  On average, approximately 13 Walleye were caught per gill net in the 2020 survey.  The average length of Walleye sampled in 2020 was 15.0 inches and Walleye ranged in length from 4.7 to 26.3 inches.  Walleye between 12 to 14 inches were most abundant, accounting for about 38% of the total Walleye catch.  Island Lake continues to be only one of three lakes in the Detroit Lakes Fisheries Management Area that supports a Walleye population sustained by natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nNet catches of Northern Pike have increased slightly in recent surveys, but remain low relative to many surrounding lakes of similar size.  The 2020 catch rate of Northern Pike was about two pike per net.  Pike sampled in 2020 measured between 18.4 and 23.3 inches, with an average length of 21 inches.   <br> \nIn the 2020 survey, about two Yellow Perch were caught per gill net, below the lake's historic average of 10 perch per net.  Sampled perch averaged 7.2 inches in length, and ranged from 5.6 to 12.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 survey did not utilize a sampling gear that targeted panfish species, but bass and panfish comprise a large portion of the fish community in Island Lake.  Panfish catch was dominated by Bluegill (58 total) and Smallmouth Bass (28 total).  Additional species sampled included White Sucker, Bullhead (Brown and Yellow), and Rock Bass. <br> \n</p>",

Smallmouth bass, bluegill and black crappie populations appear to be rebounding from lows in the seventies and early eighties and are presently above average abundance for this area.  Yellow perch numbers are about average, but, have decreased significantly since 1960.  Present walleye population is composed mainly of age groups I through III with each successive age group significantly smaller.  Growth is good; natural reproduction is excellent; average size has decreased; and abundance is several times state and local medians.  Black bullheads were first recorded in 1975 and are presently well above average abundance for this area.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is noted primarily for its walleye fishing although the fish community is diverse enough to support angling for northern pike, yellow perch, black crappie, bluegill, and both largemouth and smallmouth bass.  For a 1,142-acre lake, it receives a substantial amount of fishing activity when fishing is good.  In addition to the adjacent homes and cabins and the public access, Island Lake receives fishing pressure from four resorts.  Based on data reported by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, Island Lake is mesotrophic.  Moderate algal blooms have been observed during several recent summers. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is well suited to walleye natural reproduction and test net catches remained high in 2012 at 16 walleyes per set.  There has been no stocking of walleye in Island Lake since 1985.  Walleyes attributed to 12 different year classes were found in 2012.  Sampled walleyes averaged 14.5 inches in length and just over a pound each.  In addition, fall sampling of fingerling walleyes during 10 of the past 12 years has shown frequent, strong levels of natural walleye reproduction-especially in 2006 and 2011 (ages six and one). <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Island Lake's northern pike have been neither abundant nor large in size.  That was also the case in 2012.  The gill net catch rate was 3.1 pike per set and the average length of pike was 21.6 inches.  However, for the first time since assessments began in 1960, a pike larger than 30 inches was sampled. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough there was a wide range of sizes present in the bluegill and crappie populations, young fish dominated the age frequencies.  This bodes well for future angling opportunites for both species.  Bluegills over nine inches and crappies over 12 inches in length were also sampled. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of smallmouth bass and moderate numbers of largemouth bass were sampled in 2012.  Both populations showed a wide range of sizes but smallmouth bass were larger and older than largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nLakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging process in Island Lake by using best management practices on their land.  Properly operating septic systems, shoreline buffer zones of native vegetation, and protection of existing bulrush and cattail stands can all help. <br> \n</p>",
