The Middle Fork of the Crow River enters Nest along the north side and outlets intoGreen Lake near the east shore of Nest. Submergent vegetation (northern water milfoil,muskgrass, flatstem pondweed, claspingleaf pondweed, coontail) was dense throughout theshallow bays. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, water lilies, duckweed) was present inthe shallow bay areas and the west portion of the lake. Shoalwater substrates were mostlysand, rubble, gravel, silt, and muck. Algae blooms are common during the mid summer months.Water clarity was 4.0 feet on July 11, 1999. Recent fish stockings include walleye fry(290,430 fry 1999, 570,528 fry in 1998, 4,185,798 fry in 1997), walleye fingerlings (238 fishin 1997, 17,340 fish in 1996), black crappie adults (881 fish in 1998, 1,423 fish in 1997),and northern pike fingerlings from the Nest Lake Northern Pike Spawning Area \"NPSA\" (144 fishin 1999, 13,083 fish in 1998, 1,677 fish in 1999). Nest is a popular fishery for walleye,northern pike, panfish, largemouth and smallmouth bass.     Walleye were abundant (12.50 fish/gillnet) in 1999 compared to the normal range (3.25 -8.81 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and above the historical average (7.40 fish/gillnet).The walleye average size was small (11.30 inches, gillnets) compared to the historicalaverage (15.14 inches, gillnets and trapnets). Walleye growth rates were average compared toother local lakes. There were two prevalent walleye year classes (1998 year class comprised35% of the total catch, 1997 year class comprised 43% of the total catch) present in the 1999summer walleye catch. The 1998 and 1997 year classes were also abundant as young of year\"YOY\" walleye in previous fall electrofishing surveys (103.85 YOY/hour in 1998, 33.75YOY/hour in 1997). Young of year walleye numbers were low (18.00 YOY/hour, 7.20 inchesaverage size) in the 1999 fall electrofishing survey.     Northern pike were numbers were moderate to low (3.00 fish/gillnet) in 1999, and slightly below the historical average (4.31 fish/gillnet). The 1999 northern pike averagesize was large (26.04 inches, gillnets). The largest northern pike captured in the 1999survey was 36.10 inches. The two most prevalent northern pike year classes were 1997 (36% oftotal northern pike catch) and 1996 (32% of total northern pike catch).     Yellow perch numbers were low to moderate (11.75 fish/gillnet) in 1999 compared to thehistorical average (21.94 fish/gillnet). The 1999 yellow perch average size was small (6.18inches, gillnets).     Bluegill were moderately abundant (37.50 fish/trapnet) in 1999. The 1999 bluegillaverage size was small (4.79 inches, trapnets) and below the historical average (5.54inches), but this was due to the 1999 catch of large numbers of young fish (47% of catch from1997 year class). The largest bluegill captured was 8.27 inches in the 1999 survey. Bluegillgrowth rates were slightly above the normal ranges for similar lakes.     Black crappie numbers were low (0.75 fish/gillnet) in 1999 compared to the historicalaverage (7.69 fish/gillnet). The 1999 black crappie average size was small (6.15 inches,gillnets), however 44% of the black crappie were from the 1998 year class.     Moderate numbers of largemouth bass (33.26 fish/hour) and smallmouth bass (23.48fish/hour) were caught in the 1999 spring electrofishing survey. The largemouth andsmallmouth bass average sizes were 12.00 inches and 10.59 inches respectively in the 1999spring electrofishing survey.  The largest largemouth and smallmouth bass captured in the1999 spring electrofishing survey were 18.90 inches and 18.11 inches respectively.     Other fish species of interest occasionally caught in Nest Lake include channel catfishand muskellunge. The New London Fish Hatchery raise channel catfish and muskellungefingerlings each summer in the rearing ponds adjacent to the Middle Fork of the Crow Riverupstream of Nest Lake. Occasionally, these species have accidently escaped from the hatcheryinto the river during the hatching or rearing stages due to mechanical failures or overflowincidents.      Local residents have reported better fishing success in recent years for northern pike,walleye, and black crappie. Local anglers have also commented about the improved bluegillsize caught in the spring of 1999. Although there has been documented walleye naturalreproduction in Nest, the extent is unknown because of the occasional release of walleyefry/eggs from the DNR New London Fish Hatchery tanks each spring into the Middle Fork of theCrow River upstream of Nest. Walleye fingerling stocking will occur in Nest as needed basedupon the numbers and sizes of YOY walleye present in annual fall electrofishing surveys. TheDNR Spicer Fisheries Office will continue to monitor adult fish population numbers by summertest netting every four years and YOY walleye numbers every year by fall electrofishing inorder to evaluate the effectiveness of management practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Nest Lake during October 10, 2022. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Fall electrofishing was conducted at seven stations for a total of 130 minutes. The water temperature was 61 F. during the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. Submergent vegetation densities were generally abundant at the different stations in 2022. Water clarity was moderate. We observed abundant numbers of Bluegill, Yellow Bullhead and Brook Silversides in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. We also saw moderate numbers of Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population is due to a combination of natural reproduction and Walleye stockings (fry, fingerlings and adults) for Nest Lake based on surveys, oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marking and analysis. Nest Lake occasionally receives Walleye fry via scheduled stocking or from the Middle Fork of Crow River during clean-up operations of the Walleye hatching program at the New London State Fish Hatchery. Nest Lake was recently stocked with Walleye in 2012 (629,789 fry; 2,966 yearlings, 890 pounds; 4,799 fingerlings, 381 pounds), 2013 (542,744 fry; 24,750 fingerlings, 1,381 pounds; 182 adults, 66 pounds; 125 yearlings, 25 pounds), 2014 (530,653 fry; 2,885 yearlings, 145 pounds), 2015 (1,541,987 fry), 2017 (1,821 fry), 2018 (534,227 fry; 755 fingerlings, 40 pounds; 5,690 yearlings, 1,654 pounds; 68 adults, 165 pounds) and 2021 (635 pounds, 3,118 fingerlings). Walleye stocked into Nest were from the Pike River strain prior to 2014 and the local Spicer strain during 2014-2021. Walleye fry were marked with OTC in 2015. No Walleye were stocked into Nest during 2016, 2019 or 2020. Walleye fry were recently stocked in 2021 (635,492 fish), and a small amount of fry (38,131 fish) in 2022 due to hatchery clean out via the Middle Fork Crow River. <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers (13.85 YOY/hour, 7.3 inches) were captured in 2022. Yearling Walleye numbers were also low (0.92 fish/hour, 10.8 inches) in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (7.50 YOY/hour, 7.2 inches) were captured in the 2021 fall electrofishing survey. Yearling numbers were low (0.50 fish/hour, 10.8 inches), but two year old fish (2019 year class) were abundant (13.5 fish/hour, 12.4 inches). Walleye fingerlings were stocked after the 2021 fall electrofishing survey due to the low YOY numbers. An electrofishing survey was not conducted during 2020 in Nest. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (36.00 YOY/hour, 7.1 inches) due to natural reproduction were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. There were low YOY Walleye numbers captured (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) in 2018 (4.50 YOY/hour, 7.2 inches). Low YOY Walleye numbers (3.00 YOY/hour, 5.8 inches) were captured in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (40.50 YOY/hour, 7.3 inches) were captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. All of the YOY Walleye captured were from natural reproduction in 2016. Yearling walleye numbers were low in the 2016 (6.00 fish/hour, 9.9 inches), 2017 (3.00 fish/hour, 10.2 inches), 2018 (1.50 fish/hour, 11.7 inches) and 2019 (3.00 fish/hour, 10.6 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. Moderate YOY numbers were captured in the 2015 fall (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.4 inches), but spring stocked OTC marked fry accounted for 71% of the fall YOY Walleye captured. There were also abundant yearling Walleye numbers (24.00 fish/hour, 8.9 inches) captured in 2015. This corresponds to abundant YOY Walleye numbers (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) captured (52.50 YOY/hour, 5.7 inches) in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. There were low numbers of YOY Walleye captured in 2013 (20.00 YOY/hour, 6.6 inches). The YOY Walleye historical average catch rate is 26.96 YOY/hour for Nest Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (4.50 fish/gillnet) was low in the most recent 2018 summer standard survey. The 2018 Walleye average weight and length were 2.20 pounds and 18.1 inches from gillnets. The 2014 Walleye year class (fry stocked year) comprised 47% of the 2018 total Walleye catch. Local residents reported good Walleye fishing success in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nThe Nest Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2023 fall for YOY Walleye due to natural reproduction/fry stocking and the 2023 summer by standard survey gears for all fish species. Spicer strain Walleye fry are scheduled for stocking in Nest during 2023.  <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",

Nest Lake was recently stocked in 2012 (629,789 fry, 2,966 yearlings, 4,799 fingerlings), 2013 (542,744 fry, 24,750 fingerlings, 182 adults, 125 yearlings), 2014 (530,653 fry, 2,885 yearlings) and 2015 (1,541,987 fry). Walleye stocked into Nest were from the Pike River strain prior to 2014 and from the local Spicer strain during 2014-2015. Walleye fry were marked with oxytetracycline \"OTC\" in 2015. No walleye were stocked into Nest during 2016. <br> \n <br> \nModerate YOY Walleye numbers (40.5 YOY/hour, 7.3 inches) were captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. All of the YOY Walleye captured were from natural reproduction in 2016. Yearling walleye numbers were low (6.0 fish/hour, 9.9 inches) in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate YOY numbers were captured in the 2015 fall (42.0 YOY/hour, 6.4 inches), but spring stocked OTC marked fry accounted for 71% of the fall YOY Walleye captured. There were abundant yearling Walleye numbers (24.0 fish/hour, 8.9 inches) captured in 2015. This corresponds to abundant YOY Walleye numbers (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) captured (52.5 YOY/hour, 5.7 inches) in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. There were low numbers of YOY Walleye captured in 2013 (20.0 YOY/hour, 6.6 inches average length). The YOY Walleye historical average catch rate is 29.7 YOY/hour for Nest Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Nest Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2018 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on Nest Lake during August of 2023. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). A near shore fish survey was also conducted in mid-July. A fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Nest Lake during late September.  <br> \n <br> \nNest is a large, productive, and moderately deep lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 40 feet. Zebra Mussels were documented in Nest and connected George Lake during 2017. Public access sites include one state access along the east portion and one along the west portion of the lake. Development (192 homes, several resorts and recreational vehicle sites, one motel, and Sanderson Girl Scout Camp; 2008 survey) has occurred along the entire shoreline area except for the northwest portion of the lake. Late-summer dissolved oxygen levels were below 4.0 ppm at depths greater than 20.5 feet. Water clarity was moderate (secchi=7.67 feet) on August 15, 2023. Non-point nutrient input sources into Nest include residential homes, agricultural row crops, road runoff, and city of New London. There are approximately 20 inlets/tiles that enter Nest Lake. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles from various locations throughout the lake. The major inlet is the Middle Fork Crow River, which enters along the north shore of Nest Lake. The Middle Fork Crow Reservoir and New London Dam (replaced in 2010) are located about 4 miles upstream of Nest Lake. The New London State Fish Hatchery is located about 1 mile downstream the New London Dam. The Nest Lake outlet drains into Green Lake via the Old Mill Inn Dam. Water levels were below normal during the 2023 survey. Emergent vegetation (bulrush, burreeds, cattails, wild rice) is present in the southwest, west and north portions of the lake. White and yellow waterlilies occur frequently in the east bay areas. Submergent vegetation densities (i.e. northern milfoil, coontail, water moss, bladderwort, water celery, various pondweed species, and filamentous algae) are usually moderate to abundant within the lake. Curly-leaf pondweed can become a nuisance for boating and swimming during most years. Various free-floating duckweeds (star, lesser, water-meal) species are can also be abundant. Submergent vegetation was found down to 14 feet deep in Nest. Filamentous and blue-green algae blooms can occur during the late summer months due in part due to excess phosphorus released during the annual late summer die off of curly-leaf pondweed. Shoreline substrates are varied with boulder, gravel, sand, rubble, and silt. Boulder and rubble are found near the islands and south shore point areas. Soft substrates (silt, muck, and detritus) are most prevalent in the east bays and north inlet bay area. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was conducted on Nest in mid-May of 2021 as part of the ongoing statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  Twelve standard lake survey trapnets were set at historical stations to target Bluegill and Black Crappie. Special regulations for several area lakes (Nest, Long (Hawick, Minnesota), Diamond, George and Florida) currently entail reduced bag limits (i.e., 5 or 10 fish) for Sunfish or Crappie. The Nest Lake special regulation for Sunfish is a daily bag limit of 10 fish. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass numbers were abundant in 2023 (1.83 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes. The Smallmouth Bass historical average catch rate is 0.75 fish/gillnet for Nest Lake. The 2023 Smallmouth Bass average size was large (2.51 pounds and 16.37 inches) from gillnets. The Smallmouth Bass historical average weight is 1.81 pounds from gillnets. The 2023 catch rate of preferred size (14.0 inches and larger) Smallmouth Bass was high (1.33 fish/gillnet). The largest Smallmouth Bass captured was 18.5 inches. Smallmouth Bass growth rates were below average. Three-year classes (2020, 2017 and 2014) each comprised 25% of the 2023 total Smallmouth Bass catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2023 (0.17 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes. The Black Crappie gillnet historical average catch rate was 6.28 fish/gillnet. Black Crappie abundance in the 2021 mid-May targeted survey was low (2.67 fish/trapnet, 10.32 inches average length). The 2023 Black Crappie average sizes were good from gillnets (0.70 pounds, 10.75 inches) and trapnets (0.55 pounds, 9.23 inches). The 2023 catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches and larger) Black Crappie was low (0.17 fish/gillnet). Black Crappie growth rates were generally above average. The 2019 year class comprised 33% of the 2023 total Black Crappie catch.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were high in 2023 (8.83 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes and the historical average (5.20 fish/gillnet). The 2023 Northern Pike average size was small and (2.28 pounds and 21.41 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.91 pounds from gillnets. The 2023 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches and larger) was low (0.50 fish/gillnet). The largest Northern Pike captured was 31.6 inches in 2023. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Nest Lake in the North-central Zone are as follows: 10 (Not more than 2 over 26\". All from 22-26\" must be immediately released.) by angling; 10 (only 1 Northern Pike between 22-26\" and 1 over 26\"; or 2 over 26\") by dark house spearing.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2023 (1.33 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 14.64 fish/gillnet. The 2023 Yellow Perch average length (6.29 inches) from gillnets was slightly above the historical average (6.03 inches). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate in 2023 (3.33 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes, but below the historical average (6.58 fish/gillnet) for Nest Lake. The 2023 Walleye average size was moderate (1.75 pounds and 15.93 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.67 pounds from gillnets. The 2023 catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches and larger) Walleye (2.00 fish/gillnet) was below the Nest historical average (3.02 fish/gillnet). The 2023 catch rate of preferred size (20.0 inches and larger) Walleye (0.67 fish/gillnet) was also below the Nest historical average (1.01 fish/gillnet). The largest Walleye captured was 24.6 inches in 2023. Walleye growth rates were below average. The 2022 Walleye year class (fry stocked year) comprised 32% of the 2023 total Walleye catch. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population is due to a combination of natural reproduction and Walleye stocking (fry, fingerlings and adults) in Nest Lake. Nest Lake also occasionally receives low numbers of Walleye fry via the Middle Fork of the Crow River during clean-up operations of the Walleye hatching program at the New London State Fish Hatchery. There were low numbers of young of year \"YOY\" Walleye captured (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) in 2023 (5.50 YOY/hour, 7.10 inches average length). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers due to natural reproduction were captured in 2022 (13.85 YOY/hour, 7.27 inches average length). Nest Lake was recently stocked in 2018 (534,227 fry; 5,690 yearlings, 1,654 pounds; 755 fingerlings, 40 pounds; 68 adults, 165 pounds), 2021 (854,819 fry; 3,115 fingerlings, 635 pounds), 2022 (38,131 fry), 2023 (1,078,266 fry; 5,955 fingerlings, 502 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2023 (15.00 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes. The Bluegill historical catch rate is 39.10 fish/trapnet. Bluegill abundance in the 2021 mid-May targeted survey was moderate (25.42 fish/trapnet, 6.42 inches average length). The 2023 Bluegill average size was small (0.09 pounds and 4.71 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.15 pounds from trapnets. The 2023 catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches and larger) bluegill was low (2.08 fish/trapnet). The largest Bluegill captured was 8.5 inches in 2023. Bluegill growth rates were average for younger fish, but above average for ages 6-8. The 2021 year class comprised 66% of the 2023 total bluegill trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2023 (0.67 fish/gillnet). The 2023 Black Bullhead average size was large (1.09 pounds and 12.13 inches). Yellow Bullhead numbers were abundant in 2023 (14.67 fish/gillnet). The 2023 Yellow Bullhead average size was also large (0.60 pounds and 10.15 inches). <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of special interest captured in 2023 included low numbers of White Sucker (1.17 fish/gillnet) and Largemouth Bass (0.67 fish/gillnet). Moderate numbers of Largemouth Bass have been captured in Nest during previous spring pre-spawn spring electrofishing surveys. A spring electrofishing was not conducted for Largemouth Bass in 2023. Rock Bass were also sampled in low numbers in 2023 (0.17 fish/gillnet). <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Muskellunge have not been captured in DNR summer surveys, local anglers have reported catching or seeing large Muskellunge below the New London Dam, in Nest Lake and Green Lake. A Muskellunge yearling (1.50 fish/hour, 19.0 inches) was captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Muskellunge fingerling culture has occurred in shallow ponds at the New London State Fish Hatchery since the 1980's, which drains into the Middle Fork of the Crow River upstream of Nest Lake. Muskellunge fingerlings had escaped into the Middle Fork of Crow River upstream of Nest on two occasions approximately 20 years ago from the New London Hatchery Ponds due to a pond structure failure one year and criminal damage to outlet screens another year.  <br> \n <br> \nA Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity \"FIBI\" assessment was performed on Nest Lake in July 2023. FIBI surveys are comprised of shoreline seining and backpack electrofishing to sampling fish in the near shore habitat around the lake. Twenty-two fish species were captured in the near shore sampling gears. The nearshore data were combined with trapnet and gillnet data from a standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. Nest Lake's 2023 IBI score was 52, which was higher than the impairment threshold of 45 for tool 2 lakes. Moderate species numbers of intolerant habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Logperch, Pugnose Shiner, Smallmouth Bass and Iowa Darter) were captured in Nest Lake. Tolerant fish species captured included Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Nest Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. A fall electrofishing survey for YOY Walleye is scheduled for 2024. A standard survey of all fish species is scheduled during the 2026 summer for Nest Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Nest Lake during October 1, 2021. Fall electrofishing was conducted at six stations for a total of 120 minutes. The water temperature was 68 F. during the 2021 fall electrofishing survey. Submergent vegetation densities were generally light at the different stations in 2021. Water clarity was moderate. We observed abundant numbers of Bluegill, Shiner species and Yellow Perch in the 2021 fall electrofishing survey. We also saw moderate numbers of Brook Silversides, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Yellow Bullhead and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population is due to a combination of natural reproduction and Walleye stockings (fry, fingerlings and adults) for Nest Lake based on surveys, oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marking and the WAESTOCK Program analysis. Nest Lake occasionally receives Walleye fry via scheduled stocking or from the Middle Fork of Crow River during clean-up operations of the Walleye hatching program at the New London State Fish Hatchery. Nest Lake was recently stocked with Walleye in 2012 (629,789 fry; 2,966 yearlings, 890 pounds; 4,799 fingerlings, 381 pounds), 2013 (542,744 fry; 24,750 fingerlings, 1,381 pounds; 182 adults, 66 pounds; 125 yearlings, 25 pounds), 2014 (530,653 fry; 2,885 yearlings, 145 pounds), 2015 (1,541,987 fry), 2017 (1,821 fry), 2018 (534,227 fry; 755 fingerlings, 40 pounds; 5,690 yearlings, 1,654 pounds; 68 adults, 165 pounds) and 2021 (635 pounds, 3,118 fingerlings). Walleye stocked into Nest were from the Pike River strain prior to 2014 and the local Spicer strain during 2014-2021. Walleye fry were marked with OTC in 2015. No Walleye were stocked into Nest during 2016, 2019 or 2020. Walleye fry were stocked in 2021 (635,492 fish). <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers (7.50 YOY/hour, 7.15 inches) were captured in the 2021 fall electrofishing survey. Yearling numbers were low (0.50 fish/hour, 10.75 inches), but two year old fish (2019 year class) were abundant (13.5 fish/hour, 12.40 inches). Walleye fingerlings were stocked after the 2021 fall electrofishing survey due to the low YOY numbers. An electrofishing survey was not conducted during 2020 in Nest. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (36.00 YOY/hour, 7.10 inches) due to natural reproduction were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. There were low YOY Walleye numbers captured (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) in 2018 (4.50 YOY/hour, 7.17 inches). Low YOY Walleye numbers (3.00 YOY/hour, 5.79 inches) were captured in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (40.50 YOY/hour, 7.33 inches) were captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. All of the YOY Walleye captured were from natural reproduction in 2016. Yearling walleye numbers were low in the 2016 (6.00 fish/hour, 9.93 inches), 2017 (3.00 fish/hour, 10.24 inches), 2018 (1.50 fish/hour, 11.65 inches) and 2019 (3.00 fish/hour, 10.55 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. Moderate YOY numbers were captured in the 2015 fall (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.38 inches), but spring stocked OTC marked fry accounted for 71% of the fall YOY Walleye captured. There were also abundant yearling Walleye numbers (24.00 fish/hour, 8.87 inches) captured in 2015. This corresponds to abundant YOY Walleye numbers (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) captured (52.50 YOY/hour, 5.71 inches) in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. There were low numbers of YOY Walleye captured in 2013 (20.00 YOY/hour, 6.60 inches). The YOY Walleye historical average catch rate is 26.96 YOY/hour for Nest Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (4.50 fish/gillnet) was low in the most recent 2018 summer standard survey. The 2018 Walleye average weight and length were 2.20 pounds and 18.10 inches from gillnets. The 2014 Walleye year class (fry stocked year) comprised 47% of the 2018 total Walleye catch. Local residents have reported good Walleye fishing success in 2021. <br> \n <br> \nThe Nest Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2022 fall for YOY Walleye due to natural reproduction and the 2023 summer by standard survey gears for all fish species. Spicer strain Walleye fry are scheduled for stocking in Nest during 2023.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nest is a moderate sized (945 acres) lake with a maximum depth of 40 feet and 5.5 milesof shoreline. Water clarity is fair/poor. Algae blooms are quite common. There have beenreports of summerkills in small portions of the lake. Nest is a nutrient rich lake within alarge watershed area. The immediate watershed is a combination of mixed hardwoods on gentleto steep slopes (sandy/loam soils), agricultural row crops and pastures, and wetlands. TheMiddle Fork of the Crow River (MFCR) flows into Mud Lake/Middle Fork of the Crow RiverReservoir, the north portion of Nest, Green Lake (34-079), Calhoun (34062), and finally intothe North Fork of the Crow River. There are also four small inlets that flow into Nest. TheMiddle Fork of the Crow River contributes most of the nutrients and sediments entering intoNest. In the past, the New London sewer plant (no longer in operation), Green Lake sanitarysewage district, Belgrade sewage treatment plant, and agricultural runoff have been locallyblamed for contributing excessive nutrient/sediment inputs into Nest via the Middle Fork ofthe Crow River. Another potential source of significant nutrient runoff is from a golf coursewhich has drainage into the river upstream of Nest. The Middle Fork of the Crow River outletis located on the east side of the lake. A stoplog dam at the Ye Olde Mill Inn (CSAH #30)separates Nest and Green. Submergent vegetation species (curled pondweed, coontail, northernwatermilfoil) are abundant in water depths less than 6 feet throughout most of the shoreline.The most densely vegetated areas include the northeast, east, and north (MFCR inlet area)portions of the lake. Curled pondweed often becomes a nuisance problem within the lake. Amechanical weed harvester has been operated by the Nest Lake Association since the mid1980's. Emergent vegetation includes hardstem bulrush, common cattail, wild rice, yellow andwhite waterlilys. There are small bulrush stands located along the northwest portion,southwest bay and northeast shoreline. The shoalwaters substrates are mostly sand, muck,silt, and gravel. The lake is highly developed on the southern and northern shores withhomes, resorts, and trailer parks. The west and northwest shorelines are mostly marshlandsand agriculture. Nest is a popular fishing lake for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth andlargemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. The bluegill and black crappie average sizeshave generally become smaller during the last 10-15 years according to local anglers. Blackcrappie numbers have also declined during the past several years. Present fish managementactivities include the operation of a northern pike spawning area (south side), walleyefingerling/fry stocking, issuance of B-permits for carp removal, and fish population surveys.Other past activities that no longer take place include the operation of a seasonal fish trap(MFCR inlet) for carp removal and walleye spawn take (1970-85, 1990-92).     Walleye abundance in 1994 (4.0 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.3 - 8.8fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (7.0 fish/gillnet). The1994 average size (1.7 lbs from gillnets) was above the historical average (1.5 lbs fromgillnets). The largest walleye caught was 28.1 inches. Growth rates appear average comparedto other local lakes. Walleye fingerlings are scheduled to be stocked every even year.Natural reproduction does occur within Nest Lake and the Middle Fork Crow River Inlet (priorspawning runs), but it is difficult to determine the extent due to incidental fry stocking(annual spring flushing of hatching tanks at New London Hatchery into Middle Fork of the CrowRiver). Walleye angling has been generally good the last five years.     Northern pike abundance in 1994 (1.6 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (2.8 - 9.0fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (4.3 fish/gillnet). The 1994average size (23.6 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was above the historicalaverage (21.7 inches). The largest northern pike caught was 30.9 inches. Growth rates appearaverage compared to local lakes.     Bluegill abundance in 1994 (59.3 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (4.4 - 49.0fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (49.1 fish/trapnet). The1994 average size (5.4 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was slightly below thehistorical average (5.8 inches). The largest bluegill caught was 8.0 inches. Catch rates oflarge bluegill (> 8.0 inches) have been poor (< 1) since the 1983 survey. Growth rates appearbelow average compared to other local lakes.     Black crappie abundance in 1994 (0.7 fish/set) was within the normal range (0.4 - 2.3fish/trapnet), but below the historical average (3.3 fish/trapnet). The 1994 average size(4.2 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was below the historical average (6.9inches).     Largemouth bass young of year catch rates appear good (31.5 fish/0.25 inch trapnet, 5.0fish/seine haul). The average young of year size was 2.8 inches. Spring electrofishingsurveys were not conducted in 1994. Spring electrofishing catch rates in 1990 were low-moderate (10.4 fish/hour, average size=1.0 lb.).     Smallmouth bass abundance in 1994 (0.8 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (0.1 - 0.9 fish/gillnet), but above the historical average (0.2 fish/gillnet). The 1994 averagesize (2.0 lbs from gillnets) was above the historical average (1.7 lbs). The east side of thelake near the railroad bridge (river channel) and area adjacent to the two islands are goodspots for potentially catching memorable size smallmouth bass (> 17.0 inches).     Yellow perch abundance in 1994 (22.0 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (7.0 -46.3 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27 and similar to the historical average (21.5fish/gillnet). The 1994 average size (5.9 inches gillnets and trapnets combined) was slightlybelow the historical average (6.2 inches). Growth rates appear average.     Carp abundance in 1994 (1.1 fish/gillnet) was slightly above the normal range (0.2 - 1.0fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (0.5 fish/gillnet). The 1994average size (16.0 lbs from gillnets) was slightly above the historical average (14.1 lbs).     Bowfin \"dogfish\" abundance in 1994 (0.9 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range forsimilar lakes, but slightly above the historical average (0.6 fish/trapnet). The 1994 averagesize (4.4 lbs) was above the historical average (3.6 lbs).     Black bullhead abundance in 1994 (0.3 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (0.6 -6.8 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (2.3 fish/gillnet). Theblack bullhead average size in 1994 was 11.2 inches (gillnets and trapnets combined). Theyellow bullhead abundance in 1994 (0.8 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (1.2 - 5.2fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (6.4 fish/trapnet). Theyellow bullhead average size in 1994 was 10.7 inches (gillnets and trapnets combined).     Improving water quality should be the major management priority for Nest Lake. Acomprehensive plan is needed for reducing nutrient and sediment runoff within the watershedarea which would includes both upstream (Middle Fork of the Crow River, Mud Reservoir) anddownstream waters (Green, Calhoun). We need to encourage area landowners and businesses topractice best land management practices such as conservation tillage farming techniques(mulch till, minimum till, no till, ridge till, etc.), planting buffer strips alongditches/inlets, proper feedlot management, proper lawn care management (using low/nophosphorus fertilizer), reducing fertilizers runoff from the Little Crow Golf Course into theriver by encouraging them to use low/no phosphorous fertilizers with moderate nitrogenlevels. Alleviating the nuisance densities of submergent vegetation (curled pondweed) mayresult from reducing incoming available nitrogen levels in addition to selective harvestingof curled pondweed prior to bud formation in the spring (experimental technique beingevaluated). Positive results of water quality are likely to take years even with a reductionof nutrient inputs within the watershed. Specific fishery management options include thecontinued operation of the northern pike spawning area, stocking walleye fingerlings asneeded, periodic assessment of fish populations through lake and creel surveys, protectionand expansion of important fish habitat (hardstem bulrush), and attempting differenttechniques (habitat manipulation, protection of certain predators, implementing harvest/sizeregulations, etc.) at improving the size structure of panfish (bluegill and black crappie)populations. </p>",

A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).   <br> \n <br> \nNest is a large, productive, and moderately deep lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 40 feet. Zebra Mussels were documented in Nest and connected George Lake during 2017. Public access sites include one state access along the east portion and one along the west portion of the lake. Development (192 homes, several resorts and recreational vehicle sites, one motel, and Sanderson Girl Scout Camp; 2008 survey) has occurred along the entire shoreline area with the exception of the northwest portion of the lake. Late-summer dissolved oxygen levels were below 3.0 ppm at depths greater than 18.0 feet. Water clarity was poor (secchi=5.5 feet) on July 23, 2018. Non-point nutrient input sources into Nest include residential homes, agricultural row crops, road runoff, and city of New London. There are approximately 20 inlets/tiles that enter Nest Lake. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles from various locations throughout the lake. The major inlet is the Middle Fork Crow River, which enters along the north shore of Nest Lake. The Middle Fork Crow Reservoir and New London Dam (replaced in 2010) are located about 4 miles upstream of Nest Lake. The New London State Fish Hatchery is located about 1 mile downstream the New London Dam. The Nest Lake outlet drains into Green Lake via the Old Mill Inn Dam. Water levels were slightly above normal during the 2018 survey. Emergent vegetation (bulrush, burreeds, cattails, wild rice) is present in the southwest, west and north portions of the lake. White and yellow waterlilies occur frequently in the east bay areas. Submergent vegetation densities (i.e. northern milfoil, coontail, water moss, bladderwort, water celery, various pondweed species, and filamentous algae) are usually moderate to abundant within the lake. Curly-leaf pondweed can become a nuisance for boating and swimming during most years. Various free-floating duckweeds (star, lesser, water-meal) species are can also be abundant. Submergent vegetation was found down to 14 feet deep in Nest. Filamentous and blue-green algae blooms can occur during the late summer months due in part due to excess phosphorus released during the annual late summer die off of curly-leaf pondweed. Shoreline substrates are varied with boulder, gravel, sand, rubble, and silt. Boulder and rubble are found near the islands and south shore point areas. Soft substrates (silt, muck, and detritus) are most prevalent in the east bays and north inlet bay area. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass numbers were abundant in 2018 (3.25 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes. The Smallmouth Bass historical average catch rate is 0.67 fish/gillnet for Nest Lake. The 2018 Smallmouth Bass average size was large (1.36 pounds and 13.1 inches) from gillnets. The Smallmouth Bass historical average weight is 1.74 pounds from gillnets. The 2018 catch rate of preferred size (14.0 inches and larger) Smallmouth Bass was high (1.25 fish/gillnet). Smallmouth Bass growth rates were above average. The 2016 year class comprised 62% of the 2018 total Smallmouth Bass catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were moderate in 2018 (5.75 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes. The Black Crappie gillnet historical average catch rate was 6.75 fish/gillnet. The 2018 Black Crappie average sizes were small from gillnets (0.20 pounds, 7.1 inches) and trapnets (0.16 pounds, 6.7 inches). The 2018 catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches and larger) Black Crappie was low (0.25 fish/gillnet). Black Crappie growth rates slightly above average. The 2016 year class comprised 91% of the 2018 total Black Crappie catch.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were moderate in 2018 (4.50 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes and the historical average (4.92 fish/gillnet). The 2018 Northern Pike average size was moderate (2.98 pounds and 23.9 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.82 pounds from gillnets. The 2018 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches and larger) was low (0.50 fish/gillnet). Northern Pike growth rates were below average. Approximately 56% of the Northern Pike captured in the 2018 summer nets were from the 2014 year class. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Nest Lake in the North-central Zone are as follows: 10 (Not more than 2 over 26\". All from 22-26\" must be immediately released.) by angling; 10 (only 1 Northern Pike between 22-26\" and 1 over 26\"; or 2 over 26\") by dark house spearing. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2018 (0.50 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 15.66 fish/gillnet. The 2018 Yellow Perch average length (6.8 inches) from gillnets was above the historical average (6.0 inches). Yellow Perch growth rates were average. The 2016 year class comprised 83% of the 2018 total Yellow Perch catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate in 2018 (4.50 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes, but below the historical average (6.82 fish/gillnet) for Nest Lake. The 2018 Walleye average size was large (2.20 pounds and 18.1 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.66 pounds from gillnets. The 2018 catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches and larger) Walleye (4.00 fish/gillnet) was similar to the Nest historical average (3.15 fish/gillnet). The 2018 catch rate of preferred size (20.0 inches and larger) Walleye (1.25 fish/gillnet) was also near the Nest historical average (1.05 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were average. The 2014 Walleye year class (fry stocked year) comprised 47% of the 2018 total Walleye catch. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population is due to a combination of natural reproduction and Walleye stocking (fry, fingerlings and adults) in Nest Lake. Nest Lake also occasionally receives low numbers of Walleye fry via the Middle Fork of the Crow River during clean-up operations of the Walleye hatching program at the New London State Fish Hatchery. There were low numbers of young of year \"YOY\" Walleye captured (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) in 2018 (4.50 YOY/hour, 7.2 inches average length). Low YOY Walleye numbers were also captured in 2017 (3.00 YOY/hour, 5.8 inches). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers due to natural reproduction were captured in 2016 (40.50 YOY/hour, 7.3 inches). Stocked OTC marked Walleye fry comprised 71% (30.0 YOY/hour) of the 2015 fall electrofishing fingerling catch (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.4 inches). Moderate YOY numbers (52.50 YOY/hour, 5.7 inches) were documented in a 2014 fry stocked year. Nest Lake was recently stocked in 2012 (629,789 fry; 2,966 yearlings, 890 pounds; 4,799 fingerlings, 381 pounds), 2013 (542,744 fry; 24,750 fingerlings, 1,381 pounds; 182 adults, 66 pounds; 125 yearlings, 25 pounds), 2014 (530,653 fry; 2,885 yearlings, 145 pounds), 2015 (1,541,987 OTC marked fry), 2016 (1,972 fry), 2017 (1,821 fry) and 2018 (534,227 fry; 755 fingerlings, 40 pounds; 5,690 yearlings, 1,654 pounds; 68 adults, 165 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2018 (26.00 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes. The bluegill historical catch rate is 33.62 fish/trapnet. There were moderate numbers of large Bluegill (5.75 fish/gillnet, 6.6 inches) captured in the 2018 gillnets. The 2018 bluegill average size was small (0.13 pounds and 5.1 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.16 pounds from trapnets. The 2018 catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches and larger) bluegill was moderate (6.45 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates average for younger fish, but above average for ages 6-8. The 2016 and 2014 year classes comprised 36% and 16% respectively of the 2018 total bluegill catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2018 (0.50 fish/gillnet). The 2018 Black Bullhead average size was large (1.43 pounds and 13.5 inches). Yellow Bullhead numbers were abundant in 2018 (21.75 fish/gillnet). The 2018 Yellow Bullhead average size was also large (0.97 pounds and 11.8 inches). <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of special interest captured in 2018 included moderate numbers of White Sucker (2.00 fish/gillnet) and low numbers of Largemouth Bass (0.09 fish/trapnet). Moderate numbers of Largemouth Bass have been captured in Nest during previous spring pre-spawn spring electrofishing surveys. A spring electrofishing was not conducted for Largemouth Bass in 2018.  <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Muskellunge have not been captured in DNR summer surveys, local anglers have reported catching or seeing large Muskellunge below the New London Dam, in Nest Lake and Green Lake. A Muskellunge yearling (1.50 fish/hour, 19.0 inches) was captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Muskellunge fingerling culture has occurred in shallow ponds at the New London State Fish Hatchery since the 1980's, which drains into the Middle Fork of the Crow River upstream of Nest Lake. Muskellunge fingerlings had escaped into the Middle Fork of Crow River upstream of Nest on two occasions approximately 20 years ago from the New London Hatchery Ponds due to a pond structure failure one year and criminal damage to outlet screens another year.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Nest Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. A fall electrofishing survey for YOY Walleye is scheduled for 2019. A standard survey of all fish species is scheduled during the 2023 summer for Nest Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey of young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye was conducted on Nest Lake during September 19, 2019. Nest is a large (1,008 acres), moderately deep (40 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake with abundant submergent vegetation located in Kandiyohi County. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population is due to a combination of natural reproduction and Walleye stockings (fry, fingerlings and adults) for Nest Lake based on surveys and oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marking analysis. Nest Lake occasionally receives Walleye fry via scheduled stocking or from the Middle Fork of Crow River during clean-up operations of the Walleye hatching program at the New London State Fish Hatchery. Nest Lake was recently stocked with Walleye in 2012 (629,789 fry; 2,966 yearlings, 890 pounds; 4,799 fingerlings, 381 pounds), 2013 (542,744 fry; 24,750 fingerlings, 1,381 pounds; 182 adults, 66 pounds; 125 yearlings, 25 pounds), 2014 (530,653 fry; 2,885 yearlings, 145 pounds), 2015 (1,541,987 fry), 2017 (1,821 fry) and 2018 (534,227 fry; 755 fingerlings, 40 pounds; 5,690 yearlings, 1,654 pounds; 68 adults, 165 pounds). Walleye stocked into Nest were from the Pike River strain prior to 2014 and from the local Spicer strain during 2014-2018. Walleye fry were marked with OTC in 2015. No Walleye were stocked into Nest during 2016 or 2019. <br> \n <br> \nModerate YOY Walleye numbers (36.00 YOY/hour, 7.10 inches) due to natural reproduction were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. There were low YOY Walleye numbers captured (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) in 2018 (4.50 YOY/hour, 7.17 inches). Low YOY Walleye numbers (3.00 YOY/hour, 5.79 inches) were captured in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (40.50 YOY/hour, 7.33 inches) were captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. All of the YOY Walleye captured were from natural reproduction in 2016. Yearling walleye numbers were low in the 2016 (6.00 fish/hour, 9.93 inches), 2017 (3.00 fish/hour, 10.24 inches), 2018 (1.50 fish/hour, 11.65 inches) and 2019 (3.00 fish/hour, 10.55 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. Moderate YOY numbers were captured in the 2015 fall (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.38 inches), but spring stocked OTC marked fry accounted for 71% of the fall YOY Walleye captured. There were also abundant yearling Walleye numbers (24.00 fish/hour, 8.87 inches) captured in 2015. This corresponds to abundant YOY Walleye numbers (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) captured (52.50 YOY/hour, 5.71 inches) in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. There were low numbers of YOY Walleye captured in 2013 (20.00 YOY/hour, 6.60 inches). The YOY Walleye historical average catch rate is 27.77 YOY/hour for Nest Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2018 summer standard survey (4.50 fish/gillnet) low compared to the Nest Lake historical average (6.82 fish/gillnet). The 2018 Walleye average weight and length were 2.20 pounds and 18.10 inches from gillnets. The 2014 Walleye year class (fry stocked year) comprised 47% of the 2018 total Walleye catch. <br> \n <br> \nThe Nest Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2023 summer for all fish species. Spicer strain Walleye fry are scheduled for stocking in Nest during 2021. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nest Lake is a moderate size (945 acres) with a maximum depth of 40 feet and 5.5 milesof shoreline. About 56% of the surface area is 15 feet or less in depth. The water clarityreading (secchi disc) was 8.5 feet on 7-1-96. Algae blooms are quite common. Summer dissolvedoxygen readings are generally < 5 ppm below 20 feet and often times it becomes anoxic belowthe thermocline. There have been past reports of summerkills in small areas of the lake. Nestis a eutrophic lake within a large watershed area. The immediate watershed is a combinationof mixed hardwoods on gentle to steep slopes (sandy/loam soils), agricultural row crops,pastures, and wetlands. The Middle Fork of the Crow River (MFCR) flows into Mud Lake/MiddleFork of the Crow River Reservoir, the north portion of Nest, Green Lake (34-0079), Calhoun(34-0062), and finally into the North Fork of the Crow River. There are also four smallinlets that flow into Nest. The Middle Fork of the Crow River contributes the majority ofnutrient and sediment inputs into Nest. In the past, the New London sewer treatment plant (nolonger in operation), Green Lake sanitary sewage district, Belgrade sewage treatment plant,and agricultural runoff have been locally blamed for contributing excessive nutrient/sedimentinputs into Nest via the Middle Fork of the Crow River. Other potential sources of nutrientrunoff are from a golf course which has drainage into the river upstream of Nest, and failingseptic systems of residential homes on the lake. The Middle Fork of the Crow River outlet islocated on the east side of the lake. A stoplog dam at the Ye Olde Mill Inn (CSAH #30)separates Nest and Green. Submergent vegetation species (coontail, flatstem pondweed, sagopondweed, claspingleaf pondweed, water moss, northern watermilfoil) are frequently occurringin water depths less than 6 feet throughout most of the shoreline. The most densely vegetatedareas include the northeast, east, and north (MFCR inlet area) portions of the lake. In thepast, curled pondweed was a nuisance problem within the lake. A mechanical weed harvester hasbeen operated by the Nest Lake Association since the mid 1980's. Emergent vegetation includeshardstem bulrush, reed canary grass, common cattail, wild rice, yellow and white waterlilies.There are small bulrush stands located along the northwest portion, Middle Fork Crow RiverInlet bay area, and southwest bay. The shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, detritus, muck,silt, and gravel. The lake is highly developed on the southern and northern shores withhomes, resorts, and trailer parks. The west and northwest shorelines are mostly marshlandsand agricultural row/crops/pasture areas. Nest is a popular fishing lake for walleye,northern pike, smallmouth and largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. The bluegill andblack crappie average sizes have generally become smaller during the last 10-15 yearsaccording to local anglers. Black crappie numbers have also declined during the past severalyears. Present fish management activities include the operation of the Nest Northern PikeSpawning Area \"NPSA\" (south side), walleye fingerling/fry stocking, black crappie stocking,issuance of B-permits for carp removal, and fish population surveys. Other past activitiesthat no longer take place include the operation of a seasonal fish trap (MFCR inlet) for carpremoval and walleye spawn take (1970-85, 1990-92).     Walleye abundance in 1996 (5.5 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (3.3 - 8.8 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, but slightly below thehistorical average (6.8 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (1.4 lbs from gillnets) wassimilar to the historical average (1.5 lbs from gillnets). The largest walleye caught was24.3 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 67.6 and 32.4. The historical average PSD and RSD-Pwas 64.3 and 25.0 respectively. Growth rates appear average good for ages I-V compared toother local lakes. About 38% of the fish captured in the summer survey belonged to the 1995year class. Walleye fingerlings are scheduled to be stocked every even year. Walleye fry werestocked only during years in which walleye spawn were taken at the MFCR inlet. Naturalreproduction does occur within Nest Lake and the Middle Fork Crow River Inlet (prior spawningruns), but it is difficult to determine the extent due to spring flushing of excess walleyefry from the New London Hatchery tanks into Middle Fork of the Crow River. The poor qualityand small quantity of fry flushed into the river each spring probably has an insignificantaffect on corresponding young of year numbers compared to natural reproduction within Nestand the Crow River. The young of year \"YOY\" walleye catch rate in the 1996 fallelectrofishing survey (34.5 fish/hour) was within the overall median 1st and 3rdinterquartile range (10.9 - 55.6 YOY/hour) for area lakes with potential natural reproduction(Table 1.). The 1996 fall YOY walleye average size (5.5 inches) was below the overall average(6.8 inches) for lakes with natural reproduction (Table 2.). The YOY walleye were inexcellent condition even though their average length was small due to apparent heavy feedingon abundant small YOY yellow perch during the fall electrofishing survey period. The spring1996 yearling (1995 year class) electrofishing catch rate was 39.1 fish/hour. The spring 1996yearling average size was 8.5 inches. The walleye yearling abundance in the fall of 1996decreased to 12.0 fish/hour (Table 3.) compared to the spring electrofishing survey. However,the 1996 fall yearling catch rate was similar to the overall average (13.8 fish/hour) forarea lakes. The 1996 fall yearling average size (10.9 inches) was similar to the overallaverage (10.6 inches) for all area lakes (Table 4.). Walleye angling success between 1994-1996 was fair to poor.     Northern pike abundance in 1996 (5.5 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (2.8 - 9.0 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, but slightly above thehistorical average (4.5 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (2.7 lbs from gillnets) wassimilar to the historical average (2.6 lbs). The largest northern pike caught was 32.4inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 61.2 and 6.1 respectively. The historical average PSD andRSD-P was 61.7 and 6.9 respectively. Growth rates appear average compared to local lakes.About 35% of the northern pike captured belonged to the 1993 year class. The YOY northernpike abundance was 7.5 fish/hour (Table 5.) with an average size of 11.6 inches (Table 6.)during the 1996 fall electrofishing survey. The Nest Lake NPSA produced 1,128 northern pikefingerlings in 1996 from a natural run of adult fish into the spawning area (Figure 1.).Anglers had good success fishing for adult northern pike during the early summer of 1996.     Bluegill abundance in 1996 (49.3 fish/trapnet) was above the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (4.4 - 49.0 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 27, but similar to thehistorical average (49.1 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (4.5 inches from gillnets andtrapnets combined) was below the historical average (5.6 inches). The largest bluegill caughtwas 7.5 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 5.5 and 0 respectively. The historical average PSDand RSD-P was 41.0 and 2.9 respectively. Preferred size (> 8.0 inches) bluegill catch rates(fish/net) have been poor (< 1) since the 1983 survey. The highest catch rates for preferredbluegill (>8.0 inches) occurred in 1979 (9.4 fish/net, average size=6.2 inches) and 1954 (1.8fish/net, average size=6.8 inches). Growth rates appear below average compared to other locallakes. Only 5% of the bluegill captured were Age V or older. There was only 1 YOY bluegillcaught during the 1996 August seining survey.     Black crappie abundance in 1996 (1.3 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.4 - 2.7 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, but below the historicalaverage (8.6 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (6.1 inches from gillnets and trapnetscombined) was slightly below the historical average (6.8 inches). The largest black crappiecaught in 1996 was 12.6 inches. Black crappie growth rates appear average compared to otherlocal lakes. About 85% of the black crappie captured belonged to the 1995 year class.Prespawn adult black crappie were stocked into Nest during late May/early June of 1995 (1,721fish) and 1996 (1,193 fish) to boost natural reproduction. There were no YOY black crappiescaught during the August 1995 or 1996 seine hauls. However, there appears to be some naturalreproduction of black crappie occurring with the capture of 1995 year class fish in the 1996summer survey.     The YOY largemouth bass catch rate appears good (10.4 fish/seine haul). The averageyoung of year size was 2.7 inches. Adult largemouth bass abundance was low in the 1996 springelectrofishing survey (15.7 fish/hour, average size=1.1 lbs) compared to previous surveys in1990 (41.5 fish/hour, average size=1.0 lbs) and 1992 (37.7 fish/hour, average size=0.9 lbs).Largemouth bass average sizes have remained relatively consistent during the last threesurveys. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 37.5 for both. Growth rates appear average compared toother local lakes. About 43% of the fish captured during the spring survey belonged to the1994 year class.     Smallmouth bass abundance in 1996 (0.6 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.1 - 0.9 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, but above the historicalaverage (0.3 fish/gillnet). The 1996 spring electrofishing catch rate was low (1.6 fish/hour,average size=0.4 lbs). The 1996 average size (1.1 lbs from gillnets) from the summer surveywas slightly below the historical average (1.5 lbs). Fish captured from the summer survey hadaverage growth rates. YOY smallmouth bass abundance was good in 1996 (3.6 fish/seine haul).The east side of the lake near the railroad bridge (river channel) and area adjacent to thetwo islands are good spots for potentially catching memorable size smallmouth bass (> 17.0inches).     Yellow perch abundance in 1996 (34.9 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (7.0 - 46.3 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, but above the historicalaverage (23.2 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (5.6 inches gillnets and trapnetscombined) was slightly below the historical average (6.1 inches). The largest yellow perchcaptured in the 1996 survey was 8.1 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (0.3 and 0) was similarto the historical PSD and RSD-P (1.2 and 0). Growth rates appear average compared to otherlocal lakes. About 82% of the fish captured belonged to the 1994 year class.      Carp abundance in 1996 (0.1 fish/gillnet) was slightly below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.2 - 1.0 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27 and below the historicalaverage (0.5 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (10.6 lbs from gillnets) was slightly abovethe historical average (13.5 lbs).     Bowfin \"dogfish\" abundance in 1994 (0.2 fish/trapnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.3 - 1.1 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 27, and below the historicalaverage (0.6 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (5.3 lbs) was above the historical average(3.8 lbs).     Black bullhead abundance in 1996 (0.1 fish/gillnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.6 - 6.8 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27 and below the historicalaverage (2.0 fish/gillnet). The black bullhead average size in 1996 was 9.5 inches (gillnetsand trapnets combined). The yellow bullhead abundance in 1996 (1.8 fish/trapnet) was withinthe 1st and 3rd median interquartile range (1.2 - 5.2 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 27 andbelow the historical average (5.9 fish/trapnet). The yellow bullhead average size in 1996 was10.2 inches (gillnets and trapnets combined). Brown bullhead abundance in 1996 (0.4fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rd median interquartile range (0.3 - 1.6 fish/trapnet)for Lake Class 27, and similar to the historical average (0.3 fish/trapnet). The 1996 brownbullhead average size was the same as the historical average (11.9 inches for gillnets andtrapnets combined).     Improving water quality is one of the major management priorities for Nest Lake. Acomprehensive plan is needed for reducing nutrient and sediment runoff within the watershedarea which would includes both upstream (Middle Fork of the Crow River, Mud Reservoir) anddownstream waters (Green, Calhoun). We need to encourage area landowners and businesses topractice best land management practices such as conservation tillage farming techniques,planting buffer strips along ditches/inlets, proper feedlot management, proper lawn caremanagement (using low/no phosphorus fertilizer, reducing fertilizer runoff) for residentialhomes and the golf course. In order to alleviate the nuisance densities of submergentvegetation (curled pondweed), phosphorus and seasonal nitrogen (early summer) inputs need tobe reduced into Nest. In addition, selective harvesting of curled pondweed prior to budformation in the spring (experimental technique) should be evaluated as a possible controlmeasure for curled pondweed. Specific fishery management priorities include the continuedoperation of the northern pike spawning area, maintaining adequate walleye numbers throughstocking fingerlings as needed, periodic assessment of fish populations through lake andcreel surveys, protection and expansion of important fish habitat (hardstem bulrush), andattempting different techniques (habitat manipulation, protection of certain predators,implementing harvest/size regulations, etc.) at improving the size structure of panfish(bluegill and black crappie) populations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish resurvey of Nest Lake was conducted in July of 2003. Nest is a moderate sized (945 acres) and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 40 feet. Residential development has occurred throughout the entire shoreline area with the exception of the northwest portion of the lake. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles from various locations throughout the lake. The major inlet is the Middle Fork of the Crow River, which enters along the north shore of Nest Lake. The outlet drains into the Green Lake via the Old Mill Inn Dam. Public access sites include one state access along the east portion and one along the west portion of the lake. There are six resorts/campgrounds located along Nest Lake. Emergent vegetation (bulrush, wild rice) is present in the west and north portions of the lake. Waterlilies occur frequently in the east bay areas. Submergent vegetation densities (coontail, pondweeds, filamentous algae) within the lake were high in 2003. Curly-leaf pondweed can become a nuisance for boating and swimming during most years. Water quality (total phosphorus=0.017 mg/l) and clarity (secchi=15.5 feet on 6/09/03, 4.0 feet on 7/15/03) are good to moderate, but algae blooms can occur during the late summer months. Local anglers had good fishing success for walleye and black crappie during the last several years, especially during the early winter months. An angler harvested a 28 pound (48 inch) muskellunge from Nest Lake in August of 2003. Muskellunge have not been intentionally stocked into Nest, however some muskellunge fingerlings had accidentally escaped from the New London State Fish Hatchery Ponds into the Middle Fork of the Crow River.Largemouth bass numbers were moderate in the 2003 spring electrofishing survey was moderate (30.5 fish/hour) compared to the normal range (25th=14.0, 50th=29.6, 75th=66.6 fish/hour) of area lakes, and similar to the Nest Lake historical average (31.8 fish/hour). The 2003 largemouth bass average size was large (1.82 pounds and 14.17 inches) from spring electrofishing. The largemouth bass historical average size is 1.22 pounds and 12.1 inches from spring electrofishing. The catch rate of preferred size (15.0 inches) and larger largemouth bass was moderate (10.2 fish/hour) in 2003. Largemouth bass growth rates in Nest Lake were generally within or above the normal ranges for ages 1-5 compared to area lakes. The 1998 year class comprised 31% of the 2003 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch in Nest Lake. The largest largemouth bass captured was 18.6 inches from the 2003 spring electrofishing survey.Smallmouth bass numbers were high in 2003 (2.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes, and above the historical average (0.5 fish/gillnet) for Nest Lake. The 2003 smallmouth bass average size was large (1.85 pounds and 14.6 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average weight is 1.63 pounds from gillnets. The 2003 catch rate of preferred size (14.0 inches) and larger smallmouth bass was also high (1.1 fish/gillnet) in Nest. Smallmouth bass growth rates were below the normal range for ages 1-7 compared to other area lakes. The 1999 year class comprised 43% of the 2003 total smallmouth bass gillnet catch. The largest smallmouth bass captured was 21.7 inches in the 2003 resurvey.Black crappie numbers were high in 2003 (5.4 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes, but below the historical average catch rate of 7.5 fish/gillnet for Nest. The 2003 black crappie average size was small to moderate (0.22 pounds and 7.1 inches) from gillnets. Black crappie growth rates in Nest were generally in the normal range compared to area lakes. The 2001 year class comprised 65% of the 2003 total black crappie resurvey catch.Northern pike numbers were moderate to high in 2003 (6.3 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the historical average (4.5 fish/gillnet) for Nest. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 4.5 fish/gillnet. The 2003 northern pike average size was moderate (3.27 pounds and 23.8 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight for Nest Lake is 2.79 pounds from gillnets. The 2003 catch rate of quality size (21.0 inches) and larger northern pike was high (4.6 fish/gillnet) in Nest. Northern pike growth rates in Nest were within or above the normal ranges for ages 1-5 compared to area lakes. Approximately 77% of the northern pike captured in the 2003 summer resurvey were from the 2001 year class. The largest northern pike captured was 37.9 inches in the 2003 Nest Lake survey nets.Yellow perch numbers were low in 2003 (0.1 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the historical average catch rate (19.8 fish/gillnet) in Nest. The 2003 yellow perch average length (5.7 inches) from gillnets was slightly below the historical average (5.9 inches). Walleye numbers were moderate in 2003 (6.1 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes, but slightly below the historical catch rate (7.3 fish/gillnet) for Nest. The 2003 walleye average size was moderate (1.34 pounds and 14.5 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.38 pounds from gillnets. The 2003 catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches) and larger walleye in 2003 (1.6 fish/gillnet) was below the Nest historical average (2.2 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were within the normal ranges for ages 1-3, but above the normal ranges for ages 4-7 compared to area lakes. A large 2001 walleye year class (from natural reproduction) comprised 65% of the 2003 total walleye catch from survey nets. The largest walleye captured was 25.5 inches in the 2003 Nest Lake survey nets. The walleye population is due to a combination of natural reproduction and walleye stocking (fry, fingerlings, adults) in Nest Lake. Nest Lake occasionally receives low numbers of walleye fry (100,722 fry in 2003) via the Middle Fork of the Crow River during clean up operations of the walleye hatching program at the New London State Fish Hatchery. There were no young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers captured (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) in 2003 (0.0 YOY/hour). The YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 44.8 YOY/hour for Nest Lake. The area YOY walleye average catch rate is 73.8 YOY/hour. Nest Lake was last stocked with substantial walleye fingerling numbers in 1996 (17,340 fish).Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2003 (26.0 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes, but below the historical average (45.6 fish/trapnet) for Nest. The 2003 bluegill average size was moderate (0.16 pounds and 5.5 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.17 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches) and larger bluegill was moderate (9.2 fish/trapnet) in 2003. Bluegill growth rates in Nest Lake were generally near the low end of the normal ranges for ages 1-4, but above the normal ranges for ages 5-7 compared to area lakes. The 1999 year class comprised 42% of the total bluegill catch in the 2003 nets. Black bullhead numbers were low in 2003 (0.1 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. Yellow bullhead numbers were high in 2003 (5.9 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The 2003 yellow bullhead average size was 0.91 pounds and 11.2 inches.Current fish management activities on Nest Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Nest Lake fishery will be resurveyed in the 2004 fall for YOY walleye and the 2007 spring and summer for all fish species. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey of young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye was conducted on Nest Lake during September 13, 2017. Nest is a large (1,008 acres), moderately deep (40 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake with abundant submergent vegetation located in Kandiyohi County. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population is due to a combination of natural reproduction and Walleye stockings (fry, fingerlings and adults) for Nest Lake based on surveys, marking and historical data review. Nest Lake occasionally receives Walleye fry via scheduled stocking or from the Middle Fork of the Crow River during clean-up operations of the Walleye hatching program at the New London State Fish Hatchery. Nest Lake was recently stocked in 2012 (629,789 fry; 2,966 yearlings, 890 pounds; 4,799 fingerlings, 381 pounds), 2013 (542,744 fry; 24,750 fingerlings, 1,381 pounds; 182 adults, 66 pounds; 125 yearlings, 25 pounds), 2014 (530,653 fry; 2,885 yearlings, 145 pounds), 2015 (1,541,987 fry) and 2017 (1,821 fry). Walleye stocked into Nest were from the Pike River strain prior to 2014 and from the local Spicer strain during 2014-2017. Walleye fry were marked with oxytetracycline \"OTC\" in 2015. No Walleye were stocked into Nest during 2016. <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers (3.00 YOY/hour, 5.79 inches average) were captured in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (40.50 YOY/hour, 7.33 inches average) were captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. All of the YOY Walleye captured were from natural reproduction in 2016. Yearling walleye numbers were low in both the 2016 (6.00 fish/hour, 9.93 inches average) and 2017 (3.00 fish/hour, 10.24 inches average) fall electrofishing surveys. Moderate YOY numbers were captured in the 2015 fall (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.38 inches average), but spring stocked OTC marked fry accounted for 71% of the fall YOY Walleye captured. There were also abundant yearling Walleye numbers (24.00 fish/hour, 8.87 inches average) captured in 2015. This corresponds to abundant YOY Walleye numbers (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) captured (52.50 YOY/hour, 5.71 inches average) in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. There were low numbers of YOY Walleye captured in 2013 (20.00 YOY/hour, 6.60 inches average). The YOY Walleye historical average catch rate is 28.46 YOY/hour for Nest Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Nest Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2018 summer for all fish species. Spicer strain Walleye fry are scheduled for stocking in Nest and conjunction with downstream Green Lake during 2018. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted on Nest Lake during mid-July of 2008. Nest is a large, productive, and moderately deep lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 40 feet. Residential development (192 homes, several common interest properties, and recreational vehicle sites) has occurred along the entire shoreline area with the exception of the northwest portion of the lake. There are approximately 20 inlets/tiles that enter Nest Lake. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles from various locations throughout the lake. The major inlet is the Middle Fork of the Crow River, which enters along the north shore of Nest Lake. The Middle Fork Crow Reservoir is located about 4 miles upstream of Nest Lake. The outlet drains into the Green Lake via the Old Mill Inn Dam. Public access sites include one state access along the east portion and one along the west portion of the lake. There are three resorts, one motel, and Sanderson Girl Scout Camp located along Nest Lake. Shoreline substrates are varied with boulder, gravel, sand, rubble, and silt. Boulder and rubble are found near the islands and south shore point areas. Silt is most prevalent in the east bays and north inlet bay area. Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattails, wild rice) is present in the southwest, west and north portions of the lake. White and yellow waterlilies occur frequently in the east bay areas. Submergent vegetation densities (northern milfoil, coontail, flat-stem pondweed, filamentous algae) within the lake were moderate in 2008. Curly-leaf pondweed can become a nuisance for boating and swimming during most years. Curly-leaf pondweed was abundant in the littoral areas along the north, east, and west shore areas during June of 2008. The maximum depth of vegetation was 12.0 feet. Mid summer-dissolved oxygen levels were below 3.0 ppm at depths greater than 21.0 feet. Water quality (total phosphorus=0.028 mg/l) was moderate and clarity (secchi=8.0 feet on 6/09/08, 4.1 feet on 7/16/08) was fair during 2008. Algae blooms can occur during the late summer months. Non-point nutrient input sources into Nest include residential homes, agricultural row crops, road runoff, and city of New London. Nest Lake is managed for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. Nest Lake is scheduled for walleye fingerling stocking after consecutive poor YOY walleye numbers due to fry stocking or natural reproduction. Nest is managed primarily for walleye. <br> \n <br> \nA spring electrofishing survey was not conducted in Nest during 2008. The previous 2003 spring electrofishing survey results included moderate numbers of largemouth bass (30.46 fish/hour) compared to the Nest Lake historical average (31.75 fish/hour). The 2003 largemouth bass average weight and length were 1.82 pounds and 14.17 inches respectively from spring electrofishing. The largemouth bass historical average weight and length are 1.22 pounds and 12.1 inches from spring electrofishing. There were abundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" largemouth bass (18.88 YOY/seine haul, 2.56 inches average length) captured in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were low in 2008 (0.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.43 fish/gillnet for Nest Lake. The 2008 smallmouth bass average size was large (3.53 pounds and 17.91 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average weight is 1.87 pounds from gillnets. YOY smallmouth bass numbers were low (0.75 YOY/seine haul, 2.19 inches average length) in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderate to low in 2008 (2.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Nest (25th=1.56, 50th=2.80, 75th=6.54 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The black crappie gillnet historical average catch rate was 7.03 fish/gillnet. The black crappie catch rate from the 2008 trapnets (1.58 fish/trapnet) was near the historical average (1.79 fish/trapnet). The 2008 black crappie average size was moderate (0.29 pounds and 8.07 inches) from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was low (1.20 fish/gillnet). Black crappie growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2005 year class comprised 59% of the 2008 total black crappie resurvey catch. No YOY black crappie were captured in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2008 (9.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Nest Lake (25th=2.85, 50th=5.33, 75th=6.29 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 4.98 fish/gillnet. The 2008 northern pike average size was moderate (3.04 pounds and 23.51 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.82 pounds from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was high (6.60 fish/gillnet). The 2008 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger was moderate (1.20 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. Approximately 39% of the northern pike captured in the 2008 summer resurvey were from the 2004 year class. Low numbers of YOY northern pike (0.88 YOY/seine haul, 5.56 inches average length) were captured in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2008 (3.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Nest Lake (25th=10.38, 50th=15.50, 75th=29.81 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 18.25 fish/gillnet. The 2008 yellow perch average weight was low (0.08 pounds) from gillnets. The 2008 yellow perch average length (5.77 inches) from gillnets was slightly below the historical average (5.90 inches). Yellow perch growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. All of the yellow perch captured from the 2008 gillnets belonged to the 2005 year class. Abundant numbers of YOY yellow perch were captured in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls (31.25 YOY/seine haul, 2.28 inches average length). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2008 (2.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for Nest Lake (25th=4.75, 50th=6.25, 75th=8.27 fish/gillnet), but within the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 6.87 fish/gillnet for Nest Lake. The 2008 walleye average size was moderate to large (3.04 pounds and 19.67 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.53 pounds from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye (2.20 fish/gillnet) was equal to the Nest Lake historical average. Walleye growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. A large 2001 walleye year class (from natural reproduction) comprised 65% of the 2003 and 53% of the 2008 total walleye catch from survey nets. Low numbers of walleye were captured from ice out trapnets in 2008 (1.70 fish/trapnet, 2.41 pounds average weight, 18.90 inches average length). All of the walleye captured were males during the ice out trapnetting. Approximately 29% of the walleye captured in the ice out trapnets were from the 2001 year class.  <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population is due to a combination of natural reproduction and walleye stocking (fry, fingerlings, adults) in Nest Lake. Nest Lake occasionally receives low numbers of walleye fry via the Middle Fork of the Crow River during clean up operations of the walleye hatching program at the New London State Fish Hatchery. There were low YOY walleye numbers captured (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) in 2008 (1.50 YOY/hour, 6.61 inches average length). The YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 28.47 YOY/hour for Nest Lake. The Spicer Area YOY walleye average catch rate is 76.32 YOY/hour. Nest Lake was recently stocked in 2004 (10,994 fry, 580 adults, 10,775 fingerlings), 2005 (377,879 fry), 2006 (532,727 fry, 113 adults, 26,766 fingerlings, 16 yearlings), 2007 (51,429 fry), and 2008 (694,029 fry). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2008 (37.67 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Nest Lake (25th=25.75, 50th=37.67, 75th=47.43 fish/trapnet) and similar lakes. Abundant numbers of bluegill were captured in the 2008 gillnets (28.20 fish/gillnet, 0.23 pounds average weight). The bluegill historical catch rate is 36.25 fish/trapnet. The 2008 bluegill average size was moderate (0.21 pounds and 6.20 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.17 pounds from trapnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was high (26.28 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6, but above the normal ranges for ages 7-8. The 2002 year class comprised 36% of the total bluegill catch in the 2008 gillnets and trapnets. YOY bluegill numbers were low (0.38 YOY/seine haul, 1.17 inches average length) in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2008 (2.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2008 black bullhead average size was large (1.18 pounds and 12.50 inches) from gillnets. Yellow bullhead numbers were moderate to abundant in 2008 (6.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2008 yellow bullhead average size was large (0.82 pounds and 11.16 inches) from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of special interest captured in the 2008 included moderate numbers of white sucker (3.00 fish/gillnet). The white sucker historical average catch rate is 3.68 fish/gillnet. The 2008 white sucker average size was moderate to large (2.89 pounds and 18.70 inches) from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Nest Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. <br> \nA fall electrofishing survey for YOY walleye is scheduled for 2009. A population assessment of all fish species is scheduled during the 2013 summer for Nest Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted on Nest Lake during late-July of 2013. Nest is a large, productive, and moderately deep lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 40 feet. Public access sites include one state access along the east portion and one along the west portion of the lake. Development (192 homes, several resorts and recreational vehicle sites, one motel, and Sanderson Girl Scout Camp; 2008 survey) has occurred along the entire shoreline area with the exception of the northwest portion of the lake. Mid-summer-dissolved oxygen levels were below 3.0 ppm at depths greater than 21.0 feet. Water quality was fair (total phosphorus=0.042 mg/l, MNPCA) and clarity was good during mid-July of 2013 (secchi=8.0 feet on 7/15/2013, MNPCA), but clarity was poor by late-July (3.2 feet on 7/29/2013). Non-point nutrient input sources into Nest include residential homes, agricultural row crops, road runoff, and city of New London. There are approximately 20 inlets/tiles that enter Nest Lake. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles from various locations throughout the lake. The major inlet is the Middle Fork Crow River, which enters along the north shore of Nest Lake. The Middle Fork Crow Reservoir and New London Dam are located about 4 miles upstream of Nest Lake. The New London State Fish Hatchery is located about 1 mile downstream the New London Dam. The Nest Lake outlet drains into Green Lake via the Old Mill Inn Dam. Shoreline substrates are varied with boulder, gravel, sand, rubble, and silt. Boulder and rubble are found near the islands and south shore point areas. Soft substrates (silt, muck, and detritus) are most prevalent in the east bays and north inlet bay area. Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattails, wild rice) is present in the southwest, west and north portions of the lake. White and yellow water lilies occur frequently in the east bay areas. Submergent vegetation densities (i.e. northern milfoil, coontail, various pondweed species, and filamentous algae) are usually moderate to abundant within the lake. Curly-leaf pondweed can become a nuisance for boating and swimming during most years. Blue-green algae blooms can occur during the late summer months due in part due to excess phosphorus released during the annual late summer die off of curly-leaf pondweed.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass abundance was moderate (0.67 fish/gillnet) in 2013 compared to similar lakes. The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.45 fish/gillnet for Nest Lake. The 2013 smallmouth bass average size was moderate (1.07 pounds and 11.24 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average weight is 1.07 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderate in 2013 (4.67 fish/gillnet), but below the historical average (6.84 fish/gillnet). The 2013 black crappie trapnet catch rate (1.75 fish/trapnet) was low, but near the historical average (1.79 fish/trapnet). The 2013 black crappie average size was small (0.38 pounds, 7.15 inches) from gillnets, but moderate for trapnets (0.60 pounds, 9.33 inches). The 2013 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was low (1.33 fish/gillnet). Black crappie growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 3-7. The 2012 and 2010 year classes comprised 38% and 21% of the 2013 total black crappie catch.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate in 2013 (4.67 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 4.96 fish/gillnet. The 2013 northern pike average size was small to moderate (2.75 pounds and 23.24 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.81 pounds from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was high (3.33 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. Approximately 43% of the northern pike captured in the 2013 summer nets were from the 2010 year class. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2013 (2.33 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes and the historical average (16.92 fish/gillnet). The 2013 yellow perch average length (5.82 inches) from gillnets was small, but similar to the historical average (5.89 inches). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was moderate to high (8.67 fish/gillnet) in 2013 compared to similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 7.02 fish/gillnet for Nest Lake. The 2013 walleye average size was moderate to large (2.51 pounds and 18.23 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.61 pounds from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye (8.00 fish/gillnet) was high and above the Nest historical average (3.03 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2010 walleye year class (probably natural reproduction) comprised 41% of the 2013 total walleye net catch. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population is due to a combination of natural reproduction and walleye stocking (fry, fingerlings and adults) in Nest Lake. There were low to moderate young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers captured (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) in 2013 (20.00 YOY/hour, 6.61 inches average length). The YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 27.11 YOY/hour for Nest Lake. Nest Lake was recently stocked in 2009 (1,126,374 fry), 2010 (2,279 fry), 2011 (1,853 yearlings, 284 pounds; 3,785 fingerlings, 418 pounds; 15 adults, 30 pounds), 2012 (629,789 fry; 2,966 yearlings, 890 pounds; 4,799 fingerlings, 381 pounds) and 2013 (542,744 fry; 24,750 fingerlings, 1,381 pounds; 182 adults, 66 pounds; 125 yearlings, 25 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low (12.33 fish/trapnet) in 2013 compared to similar lakes and the historical average (34.26 fish/trapnet). The 2013 bluegill average size was moderate (0.24 pounds and 5.67 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.17 pounds from trapnets. The 2013 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was moderate (5.08 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5, but above for ages 6-8. The 2011 and 2009 year classes comprised 50% and 13% respectively of the 2013 total bluegill catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were moderate (4.67 fish/gillnet) in 2013 compared to similar lakes. The 2013 black bullhead average size was large (1.29 pounds and 12.74 inches) from gillnets. Yellow bullhead numbers were abundant (30.00 fish/gillnet) in 2013 compared to similar lakes and the historical average (4.54 fish/gillnet). The 2013 yellow bullhead average size was moderate (0.62 pounds and 10.21 inches) from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of special interest captured in 2013 included moderate numbers of white sucker (4.33 fish/gillnet) and low numbers of channel catfish (0.33 fish/gillnet). The historical average catch rates are 3.74 fish/gillnet and 0.09 fish/gillnet for white sucker and channel catfish respectively. The 2013 white sucker average size was moderate (2.65 pounds and 17.55 inches) from gillnets. The 2013 channel catfish average size was small to moderate (1.41 pounds and 15.31 inches). <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Nest Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. A fall electrofishing survey for YOY walleye is scheduled for 2014. A population assessment of all fish species is scheduled during the 2018 summer for Nest Lake. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Abundant numbers of YOY walleye (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) were captured (52.50 YOY/hour, 5.71 inches) in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. There were low numbers of YOY walleye captured in 2013 (20.00 YOY/hour, 6.60 inches average length). The YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 28.45 YOY/hour for Nest Lake. The walleye population is due to a combination of natural reproduction and walleye stocking (fry, fingerlings and adults) in Nest Lake. Nest Lake occasionally receives low numbers of walleye fry via the Middle Fork of the Crow River during clean-up operations of the walleye hatching program at the New London State Fish Hatchery. Nest Lake was recently stocked in 2009 (1,126,374 fry), 2010 (2,279 fry), 2011 (1,853 yearlings, 284 pounds; 3,785 fingerlings, 418 pounds; 15 adults, 30 pounds), 2012 (629,789 fry; 2,966 yearlings, 890 pounds; 4,799 fingerlings, 381 pounds), 2013 (542,744 fry; 24,750 fingerlings, 1,381 pounds; 182 adults, 66 pounds; 125 yearlings, 25 pounds) and 2014 (530,653 fry; 2,885 yearlings, 145 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing survey for YOY walleye is scheduled for 2015.

There were also abundant yearling Walleye numbers (24.00 fish/hour, 8.87 inches) captured in 2015. This corresponds to abundant YOY Walleye numbers (due to natural reproduction or fry stocking) captured (52.50 YOY/hour, 5.71 inches) in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Nest Lake was conducted on August 27-28, 2018 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 14 sampling stations, but six stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at six stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Logperch, Pugnose Shiner, and Smallmouth Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Logperch, and Smallmouth Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
