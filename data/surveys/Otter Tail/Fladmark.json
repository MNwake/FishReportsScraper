                "narrative": "<p>Fladmark Lake is a 55-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwest Otter Tail County approximately eight miles east of Erhard, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of hardwood forest and grassland.  The maximum depth of Fladmark Lake is 45 feet; however, 38% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2005 lake survey was 19.0 feet, which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 21.8 to 28.0 feet.  Fladmark Lake is included in class 28 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.     Fladmark Lake is located within Maplewood State Park.  The lakeshore remains entirely undeveloped.  An earthern public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent along the entire shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Fladmark Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     Experimental fishing regulations are in effect on Fladmark Lake.  The regulation is a daily bag limit of ten sunfish, and all largemouth bass and northern pike must be released.  The purpose of this regulation is to improve the size structure of those species.  Data from this lake survey indicate that the regulation may be having a positive affect on the northern pike and largemouth bass populations.     An abundant northern pike population exists in Fladmark Lake.  The test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 18.9 to 35.2 inches with an average length and weight of 27.0 inches and 4.8 pounds.  Sixty-four percent of the pike were at least 24.0 inches in length.  Northern pike attain an average length of 19.5 inches at five years of age.  Growth rate estimates are slower than average northern pike growth rates for class 28 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.  The slow northern pike growth rates may be attributed to the low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish.     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Bluegill reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Twelve percent of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age.  Growth rate estimates are equivalent to average bluegill growth rates for class 28 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.      Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that Fladmark Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 5.5 to 19.0 inches with an average length and weight of 13.6 inches and 1.4 pounds.   Bass attain an average length of 12.7 inches at five years of age.  Growth rate estimates are equivalent to average largemouth bass growth rates for class 28 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.       Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing on Fladmark Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Fladmark Lake is a 55-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwest Otter Tail County approximately eight miles east of Erhard, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of hardwood forest and grassland.  Shoreline length is 1.6 miles.  The maximum depth is 45 feet, however, 38% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2010 survey was 22.4 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 19.0 to 28.0 feet. <br> \n     Fladmark Lake is located entirely within Maplewood State Park.  The lakeshore is entirely undeveloped.  An earthen public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent along the entire shoreline. <br> \n    Special fishing regulations are in effect on Fladmark Lake.  The daily bag limit for sunfish is ten and the daily bag limit for black crappies is five.  All largemouth bass and northern pike must be immediately released.  The purpose of this regulation is to improve the size structure of these species.   <br> \n     Fladmark Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     <br> \n     A moderate density northern pike population exists.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike size structure is excellent.  Pike ranged in length from 13.5 to 33.9 inches with an average length and weight of 25.3 inches and 4.2 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 23.7 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n      The bluegill population is also moderately abundant.  Bluegill reproduction is also consistently good.  Bluegill size structure is very good with 40% of the bluegills in the trap net sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age.   <br> \n     Data from recent assessments indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Bass reproduction is also consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 3.4 to 18.2 inches.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 12.5 inches at five years of age. <br> \n      Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Fladmark Lake is a 55-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately eight miles east of Erhard, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of hardwood forest and grassland.  The maximum depth is 45 feet, however, 38% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2018 survey was 19.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 19.0 to 28.0 feet. <br> \n     Fladmark Lake is located entirely within Maplewood State Park.  The lakeshore is entirely undeveloped.  An earthen public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent along the entire shoreline. <br> \n    Special fishing regulations are in effect on Fladmark Lake.  The sunfish possession limit is ten.  The Black Crappie possession limit is five.  All Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike must be immediately released.  The objective of these regulations is to improve the size structure of these species.     <br> \n     Fladmark Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.       <br> \n     A moderate density Northern Pike population exists.  Pike ranged in length from 16.9 to 33.7 inches with an average length and weight of 21.4 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 18.1 inches at three years of age.   <br> \n      The Bluegill population is also moderately abundant.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Twenty-three percent of the Bluegills in the trap net sample were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age.   <br> \n     Data from recent surveys indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 5.5 to 15.6 inches.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 12.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n      Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Fladmark Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fladmark Lake is a 55-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwest Otter Tail County approximately eight miles east of Erhard, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of hardwood forest and grassland.  The maximum depth of Fladmark Lake is 45 feet; however, 38% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2002 lake survey was 22.5 feet, which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 21.8 to 28.0 feet.  Fladmark Lake is included in class 28 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.     Fladmark Lake is located within Maplewood State Park.  The lakeshore remains entirely undeveloped.  An earthern public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent along the entire lakeshore.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Fladmark Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     Experimental fishing regulations are in effect on Fladmark Lake.  The regulation is a daily bag limit of ten sunfish, and all largemouth bass and northern pike must be released.  The purpose of this regulation is to improve the size structure of those species.  Data from this lake survey indicate that the regulation may be having a positive affect on the northern pike and bluegill populations.     An abundant northern pike population exists in Fladmark Lake.  The test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 17.8 to 37.0 inches with an average length and weight of 24.0 inches and 3.4 pounds.  Forty-four percent of the pike were at least 24.0 inches in length.  Northern pike attain an average length of 20.3 inches at five years of age.  The slow northern pike growth rates may be attributed to the low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish.     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Bluegill reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Bluegill size structure is excellent as forty-seven percent of the sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 7.1 inches at seven years of age.     Largemouth bass are also abundant.  The test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Bass ranged in length from 5.5 to 14.6 inches with an average length and weight of 10.0 inches and 0.6 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 10.3 inches at age five.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing on Fladmark Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      </p>",
