Trout are stocked annually to provide a unique fishing opportunity in the Twin Cites Metro Area. Heavy fishing pressure is common when the trout season opens. Winter angling is very popular, especially on opening weekend. Brown trout were found in low abundance during this assessment. This is not unexpected due to the popularity of the fishery. Hybrid sunfish were the most abundant species sampled, but the fish were small. Bluegills were captured for the first time in trap nets in this lake. Bluegills were seined during the 2003 survey but their presence in the trap nets indicated the population is growing. Black crappies were uncommon while white crappies were more numerous, but are small.     </p>",

Heavy fishing pressure is common when the trout seasons open. Winter angling is very popular, especially opening weekend. Brook trout were found in low abundance during this survey, most likely due to the popularity of the fishery. Hybrid sunfish were the most abundant species sampled, but the fish were small. White crappies were found in average abundance, but were also small. Some of the fish did exceed 10 inches, but they were rare. Carp were present in low numbers. The black bullhead catch was down overall from previous surveys.</p>",
