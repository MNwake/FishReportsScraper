                "narrative": "<p>Big Wolf Lake is a 1,073-acre lake with a maximum depth of 57 feet located in southern Beltrami and northern Hubbard counties just west of the town of Cass Lake.  There is a DNR-owned public water access located on the west shore of the lake just off County Road 25 with a concrete ramp and parking for 12 trucks/trailers.  Statewide fishing regulations apply to all species.  Big Wolf Lake has become infested recently with a number of aquatic invasive plants and animals.  Recreational boaters should always adhere to state regulations (Clean, Drain and Dry) meant to prevent the spread of these invasives to other waterbodies.   <br> \n <br> \nBig Wolf Lake is closely connected to several other high-quality fishing lakes via the Upper Mississippi River.  This connectivity benefits populations of migratory fish such as Walleye that utilize a number of different types of lake and river habitats throughout the year. <br> \n  <br> \nBig Wolf Lake is a popular destination for Walleye anglers in the Bemidji area particularly early in the season when the fish are returning from their spawning run up the Mississippi River.  The 2019 survey documented good numbers of keeper-size Walleye that averaged 15 inches with fish up to 23 inches in length captured.  Walleye fishing success can remain high throughout the rest of the season as well.  If the fish aren't cooperating on Big Wolf anglers can make a short run down the Mississippi to Lake Andrusia or Cass Lake which also offer very good Walleye fishing opportunities.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Big Wolf Lake although the average size of pike captured in surveys has declined over time.  The 2019 survey captured pike up to 32 inches with an average size of nearly 20 inches in length.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe numbers of Bluegill and Black Crappie captured in surveys has increased over time and catch rates for these species are now comparable to other similar lakes.  Bluegill up to 9 inches in length were captured with a good average size of 7.5 inches.  Black Crappie over 13 inches in length were also captured in this survey.   <br> \n <br> \nFishing effort directed toward Muskellunge has increased noticeably in recent years.  Although muskies are not commonly captured in standard surveys, angler reports indicate an expanding population with success rates that are similar to other Muskellunge lakes in the area.  Once again Big Wolf's connectivity to other musky waters downstream benefits this population.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2019 survey were Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Greater and Shorthead Redhorse, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Tullibee Cisco and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Wolf Lake, in southern Beltrami County is connected by the Mississippi River to the Cass Lake chain, and fish populations are influenced by movement between the lakes.  Primary fish species in Big Wolf Lake are walleye, nothern pike, and yellow perch.  All of the species making up the fish community are maintained through natural reproduction.  Care is taken to protect the in-lake habitat to ensure continued successful reproduction.Walleye were sampled in 1999 at an all time high for this lake.  Most walleye sampled were between 12.0 and 16.0 inches, and average length was 13.9 inches.  Average weight has remained constant at approximately one pound through the entire assessment history, back to 1948.  The largest walleye sampled was 24.6 inches.  Some walleye have black spot, a common external parasite of fish.  Fish with heavy infestations are not aesthetically pleasing but eating quality is not affected.Northern pike were also sampled at their highest recorded abundance over all assessments.  Average length and weight were 20.8 inches and 2.3 pounds respectively.  Aging suggests that successful natural reproduction occurs most years.  The largest nothern pike sampled was 33 inches.Yellow perch catch rate has remained relatively stable through all assessments, but abundance is not high enough for Big Wolf Lake to be known as one of the \"hot\" perch lakes.  Average size has decreased over time but with a mean and maximum perch length of 6.6 and 9.9 inches respectively, many will still be acceptable to anglers.  Black spot was noted on 33% of the perch examined and yellow grub (another unharmful external parasite) was also present.Tullibee catch rate has shifted up and down over the years with no apparent trend.  An average weight of 1.1 pounds is comparable with most other assessments.  About half of the tullibee sampled had an internal parasite (Triaenophorus) which may be transmitted to humans.  All fish havested should be thoroughly cooked to prevent possible transmission of parasites to humans.Other species sampled in small numbers in the 1999 assessment were white sucker, black crappie, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, and yellow bullheads.Muskellunge have never been sampled in an assessment in Big Wolf Lake but they are known to be present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>(Big) Wolf Lake is in lake class 27, and fish populations are compared with other similar lakes statewide.  Bemidji area lakes in class 27 include Andrusia, Big, Blackduck, Big Turtle, Clearwater and Marquette.  They are typically very large, deep lakes with hard water and regular shorelines.  Since Wolf Lake is connected by the Mississippi River to the Cass Lake chain, fish populations are affected by movement between lakes.  Primary management is for walleye.    Walleye are common and near the lake class average.  A mean weight of slightly over one pound is lower than most comparable lakes.  A large 1995 year class averaging about nine inches is responsible for the low mean weight.  The average length of all walleye sampled was 13.8 inches and the largest was 25.3 inches.  Some walleye have Neascus (black spot), a common parasite of fish.  Fish with heavy infestations are not appealing but it doesn't affect eating quality.    Northern pike have increased in abundance from previous levels, but they are still below the lake class average.  An average weight of 2.9 pounds is heavier than most lakes in the class and the heaviest recorded in Wolf Lake since 1948.  The average length was about 22 inches and the largest was more than 38 inches.    Yellow perch are near the lake class average in abundance.  Abundance has fluctuated over the survey history, but the weight has remained quite stable and near one-fifth pound.  The average length was 7.25 inches.  Most perch have Neascus (black spot) and some also have yellow grubs, another fish parasite that is not harmful to human consumption.    A variety of panfish species are also present.  Rock bass are abundant with an average weight of 0.4 pounds.  Pumpkinseed sunfish are common and near the lake class average, but with most of them less than 4 inches they are not attractive to anglers.  Black crappie, bluegill and hybrid sunfish are present, but the abundance of each is very low.    Tullibee, whitefish, white sucker and redhorse are common.  Although tullibee and whitefish provide some seasonal gill net harvest, none of these species attract much interest from anglers.  Their greatest value to the fish community is as forage for larger predators.    Yellow, brown, and black bullheads have been identified over the survey history, but they have never been abundant.  Recent trends seem to show a shift in dominance from black and browns to mostly yellows.  This may be an indicator of improving water quality.      Muskellunge have never been sampled in Wolf Lake though they are known to be present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wolf is a 1,073-acre lake, located 6 miles northwest of Cass Lake, MN within the Chippewa National Forest and part of the Cass Lake chain of lakes.  A targeted survey was completed by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff on Wolf Lake during July of 2019 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 14 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community.  Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted.  A total of eight sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites.  A total of 22 species of fish were sampled, which included 11 species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Burbot, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Muskellunge, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from the standard survey completed in 2019 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Wolf Lake.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicated Wolf Lake is in good health with a FIBI score above the impairment and exceptional thresholds for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wolf Lake, known locally as Big Wolf, is one of several connected lakes joined via the Mississippi and Turtle Rivers that comprise the Cass Lake chain of lakes.  It is a 1,094 acre lake with a 57 foot maximum depth.  Big Wolf supports a moderate amount of residential development along its lakeshore, including several resorts.  Wolf Lake is located in southeastern Beltrami County approximately 10 miles east of Bemidji.  There is a DNR owned public access on the west side of the lake, just off of County Road 25. <br> \n <br> \nWater levels in this system are affected by dam operations on the Mississippi River, both upstream and downstream of Wolf Lake.  Water level fluctuations can affect growth of emergent and submerged vegetation as well as availability of potential spawning habitat.  In addition, fish populations in these connected waters are frequently influenced by fish movement between lakes.  Primary fish species in Big Wolf Lake are walleye, northern pike, and yellow perch.  Other important species inhabiting the system include muskellunge, black crappie, tullibee (cisco), and white sucker.  Walleye is the main species of management interest. <br> \n <br> \nWolf Lake is very scenic and is a popular destination among early season walleye anglers. This is because the section of the Mississippi River upstream from Big Wolf Lake is known to be an important walleye spawning area.  Since spawning is usually completed shortly before the season opener, walleyes are often working their way back to the main lakes in the chain and feeding along the way. <br> \n <br> \nBig Wolf is connected to Lake Andrusia which is a source of walleye brood stock for the Big Lake Creek spawn taking station.  Under DNR policy, ten percent of the annual walleye egg take is returned to the source water as fry.  Due to substantial movement of fish throughout the Cass Lake Chain, any stocking or natural reproduction should be viewed in the context of the entire connected system of lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2009 increased substantially from the 1999 assessment, as indicated by the all-time high gill net catch rate of 15.7 fish/net.  Catch rates from both of those assessments are greater than what is typically expected for this lake type.  Walleye ranged in length from 7 to 22 inches and were composed of nine different year classes.  The 2007 year class (age 2) was dominant, comprising 43% of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2009, northern pike abundance in Wolf Lake was at average levels.  Captured pike displayed a wide range of lengths from 12 inches to nearly 34 inches.  There were six different year classes represented in the sample; however, 82% were from the 2006 and 2007 year classes.  Northern pike growth rates are above average in Wolf Lake.  At age-3, an average Big Wolf Lake pike is 20.5 inches long, whereas the average length for this lake type in the Bemidji area is 18.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge have never been documented on Big Wolf during any population assessment but are known to be present due to the lake\u0019s connection to other waters with documented populations.  Anglers should remember that muskellunge harvest restrictions on Wolf Lake fall under the statewide 48 inch minimum length regulation. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance has remained very stable over the years, but the fish are not typically large enough for Big Wolf to be known as an outstanding perch fishing lake.  In 2009, only eight percent of yellow perch in the sample were greater than eight inches long.  Black crappie abundance as determined from experimental gill nets was better than average for the lake type.  Crappie ranged in length from 8 to 13 inches with a mean length of approximately 11 inches.  Sixty-nine percent of crappie in the sample was from the 2005 year class (age 4). <br> \n <br> \nDevelopment pressure is increasing around the shorelines and within the watersheds of many Minnesota lakes.  This development can degrade water quality and impact valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients, and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on the shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.
