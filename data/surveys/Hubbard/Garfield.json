                "narrative": "<p>Garfield Lake is located in northeastern Hubbard County, adjacent to the town of Laporte.  Garfield has a surface area of 960 acres and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  There is a city-owned public access located on the southwest shore of the lake.  Garfield is a popular lake for Walleye and Northern Pike fishing, but also provides angling opportunities for panfish and Largemouth Bass.  Anglers and boaters should be aware that zebra mussels, an aquatic invasive species (AIS), are present in Garfield.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.   Garfield is in lake class 27.  Other class 27 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include Fish Hook, Lake George, and Upper Bottle. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown a good Walleye population in Garfield, with their abundance fluctuating near the upper end of the range for this lake class.  Anglers will find good numbers of walleye in the 14-18 inch size range.  Sampled Walleye had an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 1.9 pounds, with fish measured up to 23.9 inches. Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye were sampled in good numbers.  Yellow Perch were small in size, with few fish of an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n   <br> \nGarfield supports an abundant Northern Pike population with the 2020 survey being very high.   Anglers will find lots of small Northern Pike in Garfield, with sampled fish having an average length and weight of 19.8 inches and 1.6 pounds, with fish measured up to 33.6 inches.  The number of large Northern Pike (>28 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nGarfield Lake is probably known more for \"quality\" than \"quantity\" when it comes to its panfish and Largemouth Bass populations.  Bluegill abundance has fluctuated from low to moderate abundance in recent surveys for this lake class.   Anglers will find good numbers of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 10-12 inch size range.  Present and past surveys have shown that Largemouth Bass are found in low to moderate abundance for this lake class.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore  and littoral fish community in Garfield Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 27-29 June 2022. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with three sites sampled from the boat due to dense waterlilies, wild rice, and cattails preventing access to wadeable water. A 50-foot seine was used to sample four sites, a 15-foot seine was used at five sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at five sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 17 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one species, Fathead Minnow, that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 27-29 June 2022 by IBI Program Staff. Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill and Bowfin comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bowfin comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was just greater than the 25% quartile for similar Lake Class 27 lakes and the average length was 6.2 inches, with 36% over 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate the fish community of Garfield Lake is affected by disturbance as indicated by an FIBI score very near to the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Garfield Lake is located in northeastern Hubbard County, adjacent to the town of Laporte.  Garfield Lake has a surface area of 979 acres and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  There is a city-owned public access located on the southwest shore of the lake.  Garfield is a popular lake for walleye and northern pike fishing, but also provides angling opportunities for panfish and largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Garfield is in lake class 27.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Upper Bottle, Fish Hook, and Lake George. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (7.3 walleye/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and at the current management goal of 7.0 walleye/gillnet.   Surveys since 1995 have had similar walleye gillnet catch rates, fluctuating around the management goal.  Anglers will find good numbers of walleye in the 14-16 inch size range.  Garfield is stocked annually in the spring with walleye fry.  Fall electrofishing surveys have shown good survival of stocked walleye fry.  An abundant yellow perch population is present in Garfield and provides a good forage base for the walleye population.  A few yellow perch were of an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nGarfield Lake supports an abundant northern pike population.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 14.7/net is well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to recent surveys.  Garfield Lake has excellent northern pike spawning habitat that accounts for good reproduction and survival of pike.  The whole south bay has preferred northern pike spawning habitat of shallow water with submerged aquatic vegetation.  Lots of \"hammer handle\" size pike are present in Garfield, with sampled pike having an average length and weight of 20.3 inches and 1.8 pounds.  The number of large pike (> 28 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nGarfield Lake is probably known more for \"quality\" than \"quantity\" when it comes to its panfish and largemouth bass populations.  Bluegill abundance (24.0 bluegill/trapnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lakes class.  Bluegill abundance in Garfield has fluctuated from low to moderate levels since the 1995 survey, while earlier surveys had very low bluegill abundance.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers for all gear types, similar to past surveys.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 10-12 inch size range.  Present and past surveys have shown that largemouth bass are found in low numbers when compared to other area lakes.  While the largemouth bass numbers are low in Garfield Lake, anglers have reported catching some large fish. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead and bowfin (dogfish), and moderate numbers of white sucker, rock bass, and brown bullhead.  Burbot (eelpout) were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 30, 2020 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, two sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and four sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at eight sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 14 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured ten species of fish including two species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, and Blackchin Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Golden Shiner, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on July 6, 2020, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Garfield Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Garfield Lake is located in the Leech Lake River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Garfield Lake is a 979 acre lake located in northeastern Hubbard County.  The town of Laporte is located on the southwest shore of the lake.Walleye were sampled in high numbers with a gillnet catch of 8.9/net.  This is the second highest walleye gillnet catch in seven surveys dating back to 1958.  The previous two surveys have had lower walleye gillnet catches: 2.3/net in 1990 and 3.8/net in 1987.  Average size of sampled walleyes was 15.3 inches and 1.4 lbs.  Walleye up to 27.4 inches were sampled.  Natural reproduction was evident, with 21% of the walleyes sampled from non-stocked years.  Present walleye stocking program is to stock Garfield Lake with walleye fry in even numbered years. Garfield Lake has been known for having an abundant northern pike population, and the 1995 survey showed no difference.  Northern pike were sampled in exceptionally high numbers, with a gillnet catch of 27.2/net.  This is the highest northern pike gillnet catch in seven surveys going back to 1958.  Historical catches have been high and stable, with the previous high catch being 14.5/gillnet in 1983 and with the low being 7.0/gillnet in 1987. Average size of the northern pike was small, 1.7 lbs and 19.2 inches.  However, several large northern pike were sampled, with the largest measuring 38.3 inches.  Abundant spawning habitat, located in the shallow south bay, maintains the high northern pike population found in Garfield Lake.Yellow perch were sampled in moderate numbers with a catch of 9.7/gillnet.  Historical catches have been higher, ranging from 17.3/net in 1990 to 57.8/net in 1958.  Average size was small, 6.7 inches.  Yellow perch of an acceptable size to the angler were sampled, however, with 11% of the sample greater than 9.0 inches and with fish measured up to 11.6 inches.  The yellow perch in Garfield Lake provide a forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations.The bluegill trapnet catch of 24.8/net is the highest catch in seven surveys dating back to 1958.  Historical trapnet catches of bluegill have been much lower, with the previous high being 1.1/net in 1987.  Size of bluegill was good, with an average length and weight of 6.9 inches and 0.3 lbs, respectively.  Bluegill up to 10.4 inches were measured, with 38% of the sample 7.0 inches or larger.  Pumpkinseed were sampled in high numbers with a trapnet catch of 19.4/net.  This is the highest pumpkinseed catch for all surveys dating back to 1958.  The previous survey in 1990 had a trapnet catch of 1.8/net, with the previous high being 7.1/trapnet (1958).  Pumpkinseed had an average length of 6.2 inches, with fish measured up to 7.9 inches.Standard survey sampling gear is usually not effective in evaluation of black crappie and largemouth bass populations, but some general inferences can be made.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Sampled black crappie were large in size, ranging from 10.4 to 13.8 inches.  Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys. Largemouth bass up to 19.3 inches were sampled.Rock bass were sampled in high numbers with a catch of 6.3/trapnet.  Previous surveys have had similar catches.  Rock bass had an average length of 6.5 inches, with fish measured up to 10.3 inches.Three species of bullhead were sampled in Garfield Lake: yellow, brown, and black.  Yellow and brown bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers, while black bullhead were sampled in low numbers.  Historical catches of yellow and brown bullhead have been slightly higher, while catches of black bullhead have been much higher, especially in 1980's.  All of the bullhead species were large in size, with missing year classes of smaller bullheads.  The cool summer water temperatures in the early 1990's probably limited bullhead spawning and resulted in the low population levels found presently in Garfield Lake.White sucker were sampled in moderate numbers with a catch of 2.6/gillnet.  Previous surveys have had similar catches.  The white sucker population in Garfield Lake provides a forage base for the northern pike population.Burbot (eelpout) were sampled in moderate numbers  with a catch of 0.4/gillnet.  Historical catches of burbot have been similar.  Burbot had a average weight of 2.5 lbs, and ranged in length from 17.2 to 22.4 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tGarfield Lake is located in Laporte, in northeastern Hubbard County. Garfield has a surface area of 960 acres and a maximum depth of 32 feet. A city owned public access is located on the southwest shore of the lake. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Garfield is in lake class 27. Class 27 lakes generally are very large, deep, with a regular shape and hard water. Other class 27 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Fish Hook, Lake George and Upper Bottle. <br> \n\tWalleye abundance was slightly lower than past surveys, but has been consistent with similar lakes. Many Walleyes are a great size for anglers of 12-17 inches. The average length was 14.5 inches, with the largest sampled at 20 inches. Yellow Perch are important forage for Walleyes and Northern Pike, and the numbers were in line with similar lakes and past surveys of Garfield Lake. The average size was small at 6.3 inches, with few perch over 8 inches. <br> \n\tNorthern Pike numbers have been above the normal range for similar lakes, and were again in 2015. The average size was 19.9 inches and 1.6 lbs, and has been steady since 1995 at 19-21 inches. <br> \n\tAngling for panfish is popular on Garfield Lake. Only two Black Crappies were sampled, but this is similar to past surveys. The fish that were sampled were great size for anglers, both over 10 inches in length. Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds were sampled in slightly lower numbers than recent years.  Most sunfish were 3.5-6.5 inches, with fish up to 8.8 inches. <br> \n\tLargemouth Bass were sampled in higher numbers than previous years.  The average size was 13.7 inches, with fish sampled up to 17 inches. <br> \n\tCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Garfield. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Garfield Lake is located in northeastern Hubbard County, adjacent to the town of Laporte.  Garfield Lake has a surface area of 979 acres and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  There is a city-owned public access located on the southwest shore of the lake.  Garfield Lake supports good  populations of walleye and northern pike.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Garfield Lake is in lake class 27.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Upper Bottle, Fish Hook, and Lake George.Good numbers of walleye were sampled in the 2000 survey.  The walleye gillnet catch rate of 7.0 walleye/gillnet is at the upper end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class and above the management goal of 5.0 walleye/net.  The previous survey in 1995 had a similar walleye gillnet catch rate.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 17.3 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleye growth rates were fast when compared to other area lakes.  Walleye growth was aided by an abundant yellow perch forage base in Garfield. Walleye fry stocking appears to be contributing to the walleye population in Garfield.  Age analysis showed 67% of the walleye sample corresponding to years of stocking.  Garfield is stocked with walleye fry in even years.  Fall electrofishing was conducted for the first time on Garfield and the abundance of young-of-the-year walleye (YOY) was very high (92 YOY walleye/hour).   The high numbers of YOY walleye are speculated to be from the walleye fry stocking in the spring of 2000. Garfield has an abundant northern pike population.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 10.6 northern pike/gillnet is above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Garfield has excellent northern pike spawning habitat which accounts for good reproduction and survival of pike.  The whole south bay has preferred northern pike spawning habitat of shallow water with submerged aquatic vegetation. Lots of \"hammer handle\"size pike are present in Garfield, with pike averaging 20.3 inches and 1.75 pounds.  The number of larger pike (> 28 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes. Garfield is known for more \"quality\" than \"quantity\" when it comes to it's panfish and largemouth bass populations.  Black crappie were sampled in low to moderate numbers during spring electrofishing (20.4 crappie/hour) and during the summer survey (0.83 crappie/gillnet).  Black crappie were nice-sized with an average length of 10.5 inches.  Bluegill abundance in Garfield has fluctuated from low to high numbers.  The bluegill trapnet catch rate of 4.0 bluegill/trapnet is below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Bluegill abundance was much higher in 1995 (24.8 bluegill/net), while earlier surveys had bluegill abundance similar to the 2000 survey.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time on Garfield and catch rates for largemouth bass were low (3.6 bass/hour).  While the largemouth bass numbers are low in Garfield, anglers have reported catching some large fish.Other species sampled in moderate numbers include: black bullhead, brown bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed, and white sucker.  Yellow bullhead were sampled in low numbers.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Garfield Lake is located in northeastern Hubbard County, adjacent to the town of Labporte.  Garfield Lake has a surface area of 979 acres and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  There is a city-owned public access located on the southwest shore of the lake.  Garfield is a popular lake for walleye and northern pike fishing, but also provides angling opportunities for panfish and largemouth bass.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Garfield is in lake class 27.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Upper Bottle, Fish Hook, and Lake George.Walleye abundance (6.3 walleye/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but just short of the management goal of 7.0 walleye/gillnet.  The two previous surveys in 1995 and 2000 had slightly higher walleye gillnet catch rates, at or just above the management goal.  While multiple year classes and sizes of walleye were sampled, a large 2002 year class (12-13 inch walleye) dominated the catch.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 14.4 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Walleye exhibited good growth rates when compared to other area lakes.  An abundant yellow perch forage base in Garfield aided walleye growth.  Walleye fry stocking by the DNR is contributing heavily to the walleye population in Garfield.  While natural reproduction is occurring in Garfield, age analysis showed that 75% of the walleye sample corresponded to years of walleye fry stocking.  Starting in 2005 Garfield Lake will be stocked annually with 500,000 walleye fry.  Prior to 2005, Garfield was stocked biannually with walleye fry.Garfield Lake has an abundant northern pike population.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 14.7 pike/gillnet is well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to recent surveys.  Garfield Lake has excellent northern pike spawning habitat that accounts for good reproduction and survival of pike.  The whole south bay has preferred northern pike spawning habitat of shallow water with submerged aquatic vegetation.  Lots of \"hammer handle\" size pike are present in Garfield, with sampled pike averaging 20.9 inches and 2.1 pounds.  The number of larger pike (> 28 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes.Garfield Lake is probably known more for \"quality\" than \"quantity\" when it comes to its panfish and largemouth bass populations.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers for all gear types.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 10-12 inch size range.  Bluegill abundance (28.2 bluegill/trapnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Bluegill abundance in Garfield Lake has fluctuated from low to moderate levels since the 1995 survey, while earlier surveys had very low bluegill abundance.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the second time on Garfield Lake and catch rates for largemouth bass were low (8.1 bass/hour), similar to the 2000 survey.  While the largemouth bass numbers are low in Garfield Lake, anglers have reported catching some large fish.Other species sampled in moderate numbers included: rock bass, white sucker, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, burbot (eelpout), and bowfin (dogfish).  Black bullhead were sampled in low numbers.</p>",
