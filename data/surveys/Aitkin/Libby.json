The trap net index for largemouth bass is below the first regional quartile. Northern pike ranged from one to eight plus years of age with a strong year class in 1984. The growth rates for the second, third, seventh and eighth increments ranged from thirty-one percent to eighty-six percent slower than normal. The growth rates for the fifth increment was forty- five percent faster than normal and the sixth increment sixty-two percent faster than normal. The first and fourth growth increments were normal. Bluegill ranged from one to eight years of age with strong year classes in 1987 and 1986. The second and eight growth increments were faster than normal. The sixth and seventh growth increments were slower than normal. It should be noted that only one fish was aged beyond the sixth years of age and may not be representative of the population. The remainder of the growth increments showed normal growth. Black crappie ranged two to eight plus years of age. The eighth growth increment was thirty-six percent slower than normal. The remainder of the growth increments showed normal growth. Yellow perch ranged from two to seven years of age with strong year classes in 1983, 1985 and 1986. The first, fifth and sixth growth increments ranged from twenty-seven to forty-four percent slower than normal. The seventh growth increment was forty-three percent faster than normal. The remainder of the growth increments showed normal growth. Walleye ranged from two to four years of age. The first growth increment was thirty-nine percent slower than normal. The fourth growth increment was 211 percent faster than normal. While the indicator net for the black bullhead is the trap net, gillnet catches were very high, greatly exceeding the third regional quartile for gillnet catches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted gill net only survey was conducted on Aitkin Lake during the week of 7/10/2023 to monitor Walleye abundance and to coincide with the ongoing Walleye population estimate and Walleye movement study on connected Big Sandy Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nAitkin Lake is just north of Big Sandy Lake, connected via the Aitkin Lake Flowage. This natural channel from Big Sandy (~2 miles long and varying in width) is navigable, but can be quite narrow at times, especially in years of high wild rice production. Water level in Aitkin Lake is controlled at the Corps of Engineers dam on the Sandy River. Open water access to Aitkin Lake is either from Big Sandy Lake or Aitkin Lake Resort, which is the only major development on the lake. In winter, some anglers also access the lake via state lands on the east side of the lake. With the exception of some parcels in the southwest end and north side of the lake, most of the shoreline is in state ownership. Most of Aitkin Lake is shallow, heavily vegetated with wild rice, and is subject to frequent partial winterkills. A 30 foot deep basin at the northeast end of the lake maintains some oxygen in the winter and prevents total winterkills. As such, the surviving fish in the population generally exhibit faster growth rates, which often create a high quality fishery. Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch appear to be the primary species anglers seek on Aitkin Lake and it is managed primarily for Bluegill. There are special regulations for Sunfish (5 daily limit) and Walleye (14-18 inch harvest slot, with one allowed over 26 inches) for the entire Big Sandy system, including Aitkin Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring the 2023 survey, Walleye abundance was low with only 6 fish sampled, which is normal for Aitkin Lake. The Walleyes sampled in 2023 had an average size of 17.8 inches and 1.4 pounds, with a maximum length of 25.8 inches. Fifty percent of walleye sampled in 2023 were greater than or equal to 18 inches in length, which is more than what was observed in the 2023 Big Sandy Lake GN sample (3% ? 18 inches). Conversely, no fish under 12 inches were observed in Aitkin Lake, whereas nearly half of the 2023 sample from the Big Sandy survey were less than 12 inches.  Very limited spawning habitat and frequent winterkills are restricting Walleye reproduction and survival. It is likely that the Walleye population in Aitkin Lake is dependent upon larger fish emigrating from Big Sandy Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were common in the 2023 survey and had comparable catch rates to similar lakes. The Northern Pike sampled in 2023 had an average size of 20 inches and 1.7 pounds, with fish up to 32.3 inches observed in the sample. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the most abundant species sampled in Aitkin Lake. Yellow Perch abundance was within the normal range of similar lakes. The average size was 7.4 inches, and the largest observed was 10.8 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was low with only 3 fish sampled and was below the normal range when compared to similar lakes. Among the 3 fish sampled, the average length was 7.6 inches, and the maximum length was 8.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance is typically estimated using trap net catches instead of gill nets, however the sizes of the few fish that were sampled were decent with an average length of 7.9 inches and included 1 fish greater than 10 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish have become more prevalent in Aitkin and Big Sandy Lakes in recent years. This species has likely become present in Aitkin and Big Sandy Lakes due to the significant flooding in 2012, and later in 2022, when the Mississippi River and Big Sandy were also the same elevation. Five Channel Catfish were sampled in the 2023 survey compared to 1 in the 2016 survey. The average length in 2023 was 21 inches, with the largest fish measuring 27.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker, Shorthead Redhorse, Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), and a few Largemouth Bass were also sampled during this survey. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Aitkin Lake is just north of Big Sandy Lake, connected via the Aitkin Lake Flowage. This natural channel from Big Sandy (~2 miles long and varying in width) is navigable, but can be quite narrow at times, especially in years of high wild rice production.  Water level in Aitkin Lake is controlled at the Corps of Engineers dam on the Sandy River.  Open water access to Aitkin Lake is either from Big Sandy Lake or Aitkin Lake Resort, which is the only major development on the lake.  In winter, some anglers also access the lake via state lands on the east and west sides of the lake. With the exception of some parcels in the southwest end and north side of the lake, most of the shoreline is in state ownership.  Most of Aitkin Lake is shallow, heavily vegetated with wild rice, and is subject to frequent partial winterkills.  Based on age distributions of the fish, it appears that the last harsh kill occurred in winter 2001-2002.  A 30 foot deep basin at the northeast end of the lake maintains some oxygen and prevents total winterkills.  As such, the surviving fish in the population generally exhibit faster growth rates, which often create a high quality fishery.  Bluegill and yellow perch appear to be the primary species anglers seek on Aitkin Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSince the last survey, bluegill abundance has increased to a level above the statewide median for this lake class.  The average size bluegill sampled in the trap nets was 7.5 inches.  Black crappie abundance was low and may be limited by poor survival of young during partial winterkill periods.   <br> \n <br> \n Walleye abundance was low with only 4 fish sampled.  Very limited spawning habitat and frequent winterkills are restricting walleye reproduction and survival.  Northern pike were common in both gill and trap nets but were small and slow growing.  Lack of small perch prey and high density of plant cover may be inhibiting the growth of northern pike.  Yellow perch were the most abundant species sampled and within the normal range for this lake type.  About 45% of the perch were greater than 8 inches and may be of interest to anglers.  Shorthead redhorse, yellow and brown bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), and a few largemouth bass were also caught during the survey. <br> \n</p>",

The near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (14 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish IBI for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations, but three sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing. A 50-foot seine was not used, a 15-foot seine was used at 11 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 3 sites. Nearshore sampling captured one intolerant fish species, the Iowa darter. <br> \n <br> \nAitkin lake falls within lake class 35 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 5 lakes for evaluating IBI data. IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 24 (CI 9-39) and the potential exceptional quality level is set at 61. The IBI score, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2016 standard assessment, calculated from this survey was 43 and is above the threshold.  <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Aitkin Lake is located in the Mississippi River - Grand Rapids Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Aitkin Lake drains into Big Sandy Lake through a 200 foot wide natural channel (Aitkin Lake Flowage). Much of the boat traffic on Aitkin Lake comes from Big Sandy Lake. Aitkin Lake Resort also provides a launching site for anglers and other boaters. Larger than average bluegills are one of Aitkin Lake'sbest features. Most of the angling occurs around the bulrushes at points and bars, and the bulrushareas must be protected to maintain the fishery. Other fisheries include black crappie, walleye,largemouth bass and northern pike fisheries. On several occasions the survey crew observed largemouth bass anglers in the channel between Aitkin Lake and Big Sandy Lake.Most of Aitkin Lake is shallow and is subject to frequent partial winterkills. A 30 foot deep basin atthe northeast end of the lake maintains oxygen during most winters and prevents total winterkills. Thissurvey revealed the effects of the partial winterkills. Bluegill and black crappie populations are low, but their growth rates are above normal. Recruitment of sunfish appears to be limited and the fish werelarger than normal. Sunfish recruitment may be limited by poor survival of young sunfish during partialwinterkill periods.Northern pike are small and slow growing; most northerns were between 16 and 19 inches long. Lack ofcentrarchid prey may be inhibiting the growth of northern pike. Yellow perch abundance is normal for lakes of this type, and the population includes a fair number of fish above 8 inches. The perch are abundant enough to support good growth for northern pike, but northern pike don't seem to take advantage of this. Dense vegetation and dark water may be inhibiting the northern pike's ability tocapture yellow perch.Walleye catch has remained at 0.7 fish per gill net in the last three surveys. Very limited spawning habitat and frequent partial winterkills are restricting walleye reproduction and survival.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on August 15, 2016 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations with four sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at six sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Blacknose Shiner and Iowa Darter).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in July 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Aitkin Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and indicates a healthy fish community. Data from this survey will be included as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Mississippi River - Grand Rapids watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Aitkin Lake is connected to Big Sandy Lake via the Aitkin Lake Flowage (a 200 foot wide natural channel).  Access to Aitkin Lake is either from Big Sandy Lake or Aitkin Lake Resort.  Larger than average bluegills are one of Aitkin Lake's notable features.  Most of the angling occurs around the bulrushes at points and bars, and the bulrush areas must be protected to maintain the fishery.Most of Aitkin Lake is shallow and subject to frequent winterkills.  A 30 foot deep basin at the northeast end of the lake maintains oxygen and prevents total winterkills.  Since the last survey black crappie abundance has increased to a level above the state average.  The typical black crappie sampled in the trap nets was 10 inches.  Bluegill abundance was low but the fish were larger than normal.  Sunfish abundance may be limited by poor survival of young sunfish during partial winterkill periods.   Walleye abundance has increased slightly (0.7 to 1.17) per gill net lift during this last survey.  Very limited spawning habitat and frequent winterkills are restricting walleye reproduction and survival.  Northern pike were common in both gill and trap nets but were small and slow growing.  Lack of small perch prey and high density of plant cover may be inhibiting the growth of northern pike.  Yellow perch were the most abundant species sampled and within the normal range for this lake type.  About 45% of the perch were greater than 8 inches and may be of interest to anglers.  Tullibee, white sucker, and both yellow and black bullheads were caught during the survey in gill nets.  Their abundances were slightly less than average but within the normal range for this lake type.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Aitkin Lake is just north of Big Sandy Lake, connected via the Aitkin Lake Flowage. This natural channel from Big Sandy (~2 miles long and varying in width) is navigable, but can be quite narrow at times, especially in years of high wild rice production. Water level in Aitkin Lake is controlled at the Corps of Engineers dam on the Sandy River. Open water access to Aitkin Lake is either from Big Sandy Lake or Aitkin Lake Resort, which is the only major development on the lake. In winter, some anglers also access the lake via state lands on the east side of the lake. With the exception of some parcels in the southwest end and north side of the lake, most of the shoreline is in state ownership. Most of Aitkin Lake is shallow, heavily vegetated with wild rice, and is subject to frequent partial winterkills. A 30 foot deep basin at the northeast end of the lake maintains some oxygen and prevents total winterkills. As such, the surviving fish in the population generally exhibit faster growth rates, which often create a high quality fishery. Bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch appear to be the primary species anglers seek on Aitkin Lake.  <br> \nSince the last survey, bluegill abundance has decreased to a level below the statewide median for this lake class, and back within the historical range for Aitkin Lake. Although the average size bluegill sampled in the trap nets was 5.9 inches, several quality sized individuals were observed. Anglers should be aware of the 5 fish limit for sunfish, which was implemented to protect this quality fishery.   <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was within the normal range for this lake class, but is often limited by poor survival during partial winterkill periods.  <br> \nWalleye abundance was low with only 5 fish sampled, which is normal for Aitkin Lake. Very limited spawning habitat and frequent winterkills are restricting walleye reproduction and survival. It is likely that walleye in Aitkin are dependent upon fish emigrating from Big Sandy Lake.  Similar to sunfish, there is an experimental regulation for walleye (14-18 inch harvest slot, with one allowed over 26\") for the entire Big Sandy system, including Aitkin Lake.   <br> \nNorthern pike were common in both gill and trap nets, but were small.  <br> \nYellow perch were the most abundant species sampled in the gill nets and were within the normal range for this lake type. The average size was 7.0 inches, and the largest was 11.2 inches long.  <br> \nA channel catfish was observed for the first time in survey history.  This species has likely become present in Aitkin and Big Sandy lake due to the significant flooding in 2012. White sucker, yellow and brown bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), and a few largemouth bass were also caught during the survey. <br> \n</p>",
