                "narrative": "<p>Hyland Lake is an 84-acre lake with an average depth of 5 feet and maximum depth of 12 feet. The lake is part of the Hyland Lakes Park Reserve in the city of Bloomington in southern Hennepin County. Due to shallow water depths, an aerator is operated during winter months to prevent winter kill. Hyland is actively managed for Largemouth Bass, with secondary emphasis on Bluegill. Hyland also supports catchable populations of Black Crappie. Public water access is provided by the Three Rivers Park District on the northwest side of the lake off East Bush Lake Road (up to 3 vehicle/trailer parking spaces, overflow parking is also available). Surface use restrictions require the operation of electric motors. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey (9 trap nets/4 gill nets) was completed on Hyland Lake during the week of 6/6/2023 to monitor water quality and fish populations. Water color was brown/green, with low-moderate water clarity, measured at 5.0 feet during the time of this survey. Despite low-moderate water clarity, oxygen was 13.4 parts per million (ppm) at a bottom depth of 8 feet, meaning fish were able to use the entire water column during our summer survey. Hyland Lake is one of the few metro lakes that does not appear on the infested waters list. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Largemouth Bass were sampled during spring 2023 with nighttime boat electrofishing (139 fish/hour). There were 163 bass sampled, with an average length of 10.2 inches and the largest measured at 19.8 inches. The current population appears well balanced (a middle ground between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish). Despite high numbers, multiple fish were sampled greater than 18 inches, demonstrating the potential for these fish to reach desirable sizes. While small bass may be numerous, the opportunity to catch large (>18\") fish in Hyland Lake remains high. <br> \n <br> \nVery high numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (94.3/net), well above the expected catch rate of similar metro lakes. There were 849 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2023 survey, with an average length of 5.8 inches, and the largest measured at 7.7 inches. Less than 7% of the total Bluegill sampled were greater than 7 inches. Although Bluegill are abundant, relatively few large fish can be found in Hyland Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (2.3/net) and trap nets (4.1/net) below the expected catch rate of similar metro lakes. Historically, Hyland Lake has always had low numbers of Black Crappie. There were 46 Black Crappie sampled during the 2023 survey, with an average length of 6.7 inches, and the largest measured at 9.1 inches. The current Black Crappie population consists of low numbers and small sizes and likely provides little interest to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Walleye, and White Sucker.</p>",

SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY-THREE (763) LARGEMOUTH FINGERLINGS WERE STOCKED IN FALL 1990. WITH A TRAPNET INDEX OF 107.8/SET BLUEGILLS WERE 5.1 AND 9.2 TIMES LOCAL AND STATE MEDIANS.  A PSD OF 12.4 IS ABOUT ONE-QUARTER THE PSD'S SEEN IN 198 6 (53.6) AND 1988 (53.0).  NO BLUEGILLS 7 IN OR LARGER WERE SAMPLED.  THOUGH GROWTH IS CONSIDERED MODERATE, 1990 LENGTHS AT AGES 3 AND OLDER ARE LESS THAN THOSE SAMPLED IN BOTH 1988 AND 1986. BLACK CRAPPIE NUMBERS WERE AT THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN AND HALF OF THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR BOTH GILLNET AND TRAPNET MEASURES.  MODAL SIZE OF CRAPPIES WAS 6.0-6.4 IN.  BLACK BULLHEADS WERE PRESENT IN GILLNETS AND TRAPNETS AT TWICE THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN.  GILLNET ABUNDANCE WAS 38% OF THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND TRAPNET ABUNDANCE EQUALLED THE LOCAL MEDIAN.

                "narrative": "<p>Hyland Lake is an 84-acre shallow lake in Bloomington.  The lake is located entirely within a Three Rivers Park.  A boat launch and fishing pier are located on the northwest shore of the lake.  A walking trail leads along the shore of lake, providing ample shore fishing and recreational opportunities.  Parking for vehicles with trailers is available with a fee; however, all other vehicle parking is free.  No gas motors are permitted on Hyland; boating is limited to electric motors only.  Canoes and other boats can be rented from the park. <br> \n <br> \nHyland Lake supports healthy populations of good-sized Largemouth Bass and Walleye.  Twenty-inch bass were sampled during the nighttime sampling during the spring of 2018.  Eighteen percent of the bass were larger than 16 inches.  Fish were present in all length groups between 6 inches and 21 inches, showing that the fish are consistently reproducing.  The gill net catch rate of Walleye is at an all-time high, and the fish tend to be larger.  The average size of Walleye sampled in 2018 was 18.1 inches and 2.18 pounds.  Walleye in Hyland Lake originated from planned DNR stocking, and the fish do not naturally reproduce in this lake, typical for most metro lakes containing walleye. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie are abundant in Hyland, although the fish tend to be smaller.  Eighty-three percent of the trap-netted Bluegill were between 5.0 and 6.5 inches, and only 5% exceeded 6.5 inches.  Ninety percent of the gill netted Black Crappie were between 6.5 and 7.5 inches, and only 5% exceeded 7.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in the lake include Black Bullhead, Yellow Perch, and White Sucker, which serve primarily as the forage base for predator species, but also provide angling opportunity. <br> \n</p>",

Largemouth bass were sampled in above average numbers during electrofishing, but the average size was only 7.6\" in length. Quality bass are in the system as fish up to 20.4 inches in length were measured during this assessment of the fish population. Four Hybrid Muskellunge were also captured, but age and growth analysis indicates a slow growth rate for this species in Hyland Lake. Bluegill were sampled in very high numbers and over 40.0% of the individuals measured 7.0 inches or more in length. Black crappie average about 8.0 inches in length and were captured in less abundance than in 1991. Black bullhead are also present in relatively low numbers but above average size (11.0\" in length).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hyland is a shallow, productive, 84-acre lake located in Bloomington.  It is surrounded by the Hyland Lake Park Reserve operated by the Three Rivers Park District.  There is an accessible fishing pier and boat launch, though gas-motorized boats are not allowed to operate on the lake.  Originally Hyland Lake was a wetland that experienced annual winterkills, however water levels were raised by an earthen dike and aeration was installed to create a permanent fishery.  Despite these efforts, the lake has experienced a partial winterkill in 1989-90 due to equipment malfunction and has experienced partial summerkills due to abundant curly-leaf pondweed.  This lake is primarily managed for largemouth bass and bluegill, yet it also contains some black crappie and walleye.      <br> \n <br> \nHistorically bluegill have dominated the fish community.  In the 2008 population assessment, bluegill were again the most abundant species.  Trap nets caught an average of 125 per lift, which is over 12 times higher than the median net catch for similar lakes in the state.  The average length was 6.1 inches with the largest fish reaching 7.4 inches, 58% were 6 inches or longer.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the sample, 59% were either age 4 or 5.  Growth was somewhat slower than average for metro lakes until age 5, then it increased slightly to above average.   <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  That said, only 2 largemouth bass were collected during the 2008 assessment measuring 13.7 inches and 1.3 pounds and 16.9 inches and 2.8 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled in moderately low abundance, at a rate 3 per gill net and 3 per trap net, which is similar to the 2002 assessment (5.5 per gill net, 1 per trap net).  Ages 2 through 4 were represented in the sample; 42% were age 3 and 29% were age 4.  Growth of black crappie was near average compared to other class similar lakes in the West Metro Area. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked in Hyland Lake on an alternate year basis since 2004, including fingerlings in 2008.  Walleye abundance was low; seven were sampled averaging 18.4 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Five of the walleye sampled were age 5 and one was age 6, these fish are likely from the 135 adults stocked in 2006.  The remaining walleye was age 4, from the original 2004 stocking.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional fish species sampled in low abundance were black bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hyland is a shallow, productive 84-acre lake located in Bloomington, in Hennepin County.  The entire lake is within the Hyland Lake Park Reserve, operated by Three Rivers Park District.  There is a fishing pier and boat launch (a fee exists for boat trailer parking), though gas-motorized boats are not allowed to operate on the lake. There are also multiple locations to fish from shore.  <br> \n <br> \nWater quality in Hyland Lake has improved over the years, in part because of Three Rivers Park District's efforts to control curly-leaf pondweed.  Since 2011, declines in total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a have been documented.  Additionally, Secchi disk measurements indicate water clarity has increased over the past few years.  However, the lake's shallow, fertile characteristics still make it prone to occasional small-scale fish die-offs related to thermal or oxygen stress.   <br> \n  <br> \nThis lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill, yet it also contains some Black Crappie and Walleye.  Past management has included: hybrid (tiger) Muskellunge stocking from 1988-1999 and a Largemouth Bass no-harvest slot of 12-16 inches from 1981-1993.  Because of the lake's thermal and oxygen limitations (which included a partial winterkill in 1989-90), these efforts did not establish viable Muskellunge populations or better-quality Largemouth Bass fishing.  A standard population assessment consisting of gill nets and trap nets was conducted in 2013 to characterize the game fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill was the most abundant species in the assessment.  At 35.5 per trap net, abundance was high and ranked near the 75th percentile value compared with other similar lakes.  Hyland Lake has had consistently abundant Bluegill populations, but with variable size structures.  In 2013, the size structure was weighted toward larger fish, where 42% were between 7.0 and 7.5 inches.  Bluegill ranged from 3.4-8.1 inches, averaging 6.7 inches and weighing 0.2 lbs.  Bluegill in Hyland Lake are long-lived; 26% were older than 10 years and the oldest was age 15.  Growth was similar to the statewide average, where Bluegill were 6.9 inches by age 5.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were low in trap-net abundance (0.63/net) and moderately low in gill-net abundance (3.3/net).  Crappie ranged from 4.0 to 9.4 inches, averaging 5.7 inches and 0.2 lbs.  Historically, Black Crappie abundances have been moderately low in Hyland Lake.  Over the previous 5 assessments, crappie catch has ranged from 1.0 to 5.5 per gill net, averaging 3.7/net.  Given the small sample size of Black Crappie in this assessment, ages were only determined for a few fish.  Similar to Bluegill, several crappie were long-lived.  Two reached age 12; however the larger of these two was only 8.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSince 2004, Hyland Lake has regularly been stocked with Walleye fingerlings and/or yearlings on even-numbered years.  Despite this, Walleye abundance is low.  In the previous assessment (2008), 5 Walleye (1.3 per gill net) were sampled.  In the 2013 assessment, 11 Walleye (2.8 per gill net) were sampled.  In this most current 2013 assessment, all Walleye were exclusively from the two most recent stockings:  fingerlings in 2010 (age 3 fish) and yearlings in 2012 (age 2).  These represented 75% and 25% of the total, respectively.  No fish stocked in 2004, 2006, or 2008 were sampled.  Walleye ranged from 10.7 to 16.3 inches, averaging 13.8 inches.  Mean weight was 0.8 lbs, moderately low when compared to other similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNo Northern Pike were sampled in the 2013 assessment.  Other fishes sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, White Sucker, Yellow Perch, and Largemouth Bass.  Passive sampling gear, such as the trap and gill nets used here, are not effective methods for collecting Largemouth Bass, so the 2013 assessment values likely under-represents bass abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for  <br> \nLargemouth Bass assessments but was not conducted.      <br> \n <br> \nBeginning in the winter of 2012-13, Three Rivers Park District has a permit to pump water from Hyland Lake for snow-making operations.  This could affect water levels and ice thicknesses.  Be aware and heed any signs and information related to Hyland Lake winter access/travel. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hyland Lake is shallow, productive basin covering 84 acres.  Originally a wetland that winterkilled fish annually, water levels were raised by an earthen dike and aeration installed to create a permanent fishery.  Despite these efforts, the lake experienced a partial winterkill in 1989-90 due to equipment malfunction and has experienced partial summerkills due to abundant curly-leaf pondweed.  Black crappie averaged 7.33 per gill net and 1.0 per trap net.  Eighteen percent of the gill net sample exceeded 8 inches, while 44% from trap nets were greater than 8 inches.  The 2000 year-class is strong, comprising 84% of the sample.  Bluegill in Hyland Lake averaged 5.9 inches in length, and no individuals sampled exceeded 7 inches.  Growth is slow, with bluegill averaging 6.0 inches at age 5.  Trap nets found a mean of 19.9 bluegill per lift, which falls between the lake class median and upper quartile.  Seven largemouth bass were sampled in trap nets.  Mean length was 7.1 inches, although the largest measured 12.9 inches.  Growth appears to be similar to lake class averages.Also sampled in this survey were black bullheads, yellow perch, golden shiners, and hybrid sunfish.</p>",
