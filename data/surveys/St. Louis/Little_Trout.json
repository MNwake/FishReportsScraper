                "narrative": "<p>Little Trout Lake is located within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) within the Superior National Forest and is a non-motorized lake.  It sits just east of the north arm of Trout Lake which is north of Lake Vermilion.  It is accessed by three different portages and one water connection from Trout Lake, although beaver dams may be present.  Little Trout is a 538 acre lake with a maximum depth of 37 feet and relatively clear water.  Shorelines are made up of mostly sand with some rubble, gravel, ledgerock, and boulder.  \n\nA total of nine different species were sampled: yellow perch (41%), walleye (15%), bluegill (15%), northern pike (12%), tullibee (11%), smallmouth bass (2%), white sucker (2%), pumpkinseed (1%), and rock bass (1%).\n\nThe walleye catch rate of 7.4 fish/gill net was above the historic average of 6.6 fish/net.  Average length was 16 inches and the largest walleye sampled was 26 inches.  Growth was slow when compared to other lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.  The oldest walleye in the sample was 14 years old and 24 inches long.\n\nThe northern pike catch rate of 5.9 fish/gill net was the highest catch rate on record for Little Trout Lake.  Length ranged from 16 to 34 inches with an average of 23 inches.  Growth was slightly better than the area average.  Ages ranged from 2 to 8 years with 75% of the fish being age 4 or younger and generally under 24 inches long.\n\nNine smallmouth bass were sampled for a catch rate of 1.0 fish/net which is close to average for this type of lake.  Sizes were good as fish ranged from 14 to 19 inches with an average of 16 inches.  Additionally the average weight was 2.5 lbs.  All fish that were aged were found to be 7 years old.\n\nA good bluegill population was sampled for the first time ever on Little Trout Lake.  The catch rate was 7.3 fish/net.  Bluegill sizes were quite impressive, ranging from 4 to 10 inches with an average of 7 inches.  The average was also 0.4 lb/fish.  Of all the bluegill sampled, 24 (36%) were 9 inches or larger.  \n\nYellow Perch numbers have historically been high on Little Trout Lake although, sizes are somewhat small.  In 2013 the catch rate was 20.0 fish/net and sizes ranged from 5 to 10 inches with an average of 7 inches.\n\nThe tullibee numbers in Little Trout seem to be dropping with 2013 having the lowest catch rate on record at 5.7 fish/net.  Sizes were decent though with an average length of 15 inches and average weight of 1.4 lbs/fish.  Lengths ranged from 13 to 17 inches.\n</p>",
