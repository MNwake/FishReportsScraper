                "narrative": "<p>Armstrong Lake is located approximately 7 miles SW of Ely. There is a boat ramp with a dock and parking lot for public access located on the NW side of the lake off Highway 169. Armstrong has good water clarity and aquatic vegetation is common near shore. Most of the shoreline is privately owned and no campsites are present. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2015 were sampled using gill nets, trap nets and night electrofishing. Eleven species of fish were sampled with northern pike, bluegill and largemouth bass most common. Moderate numbers of black crappie and low numbers of walleye were also present. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2015 were above average compared to other similar lakes in the area and higher than the historic average of 4.8/gill net on this lake. The average pike sampled in the gill nets was 21 inches long which is similar to the past. The largest pike sampled was 37.2 inches long. Twenty percent of the pike sampled were 25 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2015 were above average compared to similar lakes in the area and slightly lower than the historic average on this lake. Bluegill sizes were good. The largest bluegill sampled was 9 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass in 2015 were sampled in abundance by electrofishing and the gill net catch was also above average. Bass caught by electrofishing had an average length of 11 inches and the largest sampled was 18 inches long. Thirty-eight percent of the largemouth sampled from electrofishing were 12 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance in 2015 was above average compared to past surveys. Crappies were found at the size anglers like to keep. Crappie typically have boom and bust cycles driven by a few strong year classes, so fishing success can vary widely across the years. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2015 were the lowest on record for survey. The average walleye sampled was 22 inches long and about 8 years old. The largest walleye sampled was almost 30 inches long. Walleye fry have been stocked on even-numbered years since 2004. Because of the low success in fry stocking, the walleye stocking strategy on Armstrong may be changed to fingerling stocking in the future. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass and yellow perch were sampled in low relative abundances. Smallmouth up to 18 inches were sampled and the average perch sampled was over 6 inches long. Rock bass numbers are above average compared to other similar lakes in the area. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Armstrong Lake is a 382 acre lake located 10 miles west of Ely.  It is accessed by a concrete ramp off Hwy 169.  The lake has a maximum depth of 34 feet and clear water at the time of this survey.   <br> \n <br> \nOn August 9, 2021 the lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 72 F and a bottom temperature of 54 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 27 feet where the temperature was 57 F.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly gravel, rubble, and sand.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 14 feet. <br> \n <br> \nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 15.8 fish/net which was the lowest catch rate on record for the lake.  Yield was 24.5 lbs/net which was the second lowest of past surveys on the lake.  Fish species sampled were walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, bluegill, largemouth bass, white sucker, black crappie, rock bass, smallmouth bass, and pumpkinseed.  Trap nets caught fish at an overall rate of 21.4 fish/net which was the second lowest on record for the lake.  Yield was 6.1 lbs/net which was average compared to past catches on the lake.  The catch was dominated by bluegill with no additional species sampled in trap nets that weren't also sampled in gill nets.  <br> \n <br> \nForty walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 4.4 fish/net, which was just below average compared to other similar lakes but the highest catch rate since the 1997 survey.  Walleye lengths ranged from 10 to over 26 inches with an average of nearly 19 inches.  The average weight was impressive at over 2 pounds which was better than most other similar lakes in the state.  Walleye growth was good with the average fish measuring 16 inches at four years old.  Ages ranged from 2 to 9 years with the 2016 year class representing 55% of the total catch.  When stocked years were compared against non-stocked years, 32 of the 38 aged fish (84%) came from a year class where stocking occurred.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 3.3 fish/net which was the lowest since the 1987 survey but just above average compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 16 to 34.5 inches with an average over 21 inches.  Sizes were on par with previous surveys. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night electrofishing was used for the second time on Armstrong for bass sampling.  On the night of June 2nd, three electrofishing stations were sampled with each station being fished for 30 minutes.  One-hundred fifty total bass were captured in 1.5 hours of on-time for a total catch rate of 100.0 fish/hour.   <br> \n <br> \nEight smallmouth were captured in the 1.5 hours of fishing for a catch rate of 5.3 fish/hour.  This was below average compared to other area smallmouth lakes.  Lengths ranged from 4 to nearly 17 inches with an average of 10 inches.  Growth rates appeared relatively slow compared to other area smallmouth populations.   <br> \n <br> \nOne-hundred forty-two largemouth bass were captured during electrofishing for a catch rate of 94.7 fish/hour.  This ranked 5th out of 29 recent electrofishing surveys on area largemouth lakes.  Fifteen additional largemouth were captured in gill nets (1.7 fish/net) and 17 were also caught in trap nets (1.9 fish/net).  Both of these catch rates were very good when compared to other similar largemouth lakes.  The widest range of sizes came from the elctrofishing sample with a range from 6 to 17 inches and an average of 12 inches.  Like the smallmouth, growth rates appeared relatively slow compared to other area largemouth populations.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnet catch was 16.7 fish/net which was above average compared to other similar lakes but below average compared to past surveys on Armstrong Lake.  Sizes ranged from 3 to over 8 inches with an average of 5 inches.  Ages ranged from 3 to 11 years with strong representation (over 48% of the total catch) coming from the 2016 year class.  Growth was quite slow with the average fish taking 8 years to reach 6 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nNineteen yellow perch were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 2.1 fish/net which was below average compared to other similar lakes and below average for Armstrong Lake.  Sizes were small but similar to past surveys with a maximum size of 7 inches and an average of 6 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Armstrong Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are average-sized, have shorelines that drop off quickly, and have clear and soft (unmineralized) water.Armstrong Lake partially stratifies thermally in midsummer and retains good oxygen (2 ppm) to a depth of about 25 ft, at which depth the temperature is about 60 F.  There is a small inlet from Robinson Lake and an outlet to Lake Vermilion which has an upstream spawning run of sucker each spring.  The lake bottom along the shoreline is mostly gravel, sand, and rubble.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 12 ft in a sparse, narrow fringe along the shoreline, with dense beds at the east and west ends of the lake.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1997 of 32 fish/net (39 lb/net) was normal for this lake class and was similar to the long term average catch of 37 fish/net (38 lb/net) for all seven surveys and assessments on this lake, dating back to 1958.  Lake Class 5 is one of the most productive, in terms of fish numbers and biomass, in northeast Minnesota.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1997 of 63 fish/net (14 lb/net) is much higher than in previous surveys and assessments and continues a trend of increasing bluegill numbers that began with the 1992 assessment.  Increasing bluegill populations have also been observed in some other lakes in the area in recent years.Bluegill numbers in 1997 (54/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class.  Bluegill were absent in the initial 1958 survey; 3/trapnet were caught in 1982 and 23/trapnet were caught in 1992.  Bluegill sizes in 1997 averaged 6\" and only a few were 8\" or larger.  Most bluegill were from a strong 1994 year class.  Bluegill growth (5\" at age five) was slower than normal for the area.Walleye numbers in 1997 (4/gillnet) were normal for this lake class but were lower than in all previous surveys and assessments.  Most of the walleye in 1997 were from the 1992 and 1995 year classes; the lower numbers in this assessment were due to apparent year class failures in 1993 and 1994.  This age class distribution is very different than in most area walleye lakes, which had strong year classes in 1991 and 1994 and weak year classes from the cold summers of 1992 and 1993.  The average size of walleye in Armstrong Lake in 1997 (19\") was the highest on record, reflecting the lack of young, small fish.  The largest walleye was 29\" (9.0 lb).  Walleye growth (12\" at age two, 18\" at age five) was faster than normal for the area.  This growth was also faster than in previous surveys and assessments on this lake, indicating that walleye growth may be inversely dependent on their abundance.Northern pike numbers in 1997 (5/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the long term average catch of 4/gillnet for this lake.  As in previous surveys and assessments, pike sizes in 1997 were small; the largest was 28\".  Pike growth (21\" at age five) was normal for the area.  Pike from many year classes were present.Sucker numbers in 1997 (6/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the long term average catch of 5/gillnet for this lake.Yellow perch numbers in 1997 (4/gillnet) were normal for this lake class, but were lower than the long term average catch of 8/gillnet for this lake.  Perch sizes averaged 6\"; the largest was 7\".  Most perch were from a strong 1994 year class.  Perch growth (5\" at age three) was normal for the area.Black crappie numbers in 1997 (2/gillnet, 2/trapnet) were normal for this lake class but were higher than in previous surveys and assessments for both types of nets.  Crappie sizes averaged 8\"; the largest was 13\" (1.25 lb).  Most crappie caught in trapnets were from a strong 1994 year class. Most of the bluegill and many of the northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch captured in 1997 were infected with Neascus (black spot).  Many of the largemouth and smallmouth bass had bass tapeworm infections.  Neascus and bass tapeworm are parasites that do not affect the muscle, are removed by filleting, are killed by cooking, and cannot infect humans.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Armstrong Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are average in size, have shorelines that drop off quickly, and have clear and soft (unmineralized) water.Armstrong Lake was partially stratified thermally on 08/19/2002 with a surface temperature of 66 F and a bottom temperature of 54 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 28 ft, where the temperature was 60 F.  Armstrong Lake ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index, with Secchi water clarity of 2.75 m, chlorophyll-a of 3.1 ppb, and total phosphorus at or below the laboratory detection limit of 20 ppb. Inlets are from Robinson Lake and Pickerel Lake.  The outlet, to Lake Vermilion, is Armstrong Creek.  Water levels are quite stable, fluctuating about 0.7 ft annually.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly gravel, rubble, and sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 14 ft; the most common plants are sedges and sweetgale along the shoreline, and several types of pondweeds in deeper water.Twenty seven homes and cabins were present in 2002, up from 20 in 1982 and 17 in 1958 (the four cabins at the old resort are now all privately owned and are included in the above figures).  More of the dwellings in 2002 were year-round homes than in previous investigations.  Shoreland on the southwest side of the lake has been subdivided and is now being sold.   There is a public access on the northwest end of the lake.  Fishing was considered to be poor in 2002, as it was in previous fisheries lake surveys in 1982 and 1958.Fish sampling in this fisheries lake survey consisted of  nine trapnet sets, nine gillnet sets, and five shoreline seining hauls.  Seven previous investigations, dating back to 1958, each consisted of 3-9 gillnet sets.  Four of these previous investigations also used 6-10 trapnet sets.  Shoreline seining was done during the 1958 and 1982 investigations.  All of these investigations were done in August, except that trapnetting was moved to early July in 1997 and 2002 to increase catches of panfish, which are more vulnerable to trapnets early in the summer.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets has increased over time (even in 1992, prior to the move to earlier trapnetting dates), and in 2002 was 76.7 fish/net (17.4 lb/net).  Trapnet catches in 2002 were dominated by bluegill sunfish, followed by pumpkinseed sunfish and rock bass.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 2002 of 24.1 fish/net (31.2 lb/net) was in the second quartile for this lake class and was lower than the median catch of 34.9 fish/net (37.4 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 5 is one of the more productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.  Gillnet catches in 2002 were dominated by northern pike and white sucker.  Walleye numbers in 2002 were lower than normal for this lake.Bluegill numbers in 2002 (62.9/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Bluegill were not captured during the initial investigation in 1958, or the gillnet-only investigation in 1970, and were first observed in the gillnets in 1978.  Bluegill sizes in 2002 averaged 6.1\" (0.16 lb), which was at the median for this lake class.  The largest bluegill was 9.8\".  Most bluegill were ages 4-7.  Bluegill growth was slower than normal (in the first or second quartiles, depending on age) by area standards.Rock bass and pumpkinseed sunfish numbers in 2002 were both above the median for this lake class.  Pumpkinseed were first captured in this lake in 1997.Northern pike numbers in 2002 (5.4/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 4.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2002 averaged 20.6\" (2.1 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 19.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2002 was 29.2\".  Pike scales were difficult to read, but pike growth appeared to be somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.Walleye numbers in 2002 (1.3/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were the lowest ever recorded in this lake (previous range of walleye catches: 4.4-19.3/gillnet).  Walleye sizes in 2002 averaged 19.4\" (3.2 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  The largest walleye was 27.7\".  Half the walleye captured were age two, from the 2000 year class; the others were all age seven or older.  Walleye growth was faster than normal by area standards.Smallmouth bass were present in the initial investigation on this lake and have been captured in most investigations since then.  Largemouth bass were first captured in the 1982 investigation.  Bass numbers are probably higher than indicated by the standard gillnet and trapnet catches, as these species are known to be \"net-shy\".  Fair numbers of young-of-year of both species were captured in shoreline seines in 2002.  The largest smallmouth in 2002 was 16.5\", and the largest largemouth was 18.9\".  Growth of smallmouth bass was faster than normal by area standards, while growth of largemouth bass was normal.Perch numbers in 2002 (2.4/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 4.1/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2002 averaged 6.6\", the largest (caught in a trapnet) was 11.9\".Many of the game fish examined in 2002 were infected with neascus.  Some of the bass were also infected with bass tapeworm larvae in their viscera, and one of the yellow perch was infected with yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot), bass tapeworm, and yellow grub are all common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Armstrong Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that have shorelines that drop off quickly from shore, and have clear and soft (unmineralized) water.   <br> \n <br> \nArmstrong Lake was thermally stratified on 08/27/2007 with a surface temperature of 67 F and a bottom temperature of 57 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 26 ft, where the temperature was 65 F.  Armstrong Lake ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index. <br> \n <br> \nInlets to Armstrong Lake are from Robinson Lake and Pickerel Lake.  The outlet, to Lake Vermilion, is Armstrong Creek.  Water levels are quite stable, fluctuating about 0.7 ft annually.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Armstrong Lake are mostly gravel, rubble, and sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 14 ft; the most common plants are sedges and sweetgale along the shoreline, and several types of pondweeds in deeper water. <br> \n <br> \nTwenty seven homes and cabins were present in 2002, up from 20 in 1982 and 17 in 1958 (the four cabins at the old resort on the east end of the lake are now all privately owned and are included in the above figures).  More of the dwellings in 2002 were year-round homes than in previous investigations.  Shoreland on the southwest side of the lake has been subdivided and is now being developed.   There is a public access on the northwest end of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling in 2007 was done with nine gillnets and eight trapnets.  Eight previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1958, used 3-9 gillnets.  Five of these previous investigations used 6-10 trapnets.  Shoreline seines were used to sample small fish in three of the previous investigations. All of these investigations were done in August, except that trapnetting was moved to early July in 1997 and subsequent investigations in an attempt to better sample panfish populations. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets has increased over time (even in 1992, prior to the move to earlier trapnetting dates), due to an increase in bluegill numbers.  Trapnet catches in 2007 were dominated by bluegill sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish in the gillnets in 2007 of 32 fish/net (34 lb/net) was near the median for this lake class and was similar to the median catch of 32 fish/net (36 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 5 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.  Gillnet catches in 2007 were dominated by northern pike, followed by walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2007 (31.6/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Bluegill were first captured in Armstrong Lake in the 1978 gillnet investigation, and were fairly abundant by the 1992 trapnetting, which was done in August.  Bluegill sizes in 2007 averaged 5.7\" (0.14 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class.  The largest bluegill, caught in a gillnet, was 9.1\".  Most bluegill were ages 4-6.  Bluegill growth was slower than normal (in the first quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2007 (4.3/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median pike catch of 4.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2007 averaged 24.0\" (3.6 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average pike size of 20.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2007 was 34.5\".  Pike growth was somewhat faster than normal (in the third quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2007 (2.0/gillnet) were at the first quartile for this lake class and were much lower than the median walleye catch of 9.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye fry stocking was done in 2004 and 2006 in response to lower than normal walleye numbers in 1997 (4.4/gillnet) and 2002 (1.3/gillnet).  Eight of the 18 walleye captured in 2007 were from the fry-stocked 2004 year-class.  Walleye from the fry-stocked 2006 year-class may have been too small to be captured in the gillnets in 2007.  Walleye sizes in 2007 averaged 20.5\" (3.4 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  The largest walleye was 28.5\".  Walleye growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of black crappie, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass were also present in 2007.  Bass numbers are probably underestimated by the trapnet and gillnet catches, as bass are \"net-shy\" and tend to avoid standard sampling nets. The largest crappie caught in 2007 was 13.9\", the largest largemouth was 14.8\", and the largest smallmouth was 16.6\".  Growth of these three species was in the normal range (in the second or third quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nMany of the game fish examined in 2007 were infected with neascus (black spot).  Some of the bass were also infected with bass tapeworm larvae in their viscera, and some of the yellow perch was infected with yellow grub.  Neascus, bass tapeworm, and yellow grub are all common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Armstrong Lake is located 10 miles west of Ely off of state highway 169 in northeastern St. Louis County near Bear Head Lake State Park. Armstrong is a 389 acre lake with a maximum depth of 34 feet. Anglers will be successful in catching a wide variety species including walleye, northern pike, largemouth and smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Other species present in lower numbers include black crappie, yellow perch, rock bass and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \nThere is a concrete ramp in the southwest corner of the lake off of state highway 169.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics. Armstrong Lake is in lake class 5. Lakes in this lake class typically are moderate in size and depth, and have excellent water clarity. Other area lakes in the same lake class include: Eagles Nest Lakes, Ely, Little Long, Mitchell, St. Mary's, and Wolf Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has been low in recent years but still within the normal range of similar lakes. The DNR began stocking walleye fry in even years starting in 2004 because of concern about reduced and sporadic walleye recruitment. The last time walleye had been stocked prior to 2004 was 1968 and the walleye fishery had done well with natural reproduction only for many years. Even now, Armstrong occasionally produces a strong year class. In the 2012 assessment, the largest year class sampled was from 2007- an unstocked year. Walleye captured in 2012 ranged in length from 15 inches to 25 inches with an average length of 20 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nEven though bass are known to be \"net shy\", many were sampled during the 2012 assessment. Largemouth bass were abundant with many in the 13 to 16 inch range. Smallmouth bass were less abundant but the largest caught was almost three and a half pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was above what you would typically find in a class 5 lake. Pike were a wide range of sizes up to 36 inches long. Average length from the past two investigations has been very good at around 24 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were first sampled in 1978 and have been the most abundant species sampled in recent investigations. There were many bluegill in the 6 to 8 inch size range in the 2012 assessment. Anglers need to show some restraint when bluegill are really biting. Throw back the larger bluegill and keep a few of the medium-sized fish for table fare. This will have less of an impact on the size structure for bluegill. This applies to most species anglers pursue. Also in 2012, many black crappie were sampled. They ranged from 4 to 12 inches long and were 2 to 5 years old.  <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to standard fisheries sampling, near-shore netting was conducted on Armstrong Lake to sample the entire fish community. Fourteen different species were identified including green sunfish; Iowa and Johnny darters; mottled sculpin; spottail, common, and golden shiners; bluntnose and fathead minnows; and central mudminnow. In addition, young-of-year largemouth, smallmouth, bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch were also sampled.</p>",
