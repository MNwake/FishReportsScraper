                "narrative": "<p>Tetonka Lake in Le Sueur County is a 1,336 acre lake located in the town of Waterville. The lake is accessible from two public water accesses. A city-owned access is open in Waterville off 1st street North on the Cannon River. The parking lot and access can be found from across town by driving towards the blue water tower. A second public access is found on the south side of the lake in Antl Bay, off Le Sueur County Road 14.  <br> \n <br> \nTetonka Lake was surveyed the week of July 20th, 2009 to monitor the fish community and aquatic habitat. Water clarity was excellent; secchi depths measured 8.5 feet. It is possible the exceptional water clarity resulted in lowered net catches compared to historical catches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are a feature on Tetonka Lake and likely are the most targeted species by both summer and winter anglers. Bluegill averaged 28 fish per trap net, ranging in size from 3 to 9 inches in length. Average bluegill size was 5.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie averaged 3.1 and 4.8 fish per net in gill net and trap net catches respectively. Average size for all gears was 7.8 inches. Size range was good, with fish ranging from 4.1 to 12.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOne channel catfish was caught during the survey. Channel catfish have a long stocking history in Tetonka Lake. Channel catfish are found throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike averaged 3.2 fish per gill net lift. Pike ranged from 18 to 38 inches in length, with an average of 26 inches. Average weight was 4.4 pounds, which exceeded the upper quartile for lakes of Tetonka's classification (class 24).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye maintain a low level of abundance on Tetonka Lake. Walleye averaged 2.4 fish per gill net lift. Walleye ranged from 9 to 27 inches in length and averaged 19 inches. Walleye fry are stocked 3 out of 4 years. <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass averaged 2.2 fish per gill net lift. Size was good; white bass averaged 13 inches and one 18 inch fish was caught. White bass, while generally underutilized throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes, do provide a good fight to sport anglers and have firm white flesh. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch averaged 4.3 fish per gill net lift. Perch averaged 8.6 inches in length, and ranged from 5.4 to 10.5 inches. Some large individuals can be found in the lake; Tetonka has historically had better yellow perch size distribution than other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in late May with a boom electroshocking boat. Only 14 fish per hour of run time were sampled. This sample may have not been representative because of cold weather. Tetonka is usually considered a good bass fishing lake; at one time it was the home of the Minnesota state record largemouth bass.  <br> \n <br> \nA small population of smallmouth bass exists in Tetonka Lake. Only one fish was sampled in the 2009 assessment in a gill net. Rocky point and some of the midlake rocky humps tend to hold a few smallmouth bass. Other fish observed in the survey include black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, freshwater drum (sheephead), longnose gar, quillback sucker, white sucker, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  <br> \n <br> \nA point-intercept or grid sampling survey of aquatic plants was conducted on July 27, 2009 according to the methodology of Perleberg 2006.  This survey was conducted to continue quantify aquatic plant distribution to support the Lake Vegetation Management Plan.  Figure 1 shows 545 potential sampling point locations, 100 meter grid spacing, in relation to water depth contours.  Figure 2 shows 178 points that fell in the vegetated zone found to be in 10 feet of water or less and the number of rooted plant species found at those locations.  Tetonka's aquatic plant community is only moderately diverse with 14 species or groups identified (Table 1).  The distribution of rooted plants found at over 10% of vegetated zone sites are shown in Figures 3-8. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2009 a proposal to manage Tetonka for muskellunge as one of 5 new lakes statewide was drafted.  Consistent with the Long Range Plan for Muskellunge and Northern Pike Management through 2020, the proposal is based on angler input, geographic distribution, fish community, physical size, and various biological and chemical criteria. The proposal is designed to provide an additional opportunity to muskie anglers, particularly in southern Minnesota where such a fishing opportunity is limited. The proposal is open to public comment in the Fall of 2010. Anyone interested in more information on the Tetonka Lake proposal or muskellunge are encouraged to visit http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/muskellunge/muskiefaq.html or call the Waterville area fisheries office at the number below. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Tetonka Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nReference:  Perleberg D. 2006.

Northern pike exhibited fast growth with ages 1-4 sampled.  Northern pike were evenly distributed between 18.0-27.9 inches.Channel catfish were represented by large fish 12.0-30.9 inches.  Channel catfish were represented by 2 and 6-8+ year olds.  Some reproduction may be taking place, with channel catfish last stocked in 1985.  Channel catfish averaged 0.93/gill net compared to 0.67/gill net in 1986.Black crappie were sampled in relatively low numbers, averaging 2.62/trap net compared to 6.50/trap net in 1986.  Black crappie are of average size with most fish 6.5-9.0 inches.  Black crappies were represented by 1-6 year olds with 1-3 age classes most abundant.Only one white crappie was sampled compared to four fish captured in 1986.Bluegill were sampled in relatively low numbers, averaging 1.25/trap net compared to 3.33/trap net sampled in 1986.  Bluegill were represented by ages 1-4 with 2 and 3 year olds most abundant.  Bluegills sampled were evenly distributed between 5.5-8.4 inches.White bass catch rates improved from 3.00/gill net in 1986 to 6.00/gill net.  White bass are dominated by 2 year olds, with 1 year olds well represented and fewer 3 and 4 year olds sampled.  White bass have a favorable size distribution with all fish sampled 8.0-13.9 inches.Yellow perch averaged 7.29/gill net compared to 6.50/gill net in 1986.  Yellow perch are dominated by 2-3 year olds with fewer 1 and 4 year olds.  Yellow perch were represented by 1-5 age classes with 1-2 year olds dominating in 1986.Black bullheads have increased in abundance, averaging 405.62/trap net compared to 12.30/trap net in 1986.  All sizes of black bullheads were sampled and it appears a dominant age class 5.5-6.5 inches is present.Freshwater drum are abundant, averaging 55.43/gill net compared to 14.00/gill net in 1986.Carp were sampled in moderate numbers, averaging 8.50/trap net compared to 5.00/trap net sampled in 1986.Other species sampled in low abundance include bowfin, white sucker, yellow bullhead, bigmouth buffalo, pumpkinseed, and largemouth bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Standard fish sampling gears used by the MN DNR include gill nets and trap nets, which are effective at sampling a variety of fish species and provide an estimate of abundance for a particular lake. Largemouth Bass are unique in that they are not effectively sampled in gill or trap nets, which makes it difficult to assess the population. As a result, surveys using boat electrofishing are necessary to sample Largemouth Bass and assess their populations in lakes in which they are managed. Electrofishing allows fisheries managers to effectively sample Largemouth Bass, record length and weight, remove a scale sample for aging, and release the fish back into the lake. These surveys focus exclusively on Largemouth Bass and are conducted in the spring during daylight hours. <br> \n <br> \nTetonka Lake is a 1,336 acre lake located in Le Sueur County near the town of Waterville. A DNR-owned public access located on the west side of Antl Bay off Le Sueur County Road 14. There is also a city-owned access on the Cannon River within the town of Waterville off 1st Street near the blue water tower. Tetonka Lake has a mean depth of 19 feet and a maximum depth of 35 feet. A survey was conducted on May 18, 2016 to assess the Largemouth Bass population. This survey consisted of boat electrofishing during the daytime at 3 standardized locations along the shoreline of Tetonka Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 76.5 fish/hour, which was above the long-term average for Tetonka Lake (30.9 fish/hour). Despite the high catch rate, most of the fish were small. The largest fish was 18.3 inches, but 90% of all sampled fish measured less than 8.0 inches. The amount of small fish sampled suggested successful natural reproduction of Largemouth Bass that should grow to desirable size in coming years. Largemouth Bass thrive in lakes with heavy cover, like aquatic vegetation and woody debris. The next Largemouth Bass electrofishing survey will be conducted in spring of 2017, along with a Standard Survey using gill and trap nets during the summer. Although not represented in this survey, Tetonka Lake is also home to a small population of Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \n-Kip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

The highest catch rates from stocked years were 84.5/hour in 2018 and 79.0/hour in 1996. The highest catch rates from non-stocked years were 67.0/hour in 2001 and 45.9/hour in 2020.

                "narrative": "<p>Tetonka Lake is a 1,336-acre lake located on the west side of the town of Waterville in Le Sueur County. Tetonka Lake has a maximum depth of 35 feet with approximately 41% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency describes the lakes overall water quality condition as, \"Not always suitable for swimming and wading due to low clarity or excessive algae caused by the presence of nutrients such as phosphorus in the water.\" A DNR owned ramp is located on the west side of Antl Bay, and a city owned ramp is located in town on the Cannon River. The lake is designated as infested due to the presence of Eurasian Watermilfoil. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Smallmouth Bass. The current management plan calls for stocking 274,000 Walleye fry annually. Tetonka Lake is designated as a Tier-1 Lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program at a frequency of every 3 years.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 survey was completed the week of 31 July 2023 using 12 gill nets and 11 trap nets. Spring sampling for Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass was conducted 2 June 2023 and consisted of 80 minutes of daytime electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 57 Walleyes were sampled in 2023 for a catch rate of 4.8/net. The 2023 catch rate was the highest catch rate since 1994 and was more than double the lake average (2.1/net). Catch rates have varied from 1.2/net to 4.8/net with an average of 2.1/net since 1994. The previous catch rate was 2.5/net in 2020. Lengths in 2023 ranged from 7.5 inches to 26.2 inches with a mean of 17.4 inches. Walleye ranged from age-1 to age-12 with 10 year classes present. The 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2022 year classes were well represented. Growth was fast with quality length of 15 inches surpassed by age-3. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in high numbers in 2023 with a catch rate of 6.6/net. The 2023 Northern Pike catch rate was nearly triple the 1994-2023 mean of 2.4/net. Northern Pike ranged from 21.5 inches to 32.2 inches with an average of 26.7 inches. Approximately 85% of Northern Pike exceeded the legal minimum length limit of 24 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nEight Largemouth Bass were sampled with daytime electrofishing for a catch rate of 6.0/hour. No Smallmouth Bass were sampled in 2023. The mean Largemouth Bass catch rate since 1994 is 30.0/hour and the mean Smallmouth Bass catch rate is 0.5/hour for the same period. Largemouth Bass sampled in 2023 ranged from 9.3 inches to 15.7 inches with an average length of 13.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 4.1/net. Black Crappie were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 3.4/net. The 2023 gill net and trap net catch rates were less than the previous survey (gill nets in 2020, trap nets in 2021) but were both greater than lake average since 1995. Black Crappie sampled in gill nets ranged from 5.3 inches to 12.0 inches with an average of 8.5 inches. Black Crappie sampled with trap nets ranged from 5.6 inches to 10.6 inches with an average of 8.1 inches. Black Crappie from both gears were aged using scales and otoliths. Black Crappie ranged from age-1 to age-6 with no missing year classes within that range indicating consistent recruitment. Growth was moderate with quality length of 8 inches reached around age-3 to age-4. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 64 Bluegills were sampled for a catch rate of 5.8/net in 2023. Bluegills ranged from 3.2 inches to 8.5 inches with an average of 4.4 inches. Bluegill were aged using scales and otoliths and ranged from age-1 to age-5. Bluegill grow fast in Tetonka Lake often reaching 7 inches by age-3 or age-4. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at just 1.2/gill net after being sampled at historically high numbers in 2020. Catch rates have varied from 1.2/net to 41.2/net with an average of 10.8/net since 1994. Yellow Perch in 2023 ranged from 7.6 inches to 8.8 inches with an average of 8.1 inches. Yellow Perch are an important prey species, and the low catch rate may be due to increased numbers of Walleye in Tetonka Lake and the Cannon River system. <br> \n <br> \nOnly 5 Black Bullheads and 12 Yellow Bullheads were sampled in 2023. Black Bullheads were a common species in Tetonka Lake and were targeted frequently. A sharp decline in Black Bullhead numbers was observed starting in the 1990s. Improved water quality appears to be responsible for this decline and resulted in a resurgence in less tolerant native species such as Largemouth Bass and Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 38 Common Carp were sampled in 2023 for a catch rate of 3.5/trap net. High Common Carp numbers can negatively impact lake water quality and habitat and efforts to reduce or eliminate them should be considered. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species sampled in 2023 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (dogfish), Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), Golden Shiner, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was poor with a secchi depth of 3.0 feet. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 10.6 ppm at the surface to 0.1 ppm below 18 feet. Water temperature ranged from 78.1 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 61.9 degrees Fahrenheit at 27 feet. A thermocline was detected around 21 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye catch was still low (1.0/gill net) even though it was almost double the catch of 1981 (0.57/gill net), but below both the State (3.60/gill net) and local (2.33/gill net) medians.  All fish sampled were from the 1985 and 1984 year classes; the growth on these fish was about average for the area.The northern pike catch was very low with only 5 fish sampled in the 6 trap nets and 6 gill nets.  Two of the 5 fish were young of the year and only 1 fish from each of the 1984, 1983, and 1982 year classes was caught.  This is quite similar to the catch rates from the 1981 netting, which is hard to understand with high numbers of fish being produced in the northern pike spawning area in the last three years.The white bass population seems to have improved, with 3.0/gill net being caught, compared to only 1.5/gill net in 1981.  There was good reproduction this year with 14 young of the year caught.  There also appears to be quite high numbers of fish in the 12.0-12.9 inch class, which should be acceptable to the angler.There is also a fair number of channel catfish in Lake Tetonka.  Channel catfish have been stocked every year since 1980 with the exception of 1982.  The catch rate was 0.67/gill net, which is above both the state (0.47/gill net) and the local (0.25/gill net) medians.  Most fish caught were from the 1983 year class, with some individuals from the 1982 year class, which indicates there may be some natural reproduction occurring.The yellow perch catch was fair with 6.5/gill net caught, which was below both state (8.0/gill net) and local (8.83/gill net) medians.  This was also below the catch/gill net (7.14) in the 1981 netting.  The modal length was 7.0-7.4 inches, with most of the fish longer than this length.  Most of the fish caught were from the 1984 and 1985 year classes, with growth rates above average.The bluegill catch rate (3.33/trap net) was quite a bit below state (11.67/trap net) and local (15.91/trap net) catch rates.  Reproduction looks to be consistent with fish showing up in all year classes from 1979 to the present.  The growth rate on these fish is about average for the area.The black crappie catch shows a strong 1983 year class with fair numbers of older and younger fish.  The fish in the catch had a modal length of 9.0-9.4 inches, which is a length very acceptable to the angler.  The catch rate of 6.5/trap net was very similar to the catch rate in 1981 (6.37/trap net), which is above the state median (2.67/trap net) and below the local median (15.0/trap net).The lake also has a high population of rough fish, with high numbers of carp, freshwater drum, and black bullheads.  The black bullhead catch (38.2/gill net) did drop significantly from the 1981 netting (195.78/gill net), but is still quite high.</p>",

Locals report nice size bluegills and many walleyes in the 8\" to 12\" range that will recruit to the fishery this year.  The black bullhead catch was the lowest recorded in thirty years of surveys, consistent with a trend noted throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes and probably indicative of long term improvement in water quality.  The black bullheads that were caught were of acceptable size, averaging 10\" and weighing 3/4 lb.</p>",

A total of 54 age-0 Walleyes were sampled for a catch rate of 54.5/hour. In 19 surveys since 1996, catch rates during fry-stocked years have averaged 58.8/hour while non-stocked years have averaged 64.9/hour. The average length in 2022 was 6.7 inches. The robust catch rates during non-stocked years suggests natural reproduction plays an important role in Walleye recruitment in Tetonka Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tetonka Lake is a 1336-acre lake, with a maximum depth of 35', located near the town of Waterville in Le Sueur County.  Tetonka Lake is in the Cannon River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Eighteen 100 foot long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place the week of 19 July 2021 with all 18 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50 foot seine was used at 14 stations and the 15 foot seine was used at an additional 3 stations.  Soft bottom and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at the 1 remaining sampling site.  Twenty-three native species were sampled, including 3 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Iowa Darter, Logperch, and Smallmouth Bass.  This nearshore survey was used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted in 2020 and 2021 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. Tetonka Lake was evaluated using Tool 2 and scored 23 which was well below the threshold for impairment of 45. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tetonka Lake is a 1,336-acre lake located on the west side of the town of Waterville in Le Sueur County. It has a maximum depth of 35 feet with approximately 41% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency describes the lakes overall water quality condition as, \"Not always suitable for swimming and wading due to low clarity or excessive algae caused by the presence of nutrients such as phosphorus in the water.\" A DNR owned ramp is located on the west side of Antl Bay and a city owned ramp is located in town on the Cannon River. The lake is designated as infested due to the presence of Eurasian Watermilfoil. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Smallmouth Bass. The current management plan calls for stocking 548,000 Walleye fry in even years. The quota is split 50:50 between LMS and MIS strain Walleye fry to accommodate the ongoing research project involving Cannon River Walleye stocks. Tetonka Lake is designated as a Tier-1 Lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program at a frequency of every 3 years.  <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was completed the week of July 27, 2020 using 12 gill nets. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Trap nets and spring boat electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass were not completed due to COVID-19 restrictions. Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 30 Walleyes were sampled in 2020 for a catch rate of 2.5/net, indicating low to moderate numbers were present but was the highest catch rate in recent surveys. Catch rates have varied from 1.2/net to 2.5/net with an average of 1.8/net since 1994. The previous catch rate was 1.3/net in 2017. Lengths in 2020 ranged from 8.7 inches to 27.7 inches with an average of 16.2 inches. Approximately 63% were larger than 15 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 11 years old with 9 year classes present. Both the 2019 and 2020 year classes were well represented which provided strong evidence of natural reproduction and recruitment in the lake. Growth was fast with quality length of 15 inches surpassed by year 3. Hopefully the strong Yellow Perch numbers will help to increase Walleye numbers in Tetonka Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in low numbers in 2020 with a catch rate of just 1.8/net, indicating low to moderate numbers were present. This was right around the 1994-2020 average of 1.7/net. Lengths ranged from 17.5 inches to 33.1 inches with an average of 24.2 inches. Approximately 43% exceeded the legal minimum length limit of 24 inches. Fish were mostly 2 to 4 years old with growth to 21 inches surpassed between year 2 and year 3. Tetonka Lake is located in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. In order to harvest a Northern Pike the fish must be over 24.0 inches in length.  The daily bag limit in this zone is 2 Northern Pike per day. <br> \nNo Largemouth Bass and only one 11.6 inch Smallmouth Bass were sampled in 2020. Again, due to COVID-19 restrictions, spring boat electrofishing was not completed as planned. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were well represented in the 2020 survey with a total of 93 sampled for a catch rate of 7.8/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. This was a sizable increase over the 2017 catch rate of 2.2/net. Lengths ranged from 4.3 inches to 10.2 inches with an average of 6.3 inches. Fish were mostly small and young with ages ranging from 1 to 3 years old. Growth was moderate with 8 inches reached around year 3. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 70 Bluegills were sampled for a catch rate of 5.8/net in 2020. Lengths ranged from 3.5 inches to 7.1 inches with an average of 5.5 inches. Only 1 fish was larger than 7 inches. All were 1 or 2 years old and showed good growth. Bluegills are better sampled with trap nets and caution should be used before drawing conclusions about the Bluegill population in Tetonka Lake using the 2020 gill net sample. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at historically high numbers in 2020. A total of 494 were sampled for a catch rate of 41.2/net, indicating high numbers were present. Since 1994, catch rates have varied from 4.3/net to 41.2/net with an average of 12.2/net. The previous catch rate was 5.3/net in 2017. Lengths in 2020 ranged from 5.2 inches to 10.8 inches with an average of 6.8/net. Only 18% were larger than 8 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 4 years old with 4 year classes present. Approximately 77% were 1 year old. Growth was fast with a length of 9 inches surpassed around year 3. Yellow Perch are an important prey species and the high catch rate and strong growth rate should also provide Tetonka Lake anglers a high quality target in the near future. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum remained a common member of the Tetonka Lake fish community in 2020. The catch rate of 4.7/net indicated moderate numbers were present. This was below the long-term average of 5.9/net. Lengths ranged from 8.5 inches to 18.0 inches with an average of 15.3 inches. Freshwater Drum are often caught by anglers while targeting other species. For the open-minded angler, they offer an additional fishing target and are surprisingly good table fare. <br> \n <br> \nJust 3 Black Bullheads and 13 Yellow Bullheads were sampled in 2020. Historically, Black Bullheads were a common species in Tetonka Lake and were targeted frequently. Starting in the 1990s, a sharp decline in Black Bullheads numbers was observed. Improved water quality appears to be responsible for this decline and resulted in a resurgence in less tolerant native species such as Largemouth Bass and Bluegills. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 26 Common Carp were sampled in 2020 for a catch rate of 2.2/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. This was on par with the 2017 catch rate of 2.0/net. High Common Carp numbers can negatively impact lake water quality and habitat and efforts to reduce or eliminate them should be considered. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species sampled in 2020 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (dogfish), Channel Catfish, Golden Shiner, White Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was poor with a secchi depth of 3.5 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 8.3 ppm and 77.5 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 0.1 ppm and 72.1 degrees Fahrenheit at 29 feet. A thermocline was detected around 22 or 23 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tetonka Lake is a 1,336-acre lake located on the west side of the town of Waterville in Le Sueur County. It has a maximum depth of 35 feet with approximately 41% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency describes the lakes overall water quality condition as, \"Not always suitable for swimming and wading due to low clarity or excessive algae caused by the presence of nutrients such as phosphorus in the water.\" A DNR owned ramp is located on the west side of Antl Bay and a city owned ramp is in town on the Cannon River. The lake is designated as infested due to the presence of Eurasian Watermilfoil. Tetonka Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Smallmouth Bass. The current management plan calls for stocking 274,000 Walleye fry annually. The quota is split 50:50 between LMS and MIS strain Walleye fry to accommodate the ongoing research project involving Cannon River Walleye stocks. Tetonka Lake is designated as a Tier-1 Lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program at a frequency of every 3 years.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets and boat electrofishing were completed during the regularly scheduled survey in 2020 but trap nets were postponed until 2021 due to COVID protocols. The 2021 targeted survey was completed the week of 17 August 2021 using 11 trap nets. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Results from this targeted survey should not be compared to results from standard surveys. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 167 Bluegills were sampled for a catch rate of 18.6/net, indicating low to moderate numbers were present. The previous Bluegill catch rate was 4.1/net in 2017 and the long-term average was 9.3/net. Bluegills ranged from 2.8 to 7.9 inches with an average of 4.5 inches. Size structure was poor with few fish over 6 inches. In three surveys since 2014, no Bluegills over 8 inches have been sampled. Bluegills ranged from 1 to 3 years old with 3 year classes present. Approximately 75% of Bluegills sampled were 1 year old. Bluegill growth was moderate with fish nearing quality length of 6 inches around age-3. Aside from the 1 year old year class, Bluegills were sampled in low numbers in 2021. The absence of larger, older fish is more likely an artifact of the sampling and not a true reflection of the population.  <br> \n <br> \nOther game fish sampled in 2021 include Black Crappies up to 10.9 inches, Largemouth Bass up to 20.1 inches, Northern Pike up to 33.1 inches, Walleyes up to 19.1 inches, and Yellow Perch up to 8.1 inches. Non-game species sampled include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), White Sucker, Yellow Bass, and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis spp.). <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

The varied shape of the lake basin makes Tetonka a difficult lake to fish and the Cannon River contributes to seasonal movement, adding to this difficulty.  Tetonka, at times, produces good walleye fishing and it is stocked with walleye fry 3 out of 4 years.  Panfish abundance is relatively low, but many bluegill are caught off rock bays in the summer.  Periodically, a large white bass year class is produced, creating a good fishery of 1/2-3/4 lb. fish.Tetonka supports a diverse fish community, with large numbers of carp, bigmouth buffalo, and bullhead harvested annually by commercial fishermen.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nTetonka Lake is a 1,336 acre lake located in Le Sueur County near the town of Waterville. A DNR-owned public access located on the west side of Antl Bay off Le Sueur County Road 14. There is also a city-owned access on the Cannon River within the town of Waterville off 1st Street near the blue water tower. Tetonka Lake has a mean depth of 19 feet and a maximum depth of 35 feet. Based on limnological variables, Tetonka Lake is placed in lake class 24. Other lakes in this lake class include Madison (Blue Earth County), Mazaska (Rice County), and Reeds (Waseca County). Tetonka Lake is managed primarily for walleye and channel catfish and secondarily for northern pike. Walleye fry have been stocked in Tetonka Lake three out of four years since 2004, while northern pike and channel catfish are stocked periodically. Tetonka Lake was surveyed the week of July 21, 2014 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying trap nets and gill nets, as well as recording water quality parameters.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch rate in the 2014 survey was 1.8 fish/net, which was just above the long-term average of 1.5 fish/gill net in Tetonka Lake. Walleye abundance has remained relatively stable over the past 25 years, ranging from 1.2 to 2.6 fish/net since 1989. The total length of walleye from gill nets ranged from 7.0 to 24.0 and averaged about 13.0 inches, indicating a relatively small size structure. Walleye growth in Tetonka Lake appears to be slightly slower than similar lakes in the area, which may play a role in the small size structure. Numerous year classes were represented in this survey, as Tetonka Lake is stocked with walleye regularly (three of every four years). Natural reproduction of walleye is also suspected to occur, at least to some degree, throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch <br> \nYellow perch were the most abundant fish species observed in the gill nets, averaging 9.1 fish/net. This was above the long-term average for yellow perch catch rates in Tetonka Lake (6.6 fish/net). Yellow perch gill net catch rates in Tetonka Lake have remained relatively stable since 1981. The length of yellow perch in 2014 ranged from 5.0 to 10.5 inches and averaged 7.0 inches, indicating a relatively small size structure of yellow perch. Although some yellow perch angling opportunities exist in Tetonka Lake, anecdotal reports indicate mostly small fish are caught.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nBluegill abundances were low during the 2014 survey. Bluegill catch rates were the lowest in about 30 years at 1.1 fish/trap net. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.2 to 7.9 inches, with most fish measuring over 7 inches. Although bluegill catch rates were low during this survey, the numbers may not necessarily reflect actual population levels. Similar to angling, abiotic variables can affect fish patterns and behavior, potentially affecting their susceptibility to net catch. For example, bluegill may have inhabited deeper water at the time of this survey, thus greatly reducing their susceptibility to near shore trap net catch.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was low during the 2014 survey, with gill nets yielding only 3.3 fish/net. This catch rate was similar to the survey conducted in 2009, which yielded 3.1 fish/gill net. Trap net catch rates of black crappie were also low, averaging only 0.9 fish/net. Black crappie lengths from both net types ranged from 4.0 to 11.0 inches, averaging 6.7 inches. Anglers often target black crappie in Tetonka Lake, especially during ice covered periods. However, anecdotal reports indicate most fish that are caught are 10 inches or less in total length.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate in the 2014 survey was 1.2 fish/gill net, which closely represents the long-term average for Tetonka Lake (1.1 fish/gill net). Although the relative abundance of northern pike in Tetonka Lake is below average compared to similar lakes in the area, the average length was about 29.0 inches and ranged from 24.0 to 34.0 inches, indicating a good size structure of northern pike in Tetonka Lake for angling and spearing. Northern pike fry were stocked recently in Tetonka Lake in 2010, 2011, and 2013.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish <br> \nChannel catfish are present in Tetonka Lake, although in low abundance. The gill net catch rate in 2014 was 0.6 fish/net, while the trap nets collected only 0.1 fish/net. All channel catfish collected in the 2014 survey ranged from 18.0 to 20.0 inches in total length. Although channel catfish from this survey were not aged, the size structure suggests that only one year class was sampled in 2014. A surplus stocking plan exists for Tetonka Lake and channel catfish were last stocked in 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass <br> \nWhite bass are also present in Tetonka Lake, apparently as a result of natural reproduction since they are not stocked. Gill nets yielded 1.3 white bass/net in the 2014 survey. White bass abundance in Tetonka Lake has varied throughout the sampling history, ranging from 6.0 fish/net in 1989 to 0.6 fish/net in 1994. This variability is likely affected by spawning success, or lack thereof, from year to year. The total length of white bass from gill nets in this survey ranged from 7.3 to 15.2 inches and averaged 13.1 inches. White bass in Tetonka Lake offer a quality fishing opportunity for anglers looking for hard fighting fish and good table fare.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species <br> \nAlthough only one largemouth bass (19.3 inches) was collected in this survey, both largemouth and smallmouth bass are present in Tetonka Lake. Since largemouth and smallmouth bass are not effectively sampled in gill and trap nets, an electrofishing survey is scheduled for spring 2015 to assess the populations. Other fish collected in this survey included black and yellow bullheads, freshwater drum, bowfin, white sucker, common carp, and bigmouth buffalo.    <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n</p>",

A total of 225 age-0 Walleyes were sampled for a catch rate of 134.7/hour on-time. Catch rates during fry-stocked years (n = 14) have averaged 64.2/hour on-time while non-stocked years (n = 6) have averaged 64.9/hour on-time. The mean length in 2023 was 7.0 inches. The robust catch rates during non-stocked years suggests natural reproduction plays an important role in Walleye recruitment in Tetonka Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Tetonka is located west of the City of Waterville in southern Le Sueur County.  A fishery survey was conducted on Lake Tetonka in 2004 to assess the fish community and aquatic habitat.  Walleye gill net catch has been consistent at a moderately low level over the past several surveys.  A wide range of walleye were caught in the gill nets - from 8 to 26 inches long.  Most walleye were age 3, from the 2001 year class when no walleye were stocked in the Cannon River chain of lakes.  Northern pike were relatively large with many of the fish from 20 to 33 inches long.  Trap net catches of black crappie and bluegill were low, but the size of these fish was generally large.  Many bluegill were around 6 and 8 inches long with the largest fish about 9 inches long.  Black crappie were between 8 and 12 inches long.  Black bullhead were the most abundant species in both the gill and trap net sets.  Most black bullheads were relatively large at 8 to 12 inches long.  Most white bass were around 12 inches long.  Yellow perch around 9 inches long were moderately abundant.  Other species present included carp, channel catfish, freshwater drum, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, white sucker, bigmouth buffalo, bowfin, and yellow bullhead.A public access is located on the south shore of Lake Tetonka off highway 14.  A fishing pier is located near the boat lunch on the property of the DNR Waterville Fisheries office.  Boats can also be launched on the Cannon River in the City of Waterville.  Tetonka is a short distance upstream from this access.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tetonka Lake is a 1,336 acre lake located on the west side of the town of Waterville in Le Sueur County. It has a maximum depth of 35 feet with approximately 41% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency describes the lake's overall water quality condition as, \"Not always suitable for swimming and wading due to low clarity or excessive algae caused by the presence of nutrients such as phosphorus in the water.\" A DNR owned ramp is located on the west side of Antl Bay and a city owned ramp is located in town on the Cannon River. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Smallmouth Bass. The latest management plan calls for stocking 548,000 Walleye fry every other year on even years. Recent stocking events include Channel Catfish fingerlings in 2010, Northern Pike fry in 2010, 2011, and 2013, and Walleye fry in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed in 2017 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 12 gill nets, 12 trap nets, and 91 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also recorded. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 16 Walleye were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which indicated low numbers were present. The catch rate in 2014 was 1.8/net. Historically, catch rates have been low ranging from 0.3/net to 2.6/net with an average of 1.4/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 9.5 to 26.2 inches with an average of 18.3 inches. Approximately 38% exceeded 20 inches in length. Three additional fish ranging from 17.7 to 26.8 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears were 1 to 15 years old with 8 year classes present. Four year old fish were the most abundant year class accounting for 33% of the sample. Most of the sample was aged to stocked years however strong evidence of natural reproduction has been recorded in other assessments. Fish were around 14 inches long at their third year which was slightly slower growth than expected. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 104 Largemouth Bass were sampled using boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 68.4/hour, which was high relative to past samples. The catch rate in 2016 was 76.5/hour. Since electrofishing sample collection began in 1994, catch rates have varied from 12.0/hour to 76.5/hour with an average of 34.0/hour. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 4.9 to 20.4 inches with an average of 10.9 inches. Approximately 29% were longer than 15 inches. An additional 2 fish measuring 16.3 and 19.3 inches were sampled with trap nets. Although not aged, the length frequency distribution suggests many year classes were present and recruitment was consistent. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 29 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 2.4/net, which indicated low to moderate numbers were present. The catch rate in 2014 was 1.2/net. Northern Pike have typically been sampled in low numbers in Tetonka with an all-time range of 0.2/net to 3.2/net and an average of just 1.3/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 20.3 to 31.7 inches with an average of 26.6 inches. One quarter of the sample exceeded 28 inches in length. An additional 8 fish ranging from 22.2 to 32.9 inches were sampled with trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nJust 2 Smallmouth Bass measuring 13.2 and 20.1 inches were sampled with boat electrofishing in 2017 for a catch rate of 1.3/hour. No Smallmouth Bass were sampled in the 2016 sample. Historically, they have been extremely rare with samples averaging just 0.6/hour. Tetonka Lake is the only lake in the Waterville Area that has a self-sustaining Smallmouth Bass population and for that reason it is important to area fish management. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 17 Black Crappie were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.4/net, which indicated low numbers were present. The catch rate in 2014 was 0.9/net. Historically, catch rates have varied from 0.3/net to 16.2/net with an average of 4.1/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 5.1 to 10.7 inches with an average of 8.8 inches. Only 12% of the sample exceeded 10 inches long. An additional 25 fish ranging from 5.8 to 10.8 inches were sampled with gill nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 4 years old with 4 year classes present. Two and three year old fish accounted for a vast majority of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled in low numbers in 2017 with a total of 49 sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 4.1/net, indicating low numbers were present. The catch rate in 2014 was 1.1/net. Except for a catch rate of 27.8/net in 2009, Bluegill catch rates have never exceeded 5.0/trap net. Lengths ranged from 2.8 to 7.9 inches with an average of 5.7 inches. An additional 41 fish ranging from 4.0 to 8.3 inches were sampled with gill nets. Aged Bluegills were either 2 or 3 years old. As these fish grow and reproduce, catch rates and size structure should improve. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 65 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 5.3/net, which indicated low to moderate numbers were present. This was a decline from the 2014 catch rate of 9.1/net. Historically, catch rates have ranged from 0.1/net to 13.1/net with an average of 6.5/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 5.6 to 9.3 inches with an average of 7.5 inches. Approximately 45% of the sample exceeded 8 inches in length. Fish were young with the entire sample either 1 or 2 years old. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 8 Channel Catfish were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.7/net, which was right at the historical average of 0.7/net. Channel Catfish have been present and rare in every sample since 1969 except for being absent in the 2009 sample. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 23.4 to 29.2 inches with a mean of 26.6 inches. Channel Catfish offer an additional angling opportunity in Tetonka Lake, especially for larger fish. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were the most abundant fish sampled with trap nets in 2017 with a total of 166 caught for a catch rate of 13.7/net, which indicated high numbers were present. This was the highest catch rate on record. Historically, catch rates have varied from 1.1/net to 13.7/net with a mean of 6.1/net. With the lake openly connected to entire Cannon River system, Common Carp have ample opportunities to spawn successfully and will likely remain a common member of the Tetonka Lake fish community. <br> \n <br> \nNo Black Bullheads were sampled with gill nets in 2017 and only 2 were sampled with trap nets. After catch rates of 195.8/net in 1981 and 146.6/net in 1989, numbers have plummeted to less than 2.0/net in the three samples since 2004. For a period of time, Black Bullheads were an important fish commonly targeted by local anglers as well as tourists. The recent decline can be attributed to improvements in water quality and a decreased frequency of winterkills and other disturbances. A handful of Yellow Bullheads were sampled with gill and trap nets and they often replace Black Bullheads in more stable, healthy lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2017 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Freshwater Drum, White Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements include water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. They ranged from 81.0 degrees Fahrenheit and 13.5 ppm at the surface to 67.5 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.0 ppm at 28 feet. A thermocline was detected between 10 and 14 feet and dissolved oxygen was depleted at approximately 16 feet. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",
