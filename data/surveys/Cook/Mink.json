It has been reclaimed several times to remove undesirable fish species, with the last reclamation done in the fall of 2014 to remove yellow perch and rock bass.  The lake is currently stocked annually with yearling rainbow trout in the spring, and fingerling splake in the fall.  Management goals from the current (2019) lake management plan (LMP) are to maintain a rainbow trout population with a minimum trap net catch of 0.8 fish/set, with two year classes present, and maintain a splake population with a minimum trap net catch of 1.7 fish/set, with at least two catchable-sized (over 10 inch) year classes present. <br> \n <br> \nThis was the first standard survey completed on Mink Lake since the 2014 reclamation.  It was one of three standard surveys scheduled in the 2019 LMP to determine whether goals in the lake for rainbow trout and splake could be met under the current stocking regime, and to monitor the lake for the reintroduction of any undesireable fish species. <br> \n <br> \nNo undesirable fish species were taken in this survey, and it appeared that goals for the fishery probably could be met under the current stocking regime.  Splake appeared to have been abundant in the fall of 2020, and fish as large as 20.7 inches were found.  Fewer rainbow trout were captured, but rainbow trout catches in all sampling gears tend to be low.  The splake trap net catch was well above the goal set in the 2019 LMP, while the rainbow trout catch fell just below the goal for that species.  The splake catch was high compared to other stream trout lakes in this area, well above the normal range of 0.60 - 3.24 fish/set for stream trout lakes in this area.  Although the rainbow trout catch did not meet the plan goal, it still fell within the normal range (0.40 - 2.24 fish/set) for catches in lakes in this area.  Catches for both species included two or more year classes of catchable-sized fish, with splake as old as age-5 taken.  Most of the rainbow trout taken were survivors from the spring 2020 yearling stocking, but one two-year-old fish stocked in 2019 was also collected.  Splake growth had been fairly fast.  Fish reached a mean length of 11.8 inches at the end of their second year, compared to an area average of 9.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA creel survey done on Mink Lake in January-March 2020 showed the lake supported fairly high winter fishing pressure.  Winter anglers enjoyed good success, catching relatively high numbers of splake, as well as a few rainbow trout. <br> \n  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This assessment was done in cooperation with Cook County water planning staff, as part of a water quality study on Mink, Kimball, and Boys Lakes.  It was also done to monitor performance of stocked trout and to determine the effects of yellow perch and rock bass on that performance. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and rock bass are rarely found in stream trout lakes in this area.  Yellow perch were apparently very abundant in Mink Lake in 2013, while rock bass may have just found their way into the lake from Kimball Lake, where they were first seen in 2009. The yellow perch gill net catch was far above the normal range for this lake type, but very few of the yellow perch seen in 2013 would have been large enough to have been of interest to anglers.  No rock bass were taken in gill net sets, but one 4.5-inch fish was taken in 0.25-in-mesh trap nets used in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and rock bass will compete with trout for forage, and will likely cause trout growth rates to decline.  The rainbow trout fishery in Mink Lake is essentially a put-and-take fishery, and slow growth would not be a serious problem, as long as fish can maintain their condition over the summer.  The splake fishery, however, is dependent on growth in the lake over at least one growing season to provide the catchable-sized fish that stocking is intended to produce.  Experience in this and other area lakes suggests that splake do not thrive in the presence of large numbers of yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe rainbow trout gill net catch was was just within the normal range (1.0-6.5 fish/net) for catches in fall assessments of stream trout lakes in this area.  The mean weight for rainbow trout taken in gill nets was low compared to means usually seen in fall catches in this area.  All three rainbow trout taken in this assessment were one-year-old fish from the 2013 yearling stocking.  Their growth since they were stocked appeared to have been poor.  Rainbow trout yearlings stocked in the spring of 2013 had an average weight of 0.37 pounds per fish, compared to an average of 0.48 pounds per fish for one-year-old fish collected in the late-September assessment.  In other stream trout lakes in this area, stocked yearlings have been known to double their weight over the course of a single summer.   <br> \n <br> \nThe only brown trout collected was a survivor from a 2009 fingerling stocking in Kimball Lake.  Growth of that fish had been about average for the area.  Brown trout would have been uncommon in Mink Lake, but would have been some of the larger trout available to anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nThe splake gill net catch was low for this lake historically, and fell below the normal range (2.8 - 14.3 fish/net) for catches in fall assessments of area stream trout lakes.  Splake taken in gill nets were small; their mean weight was also below normal.  Most of the splake in Mink Lake in 2013 may have been too small to have been taken in standard gill nets.  Quarter-inch-mesh trap nets captured fairly high numbers of small splake under 8.5 inches in length.  Those small splake were apparently one-year-old fish from the 2012 fingerling stocking, and had grown only two inches over the 2013 growing season.  Few had reached a catchable size by the end of September.  The survey crew reported that larger splake collected in this assessment were skinny, and in poor condition.  It is likely that competition from high numbers of yellow perch and a few rock bass in this lake has severely limited splake growth. <br> \n <br> \nMink Lake is scheduled to be rehabilitated for stream trout management in the fall of 2014, with the goal of eliminating yellow perch and rock bass.  All fish present at that time would be killed, and the lake would be restocked beginning in the spring of 2015. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The catch was dominated by age-2 fish from a 2000 fingerling stocking, and most of the fish taken were under 12 inches in length.  A population estimate was done, and it was estimated that the lake supported about 540 splake (not counting small fish from the 2001 fingerling stocking).  The lake held only about 83 splake over 12 inches.The rainbow trout catch in 2002 was low, and consisted mostly of fish from a 2002 yearling stocking done just before the assessment.  However, rainbow trout are very difficult to capture in assessment nets, and the low catch may have been misleading.  There had been some survival of rainbow trout from previous stockings; two and three-year-old fish were found in small numbers in spring 2002.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This assessment was done to confirm reports of yellow perch in Mink Lake, and to determine how serious the problem might be.  Yellow perch were found.  The catch in the single gill net set used suggested they might be abundant; however, the lack of any yellow perch in 0.75-in-mesh trap net sets suggested their numbers may not yet have been that high.  At least two, and probably three year classes appeared to have been present.  Many of the yellow perch found in 2009 would have been large enough to have been of interest to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass, which were found in Kimball Lake for the first time in 2009, were not found in Mink Lake.  That, plus the much higher catch of yellow perch in Kimball Lake in 2009, and the lack of yellow perch in Boys Lake, suggested that Kimball Lake may have been the initial site of these introductions, with fish spreading upstream through the watershed from there. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and rock bass will compete with trout for forage, and will likely cause trout growth rates to decline.  The rainbow trout fishery in Mink Lake is essentially a put-and-take fishery, and slow growth would not be a serious problem, as long as fish can maintain their condition over the summer.  The splake fishery, however, is dependent on growth in the lake to provide catchable-sized fish.  Experience in this and other area lakes suggests that splake growth and survival will be reduced in the presence of large numbers of yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe rainbow trout trap net catch was within the normal range (0.25-1.25 fish/set) for summer assessments of stream trout lakes in this area.  All but two of the rainbow trout collected were one-year-old fish from the 2009 yearling stocking.  Growth of those fish since they were stocked appeared to have been adequate. <br> \n <br> \nThe splake trap net catch was within the normal range (0.60-4.00 fish/set) for summer assessments of area stream trout lakes.  Splake from fingerling stockings in 2008, 2007, and 2006 contributed to the catch.  Despite the presence of yellow perch, splake growth had apparently been somewhat faster than average.  Two-year-old fish reached an average length of 10.2 inches by the end of their second year. <br> \n <br> \nBrook trout collected in Mink Lake could have been migrants from Kimball Creek, which supports a wild population.  They may also have moved downstream into the lake from Boys Lake, where fairly high numbers of what appeared to have been naturally-produced brook trout were found in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nMink Lake (with Kimball and Boys Lakes) has been one of the most important, and most heavily-fished, stream trout lakes in the Grand Marais area.  Normally, these findings would result in an immediate rehabilitation of all three lakes.  However, before a rehabilitation can be done, the status of the barrier below Kimball lake must be determined, and it must be rebuilt if necessary.  Restoration of the barrier between Mink and Kimball lakes may also be needed, and construction of a third barrier between Boys and Minik lake may be justified. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

They had grown fast, but most were young, and not yet especially large. Most were age 2 and about 14 inches long. Age-1 splake were common and averaged 9 inches long. The only older splake, which was also the largest one, was 19.3 inches long and was 4 years old.Only two rainbow trout were caught. They are not readily caught in nets, so they may be more abundant than the low net catch would suggest. They measured 13.2 inches (age 1) and 17.2 inches (age 2), which indicates slightly faster growth than average.</p>",

This targeted survey was done in response to angler reports of large numbers of minnows in the lake.  All fish species should have been removed in the 2014 rehabilitation, and at the time, we were confident they were. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey found very large numbers of minnows in Mink Lake.  The catch was dominated by Fathead Minnow, at levels over 10 times higher than normal for this sampling gear in the Grand Marais area.  None of the minnow species taken in this survey had been found in the last survey of this lake done using 0.25-in-mesh trap nets (September 2013), suggesting fish taken in 2016 had been introduced, probably via bait buckets, rather than surviving the rehabilitation.  Use or possession of live minnows is not allowed on Mink Lake, and the violation of that rule opens the door to the possibility that other bait buckets may contain more damaging species, like Yellow Perch, Rock Bass, or Smallmouth Bass.  The 2014 rehabilitation was done to remove Yellow Perch and Rock Bass, and it was encouraging that neither species was found in this survey.  However, if undesirable species once again become established in Mink Lake, reduced funding for the Section of Fisheries means we may lack the ability to do another rehabilitation to remove them. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Rainbow Trout and Splake were not targeted by this survey, it offered some insight into performance of trout stocked since the rehabilitation.  Based on their lengths, Rainbow Trout taken in this survey came from yearling stockings done in 2015 and 2016.  Fish stocked in 2015 (two years old in 2016) were 14-17 inches in length, and seemed to have been present in good numbers, suggesting excellent growth and good survival  since they were stocked.  All Splake taken in this survey had been stocked in the fall of 2015.  It appeared that most would not be large enough to be of much interest to anglers until the end of the 2016 growing season, but high numbers of minnows should fuel good Splake growth. <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
