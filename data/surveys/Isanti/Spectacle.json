The yellow perch and black crappie had extremely low population figures as has been the history in Spectacle Lake.  The largemouth bass, while absent in the trapnet, was present in the gillnet and shoreline seining results.  Numerous largemouth bass observed visually during the period of survey.  The bluegill sunfish was low in the trapnet at 13.50 per set, but was at the same time high in the gillnet at 18.67 per set.  The pumpkinseed sunfish was about average at 6.00 per set.  The white sucker and hybrid sunfish had very low population figures.  No bullheads of any kind taken in the trapnets but all were captured in the gillnet.  \"See note on difficulty of trapnetting due to heavy vegetation\".</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spectacle Lake is a 240 acre lake having a horseshoe shape to its basin.  The greatest length is about 1.0 miles  long.  The shoreline substrate is mainly sand with about 90% of shore developed with homes.  Twenty-four plant species are found throughout the lake typically growing in depths of 3 to 14 feet.  With summer water clarity readings averaging around 10 feet, this lake is probably the clearest of the larger lakes in Isanti County.  It is regarded as a very good fishing lake and it receives moderate to heavy levels of recreational use.  Being a largemouth bass-panfish lake by nature, it is managed primarily for walleye, largemouth bass, northern pike, and panfish.  The maximum depth is 52 feet with about one-third of the lake's volume being deeper than 15 feet.  The lake was reported to have a partial winterkill during the winter of 1964-65.  Various stocking has occurred through the years of mainly walleye and northern pike.  Present management plans call for walleye fingerlings stocked on a 3-year rotation.During August 26-30, 1996, a lake survey  was conducted to evaluate the present fish population in Spectacle Lake.  Gear types consisted of: six standard gillnets, eight standard trapnets, night electrofishing for largemouth bass on May 28, 1996, and standard seining natural reproduction checks on August 30, 1996.  Spectacle Lake is in lake class 32 and fish abundances are based on the mean ranges observed in other lake class 32 lakes.Walleye abundance was normal for this type of lake.  In six of eight surveys since 1938, walleye were observed at historically low levels.  What fish are in the lake are primarily due to stocking of fingerlings, however, limited natural reproduction has occurred as shown by aging data.  Generally, Spectacle Lake does not have suitable gravel/rock spawning habitat for walleye, therefore, stocking is necessary to maintain a population.  The walleye sampled in this survey ranged from 12.8 to 22.8 inches with an average of 18.5 inches.  The average weight was 2.6 pounds.Northern pike abundance was normal for this lake.  Their presence has bounced from normal to low and back to normal over the years.  For Spectacle Lake, it appears the northern pike population thrives on one to three dominant year-class hatches.  It is these natural hatches which hold their numbers at an adequate level.  Past stocking attempts have worked on occasion to bolster their numbers, but not always.  A  management tool such as plant protection or enhancement are sometimes used as a means to sustain a healthy pike population.  Standing bulrush and cattail beds along the shore and other submerged plants make for excellent northern pike spawning habitat.  Removal of the natural plants would no doubt reduce the fish production in the lake.  The northern pike sampled in this survey ranged from 14.6 to 31.5 inches with an average of 21.2 inches.  The average weight was 2.2 pounds.  These fish were represented by ages one through seven with 56% being age three.  They were all growing at normal rates.Night electrofishing is a technique used to sample the largemouth bass.  The sample of bass (37.4 bass/hr) ranged in length from 6.0 to 17.9 inches, averaging 11.1 inches.  Ages two through nine were sampled indicating good natural reproduction and exhibiting normal growth.  This was the first time Spectacle Lake was electrofished by the DNR, and it will continue on a 5-year rotation.  Seining sampled several of this year's bass that averaged 2.30 inches on August 30, 1996.Bluegill abundance was normal for this lake type, which was typical of catches in past surveys.  This year's catch sampled bluegill from 2.8 to 7.0 inches with an average of 4.9 inches.  Seining sampled many bluegill young-of-year and they averaged 1.14 inches on August 30, 1996.  During spring electrofishing, bluegill were seen by the thousands.  All bluegill aged were growing at normal rates.Two methods, gillnets and trapnets measured black crappie abundance.  Catches were normal in both types of nets.  Their abundance has varied in past survey from being mostly normal to sometimes low, although this year's catch was the highest of all surveys.  Crappie sampled ranged from 4.3 to 10.6 inches with an average of 6.6 inches.  They were ages two through five with age two fish making up 60% of the catch.  These two-year-old fish averaged 7.0 inches at capture and will be the dominant crappie year-class common to anglers in the next couple of years.  Seining sampled no crappie from this year's hatch.Historically, yellow perch have carried low populations in Spectacle Lake and this survey was no different from past surveys.  Along with these natural low levels, Spectacle Lake has a good population of walleye and northern pike, and it is likely that their predation helps keep the perch numbers at low levels.  Seining sampled a small amount of this year's hatch and they were 2.15 inches on August 30th.While recorded in normal abundance during past surveys, the pumpkinseed levels were high this year.  They ranged in length from 3.6 to 7.2 inches and averaged 5.8 inches. To most anglers, pumpkinseed sunfish are generally considered no different from the bluegill and are harvested just the same.Eight other species were represented in the netting gear: black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead,  hybrid sunfish, white sucker, banded killifish, blacknose shiner, and emerald shiner.  The brown bullhead was sampled in high abundance while the remaining species were sampled at normal abundance levels for this lake type.Prepared by:  Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Spectacle Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff on 25 August 2022. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites. A 50-foot seine was used to sample eight sites, a 15-foot seine was used at one site, and deep, soft sediments with abundant water lilies prevented the use of seines at one sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 16 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and one species (Green Sunfish) that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate the fish community of Spectacle Lake is affected by disturbance as indicated by an FIBI score very near to the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Rum River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

THE MEDIAN LENGTH WAS 23.0-23.9 INCHES AND THE MEAN WT WAS 2.84 PDS. THE 11 FISH SAMPLED SHOWED AVG GROWTH AT ALL ANNULUS FORMATIONS. THE BLACK CRAPPIE AND THE YELLOW PERCH GAVE EXTREMELY LOW POPULATIONS AS HAS BEEN THE HISTORICAL NATURE OF THESE SPECIES. THE WALLEYE WAS EXTREMELY LOW AT 0.17 PER GILLNET SET AND HAS SHOWN A REAL DECREASE FROM THE 1982 NETTING OF 0.33  PER SET. ONLY 3 FISH WERE SAMPLED AND SHOWED SLOW GROWTH AT II AND IV ANNULUS AND AVG GROWTH AT I,III,V,VI,VII AND VIII. THE WALLEYE WAS NEAR THE LOCAL MEDIAN IN THE TRAPNET CATCH AND WERE OF GOOD SIZE WITH A MEAN WT OF 6.15 PDS FOR ALL FISH TAKEN. THE BLUEGILL SUNFISH WAS HIGH AT 43.75 PER SET AND OF SMALL SIZE WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH OF 5.0 TO 5.4 INCHES. THE POPULATION HAS APPARENTLY INCREASED OVER THE 13.50 PER SET IN 1982, BUT WAS PREVIOUSLY EXTREMELY HIGH AT 110.00 PER SET IN 1979 AND 49.80 PER SET IN 1975. THE HYBRID SUNFISH WAS OVER TWICE THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 2.15 WHILE THE PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH WAS SLIGHTLY LOW AT 4.00 PER SET. BOTH SPECIES WERE OF SMALL AVG SIZE AT 5.0-5.4 AND 4.0-4.4 INCHES.

                "narrative": "<p>  Spectacle Lake has been surveyed every 3 to 5 years since 1975 and during 1965.  During 1991 Spectacle Lake was assessed with 6 gillnets, 6 trapnets, and 3 shoreline stations were seined.  The following paragraphs describe the status of the gamefish populations in Spectacle Lake.\n  Although Spectacle Lake is classified as a centrarchid-largemouth bass lake, the operational plan requires that walleye fingerlings be stocked.  The walleye net catch has remained at low levels.  The largemouth bass and panfish catch rates and fish lengths are normal for lakes of this type.\n  The largemouth bass catch in trapnets (0.67/set) and gillnets (1.00/set) was near the lake class medians.  The gillnet catch improved when compared to the most recent surveys (1982 and 1986).  The largemouth bass lengths ranged from 5.0 to 17.9 inches with a median range of 15.0 to 15.9 inches.  The mean weight for the six fish captured in gillnets was 2.08 pounds and for the two fish captured in trapnets was 0.10 pounds.  The largemouth bass on average were heavier than expected for this lake class (third quartile 1.25 pounds).  Largemouth bass ranged in age from 4 to 9 years old.  Back-calculated lengths indicated slow growth for ages one through five and average for ages six through nine.  Young of the year (YOY) largemouth bass have been seined in previous surveys with two being captured during 1991.  Largemouth bass were stocked during 1967 following a winterkill in 1964-65 and since have maintained a naturally reproducing population.\n  The northern pike net catch (4.67/ set) increased from the 1986 survey (1.67/set) and was between the first quartile (4.33/set) and the median (7.50/set) for lakes of this type.  The northern pike ranged in length from 15.0 to 31.9 inches with a median range of 21.0 to 21.9 inches.  The average weight (2.41 pounds) was between the median (1.86 pounds) and third quartile (2.53 pounds) for this lake class.  Age analysis indicated fish of ages two through eight years old.  The average back-calculated lengths were similar to statewide averages.  Northern pike YOY were not captured with seines, however, age analysis indicated natural recruitment.\n  Only three walleye were captured during 1991 and one during the 1986 survey.  The walleye net catch (0.50/set) was below the first quartile (0.67/set) for lakes of this type, but increased from the 1986 survey (0.17/ set).  The historical high catch rate (4.80/set) in 1975 was probably the result of heavy stocking for several years following the winterkill in 1964-65.  The walleye ranged in length from 11.0 to 24.9 inches with a median range of 13.0 to 13.9 inches.  The average walleye weight (4.00 pounds) was heavier than expected for this lake class with the third quartile being 3.53 pounds.  The walleye ranged in age from two to seven years old.  The average back-calculated lengths indicated a normal growing population when compared to statewide averages.  YOY walleye were not captured during seining.\n  The bluegill net catch (33.67/set) was slightly above the lake class median (23.50/set) and has remained near the level of the 1986 survey (43.75/set).  The bluegill ranged in length from 3.5 to 6.9 inches with a median range of 5.0 to 5.4 inches.  The average weight (0.07 pounds) was below the first quartile (0.12 pounds).  Bluegill YOY were not seined during the 1991 survey, but have been captured in previous surveys.\n  The black crappie net catch of 0.67 per set (two fish) was only slightly above the first quartile (0.65/set).  Historically the black crappie population in Spectacle Lake is low with only two fish captured during the 1986 survey and none captured in other surveys.  Natural recruitment exists, but YOY black crappie were not captured in seines.\n  The yellow perch net catch of 0.17 per net (one fish) was far below the lake class's first quartile (2.00/set), but typical for Spectacle Lake.  Yellow perch YOY were not seined during this or previous surveys.\n  The pumpkinseed net catch (9.33/set) was above the median (5.92/set), but slightly below the third quartile (11.29/set).  Three other species were captured during the survey (white sucker, yellow bullhead, and brown bullhead) in addition to hybrid sunfish.  Net catches for the bullhead species were near the lake class medians, while white sucker net catches were slightly below the first quartile.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spectacle lake is a 240 acre basin managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into lake classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Spectacle is assigned to lake class 32.  In order to compare the present fish population to others in the lake class and to evaluate management goals, Spectacle lake was netted and electrofished during the summer of 2001.The lake's management plan calls for walleye fingerling stocking every three years and northern pike stocking when net catches fall below 3.5 per gillnet.  Long range management goals are to maintain the northern pike population near 4.0 per gillnet lift with a 2.5 pound average, maintain largemouth bass catch at 35 bass per hour with a 1 pound average, and to maintain a walleye population at 2 per gillnet with a 2 pound average.The gillnet catches for northern pike, walleye, and yellow bullhead were within the normal range when compared to other lakes in Spectacles lake class.  Walleye were sampled below the management goal at 1.0 per gillnet.  Walleye were quality sized with a 3.3 pound and 21.2 inch average which reaches the management goal for size.  The 1996 survey sampled walleye at a slightly higher catch rate (1.2 /net) but a smaller size.  Walleye year classes were aparently the result of stocking, based on scale and otolith information.  Of the 4 year classes sampled (1989, 1993, 1994, and 1996), only 1994 , which accounted for only one fish, was a non-stocking year.  Converesly, northern pike were sampled above the management goal at 8.5 per gillnet, but were below the goal weight averaging 1.8 pounds.  Sixty seven percent of the northern catch was between 18 and 22 inches.  Northerns were a half pound larger but less abundant in the 1996 survey.  Scale aging indicated that year classes were present from 1995 through 2000.  The 1998 year class accounted for 60% of the catch.  These 3 year old fish averaged 20.8 inches and should provide angling opportunity for several years.  The gillnet catch for brown bullhead was above normal compared to other class 32 lakes.  Sampled fish ranged from 10.2 to 13.1 inches.  The brown bullhead catch more than doubled since the 1996 survey with little change in size.   Largemouth bass met management goals both in size and abundance.  The electrofishing catch rate increased from 37.4 per hour in 1996 to 54.5 currently.  Lengths ranged from 6.1 to 18.0 inches with a 12.1 inch and 1.1 pound average.  Scale samples indicated that sampled bass were distributed fairly uniformly among the the 1993 to 1999 year classes.  Bass growth was normal compared to the statwide average. The blugill trapnet catch (11.8/set) was within the normal range for the lakeclass, typical of Spectacle lake surveys.  Sampled blugill ranged from 3.4 to 7.0 inches with a 4.9 inch mean.  This size structure was nearly identicle to the 1996 survey.  Black Crappie and yellow perch were scarce and absent respectively.  Although the 1996 survey reported record numbers of black crappie, both species have been very low in abundance historically.  Adequate spawning habitat appears to be available.  Shoreline seining failed to sample young of the year black crappie or yellow perch.  Young largemouth bass and bluegill were present in the seine hauls indicating adequate reproduction.The 2001 catch indicated that northern pike and walleye are both close to management goals.  Other species present during the assessement included black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead.   </p>",

Maximum depth is 51 feet.  The shoreline length is 3.7 miles and has a maximum fetch of 0.8 miles.  A paved public boat access is located on the south shore with parking for approximately eighteen rigs.  Despite heavy shoreline development and recreational use, the lake maintains good water quality with water clarity readings in the 10 foot range. <br> \n <br> \nSpectacle Lake anglers will find an abundant population of moderate sized Largemouth Bass.  Although bass up to 15 inches were present, most were between 10 and 12 inches.  Walleye were likewise present in catchable numbers and harvestable size.  The Northern Pike population, while fairly typical in abundance and average size, may provide some memorable fishing with fish in excess of 30 inches present.   Panfish, although certainly available to anglers, may better be targeted in another lake if harvest is desired.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spectacle is a 240-acre lake in western Isanti County.  The nearest town is Pine Brook.  Of the 240 acres, 157 (65%) are shallower than 15 feet (littoral area).  Maximum depth is 51 feet.  The shoreline length is 3.7 miles and has a maximum fetch of 0.8 miles.  Despite heavy shoreline development and recreational use, the lake maintains good water quality with secchi disk readings in the 10\u0019 average range.  Since 1997, the number of residences on Spectacle Lake has increased from 131 to 148, an 11% increase.   <br> \n <br> \nSpectacle Lake is managed primarily for walleye, largemouth bass, northern pike and panfish.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing have been assigned classifications based on their physical, chemical and biological similarities.  Spectacle is assigned to lake class 32, or bass/pan-fish lakes.  Various stockings have occurred through the years of mainly northern pike and walleye.  The present fisheries management plan calls for walleye fingerlings to be stocked every third year at a rate of one pound per littoral area.  A state owned northern pike spawning area is located on the south-east side of the lake.  The spawning area has not been operated since 1996 due to a statewide decrease in northern pike stocking quotas.     <br> \n <br> \nIn order to compare the present fish population to others in this lake class and to evaluate management goals, Spectacle Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2006.  Gear sampling types for fish consisted of standard gillnets, standard trap-nets and night electrofishing for largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-nine species of aquatic plants were sampled throughout the lake.  Fairly diverse populations of various emergent, submergent and floating-leafed species were present.  Purple loosestrife, and exotic species was sampled for the first time.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (2.5 per net) was above normal compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type, but close to the historical average for Spectacle Lake.  Average weight per fish was high at 2.3 pounds.  One-third of the walleyes captured were over 20 inches in length.  Four age classes were present in the sample and growth was fast. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 6.8 fish per net which was normal compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average weight was 2.0 pounds.  Ages two through seven were sampled with age class two and three showing a strong presence.  The northern pike that were sampled ranged from 13.7 to 31.3 inches in length with an average of 20.7 inches.  About 27 percent of the northern pike were over 24 inches in length.  Growth was slightly faster than normal.  Northern pike catch rates in Spectalce Lake have increased from a historic low of 1.7 fish/gillnet in 1975 and 1986 to 6.8 fish/gillnet in 2006, while average weight per fish has dropped steadily from historic highs of 3.7 pounds per fish in 1975 to 2.0 pounds in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nNighttime electrofishing was used to sample the largemouth bass population.  The sample (32.9 bass/hour) ranged in length from 8.2 to 19.9 inches, averaging 12.3 inches.  The number of bass sampled was down slightly from what was sampled in 1996 (37.4 bass/hour), the first time that largemouth bass were electrofished on Spectacle Lake.   However, the average size of the fish increased from 11.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnet catch was 10.5 fish per net, which is normal compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and typical of catches in past surveys.  Bluegill ranged from 3.6 to 7.1 inches with an average of 5.1 inches.  Eighty percent of the bluegills sampled were less than six inches.  Growth was slow with fish at age 3 reaching an average of four inches. <br> \n <br> \nBoth trapnets and gillnets sampled black crappies.  The trapnets caught an average of 0.6 fish per net.  The gillnets caught an average of 0.8 fish per net.  Black crappies ranged in size from 4.9 to 9.7 inches in length.  The average size was 8.3 inches.  Growth was normal with 50% of the sample from the 2002 year class. <br> \n <br> \nSix other species were sampled in the netting gear: brown bullhead, pumpkinseed and yellow bullhead, yellow perch, hybrid sunfish and white sucker.  Brown bullheads ranged in length from 5.6 to 13.5 inches with an average size of 8.0 inches.  A total of 18 pumpkinseed sunfish were captured.  Their sizes ranged from 4.0 to 7.0 in length.  The average size was 5.8 inches.   One white sucker, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish and yellow perch were sampled.  These species have historically been sampled in fairly low numbers on this lake. </p>",
