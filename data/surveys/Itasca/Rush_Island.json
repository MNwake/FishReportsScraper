Although it has been stocked 10 times in the last 16 years with walleye fry, only 2 walleyes were sampled in this survey. The catch of 0.2/gill net is well below what has been sampled in the past.       Northern pike were sampled just below the lake class median at 5.6/gill net.  The average weight of those sampled was 2.7 pounds with a mean length of 23.5 inches.     The lake continues to support an abundant yellow perch population as it has in the past.  The gill net catch of 333.1/set is the highest ever recorded.  The perch ranged in length from 4.8-11.6 inches and had a mean length of 8.0 inches.     Bluegill, although never abundant in the lake, were sampled at their highest levels in this survey.  They ranged in length from 5.4-8.7 inches with a mean length of 7.0 inches.       Black crappie and largemouth bass, which have been sampled in the past, were not sampled in this testnetting.  They were, however, sampled in the seining conducted during this survey.           </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rush Island Lake is a 296 acre lake located 4 miles west of Spring Lake, MN.  The lake is lightly developed and has a good public access on the south shore.  The lake is connected to Birdseye Lake and then to Sand Lake by Rush Island Creek.  Rush Island is a hard-water lake with moderate clarity and fertility.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2013 lake management plan listed Northern Pike and Walleye as primary management species, with Bluegill and Black Crappie as secondary management species.  A standard lake survey was conducted in June 2021 to assess the status of the fish community and to evaluate the effectiveness of Walleye fry stocking. <br> \n <br> \nRush Island Lake has typically produced high numbers of Northern Pike with poor to fair size structure.  The 2021 gill-net catch was well above the expected range for similar lakes and was a record high for Rush Island.  Size structure remained poor; fish ranged from 12.6 to 33.1 inches with an average length of 20.9 inches.  Ages 1-8 were represented in the sample, with age 3 the most frequently sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with pike reaching 22.7 inches at age 4.  Rush Island provides good opportunity to catch numbers of pike under 22 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill-net catch was below average compared to lakes with similar habitat, but fairly typical for Rush Island.  Size structure was favorable; Walleye ranged from 11.5 to 26.9 inches with an average length of 18.2 inches.  Six year classes from ages 2 through 10 were represented in the sample.  Only one fish corresponded to a non-stocked year.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with Walleye exceeding 16 inches after 5 years of growth.  Walleye fry had been stocked in odd-numbered years since 2017.  Prior to that, Walleye fingerlings or yearlings were stocked in odd-numbered years.  Stocking appears to support a low-density Walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nRush Island Lake has a history of extremely high Yellow Perch catches in previous surveys.  The 2021 catch rate was a record low of 25/net.  The sharp decline in perch numbers is likely related to the record high catch of Northern Pike.  Yellow Perch size structure was modest; sampled perch averaged 6.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap-net catch rate was average compared to similar lakes.  Size structure was fair; sampled fish ranged from 3.5 to 8.7 inches with an average length of 6.6 inches.  Eight percent of the sampled fish exceeded 8 inches.  Ages 2-9 were represented in the sample, with age 5 the most frequently sampled.  Growth was considered fast with Bluegill averaging 6.7 inches after 5 years of growth.  Rush Island Lake provides fair angling opportunities for moderate-sized Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nGill-net and trap-net catches for Black Crappie were low compared to similar lakes, but typical for Rush Island.  The few crappie sampled were small, averaging 7.7 inches from gill nets and 4.8 inches from trap nets.  A spring targeted survey would likely provide better information on the crappie population.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test-nets included Black, Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee and White Sucker.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rush Island Lake is a 296-acre lake located 4 miles west of Spring Lake, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 32 ft and a littoral area of 99 acres.  Rush Island Lake is in lake class 31 and has a public access on the south shore.  The lake is connected to Sand Lake by Rush Island Creek.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net catch was 16.7/net, which was much higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Gill-net catch rates in past assessments have generally been increasing and were greater than 10/net in two of the three most recent assessments.  Size structure was poor with few fish greater than 28 inches and no fish larger than 34 inches.  In general, lakes with abundant northern pike populations have poor size structure.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 25 inches by age six. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help improve northern pike size structure by releasing fish larger than 24 inches.  These larger northern pike often eat smaller northern pike which reduces their abundance, improves growth rates, and allows fish to attain a larger size in a shorter time span.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net catch was 2.5/net, which was in the middle of the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have been highly variable from 0.2 to 8.2/gill net.  Rush Island has been stocked with fingerlings at rates of 2 to 4 lbs/littoral acre in odd years since 1997.  The stocking rate is higher than the standard stocking rate of 1lb/littoral acre.  Size structure was good with walleye up to 27 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 18 inches by age five. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net catch was 18.0/net, which was similar to the average for similar lakes and was the highest catch rate ever sampled.  Catch rates in past assessments have generally been low varying from 1.0 to 5.2/trap net.  Size structure was poor with few fish over 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie trap-net catch was 0.6/net, which was similar to the lower end of the expected range.  No black crappie were sampled in gill nets.  Catch rates in past assessments have generally been low, varying from 0.2 to 2.1/ trap net.  Fish varied in length from 8 to 10 inches.  Growth was good with fish averaging 9.8 inches by age four.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch was 108.0/gill net and was more than double the expected range.  Catch rates in past assessments have been extremely high varying from 81 to 333/gill net.  Size structure was poor with few fish greater than 9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include brown bullhead, bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee, and yellow bullhead.     <br> \n <br> \nLakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by practicing selective harvest. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rush Island Lake is a 296 acre lake located 4 miles west of Spring Lake, MN.  The lake is lightly developed and has a good public access on the south shore.  The lake is connected to Birdseye Lake and then to Sand Lake by Rush Island Creek.  Rush Island Lake is in ecological lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this class include Little Bowstring, Cedar and Little Turtle Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch was above the expected range at 11.5/net.  Catch rates have varied from 1.9 to 16.7/net in previous assessments.  Catches have exceeded the lake class third quartile in four of the past five surveys.  Size structure was fairly poor; gill-net sampled pike ranged from 17.5 to 27.6 inches, with a mean length of 21.8 inches.  Ages 2-7 were identified from scale samples.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with pike reaching 23.3 inches at age 4. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill-net catch was within the expected range, but down from the previous assessment at 1.8/net.  Catch rates have varied from 0.2 to 8.2/net in previous surveys.  Size structure was modest and no preferred-length (20 inches and over) fish were captured.  Sampled walleye ranged from 13.8 to 19.9 inches with a mean length of 17.3 inches.  Ages 4, 5 and 7 were identified from scale samples, with 9 of 11 fish (82%) corresponding to years of fingerling stocking.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with walleye reaching 14.0 inches at age four.  The lack of preferred-length walleye and northern pike in the test-nets may be an indication of high angler harvest. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill-net catch was above the lake class expected range at 101.7/net, but similar to the previous assessment and the long-term average for the lake.  Size structure was poor; sampled perch ranged from 5.2 to 9.2 inches, with a mean length of 6.8 inches.  Only 3% of perch exceeded 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trap-net catch rate was within the expected range at 7.1/net.  Size structure was poor; sampled fish ranged from 2.0 to 8.4 inches with a mean length of 5.4 inches.  Only 5% of bluegill exceeded 8 inches.  Bluegill catch rates did not exceed the lake class first quartile until the two most recent assessments.  Bluegill were not aged in this assessment, but historical information suggests bluegill growth and size structure was better in surveys prior to 1990. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for tullibee was above the expected range at 7.0/net.  Catch rates in previous assessments have varied considerably, from 0.2 to 8.0/net.  Sampled tullibee ranged from 7.5 to 17.9 inches with a mean length of 11.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test-nets included black and yellow bullhead, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nAs part of a statewide IBI (index of biotic integrity) project, back-pack electrofishing and shoreline seining was used to sample nearshore fishes not normally captured in traditional test-nets.  Additional fish sampled with IBI gears included Iowa darter, Johnny darter, black crappie, blackchin shiner, bluntnose minnow, central mudminnow, creek chub, golden shiner and tadpole madtom.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rush Island Lake is 296 acres and is located nine miles west of Talmoon, MN.  The lake is managed for walleye, northern pike, and panfish.  Shoreline development is light with eight cabins present and a public access is located on the east shore off County Road 130.  The lake has two inlets and one outlet.  The outlet drains into Sand Lake and is an important spawning site for walleye migrating from Sand Lake.  The DNR has contracted a trapper to remove beaver dams and other obstructions to improve the spawning conditions.Walleye gill-net catch rate was 4.3/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes. Historical walleye abundance has varied from 0.2 to 8.2/gill net.  The 2000 assessment represents the highest abundance since 1975.  Walleye varied in length from 13 to 27 inches.  Size structure was excellent with several fish larger than 19 inches.  Seventy-seven percent of fish sampled correspond to stocked years.  Walleye growth was similar to statewide averages.  Past fry stocking was unsuccessful, likely due to the abundant yellow perch.  Currently, walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year at two pounds per acre, which is twice the recommended rate to take advantage of abundant yellow perch.  Anglers should consider releasing walleye greater than 19 inches to maintain the quality size structure of the walleye population.Northern pike gill-net catch was 13.3/set which was higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Historical abundance has varied from 1.9 to 12.0/gill net.  Size structure was moderate with a few fish greater than 24 inches.  Increasing northern pike abundance can lead to reduced growth and poor size structure common in many lakes in the area.Yellow perch abundance remains very high with a catch rate of 217.8/gill net, which is much higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance of yellow perch remains high, despite heavy walleye stocking and abundant northern pike.  Historical abundance has varied from 81 to 333/gill net.  The abundance in 2000 declined from the previous survey, thus it appears that heavy walleye stocking may be reducing their abundance.  Size structure was generally poor with few fish greater than 9 inches.  Black crappie abundance remains low with a gill-net catch of 0.2/set and a trap-net catch of 0.2/set.  Historical abundance for gill-net catches has varied from 0 to 2.3/set.  Tullibee gill-net catch was 7.2/set which is higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Historical abundance has varied from 2.0 to 7.7/gill net.  Bluegill trap-net catch was 3.0/set which was lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Historical abundance has varied from 0.1 to 5.2/trap net.  Size structure in 2000 was poor with no fish larger than 8 inches sampled.Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through fishing, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent lawn wastes and sediment from entering the lake.  In addition, lakeshore owners should avoid using fertilizers.  However, if fertilizers are used, lakeshore owners should consider a brand containing no phosphorous.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Rush-Island Lake was conducted on August 16, 2021, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample one station, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Rush-Island Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Big Fork River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
