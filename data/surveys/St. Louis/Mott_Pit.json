The pit is now about 18 acres in size and has a maximum depth of 80 feet. The water surface elevation varies depending on local precipitation. Water quality is good and there is sufficient coldwater habitat to support trout species. The pit is managed as a stream trout lake and is stocked both in the spring and fall with rainbow trout by the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB).  There is a unimproved gravel boat ramp on the east shore of the pit. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 fisheries survey consisted of three gill nets set in water between 9-35 feet deep. A temperature/oxygen profile on 6/3/2014 indicated good trout habitat throughout the water column. The fish catch consisted of three species, rainbow trout, white sucker and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one rainbow trout was caught during the 2014 survey (0.3/net). This individual was 11.0 inches in length and was probably stocked during the previous fall. Although the net catch was low, it is not uncommon for rainbow trout. Frequently, their tendency to suspend and feed up in the water column make them difficult to capture in assessment nets.  <br> \n <br> \nThe white sucker and yellow perch caught during the 2014 survey were generally small. Only three suckers over 15 inches in length were caught. Other gamefish species have been present in Mott Pit during previous surveys including walleye, northern pike and bluegill, apparently all stocked illegally. None of these species were present in the 2014 survey.</p>",
