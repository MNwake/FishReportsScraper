                "narrative": "<p>A survey of near shore fish species was conducted on July 30, 2015 by IBI Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 9 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 1 site due to abundant bulrush and deep water.  Nearshore sampling captured 7 species of fish.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed dominated the catch.   <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gillnet and trapnet data from a June 2015 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for Silver Lake is meeting expectations compared to similar lakes; of note was an absence of any fish species classified as tolerant in the FIBI survey. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. Silver Lake is located in the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed.  A review of stressor information found low watershed disturbance (14% - NLCD 2011 data) and a 2015 Score the Shore Survey assessed the shoreline habitat as fair; there are approximately 10 docks/km of shoreline. <br> \n</p>",

Yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed and yellow perch net catches indicate an average population with net catch rates falling between the first and third quartile of the Brainerd Area median for similar type lakes. White sucker, black bullhead and black crappie abundance is low with net catches below the first quartile of the area median. The northern pike population has shown no change in abundance since 1981 with numbers remaining high. The length-frequency range was excellent, with size from 10.5 to 30.9 inches long. The median size was 23.3 inches long and weighed 3.1 lbs. Year classes 1-7 were represented in the nets with annulus 1 fish exhibiting a fast growth rate and annulus 2-7 exhibiting a normal or average growth rate in comparison to statewide averages. Yellow and brown bullhead have remained relatively abundant with the majority under 9 inches long. The bluegill population has shown no change in the overabundance, or small size of fish present since the 1981 survey. Age classes present in the nets were 4-6 with growth rate average in comparison to statewide averages. The largemouth bass population remains low with fish only caught during seining, when young-of-the- year largemouth bass were caught. Yellow perch abundance has increased slightly from the last 2 surveys with year classes 3-5 present in the nets and all three classes exhibiting a slow growth rate.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver lake is a 214 acre lake located 4.5 miles northeast of Merrifield in Crow Wing County.  The majority of the lake is shallow with 90% of the lake 15 feet deep or less.  Maximum depth is 23 feet.  A public access is located on the west shoreline.  Extensive bulrush beds occur around the lake.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was very high at 23.0 per gillnet.  Average size was 20.1 inches and 2.0 lbs.  Northern pike up to 34.6 inches were captured, with 17% at least 24 inches in length.  Voluntary catch and release of these larger northern pike will help create a balanced population.    <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were captured in low numbers in gillnets (0.8/net), and in average numbers in trapnets (0.9/net).  Crappies up to 11 inches were sampled, with 69% measuring at least 8 inches in length.  Bluegills were captured in high numbers at 63.0/ trapnet.  Their size was a bit small with an average length of 5.6 inches, with only 2% measuring at least 7 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Silver Lake, but they are located in the local area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
