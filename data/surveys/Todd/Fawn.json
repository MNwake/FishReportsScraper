                "narrative": "<p>Fawn Lake has a history of periodic partial winterkills which contribute tofluctuations in fish population structure.  The latest partial winterkill occurredduring the winter of 1988-89.  Small-sized black bullhead and bluegill wereabundant in 1994.  Winterkill lakes generally favor high populations of bullheadsbecause bullheads can survive low oxygen conditions better than other species. After winterkills the fish populations respond rapidly to increased foodavailability and reduced competition.  One favorable consequence of the latestwinterkill has been good growth rates of northern pike and bluegill.     Northern pike numbers have decreased since 1989, but are currently atdesirable levels.  Good numbers of pike larger than 24 inches are present and anangler reported catching a seven pounder.  Coinciding with a decline in numbers ofnorthern pike has been an increase in yellow perch abundance.  Perch are animportant forage species which help to maintain good growth of predator specieslike northern pike.  Perch ranged in size between 4.5 and 10 inches.     Largemouth bass are present in the lake but observations from the Fisheriesfield crew and anglers indicate that bass are small.  If the lake does notexperience winterkill in the next several years the size structure of bass (as wellas sunfish) should improve because conditions in the lake (habitat and communitystructure) are favorable.      Walleye are present in low numbers.  The lake was used as a walleye rearingpond by DNR Fisheries during 1981, 1982 and 1992 but currently have no plans tocontinue using the lake for that purpose.  Very few walleye have been caught byanglers in recent years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fawn Lake is a relatively small lake with excellent water quality.  Maximum depth is about 20 feet, but most of the lake is less than 10 feet.  With a secchi disk reading of 15 feet, submerged vegetation covers much of the lake bottom.  The high water level has also increased available habitat as the marsh on the south end of the lake was navigable by boat at the time of the survey.  The lake has moderate shoreline development mostly on the west and east sides of the lake.  Native vegetation remains along much of the shoreline.  Fawn has also experienced partial winterkills in the past with the last known occurence in 1988-89.  The presence and size of some of the fish species, such as largemouth bass, suggests that low oxygen has not been a limiting factor for some time.    Most of the centrachid species, bluegills, pumpkinseeds, largemouth bass, and rock bass, are considered abundant when compared to similar type lakes.  While small panfish were more common, some nice size bluegills and pumpkinseeds over six inches were also seen in the survey.  Most of the largemouth bass seen were under 10 inches in length which may mean good bass fishing in another year.  An occasional large bass can be found with work and patience.  All of the black crappies seen in the survey were under 9 inches but lake survey nets can be ineffective at sampling crappies during the summer.      Northern pike numbers have increased since the last survey and despite being plentiful the average size seen in the survey was not bad at 21 inches.  Yellow perch abundance has dropped which may be a result of the higher pike numbers.  Perch can be an important food fish for the northern pike and largemouth bass.    Two species of bullheads, brown and blacks, were sampled in the survey.  Both populations were dominated by small fish as none of the bullheads were over 10 inches in length.      Anglers are encouraged to harvest northern pike under 24 inches in length and release the larger pike.  Limiting harvest of the larger bluegills will also work toward a more balanced fish community.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Fawn Lake is a relatively small lake with excellent water clarity.  Maximum depth is about 20 feet, but most of the lake is less than 10 feet.  The lake has lush submergent vegetation beds that grow down to a depth of 17 feet.  Sand was the most abundant substrate around the lake.   Most of the property around the lake is private and the access is owned by the Sylvan Shores Property Owners Association.   Although development around the lake has increased, most of the property owners have limited their impact around the shoreline zone which should help preserve the water quality.   <br> \n       The fish community in Fawn Lake was dominated by northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Northern pike numbers have increased since the last survey and as a result the average size has decreased.  The majority of pike caught in the lake survey were less than 21 inches in length but some larger pike are present.  Anglers reported trolling for pike in the summer and that winter fishing for pike was popular.  The largemouth bass population appears to be abundant and dominated by smaller fish.  Fawn Lake also has an abundant bluegill population.  Anglers may have fast action with the bluegill, but the fish are likely to be small, although fish up to eight inches were measured in the survey.  Anglers do have a chance to catch some quality black crappie as fish up to twelve inches were captured in the lake survey.  Three other panfish species inhabit the lake including pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass.  More quality size pumpkinseed sunfish over seven inches were observed in the lake survey than bluegill, with some up to nine inches measured. <br> \n       Yellow perch numbers appear to be low which may be a result of high northern pike numbers.  Perch can be an important prey species for northern pike and largemouth bass.  The only roughfish to be sampled in the lake survey was brown bullhead.  The last lake survey also caught some black bullhead but they were absent in this survey.   All of the bullhead caught were over ten inches in length with some over thirteen inches measured. <br> \n       Anglers are encouraged to harvest northern pike under 24 inches in length and release the larger pike.  Limiting the harvest of larger bluegill will also work toward a more balanced fish community.  Continuing to maintain native vegetation along the lake shore and using good land management practices in the watershed are encouraged to help preserve the water quality and fish habitat in Fawn Lake. <br> \n</p>",

This sampling was undertaken primarily to determine the effectiveness of daytime shocking in assessing the Largemouth Bass population with secondary interest in the panfish species.  Due to its small size and limited access to the public, Fawn is a relatively low priority lake for intensive sampling with gill nets and trap nets.  The lake has also shown some susceptibility to partial winterkills.   Sampling in 2018 consisted of 0.64 hours of on-time effort while traveling around the entire shoreline in varying depths and distances from shore.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 39 Largemouth Bass were netted and measured ranging in length from 3.7 to 18.5 inches suggesting the presence of many year classes and no recent winterkill events.  Mean length for bass was 9 inches and PSS was 73.7.  Two Black Crappie were netted and measured with the largest being 10 inches.  A single Northern Pike was seen but not netted.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed were also observed in good numbers but few appeared to be of sizes which would interest anglers.   Daytime electrofishing proved to be a fairly effective method for the species targeted.</p>",

The WALLEYES appear to have been eliminated by the partial winterkill.  BLACK BULLHEADS have decreased from the last survey but are still over abundant.  BROWN BULLHEAD numbers are also high, but they bigger than the black bullheads.  Some LARGEMOUTH BASS and BLACK CRAPPIES were taken in the natural reproduction check.  YELLOW PERCH have declined significantly from the last survey and are well below the gillnet median.</p>",
