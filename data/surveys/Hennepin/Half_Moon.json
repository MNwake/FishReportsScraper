                "narrative": "<p>Half Moon is a 30-acre lake located in the Baker Park Reserve operated by the Three Rivers Park District.  There is a parking lot, carry-in canoe access, and fishing pier on the west side of the lake.  No gas boat motors are permitted.  The fishery includes bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch, largemouth bass, and northern pike.  An assessment was conducted during July 2009 to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe two most abundant species in the 2009 assessment were bluegill and black crappie.  Both were sampled at a rate of 17/gill net.  Bluegill averaged 6.2 inches and 0.17 pounds.  Sixty-nine percent were 6 inches or longer and 4% were 8 inches or longer.  The largest measured 8.2 inches and 0.37 pounds.  Growth was comparable to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area.  Bluegill were 4.4 inches long at age 3.  Back crappie averaged 7.3 inches and 0.21 lbs.  Thirteen percent were 8 inches or greater and the largest measured 8.6 inches and 0.33 lbs.  Growth of black crappie was slower than other similar lakes in the West Metro Area, with fish reaching 6.3 inches long at age 3. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were moderately abundant (7.0/gill net) and mean individual weight was high at 5.87 pounds.  Mean length was 29.3 inches and the largest pike was 34.3 inches.  All northern pike sampled were longer than 21 inches and 77% were longer than 28 inches.  Growth was slow until age 3, then it increased to near average when compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area.  Northern pike were 16.8 inches long at age 3. <br> \nThree walleye were sampled measuring 15.9, 20.1 and 25.7 inches in length.  Walleye are not stocked into Half Moon Lake, nor have they ever been documented.  It is likely these fish have migrated from the connection to nearby Lake Independence during spring high water events. <br> \n <br> \nTwo largemouth bass were sampled (5.9 and 10.3 inches), however, passive sampling gear such as gill nets are not an effective method for collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in the assessment in relatively low abundance were yellow perch, bowfin, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, white sucker, and black, brown, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",
