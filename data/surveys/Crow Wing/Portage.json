                "narrative": "<p>The northern pike net catches followed the trend of above average populations for this chain of lakes. The northern pike catch rates exceed the third quartile of the Brainerd Area median for similar lake types which ranged between 230 to 510 acres and have a maximum depth of greater than 36 feet. The yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed and bluegill net catches also indicate above average populations for lakes in the Brainerd Area that fall into the lake group 6. The bowfin, northern cisco, white sucker, black bullhead, brown bullhead, rock bass and walleye exhibited average populations since the net catches fall between the first and third quartile of the area median for lakes with the same characteristics. Black crappie and yellow perch net catches fell below the first quartile indicating a below average population. The northern pike population indicates a steady increase, 4.0 in 1986, 13.66 in 1987 and 19.33 in 1988. The Portage Lake northern pike population has shown high levels dating back to 1950. In 1988 the northern pike ranged from 14.0 to 28.9 inches at time of capture.  Year classes 3 thru 7 were present in the nets, with annuli 3 at 14.15 inches and annuli 7 at 25.37 inches, showing average growth rates in comparison with the statewide average.  The yellow perch net catches showed a decline in population, 0.33 in 1988 compared to 6.67 in 1987 and 6.00 in 1986. The decline in yellow perch population seems logical with the increase shown in the northern pike population.</p>",

Access is possible through a channel from Hanks Lake.  Portage reaches a maximum depth of 37 feet, with 40% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 64.0/hr of run time.  Average length was 13.2 inches, and fish up to 17.6 inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch of 10.8/ gill net was above average for this lake class.  Average size was 18.1 inches and 1.8 lbs.  While the majority of the northern pike sampled were small, there were some nice northern pike present with 20% being 24 inches or larger.    Fish up to 35.2 inches were sampled.  By releasing these large northern pike, you can help improve the fish community.  Growth was average, with eight year classes present. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (cisco) were captured at a rate of 17.2/gill net.  This is well above average for this lake class, and the highest catch ever in Portage.   Tullibee are an important prey species for larger walleyes and northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trap net catch of 15.4/net was average for this lake class.  Average length was 6.3 inches, with 24% of the fish measuring 7 inches or larger.  Black crappies were caught in both trap nets and gill nets, but their numbers were low. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked by the lake association in 2008 and 2010. The walleye gill net catch of 1.5/net was average compared to similar lakes.  The walleyes captured were large with an average size of 23.3 inches and 4.9 lbs.  Walleyes up to 29 inches were captured. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species present include black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, rock bass, white sucker, yellow perch, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed.  Species sampled nearshore during IBI backpack electrofishing and seining included Iowa darter, Johnny darter, bluntnose minnow, fathead minnow, banded killifish, blackchin shiner, and blacknose shiner. <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike age classes present were 2-5, with 3 and 4 comprising 80% of the fish aged. Growth rate was average for all age classes except 5 (1 fish), which was slow in comparison to the statewide averages. The median size is 19.0 inches and averages 1.6 pounds.  The median size in 1969 and 1984 was approximately 15.5 inches, 1980 it was approximately 17.5 inches. Yellow perch age classes were 3 and 4.  Growth rates were slow for age class 3, and average for age class 4.  Yellow perch were 5.2 inches at annuli 3 and 5.3 inches at annuli 4. The population status of yellow perch is significantly and an all-time high for Portage Lake and significantly higher than Crooked and Hanks Lakes. One walleye was captured and it was eight years old and 19.1 inches at annuli 8. The northern cisco population is comparative with past nettings, except 1950 when zero were caught. The population has always been low to moderate in size, and is significantly lower than Crooked or Hanks.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Portage Lake was conducted on July 12, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine.  Nearshore sampling captured twenty-three species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead and Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Portage Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Portage Lake fully supported aquatic life use based on the FIBI.  The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

The northern pike catch rate exceeded the third quartile of the Brainerd Area median for similar lake types, which range between 230 to 510 acres and have a maximum depth of greater than 36 feet. Yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, yellow perch and walleye exhibited average populations since net catches fell between the first and third quartile of the area median for lakes exhibiting similar characteristics. Black crappie net catches fell below the first quartile, thus indicating a possible below average population, but insignificant number of net sets could have influenced the reliability. The northern pike population showed a significant increase from 1986 (4.0/gillnet) to 1987 (13.66/ gillnet), 1986 is the only year that the Portage Lake northern pike population did not show a high abundance level dating back to 1950. Northern pike in 1987 ranged from 10.0 to 24.9 inches long at the time of capture. The median size was 17.2 inches long and had a median weight of 1.2 lbs. Year classes 2 thru 4 were present in the nets with annuli 2 (10.1 inches) showing a slow growth rate while annuli 3 and 4 (19.45 inches) exhibiting an average growth rate in comparison to the statewide averages. The yellow perch net catches were higher (6.67/ gillnet) than in any other previous netting. The increase in the population began showing up in the 1986 netting and also local anglers started commenting about catching yellow perch for practically the first time. Age classes 3 thru 5 and age class 7 were present in the nets, with age class 4 comprising 57% of the net catch. The growth rate was a little below average when compared to statewide average growth rates. The walleye population indicated no significant change over past surveys with abundance remaining low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Portage is a 274 acre lake located about five miles northwest of Garrison.  It is a hardwater lake with good phosphorus fertility and average water clarity for the area.  About 40% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. Soils in shallow water (four foot depth or less) are primarily sand and gravel.  Aquatic plants are common to a depth of about 10 feet.  Limited stands of bulrush provide important spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide habitat for both predator and forage fishes as well as for a variety of organisms which are fed upon by fish.In a 1994 netting, northern pike was the most abundant gamefish and was present in \"high\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  Younger, smaller fish were most common, but several age classes were present and growth was good for older age classes.  Excellent spawning habitat is present in Rice Lake, via an inlet stream.  Walleyes were present in \"average\" numbers.  A number of age classes were present.  Growth appeared to be good.  Largemouth bass were also found in \"average\" numbers.  Bluegills were present in \"average\" numbers and they were slow growing.  Six age classes were sampled and about 5% of measured bluegills were 7.0 inches or more in length.  Pumpkinseeds, rock bass and black crappies were also found in \"average\" numbers.Yellow perch numbers were \"low\" compared to similar type lakes, while tullibees were taken in \"high\" numbers.  Both are important forage species for gamefish.  Bowfin (dogfish) and brown bullheads were also caught in \"high\" numbers and black and yellow bullheads were found in \"average\" numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Portage Lake is a 274 acre lake located in eastern Crow Wing County 5 miles northwest of Garrison.    Access is possible through a channel from Hanks Lake.  Portage reaches a maximum depth of 37', with 40% of the lake less than 15' deep. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch of 10.3/net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 17.9\", with only 5% at least 24\" in length.  Fish up to 34.1\" were sampled.  Voluntary catch and release of the few large northern pike present will help create a balanced population.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has been attempted in the past but return has been poor and thus walleyes are not currently stocked by the DNR into Portage.   However, walleyes have been stocked three times since 2008 by the lake association under a DNR permit.  The walleye gillnet catch of 1.8/net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 20.8\", with walleyes up to 31.3\" present.   <br> \n <br> \nTulibee (cisco) were sampled in high numbers at 11.3/gillnet.  Average length was 11.9\".  Tulibee are a great forage species for larger walleyes and northern pike.  Yellow perch, another important forage species, was sampled in low numbers at 0.7/gillnet. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Portage Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Access to Portage Lake is possible by launching at the Public Access at Crooked Lake and then taking channels to Hanks and then finally Portage.  Water was especially low in 2023 due to the drought conditions and made access into Portage Lake difficult to impossible by the end of the summer for many boats. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were present in high numbers (12.8/gill net).  Size, however, may be more of an issue for those hoping to target this species.  While fish up to 34.4\" were present, the average size of 20.9\" left a lot to be desired. <br> \n <br> \nSimilar was true for Largemouth bass.  An electrofishing catch rate of 196.5/hour more than tripled the previous survey's catch (64/hour), but average size was only 10.7\".  The largest fish measured was 16.7\". <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes have been stocked by the Lake Association since 2008 and while numbers weren't particularly high in 2023 at 1.7/gill net, this was still average for this type of lake and could offer some fishing opportunities.  Most of the fish were large, with an average length of 20.4\" and all the fish measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe panfish population didn't offer much for anglers to be excited about.  Black Crappie numbers were low at 0.3/gill net and the largest fish caught was 8.9\".  Bluegill numbers were a little better at 9.1/trap net, but only 12% of the fish were larger than 7\". <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) were sampled in high numbers at 18.3/gill net and had an average length of 11.8\".  Tullibee (Cisco) are an important forage fish for larger Northern Pike and Walleyes; they can also provide a unique fishing opportunity.  With most Tullibee (Cisco) fishing done through the ice, it may be difficult to target this population due to there being no direct winter access on Portage Lake. <br> \n <br> \nEurasian Watermilfoil is present in this chain of lakes.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells.  <br> \n</p>",
