Eighty-two percent of the bluegills measured were greater than six inches in length as compared to forty-nine percent during the 1980 netting.  The CPUE for yellow perch and walleyes was approximately triple the CPUE for the 1980 survey.  The CPUE for all other species has remained stable.  It is believed that the elevated numbers on yellow perch and the reduced numbers of bluegill are a result of competition and predation by the yellow perch on the YOY bluegill.  The reasons for the increase seen in yellow perch and the decline of the numbers of black bullhead cannot be adequately explained at this time.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Lake Marion was conducted the week of June 20th, 2017 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations with two sites sampled from the boat. Soft sediments with abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 8 native species of fish. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in July 2017 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Lake Marion based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Lake Pepin Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Based on net catches above the third quartile of the local median, the following species are present in high numbers in Lake Marion: white sucker, northern pike, yellow perch, black bullhead, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and black crappie.  Walleye were considered present in average numbers compared to local levels.  Carp and yellow bullhead numbers are low.  Northern pike numbers do not appear to be significantly different than in 1975.  Age classes are well represented from I through V annulus, indicating good natural reproduction.  Growth rate is good.  No walleye were aged from the 1973 or 1974 stockings.  Due to difficulty with aging older walleye scales, the 4 fish aged as VIII+ annulus could have resulted from stockings in 1972, 1973, or 1974 or some combination thereof.  The remaining walleye aged corresponds to the 1979 stocking.  Two additional fish of this size were seen in the course of this survey.  The size of the walleye in this stocking is such that they are not fully vulnerable to the gear.  It is too early to determine the success of this stocking, but their presence in the nets is encouraging.  Yellow perch were not taken in the 1975 work.  Their presence at that time would be doubtful, the lake having been chemically rehabilitated in 1964.  The numbers of perch now present is high and should provide an adequate forage base for both the northern pike and walleye populations.  Black bullhead numbers and black crappie numbers appear much higher than that found in 1975.  Bluegill numbers do not appear to be substantially more abundant at this time.  Largemouth bass are present and had successful spawning in 1980.  Carp have not been sampled in Lake Marion since the 1964 lake rehabilitation.  Dead carp were also not observed following the 1978-79 partial winterkill.  The population appears low.  Careful monitoring of the population is necessary to determine if increases to the nuisance stage develop.</p>",

Walleye were large, up to 25 inches and an average size of 20 inches.  Northern pike were also sampled in moderate numbers, but down from recent nettings.  Lengths ranged up to 30 inches, with a 22.5 inch average and approximately 25% over 25 inches.  Northern pike angling appears to be good based on the 1999 creel survey.  Largemouth bass are present in moderate to high abundance.  Good numbers of fish were over 12 inches and a fair number over 16 inches.  Angler catch for largemouth bass was good in the 1999 creel survey.  Black crappie numbers were up from recent nettings, but were small (most between 5.5 and 6.5 inches), with few over 8 inches.  Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers, with a 6.5 inch average.  Bullheads were sampled in low to moderate numbers, with yellow bullhead dominant.  Bullhead length averaged about 10 inches.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Marion is a 530 acre class 35 lake located in western Dakota County. It is primarily managed for Walleye, and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Bluegill. In 2017 East Metro Fisheries conducted a standard fisheries survey as well as an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) on Lake Marion.\n\nWalleye were sampled at 0.50 fish per gill net set, which is below the 1st quartile for abundance on class 35 lakes. The average size was 21.4 inches and 3.5 pounds. Northern Pike were sampled in the normal range at 6.25 per gill net. The average pike measured 23.2 inches and fish up to 30 inches were caught. Lake Marion will be in the new Southern Zone for Northern Pike managment and new rules will take effect in 2018. There will be a harvest limit of two fish with a minimum size of 24 inches.\n\nLargemouth Bass standard electrofishing sampled bass at a rate of 40.5 per hour which is similar to the 2016 results of 43.6 per hour. The bass population in Marion is robust with fish ranging in size from 6 inches up to 20 inches. Bluegill Sunfish were sampled in the normal range but with a small average size of 5.2 inches. Only two Bluegill Sunfish greater than 7 inches were sampled. Likewise, the Black Crappie were sampled in low abundance and small average size (6.8 inches).\n</p>",

Walleye were sampled in average abundance and size, 17 inches and 2 pounds. Northern pike were sampled in above average abundance during this survey. It was the highest catch rate since 1969. The average size sampled was 23.66 inches and 3.2 pounds. Individuals up to 32 inches in length were sampled. Largemouth bass exceeding 17 inches were sampled. Black crappie numbers were above average but the average size was small. Only one black crappie exceeding 10 inches was sampled. Yellow perch were found in the highest abundance since the 1980 survey. Yellow bullheads were also found in high numbers. Black bullhead numbers continue to decline since the 2000 survey.</p>",

The 2021 spring trap netting survey was conducted to provide baseline information on Bluegill for the new 5-fish bag limit experimental fishing regulation that went into effect in 2021. The goal of this regulation on Marion Lake is to increase the size structure of Bluegill.  <br> \nNine trap nets were set on May 17, 2021 and lifted on May 18, 2021 catching a total of 355 Bluegill. Bluegill ranged in size from 3.5 inches up to 7.3 inches in length, with an average size of 5.5 inches. Aging structures (otoliths) were collected from 68 Bluegill. The largest number of fish were from 2016 (5 years old). The oldest Bluegill sampled in 2021 was determined to be from the 2012 year-class (9 years old). The size structure of Bluegill found in Marion Lake is below average for for East Metro-area lakes, with only 3% of the fish 7 inches or larger. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Marion is a 530 acre class 35 lake in western Dakota County. Lake Marion is primarily managed for Walleye, and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Bluegill. The City of Lakeville owns and maintains two park areas in the lake - Antler's Park on the SE corner and Casperson Park on the west side of the lake.  The City of Lakeville operates a winter aeration system and fishing pier.  Minnesota DOT has developed a small parking area along the east frontage road of Interstate 35. This has proved to be a popular shore fishing spot.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at 0.50 fish per gill net set, which is below average for abundance for lakes similar to Marion. The average size Walleye was 22.5 inches. Northern Pike were sampled in average abundance at 5.25 per gill net and the average pike measured 22.8 inches. Lake Marion is in Southern Zone for Northern Pike management where a harvest limit of two fish with a minimum size of 24 inches is in effect. Largemouth Bass were sampled within a normal range for similar lakes. Bluegill Sunfish were sampled in the normal range but with a small average size of 4.8 inches. Likewise, the Black Crappie, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish were sampled in low numbers but within normal abundances and small average size. Both Yellow and Brown Bullheads were sampled in the gill nets with catch rates of 3.25/set and 3.38/set respectively and within a normal range for lakes similar to Marion. Yellow Bullheads had a mean length of 8.65 inches and Brown Bullheads mean length was 11.1 inches. <br> \n</p>",

The largest individual measured 27 inches. Largemouth bass were found in high abundance. Largemouth bass up to 17 inches were sampled. Many anglers were seen targeting bass during the survey. Black crappie numbers are average, but the average size is small. Only one black crappie greater than 9 inches was sampled. Yellow perch were found in low abundance and small sizes. Black bullhead were found in low numbers especially when compared to yellow bullhead which were caught in very high numbers. Their abundance was found to be greater than 2 times normal for this type of lake.  </p>",

Largemouth black bass (Huro salmoides) were reported, and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and common suckers (Catostomus commersoni) were seen on the ice where they had been left by fishermen in the winter of 1945-46.  The survey crew was unsuccessful in attempting to take minnows with a small seine.While panfish are four times as abundant in Lake Marion as in the average Minnesota lake, northern pike are far less common than is usual.  This condition may have resulted from the heavy spearing pressure exerted on northern pike in the years previous to 1946.  All other factors seem to favor greater northern pike abundance.Although panfish are abundant in Lake Marion, according to gillnet ratios, their growth rates are far above average rates for other Minnesota waters.  Most of the panfishes included in the growth study were two and three years of age.  Those old enough to have lived in 1942 made very poor growths that year, possibly because of the unusually cool summer.  A \"growth check\" or accessory annulus was noted during the 1945 season, perhaps the result of an unseasonably warm March and April followed by cold snaps early in May and June.  Growth in 1946 was exceptionally good.Although panfish are abundant, their growth apparently has not been affected by crowding or insufficient food, and no necessity is now seen for their removal.  Rough fish such as perch and suckers are in the lake, but do not seem common enough to warrant rough fish removal practices.Because of the present status of panfish in Lake Marion, it is recommended that the stocking of sunfish, crappies, and bluegills (as well as walleyes) be discontinued, and that heavy stocking of largemouth bass and northern pike fingerlings be inaugurated when such are available.  At least 55,000 of each should be planted for 3 consecutive years in order to restore the lake's fish populations to a proper balance.</p>",

Northern pike were abundant and exhibited average growth until age V when growth was less.  Recruitment was consistent with six year classes represented.  The lowered lake levels may be providing better northern pike spawning in portions of the lake east of the highway.  Bluegill trapnet CPUE was higher than median levels - fish were average size with a PSD of 51.  Black crappie were sampled at above statewide but below local median numbers with few individuals of a size large enough to interest anglers.  Largemouth bass were taken in low numbers - growth was average.  Yellow perch, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and black bullhead were taken in average numbers.  Yellow bullhead were taken in higher than median numbers in the gillnets - yellow bullhead were average size.  The yellow bullhead numbers are likely an indicator of increasing water quality.  Carp appear common, with many smaller fish sampled.</p>",

Historically, Lake Marion has been one of the better Largemouth Bass fisheries in the East Metro area, and there is some interest among local anglers for special regulations to maintain and improve bass size structure.  A targeted nighttime electrofishing survey was conducted on 24 May, 2016 to evaluate the Largemouth Bass population in Lake Marion. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass catch rate was 43.58 fish per hr of on time during this survey.  This is representative of a moderate density bass population in the East Metro area.   Largemouth Bass sampled in this survey ranged from 6\" to 19\".  Bass size structure was good, 74% of all sampled bass were greater than 12\", and 16% were greater than 16\".  These values were similar to those observed during the last survey in 2000. </p>",
