BLUE MOUND LAKE HAS NOT BEEN STOCKED SINCE 1985, HOWEVER PANFISH POPULATIONS REMAIN HIGH.  CRAPPIE 1+ AND 2+ YEAR CLASSES SEEM WEAK, WITH 98 OF 111 BLC BETWEEN 8.0 AND 9.5 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH. SHORELINE SEINING RESULTS INDICATED GOOD NATURAL REPRODUCTION FOR LMB AND BLG.  NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF CCF WAS ALSO EVIDENT FROM SHORELINE SEINING.

                "narrative": "<p>Blue Mound is primarily managed for black and white crappie.  The surrounding watershed land use tends to make this reservoir highly fertile and turbid.  Like most small reservoirs in Minnesota, Blue Mound has a problem with siltation which causes spawning habitat destruction.  The turbid water hinders aquatic vegetation from becoming established which is considered spawning habitat for adult fish and nursery habitat for younger fish.  Additionally, Blue Mound was suspect for a \"winterkill\" in the winter of 1991-92.  Despite the conflicts and challenges facing fish, the black crappie population has survived but in low numbers.  The black crappie average catch rate was 4.17 fish per net.  Total lengths of black crappie sampled ranged between 7.7 and 13.8 inches, with an average of 9.5.  A mode was observed in the range of 8.0 to 8.5 inches which could provide good table fare.  Interestingly, white crappies were sampled in the 1991 survey but were not in the 1995 or 1999 survey.  The black bullheads sampled in Blue Mound were small in size but numerous.  The average black bullhead trap net catch rate was 34.33 fish/net set which was down from 1991 survey (48.5 fish/net set).  Total lengths of black bullhead ranged between 5.1 and 11.4 inches, with an average of 7.8.  This population provides an excellent opportunity for kids to learn how to fish because the high population density likely translates to fast angling action.Other species which inhabit Blue Mound include orangespotted and green sunfish, channel catfish, largemouth bass, yellow perch, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and fathead minnows.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Blue Mound Reservoir through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blue Mound is managed primarily for largemouth bass and bluegill.  This 19-acre reservoir is extremely fertile and turbid.  The reservoir appeared to suffer a partial fish kill probably during the winter of 1991-92.  Prior to the suspected winter kill, bluegill, largemouth bass, and black crappie populations were considered normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  Currently, largemouth bass and bluegill numbers are considered low compared to similar lakes in our area.  Bass and bluegill were absent from our sampling gear in 1995.Black crappie numbers are also considered low.  The population is comprised mainly of larger fish ranging in length from 8 to 11 inches.  Although at low numbers, Blue Mound should produce some memorable sized fish greater than 12 inches in the future.Black bullhead numbers have increased since our last survey conducted in 1991 and are considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Bullheads collected in our trapnets ranged in length from 4 to 11 inches with an average of 6 inches.   Other species which inhabit Blue Mound include orangespotted and green sunfish, channel catfish, carp and white sucker.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Blue Mound Reservoir through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",
