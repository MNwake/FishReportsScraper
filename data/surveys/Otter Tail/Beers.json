                "narrative": "<p>     Beers Lake is a 195-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located within Maplewood State Park in northwest Otter Tail County, approximately 10 miles southeast of the city Pelican Rapids.  There are no inlets or outlets located on Beers Lake.  Water levels are approximately 6 to 8 feet above normal levels.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located along the southwest shoreline of the lakes.  Since the access is located within the state park a state park sticker is required.  Beers Lake is part of the Otter Tail River watershed and the immediate watershed is composed of hardwood forest.  Beers Lake has a maximum depth of 61 feet; 49% of the surface acreage is less than 15 feet deep.  The secchi disk reading, a measurement of water clarity, was 14.2 feet.  Past secchi disk readings have ranged from 11.3 to 17.0 feet.  Beers Lake is included in lake class 25 of the MNDNR lake classification scheme.  Other lakes in the Fergus Falls management area that are in lake class 25 include:  Bass (Elbow), Franklin, Jolly Ann, Leek, South Lida, Long, Red River, Schwartz, Sewell, West Silent, East Spirit, Stuart, Swan, Sybil, and West Olaf. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand scattered with gravel and rubble with some muck mixed in.  Stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along the entire lakeshore.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance is low, while the size structure could be considered average, as 33% of the northern pike sampled by gill nets were 24-inches or greater.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that pike recruitment is consistent.  The average length and weight of northern pike sampled by gill nets was 24.0 inches and 3.3 pounds.  Northern pike attain a mean length of 18.7 inches at age-III. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance is considered to be within the normal range for lakes of this type, however the size structure is poor.  There were no bluegills sampled by trap nets 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Recruitment appears to be consistent as there were five consecutive year classes sampled.  Bluegill attain a mean length of 5.1 inches at age-V. <br> \n     A spring electrofishing assessment was conducted to analyze the largemouth bass population.  Largemouth sampled during the electrofishing assessment ranged in length from 4.5 to 17.1 inches with an average length and weight of 10.9 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Age and growth data indicated that the largemouth bass population in Beers Lake has moderate levels of recruitment, mortality, and growth.  Bass attain a mean length of 11.4 inches at age-IV.   <br> \n     Black crappie abundance is considered to be within the normal range for lakes of this type.  Black crappie sampled ranged in length from 5.2 to 11.0 inches with a mean length of 8.2 inches.  Eighteen percent of the trap net sample was at least 10 inches or greater.  Age data indicates that recruitment is consistent, as seven year consecutive year classes year sampled.  Black crappie attain a mean length of 7.4 inches at age-IV. <br> \n     A spring trap netting assessment was conducted to analyze the muskellunge population.  A total of twenty-six muskellunge were sampled, ranging in length from 19.5 to 46.0 inches.  Thirty five percent the muskellunge were 40.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicates that the muskellunge population is being sustained by stocking, as the strongest year classes correspond to years of stocking.  The DNR stocks 200 muskellunge fingerlings on a biennial basis.  Muskellunge attain a mean length of 41.0 inches at age-X. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Beers Lake is a 195-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located within Maplewood State Park in northwest Otter Tail County approximately ten miles southeast of Pelican Rapids, MN.  There are no inlets or outlets located on Beers Lake.  Beers Lake is part of the Otter Tail River watershed.  The immediate watershed is composed of hardwood forest.  The maximum depth is 61 feet; however, 49% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 11.3 to 17.0 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along the entire lakeshore.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     A spring electrofishing assessment was conducted to analyze the Largemouth Bass population.  Catch data indicate that a moderate to high density bass population exists.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 6.3 to 18.5 inches with an average length and weight of 12.5 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 13.6 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     A trap net and electrofishing assessment was conducted to analyze the Muskellunge population.  A total of 41 Muskellunge were sampled (39 mature, 2 immature) during this period.  Mature fish ranged in length from 35.3 to 49.5 inches in length with an average length of 39.6 inches.  Of the mature fish, 13 (33%) were female and 26 (67%) were male.  Aging data indicates that the Musky population is sustained by stocking.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Beers Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Beers Lake is a 195-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located entirely within Maplewood State Park in northwest Otter Tail County approximately ten miles southeast of Pelican Rapids, MN.  There are no inlets or outlets located on Beers Lake.  Beers Lake is part of the Otter Tail River watershed.  The immediate watershed is composed of hardwood forest.  The maximum depth is 61 feet; however, 49% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Historical secchi disk readings have ranged from 11.3 to 17.0 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Possession of a valid state park permit is needed to utilize the access.  A private residence is located on the island in the northeastern part of the lake.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along the entire lakeshore.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     A special trapnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Muskellunge population.  A total of 43 Muskellunge were sampled.  Muskellunge ranged in length from 32.8 to 47.8 inches with an average length of 40.3 inches.    <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Beers Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",

Aging data indicates that the walleye population is sustained by stocking.  <br> \n     The northern pike gill net catch rate is down to a level compatible with muskellunge management.  Although no muskies were sampled in the nets, several were sampled during spring electrofishing.  <br> \n     The largemouth bass population increased since 1977.  The age and size structure of bass sampled in the nets and during spring electrofishing appears well balanced. <br> \n</p>",
