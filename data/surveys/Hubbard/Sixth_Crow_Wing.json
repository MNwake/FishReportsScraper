                "narrative": "<p>Sixth Crow Wing Lake is located two miles southwest of Nevis in central Hubbard County.  Sixth Crow Wing Lake is 340 acres with a maximum depth of 40 feet.  A county-owned public access is located on the southwest shore of Sixth Crow Wing Lake.  Sixth Crow Wing Lake provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish.  There is also a limited Tullibee population for fall sport netting.  There is a special regulation that requires all Northern Pike from 24 \u0013 36 inches to be immediately released.   <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Sixth Crow Wing is in lake class 31. Lake Class 31 lakes are regularly shaped and have very hard water.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second Crow Wing, Fifth Crow Wing, Seventh Crow Wing, Eighth Crow Wing, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, Tripp and Lower Twin.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was slightly lower than previous years, but close to similar area lakes.  Walleyes are a great size for anglers, with an average size of 16 inches and fish sampled up to 25 inches.  The 2011 year class of Walleyes appears to be very abundant and should provide good fishing in the near future.    <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of Northern Pike, with the 2014 sample being the highest on record.  Northern Pike were average size of 25.5 inches and weight of 3.7 pounds.  A number of fish over 30 inches were sampled, with the largest 35 inches. <br> \nYellow Perch are an important forage species for Walleyes and Northern Pike in Suxth Crow Wing. They were sampled in good numbers, and some are large enough to be of size acceptable to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in lower numbers than previous surveys.  The size was good, with an average length of 12 inches and fish sampled up to 19 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSixth Crow Wing has been a popular lake for panfish in recent years.  Angling opportunities for panfish include Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed.  Black Crappie numbers were low, but size was good with most fish from 8.5-10.5 inches in length.  Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds were sampled in higher numbers than recent years, and most fish were 4.5-8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNo aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Sixth Crow Wing Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

The average weight was 2.3 pounds with 64% of the fish in the 15 to 22 inch range.  Growth rates are good.  Stocked year classes made up 98% of the walleyes sampled during 1994.  Northern pike abundance is also comparable to other lakes in this lake class and similar to historical levels.  Their average size was 22.9 inches and 3.0 pounds; growth rates are good.  Largemouth bass abundance is slightly high for this lake class and also higher than historical levels.  Their size ranged from 4.3 to 17.1 inches with multiple year classes present.  Growth rates are average.  Black crappies were sampled with both types of gear in low numbers, but not unlike historical levels for this lake.  They were from year classes 3, 4, 5, and 8 years and growth is slow.  Bluegills were sampled in numbers above the median for lake class 31 with 74% of the samples 6.0 inches or greater.  Growth is slightly slower than average.  Yellow perch were very abundant and provide an excellent forage base for the predator species.  Fifty three percent of the yellow perch sampled were over 8.0 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sixth Crow Wing Lake is located three miles southwest of Nevis in southern Hubbard County.  Sixth Crow Wing has a surface area of 321 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  A state-owned public access with a concrete ramp is located on the southwest shore of the lake.  Sixth Crow Wing is connected to Fifth Crow Wing by a small channel (Crow Wing River), and boating is possible between the two lakes.  Sixth Crow Wing supports an excellent panfish fishery, as well as good fishing for largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.  Sixth Crow Wing has good water quality and      excellent fish habitat such as submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation.  Hardstem bulrush beds ring the south shore and the outlet area and provide excellent cover for bass and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Sixth Crow Wing is in class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second Crow Wing, Fifth Crow Wing, Seventh Crow Wing, Eighth Crow Wing, Duck, Hinds, and Lower Twin.  Panfish are highly sought after year-around on Sixth Crow Wing.  Good numbers of bluegill were sampled (24 bluegill/trapnet), similar to past surveys.  Average size of bluegill was 6.3 inches, and good numbers of 7 to 8 inch fish were sampled.  Good numbers of pumpkinseed were also sampled, but size was smaller with few fish over 6 inches.  Good numbers of black crappie were sampled during spring electrofishing as well as during the summer survey.  The black crappie electrofishing catch rate of 89 black crappie/hour was higher than other lakes sampled in the spring of 1999.  Black crappie had an average length and weight of 8.5 inches and 0.4 pounds.Good numbers and sizes of walleye were sampled during the 1999 survey.  The walleye catch rate of 7.2 walleye/gillnet is above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and above the management goal of 4.0 walleye/gillnet.  Past surveys have shown that walleye abundance has been high since the late 1980s, with low numbers of walleye sampled in the 1976 and 1983 surveys.  Walleye were large-sized, with an average length and weight of 18.2 inches and 2.3 pounds.  The walleye population in Sixth Crow Wing is the result of a successful stocking program.  Walleye sampled in 1999 corresponded to stocking with 72% of the catch from stocked year classes.  Some sporadic natural reproduction is contributing to the population as the 1996 year class (non-stocked) accounted for 25 % of the catch.  Past surveys have shown that the majority  of the walleye sampled correspond to stocked years.  Sixth Crow Wing (as well as the whole Crow Wing chain of lakes), is stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd years.  Important walleye forage base species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in good numbers.Sixth Crow Wing has a history of having a low to moderate northern pike population composed of quality-sized fish.  The 1999 catch rate of 2.8 northern pike/gillnet is below the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.  Northern pike were large-sized with an average length and weight of 26.6 inches and 4.7 pounds.  Northern pike up to 40.4 inches were sampled.  Northern pike growth rates were well above other area lakes.Sixth Crow Wing supports an excellent largemouth bass population.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time on Sixth and catch rates were high (71 largemouth bass/hour).  Largemouth bass had an average length and weight of 12.7 inches and 1.4 pounds, with good numbers of bass over 15 inches sampled.  Other species sampled include white sucker in high numbers, with rock bass, yellow bullhead, and golden shiner sampled in moderate numbers.  Brown bullhead and black bullhead were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

Sixth Crow Wing is part of a chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Sixth Crow Wing Lake has a surface area of 340 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  A DNR-owned public access is located on the southwest shore of Sixth Crow Wing Lake, off Deer Run Drive. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Sixth Crow Wing Lake is in Lake Class 31.  Class 31 lakes generally have very hard water, and regularly shaped shorelines.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Second, Fifth, and Seventh Crow Wings, Boulder, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, Tripp and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nA special 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit for Northern Pike is in place on Fifth and Sixth Crow Wing Lakes.  The objective of this regulations is to maintain or improve pike sizes in these lakes.  Anglers can expect to find good numbers of Northern Pike in Sixth Crow Wing Lake.  Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 25 inches and 3.6 pounds, with pike measured up to 35 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were a good size for anglers, with an average length of 18 inches.  Walleyes ranged from 10 to 28 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for both Walleye and Northern Pike were sampled in very good numbers.  Most perch were 6 - 8.5 inches, with just a few over 8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSpring sampling showed good numbers of Largemouth Bass. They had an average length of 15 inches, with fish sampled up to 19 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSixth Crow Wing Lake supports a healthy panfish population and can provide good fishing for Black Crappie and Bluegill.  Black Crappie were sampled in moderate numbers compared to other local lakes.  They had an average size of 7.5 inches, with crappies sampled up to 12 inches.  Bluegills were sampled in good numbers, similar to past surveys. The majority sampled were 3-7.5 inches, but anglers will find larger Bluegill up to and over 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNo aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Sixth Crow Wing Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Sixth Crow Wing Lake was conducted on July 3rd, 8th, and 9th, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiners, Iowa Darters, Least Darters, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass) and zero that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from the week of July 12th, 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, Mottled Sculpin), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Sixth Crow Wing Lake is in good health as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>As compared with the statewide index numbers, the index numbers indicate for walleye, common sucker, tullibee, and pech good fish populations; and for northern pike and panfish average fish populations.  There are weak or missing year classes in the age class structure of the centrachid populations.  The growth rate of walleye and northern pike is rapid while the other species appear to have a normal growth rate.Sixth Crow Wing Lake is of moderate chemical fertility and has a large area of productive littoral zone.  It is best suited ecologically for bass and panfish but is also supporting a good walleye population.Panfish growth is about normal; walleye and northern pike show a rapid growth rate.Fish Stocking:Sixth Crow Wing Lake has good spawning facilities for bass and panfish; stocking of these species will not improve angling.Although spawning facilities for walleye appears to be poor, the size and age-class structure of walleye taken in the test nets indicate that natural reproduction success has been good in recent years.  It is recommended that walleye stocking be discontinued until future investigation shows the need for stocking.Aquatic Plants:Aquatic plants were found to depth of 15 to 20 feet covering about 20 percent of the lake area.  Common species of aquatic plants present were wild rice, coontail, softstem bulrush and yellow water lilies.Local Fishing Report:Fishing has been declining for several years according to resort owners.  Fish most commonly caught are northern pike, walleye, and panfish.Special Regulations and Fish Removal:The lake was closed to angling (1945-48) and to darkhouse spearing (1946-51).  It was open to tullibee netting during 1949-54.During 1944-45 there were 3,732 pounds of bullheads removed from this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sixth Crow Wing Lake is located three miles southwest of Nevis in southern Hubbard County.  Sixth Crow Wing has a surface area of 321 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  A state-owned public access with a concrete ramp is located on the southwest shore of the lake.  Sixth Crow Wing is connected to Fifth Crow Wing Lake by a small channel (Crow Wing River), and boating is possible between the two lakes.  Sixth Crow Wing supports an excellent panfish fishery, as well as good fishing for largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.  Sixth Crow Wing has good water quality and excellent fish habitat such as submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation.  Hardstem bulrush beds ring the south shore and the outlet areas and provide excellent cover for bass and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Sixth Crow Wing is in class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second Crow Wing, Fifth Crow Wing, Seventh Crow Wing, Eighth Crow Wing, Duck, Hinds, and Lower Twin.Panfish are highly sought after year-around on Sixth Crow Wing.  Moderate numbers of bluegill were sampled (12.4 bluegill/trapnet), down slightly from past surveys, however, still within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie abundance in Sixth Crow Wing has fluctuated from low to high numbers over the years.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers in 2004 and anglers will find good numbers of crappie in the 9-11 inch size range.  Both bluegill and black crappie had good growth rates when compared to other class 31 lakes.Good numbers and sizes of walleye were sampled during the 2004 survey.  The walleye catch rate of 8.5 walleye/gillnet is above the current management goal of 7.0 walleye/gillnet and above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have shown that walleye abundance has been high since the late 1980's, with low numbers of walleye sampled in the 1976 and 1983 surveys.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 2.0 pounds.  The walleye population in Sixth Crow Wing is being maintained by a combination of fingerling stocking by the DNR as well as some sporadic natural reproduction.  Age analysis showed that walleye fingerling stocking is contributing heavily to the population in Sixth Crow Wing with 74% of the sampled walleye corresponding to stocked years.  Sixth Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd years.  Important walleye and northern pike forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in good numbers.Sixth Crow Wing has a history of having a low to moderate northern pike population composed of quality-sized fish.  The 2004 catch rate of 2.0 northern pike/gillnet is below the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.  Northern pike up to 38.1 inches were sampled.  Northern pike have very fast growth rates in Sixth Crow Wing.  With the backing of strong public support, a 40-inch minimum size limit was implemented in the spring of 2003.Sixth Crow Wing supports a good largemouth bass population.  Past and present surveys have shown Sixth Crow Wing to have good numbers of largemouth bass when compared to other lakes within the Crow Wing chain and other class 31 lakes.  Largemouth bass up to 19.9 inches were sampled.Other species sampled included moderate numbers of bowfin (dogfish), white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Brown bullhead, rock bass, and golden shiner were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sixth Crow Wing Lake is located three miles southwest of Nevis, in southern Hubbard County.  Sixth Crow Wing has a surface area of 321 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  A state-owned public access with a concrete ramp is located on the southwest shore of the lake.  Sixth Crow Wing is connected to Fifth Crow Wing Lake by a small channel (Crow Wing River), and boating is possible between the two lakes.  Sixth Crow Wing supports an excellent panfish fishery, as well as good fishing for largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.  Sixth Crow Wing has good water quality and excellent fish habitat such as submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation.  Hardstem bulrush beds ring the south shore and the outlet areas and provide excellent cover for panfish and bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Sixth Crow Wing is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second Crow Wing, Fifth Crow Wing, Seventh Crow Wing, Eighth Crow Wing, Duck, Hinds, and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are highly sought after year-around on Sixth Crow Wing.  Bluegill abundance (9.1 bluegill/trapnet) was down from past surveys, however, still within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range. Winter fishing pressure was very high during the winters of 2001-02 through 2006-07, as evidenced by record or near record numbers of fish houses on Sixth Crow Wing Lake each of those winters.  In addition, Fifth and Sixth Crow Wing Lakes experienced a partial fish kill in June of 2007.  Either or both of those events may be at least partially responsible for lower bluegill and pumpkinseed abundance in 2008.  Black crappie abundance in Sixth Crow Wing has fluctuated from low to high numbers over the years.  Black Crappie were sampled in moderate numbers in 2009 and anglers will find good numbers of crappie in the 9-11 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers and sizes of walleye were sampled during the 2009 survey.  Walleye abundance (7.0 walleye/gillnet) was at the current management goal (7.0 walleye/gillnet) and above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have shown that walleye abundance has been high since the late 1980's, with low numbers of walleye sampled in the 1976 and 1983 surveys.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 17.0 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Sixth Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Important walleye and northern pike forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in good numbers.  Yellow perch were small in size, with few fish an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (7.1 pike/gillnet) was up from past surveys.  Past surveys have shown a low to moderate northern pike population composed of quality-sized fish.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates in past surveys have generally been below or at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike up to 36.8 inches were sampled.  A 40-inch minimum size limit for northern pike was implemented in the spring of 2003.  This length limit regulation is being evaluated to see if an increase in larger northern pike has occurred. <br> \n <br> \nPast and present surveys have shown Sixth Crow Wing to have good numbers of largemouth bass when compared to class 31 and other lakes within the Crow Wing chain.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Sixth Crow Wing.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of white sucker, yellow bullhead, rock bass, and bowfin (dogfish).  Brown bullhead and hybrid sunfish were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",
