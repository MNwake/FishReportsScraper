                "narrative": "<p>Currant Lake is a 394-acre, class 43 lake that has a maximum depth of 9.5 ft. and is located southwest of Balaton in Murray County.  Currant Lake is situated in a mostly agricultural landscape which results poor water quality due to runoff of nutrients.  Currant Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Black Crappie.  Currant Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fry in the spring of 2017, due to surplus production of this strain.  The Lower Mississippi strain is the same strain that is found in Lake Sarah, which has one of the only Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction. A recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  Further genetic testing has shown that this strain of Walleye has persisted in some other southern Minnesota lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  A daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on October 4, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 24.0 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that the fry stocking was somewhat successful.  In stocked years, the goal is to attain 30.0 per hour electrofishing.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 5.9 to 7.8 inches and averaged 6.7 inches.  If they survive the winter, the 2017 year class should be a strong year class in the Currant Lake Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",

Some large walleyes (over 8 lbs) were reported caught in commercial seine hauls.Black crappie and yellow perch are managed as a secondary species in Current Lake.  The black crappie population is extremely high for lakes similar to Current Lake.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 6.0 to 14.0 inches and averaged almost 1/2 lb.  Yellow perch numbers were similar to other lakes like Current.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 6.5 inches to 14.0 inches and had an average weight of 0.2 lbs.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Currant Lake is a shallow prairie lake located four miles south and three west of Balaton.  Walleye and black crappie have been the mainstay of the Currant Lake fishery for many years.  The lake management plan indicates walleye as the primary species of management with yellow perch and black crappie as secondary species.Currant Lake continues to maintain a good walleye population.  When compared to lakes that are similar to Currant Lake, the walleye numbers were average.  An average population simply means some lakes had higher populations and some had lower.  Walleye ranged from 7 to nearly 28 inches, but most fish were 10 to 20 inches.  Natural reproduction, fry stocking, and fingerling stocking all contributed to the existing walleye population.  Natural reproduction is determined from walleye scales that are aged from years when no stocking occurred.Yellow perch have been at a moderate to low level for several years.  Although there are plenty of adults in the population, the habitat may not be good enough to allow a larger population to develop.  Yellow perch ranged from 5.6 to 9.6 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  Nearly 91% of the yellow perch sampled in 1997 were two or three years old.  Three year old fish averaged about 8 inches.  In contrast to the yellow perch population, the black crappie are doing great.  For the last four years, the black crappie population has been nearly six times higher than most lakes similar to Currant Lake.  The population appears to have decent reproduction each year with a big year class every four or five years.  Black crappie averaged almost nine inches by the time they were three years old.  Black crappie ranged from 6.4 to 12.4 inches and averaged 7.6 inches.  Anglers might find excellent crappie fishing in 1998 and 1999 as these fish grow to a size anglers prefer.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Currant Lake through watershed management.  Improved land use practices will help insure this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

The assessment consisted of 32 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 76.4 (+/- 2.7) out of 100 possible. A score of 76.4 indicates the lakewide shoreline condition is Moderate (70-80). Approximately 87 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 73.3 (+/- 2.5) indicating shoreline habitat quality of developed sites is Moderate (70-80), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 98.3 (+/- 1.7) with Excellent (92+) habitat quality.</p>",

The seine hauls captured six species of fish including Bigmouth Buffalo (N=2), Johnny Darter (N=7), Fathead Minnow (N=135), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=97), Walleye (N=509), and Yellow Perch (N=1,014). Electrofishing captured eight species of fish including Black Bullhead (N=1), Johnny Darter (N=12), Black Crappie (N=1), Fathead Minnow (N=12), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=35), Walleye (N=2), Yellow Perch(N=44), and Yellow Bullhead (N=2). Young-of-the-year Walleye were sampled indicating that the spring stocking was successful. Young-of-the-year Yellow Perch and Bigmouth Buffalo were also sampled indicating that natural reproduction occurs in Currant Lake for these species.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of Currant Lake. The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community. The IBI score at Currant Lake was 11, below the impairment threshold of 36. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Currant Lake is a 394-acre lake that has a maximum depth of 9.5 ft. and is located southwest of Balaton in Murray County.  Currant Lake is situated in a mostly agricultural landscape which results poor water quality due to runoff of nutrients.  Currant Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Black Crappie.  Currant Lake was surveyed the week of June 26, 2017 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Walleye catch rate was 32.3 per gill net, which is the highest observed catch rate since surveys began in 1984, and exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Prior to 2017, Walleye catch rates in gill nets averaged 2.5 per gill net, with the second highest catch rate being 6.6 per gill net in 1993.  Lengths of Walleye sampled in 2017 ranged from 7.7 to 23.4 inches and averaged 11.8, with 80 percent of gill netted Walleye being less than 14.0 inches in length.  Six year-classes of Walleye were sampled, with age-2, age-3, and age-4 Walleye comprising 37, 19, and 33 percent of the sample, respectively. Other ages sampled included age-1, age-7, and age-8. All year classes corresponded with fry stocking events except the 2014 year class, indicating that natural reproduction occurred.  Growth of Walleye, when compared to other similar lakes, was slow as the average length at age-1, age-2, age-3, and age-4 was 8.1, 10.0, 13.3, and 13.8 inches, respectively.  Walleye fishing should be phenomenal on Currant Lake if the fish grow a couple of inches in the next couple of years.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Yellow Perch catch rate of 5.3 per gill net was near the long term average of 5.5 per gill net since 1984 and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 8.2 to 11.5 inches and averaged 10.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate decreased from 17.6 per trap net in 2013 to 4.3 per trap net in 2017, but was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 7.6 to 11.9 inches and averaged 10.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp have historically been abundant in Currant Lake as evidenced by a long term average of 21.6 per gill net since 1984.  The 2017 catch rate was 8.7, which is the third lowest catch rate on record.  Black Bullhead abundance was low at 4.7 per gill net.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Currant is a 394-acre lake located southwest of Balaton in Murray County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 9.5 feet and is a class 43 lake.  Currant Lake is managed primarily for walleye while yellow perch, black crappie and northern pike.  An aeration system was installed in 1981 and no winterkill has been document through the winter of 2008-09.  Unfortunately due to a difficult winter in 2009-10, oxygen levels dropped to 0.8 ppm in February of 2010.  The data collected for this assessment was during the summer of 2009 prior to low oxygen levels and results may not be indicative of the actual number of fish present.   <br> \n <br> \nBased on gill nets used during our fish survey in 2009, the walleye population is less than what we would expect for lakes similar to Currant.  The walleye catch rate could have been affected by the high carp population in Currant.  Carp have a tendency to move prior to walleyes and may have tangled up the gill nets before the walleye in the lake had a chance to be sampled.  The trap nets indicated a population more like what we would see in lakes similar to Currant.  Lengths of walleye caught in our trap nets ranged from 7.1 to 27.3 inches and averaged 15.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAs of 2009, Currant Lake has a respectable yellow perch population.  No yellow perch were observed during fish surveys in 2001 and 2005 so adult perch were stocked in 2006.  The gill net catch rate increased from 0.0 in 2005 to 6.7 in 2009.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 5.4 to 7.0 inches and averaged 5.9 inches.  These fish were likely offspring of the adults stocked in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nThere is an excellent black crappie population in Currant according to our 2009 fish survey.  Lengths of black crappie caught in our trap nets ranged from 5.7 to 9.1 inches and averaged 7.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers are down a bit from our 2005 fish survey.  Trap net catch rates dropped from 15.4 in 2005 to 2.2 fish per net in 2009.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in our trap nets in 2009 ranged from 6.6 to 9.6 inches and averaged 8.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were stocked as adults in 2004 and fingerlings in 2005 to establish a population which could act as another predator on common carp.  No northern pike have ever been sampled in Currant Lake since starting lake surveys in 1993. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during the assessment included bigmouth buffalo, common carp, and orangespotted sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Currant Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Currant Lake is a 394-acre lake that has a maximum depth of 9.5 ft. and is located southwest of the City of Balaton in Murray County.  Currant Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie and Yellow Perch. Currant Lake was surveyed the week of June 21, 2021 to monitor fish populations using gill nets and trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in Currant Lake have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 1984 and 2005 to 32.3 per gill net and in 2017.  Prior to 2017, Walleye catch rates in gill nets averaged 2.5 per gill net.  Catch rates in 2017 and 2021 increased significantly to 32.3 and 33.3 per gill net, respectively, with the 2021 catch rate being the highest recorded on Currant Lake.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 9.1 to 23.7 inches and averaged 14.0 inches, with 69 percent of Walleye sampled being less than 12.0 inches.  Six year-classes of walleye were sampled in the gill net, with age-1 and age-4 Walleye comprising 61 percent and 23 percent of aged Walleye. Other ages sampled included age-2, age-5, age-6, and age-8. All year classes correspond to stocking events, except for the age-1 (2020 year class) Walleye which are a result of natural reproduction. A strong year class was also produced in 2021 (stocked year) as 511 age-0 Walleye were sampled in the IBI survey done on June 22, 2021. Growth of Walleye in Currant Lake improved since the 2017 survey, as the average length at age-1 and age-4 was 10.4 and 18.6 inches in 2021 compared to 8.1 and 13.8 inches in 2017.  The current Walleye stocking regime of 500 per acre in 3 out of 4 years appears to be working well.  The Walleye stocked in 2017, 2019, and 2021 were the same genetic strain as in Lake Sarah in Murray County.  Walleye angling in Currant Lake should be excellent in the next year or two.  <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2021, Yellow Perch catch rates in Currant Lake have ranged from 0.0 per gill net in 2001 and 2005 to 18.0 per gill net in 1993 and averaged 5.5 per gill net.  In 2021, Yellow Perch were captured at a rate of 73.7 per gill net, exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  The stocking of nearly 2,000 adult Yellow Perch in 2016 appears to have established a self-sustaining Yellow Perch population. Yellow Perch sampled in 2021 ranged in length from 4.8 to 12.6 inches and averaged 7.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 Black Crappie catch rate was 14.9 per trap net, which is an increase from the 2017 catch rate of 4.3 per trap net and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  Black Crappie were small with lengths ranging from 4.5 to 7.9 inches and averaging 5.3 inches.  One year class comprised 98 percent of the sample.  <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2021, Bigmouth Buffalo catch rates have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 1989 to 17.4 per gill net in 1997 and have averaged 4.4 per gill net. In 2021 Bigmouth Buffalo were captured at a rate of 70.3 per gill net, greatly exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes.  Bigmouth Buffalo were small, ranging in size from 4.7 to 9.3 inches.  Other species sampled included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Orangespotted Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Currant Lake is a 394 acre lake located in Murray County four miles south and three west of Balaton.  The lake is managed for walleye as the primary species while black crappie and yellow perch are managed secondarily.  There appeared to be a partial winterkill during the winter of 2000-2001.  Recently there has been some concern over the operation of the diversion upstream from the lake.  Water samples have been taken in several locations throughout the watershed and from the Redwood River from which water would be diverted when and if determined necessary.  High amounts of fecal coliform bacteria were discovered in the river and could contaminate Currant Lake if the diversion were used during these periods of high concentrations.  More information needs to be gathered to determine what detrimental effects , if any, the diversion could have on the fishery and the water quality in Currant Lake.Our catch information on Currant Lake showed the walleye population to be low compared to similar lakes.  There appears to be a good population of age one fish in the lake but the fish are too small at this time for us to sample in the gear we use.  This along with the partial winterkill could have been the reason for lower catch rates than what we have seen in the past.Catch rates of black crappie were very good compared to similar lakes.  The population should provide some good fishing opportunities for crappie anglers.  The average length of black crappie caught in our nets was about 9.5 inches.The yellow perch population is very low for lakes similar to Currant.  This may be due to the partial winterkill during the winter of 2000-2001.The carp population has always been of some concern in Currant Lake.  The survey in 2001 showed that the population was high compared to similar lakes.  The condition of the carp population was very poor meaning they are not very healthy.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Currant Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Currant is a 394 acre lake in Murray County, 4 miles south and 3 miles west of Balaton.  In 2001, there was concern over the operation of the diversion upstream of the lake.  Water samples from various locations throughout the watershed and from the Redwood River revealed high amounts of fecal coliform.  If the diversion is used during periods of high concentrations of this pollutant, Currant Lake could be contaminated.  More information needs to be collected to determine possible negative effects that the diversion could have on the fishery and water quality of the lake.  Currant is primarily managed for walleyes and secondarily for yellow perch, black crappie, and northern pike.Our 2005 sampling efforts revealed a walleye population that is \"better than average\" for lakes similar to Currant with 5 fish caught per trap net.  Fish sampled ranged in length from just under 8 inches to just over 26 inches and appeared to be well fed based on their plumpness.  Aging of the caught walleyes showed that both fry and fingerling stocking appears to be effective within the lake.  Currant was stocked with walleye fry in the spring of 2005 and will be stocked with fingerlings in the fall of 2006.The yellow perch population of Currant Lake is low compared to similar lakes.  Only 3 perch were sampled in the entire survey.  A partial winterkill in the winter of 2000-2001 may be part of the reason that the perch population is lacking.  We plan to stock Currant with adult yellow perch in the spring of 2006 in an attempt to boost the population.  Currant's black crappie population is considered exceptional compared to lakes with similar characteristics.  More than 22 fish were sampled per trap net and lengths ranged from about 5.5 inches to nearly 11.5 inches.  Further, the crappies are finding a more than adequate food source within the lake as the fish had an extraordinary condition factor (a measure of the \"plumpness\" of the fish).  Aging revealed 5 consecutive year classes, suggesting successful natural reproduction, and thus, no additional stocking of black crappie will take place at this time.As we attempt to provide a northern pike fishery within Currant Lake, 2460 fingerlings were stocked in the spring of 2005.  Ninety adult pike were stocked in 2004 as we hoped for natural reproduction within the connected wetlands upstream of the lake.  As of now, no evidence of natural reproduction has been documented.  Thus, northern pike fingerling stocking will continue in the future.Common carp have always been a concern in Currant.  Our catch information from the 2005 survey showed a continued concern.  We will continue to encourage commercial seining operations to harvest the lake in an attempt to keep the carp population to a minimum.Other species sampled during the 2005 assessment were bigmouth buffalo and black bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the water quality of Currant Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

                "narrative": "<p>Currant Lake is located southwest of Balaton in Murray County, has a surface area of 394 acres, a maximum depth of 9.5 feet, and is in DNR lake class 43.  Minnesota DNR fisheries classify lakes with similar characteristics, such as size, depth, water chemistry, and other metrics on a statewide basis for comparison of fish communities.  It is managed primarily for walleye, and secondarily for yellow perch and black crappie.  Although crappies are doing well, survival of young walleye may have been impacted by predation from them and also black bullheads.  Other factors, such as poor water quality, high carp and bullhead populations, and a partial winterkill in 2010, may be affecting the top level predators (i.e. walleye).  To assess existing fish populations and management objectives, a test netting survey utilizing 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets was conducted during the week of June 24, 2013 with the following results. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate of 1.0 per gill net was the third lowest on record since gill net surveys began in 1984.  Walleye abundance in trap nets (3.3 fish per net) was just slightly above the long term average of 3.0 per net for this lake. Walleye lengths from both gear types ranged from 9.0 to 27.0 inches, but the majority were about 12 inches long.  Only three walleye were aged by counting annual growth rings on an internal bony structure called an otolith.  These fish were all three years old, which would correspond to a fry stocking in 2010.  Walleye numbers have never been very high in Currant with a peak catch of 6.6 per gill net in the 1993 survey.  Growth rates for walleye appear to be slow compared to other area lakes.  Black crappie populations can negatively influence walleye growth and abundance. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch rates of 4.7 per gill net were near the long term average of 5.0 per net during seven prior surveys since 1984.  The trap net catch rate was just under 1.0 per net which was near the long term average for this lake.  Perch from both gear types ranged from 7.0 to nearly 10.0 inches long, with near normal growth rates.  Although no perch were aged for this assessment, using length frequency there appears to be one year class present.  They should be sufficient in size and numbers to successfully spawn and increase future populations for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates of 17.5 per trap net were just under the long term average of 20.5 per net for this lake.  Lengths of crappie ranged from 6.5 to 11.2 inches with a mean length of 8.3 inches.  Based upon length frequency groupings, there are at least three year classes of crappie present.  Growth rates were also excellent with crappie in good health.  These robust fish should provide anglers with consistent crappie fishing for several years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers in trap nets have risen dramatically since the 2009 survey from 2.2 per net then, to 77.8 per net currently.  Lengths of bullhead in both gear types ranged from 5.7 to 10.0 inches and should be targeted by anglers and commercial fisherman too. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp populations have been very abundant since the 1993 survey with a long term average of 23.0 per gill net.  This year's assessment captured 16.7 per gill net, with lengths ranging from 11.3 to 27.0 inches.  These fish would provide an excellent opportunity for bowfishers and commercial netters. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during this assessment in low densities included bigmouth buffalo, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, northern pike, and white sucker.  Only two painted turtles were sampled in the nine trap nets. <br> \n</p>",
