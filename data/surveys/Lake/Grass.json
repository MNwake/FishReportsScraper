A small, user developed, 75 foot carry-down access is located off a logging road on the south end of the lake and is suitable for canoe or small boat. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community of Grass Lake is comprised of northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed, yellow perch, white sucker, tadpole madtom and common shiner.  The northern pike catch rate in 2007 was the second highest on this lake and about average for similar lakes of this type.  The size of northern pike sampled was average (2.0 pounds) with two fish over 30 inches included in the catch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were higher in the 2007 assessment than any previous assessment.  The average size was small with 96% of the sample less than 6 inches and only one 10 inch crappie sampled.  Natural reproduction sustains the present population. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were present in average numbers; however, the average size is about 6 inches and larger fish are rare.  Bluegill and largemouth bass were recently found in Grass Lake, but assessments indicate that fishable populations do not yet exist.  <br> \n</p>",

The increase in the net catch is probably related to the stocking of Black Crappies in 1988, however some natural reproduction is occurring as approximately 10% of the aged sample were Age II fish. Trapnet and gillnet catches of Northern Pike were both near the average for lakes in this classification.</p>",

The fish ranged from 10.4 inches to 29.5 inches (5.3 pounds) and averaged 1.8 pounds, which is normal for lakes in this class and typical of the northern pike collected in previous surveys on this lake.Black crappie have existed in Grass Lake for many years but the number caught in DNR nets has never been high, with catches usually near the low end of the normal range for lakes in this class.  Test nets in 2001 caught low numbers of black crappie, but the catch included a few fish in the 10.5 inch to 11.5 inch range.Yellow perch were collected in the 2001 survey, however, the number was very low and their size was too small to interest most anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grass Lake is a 27-acre lake located approximately ten straight line miles northwest of Isabella. Access to Grass Lake is a 0.15-mile road with a turn-around area off of Forest Service Road 383. From the turn-around there is a 75-foot carry-down access to the south shore of the lake that is best suited for canoes, kayaks and other carry-in boats.  <br> \n <br> \nA lake survey was conducted on Grass Lake during June of 2023 to assess the status of the Northern Pike and Black Crappie populations along with the fish community as a whole. Northern Pike catch was within the normal range relative to similar lakes, but was lower than catches in the previous two surveys of Grass Lake. The average length of Northern Pike sampled was 20 inches, with 22% of the catch larger than 24 inches and the longest fish measuring almost 34 inches in length. The pike sample ranged in age from two to nine with only one year class in that range missing. Based on this, Northern Pike are able to spawn successfully most years. The Northern Pike population in Grass Lake provides anglers with good opportunities to catch eater sized pike; opportunities to catch a trophy pike in Grass Lake are limited. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch was also within the normal range relative to similar lakes. The average length of Black Crappie sampled in 2023 was seven inches with the longest fish measuring ten inches. Only age-3 and age-4 crappie were sampled, in most surveys of Grass Lake only a few ages of crappie are sampled. These results suggest that crappie spawning success is inconsistent, which can result in year-to-year variability in the size and number of fish available to anglers. The outlet channel of Grass Lake connects to Surprise Lake and in turn other waterbodies, which have Black Crappie populations. This means that if the Black Crappie population in Grass Lake were to fail, the lake could eventually be recolonized naturally.   <br> \n <br> \nBoth Bluegills and Largemouth Bass have also been sampled in Grass Lake; however, neither species were sampled in the 2023 survey. Like Black Crappie, successful spawning events may not occur every year. Also, if these populations were to fail fish may be able to recolonize Grass Lake from other connected waterbodies. Yellow Perch are present, but are generally too small to be of interest to most anglers.  <br> \n</p>",

The moderately hard-water has a scattered to moderate growth of submerged and floating-leaved aquatic plants. Lake bed soils are about an 80% mixture of sand and gravel with rubble or boulder and 20% muck. Shoreline marshes or lowland areas exist around the inlet and outlet. The secchi disc could be seen in water up to 6.2 feet deep.     Northern Pike and White Sucker seemed to be quite plentiful. A fair Walleye population is present. Yellow Perch were caught only in shoreline seining.     Little is known about the fishing pressure. However, the absence of cottages, boats and a designated public access would indicate that the pressure at best is light.     It would appear that additional fishing pressure might be created if Black Crappie were stocked in the lake. Such stocking should have little if any adverse affect on existing fish populations. At the present time no other stocking is needed and/or justified.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grass Lake is categorized as a lake class 14 lake, is 24 acres with a maximum depth of nine feet; Secchi disc was 5.1 feet in brown stained water.  The initial water sample taken found that pH was 7.1, conductivity 82 and total alkalinity 44.3.  The lake is located 8 miles west and 7 miles north of Isabella down the Bandana Lake Road (FS 383). The access is a 0.15 mile trail off FS 383 then a 75 foot carry-in trail down a small hill to the lake. There is a small turn around area and user made campsite.  The carry-in trail is wide enough to push a small trailer to the lake and is suitable for canoes and small boats.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were found in above average numbers and size in 2013 for this type of lake.  The average fish was about 19 inches and 2.3 pounds, with one larger fish of 39 inches and 12.2 pounds.  Historically, the pike catch in Grass Lake is average for this lake type in both numbers and size.  The most abundant size of northern pike weighs at about 2 pounds.  In each of the past five assessments since 1991 at least one fish around 30 inches or larger has been sampled.  Reproduction appears to be consistent and growth is faster than average for the Finland Area.  Grass Lake is known by local anglers to be a pretty good pike fishing lake.  The fish are a bit on the small side, but the action is good and you have a good chance at fish 30 inches and larger.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch in 2013 were sampled in above average numbers and smaller than average size with an average length of 6 inches weight of 0.09 pounds.  This was the highest catch on record, with the smallest average size.  The largest fish sampled was 7.1 inches which presently will not interest most fishermen, however; perch are a valuable forage species for the pike population. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker in 2013 were sampled in above average numbers and smaller than average size with an average length of 12.4 inches and weight of 1 pound.  The historical catch ranged from 22.5/lift in 1996 to 5/lift in 2007, weight ranged from 1.94 pounds in 1996 to 1 pound in 2013.  White Suckers are also a valuable forage species for the pike. <br> \n <br> \nTwo Largemouth Bass and four Bluegill were sampled in trap nets.  All fish were small and two years old.  Largemouth Bass were first sampled in 1996 and Bluegill in 2007.  It appears that their numbers at this time are limited and they provide for a poor fishery. <br> \n <br> \nIn 1988, 600 fingerling and 72 adult Black Crappies were stocked.  This was the first assessment since 1991 that no crappies were sampled.  Since the initial stocking, their numbers and average size has fluctuated widely.  Their absence in the catch in 2013 is a bit puzzling given the fact that both Bluegill and Largemouth Bass were captured, indicating that winterkill is not a likely cause.  It appears that all three of these species maintain small populations in Grass Lake with occasional year classes in an optimal growing year. <br> \n</p>",
