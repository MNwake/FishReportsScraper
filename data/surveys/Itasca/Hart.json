                "narrative": "<p>Hart Lake is a moderately-sized lake located in southeastern Itasca County near the town of Pengilly.  The lake is moderately fertile and has good water clarity.  Much of the shoreline is undeveloped and in a natural state.  Hart Lake is within the Mississippi River watershed.  There are three inlets of wetland origin and an outlet to Swan Lake.  A county-owned earthen ramp access is located at the north end of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 lake management plan (LMP) listed Northern Pike as the primary management species with Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie and Bluegill as secondary management species.  A standard lake survey was conducted in August 2022 to update information on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nGill-net catches for Northern Pike have been variable, ranging from 1 to 8.1/net in previous surveys.  The 2022 catch rate (2.1/net) was typical for Hart Lake but below average compared to similar lakes.  Low catch rates are desirable because they contribute to faster growth and better size quality for pike.  Northern Pike size structure was fairly good in 2022.  Pike ranged from 17.0 to 33.8 inches and averaged 23.9 inches.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the sample with faster than average growth.  Northern Pike averaged 24.4 inches after 4 years of growth.  Anglers should release pike larger than 26 inches to maintain or improve size quality.   <br> \n <br> \nGill-net and trap-net catches for Black Crappie were average for the lake and lakes with similar habitat.  Size structure was poor; crappie averaged 7 to 8 inches, and no fish exceeding 10 inches were sampled.  Five year-classes from age 2 through 6 were identified from scales.  Growth appeared slow with crappie averaging 6.7 inches after four years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nHart Lake has often produced moderate numbers of Bluegill with poor size structure.  The 2022 trap-net catch was below average for the lake at 7.5/net.  Size structure remained fairly poor with Bluegill ranging from 3.2 to 8.4 inches with an average length of 5.5 inches.  Eight year classes were sampled with ages 2 through 9 present.  Growth was similar to the lake class average with fish reaching 6.1 inches after 6 years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were the most common species captured in the gill nets.  The 2022 catch rate (5.6/net) was similar to the previous survey and typical for the lake class.  Sampled Tullibee ranged from 6.5 to 13.9 inches and averaged 10.6 inches.  Tullibee are an important prey species for the production of large predators like Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in average numbers for the lake and lake class.  Sampled bass ranged from 7.2 to 16.9 inches.  The size distribution suggested several year classes were present, though the fish were not aged.  A previous survey utilizing night electrofishing captured favorable numbers of bass, suggesting they are an important part of the fishery.  The lake's habitat and Bluegill prey base provide good conditions for Largemouth Bass and good angling opportunities likely exist.  Anglers are encouraged to release bass exceeding 15 inches to maintain quality angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the survey included Bowfin, Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hart Lake is a moderately sized, mesotrophic lake in southeastern Itasca County near the town of Pengilly.  The lake features moderate fertility, good water clarity, moderate residential development, and a diverse aquatic plant community.  Hart Lake supports a relatively diverse fish community, providing angling opportunities for several species.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the most common species captured in the gill net and the catch rate was within the expected range when compared to similar lakes.  About half of the captured individuals exceeded 21 inches in length, suggesting moderate angling opportunity for quality-sized pike.  Individuals exceeding 28 inches, however, were rare.  Relatively slow growth may limit the pike size structure.  Bluegill were the most common panfish in the sample, but occurred in relatively low numbers when compared to similar lakes.  The 2007 catch was the lowest observed for Hart Lake.  Historical records indicate poor bluegill size structure in Hart Lake.  In 2007, typically size remained small as only 25% of the captured individuals exceeded 6 inches.  Growth was slow, contributing to the small average size.  Black crappie were captured in relatively good abundance when compared to similar lakes.  The length distribution appeared balanced, although most individuals failed to exceed 8 inches as growth remained slow.  Largemouth bass were captured in good numbers during night electrofishing and Hart Lake may provide good angling opportunities for this species.  Slow growth appears to limit the size structure, however.   <br> \n <br> \nPrey availability may limit the Hart Lake fishery.  Historical records indicated high tullibee abundance when compared to similar lakes.  In 2007, tullibee catches were about average when compared to similar lakes and had dropped noticeably from previous surveys as the 2007 sample resulted in the lowest point observation of tullibee from Hart Lake.  Tullibee are an import prey species and a decline of this species may negatively impact predator populations.  Yellow perch are also an important prey species.  Yellow perch have historically been sampled in low numbers from Hart Lake and remained in low abundance in 2007.  Walleye were sampled in low numbers in 2007 as only two large individuals were captured.  Walleye were not sampled in Hart Lake from 1970 through 1992.  The occurrence of walleye in Hart Lake may be a result of emigration from Swan Lake.  Currently, downstream barriers appear to limit movement between the lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
