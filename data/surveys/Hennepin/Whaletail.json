                "narrative": "<p>Whaletail Lake is 510-acres (469 littoral acres) with a maximum depth of 22 feet. Whaletail is located northeast of St. Bonifacious in southwestern Hennepin County. Public water access is provided by DNR Parks and Trails on the northwest side of the lake off of County road 92 and West Highland road (up to 16 vehicle/trailer parking spaces). Whaletail is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Black Crappie, but also supports catchable populations of Bluegill and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was conducted on Whaletail Lake during the week of 7/26/2021 to assess the fishery. During the 2021 survey, Whaletail was productive (brown-green stained water), with low water clarity, measured at 3 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen was zero parts per million (ppm) below 11 feet during the survey period. Eurasian Watermilfoil has been found in Whaletail Lake and remains present. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled with gill nets (9.0/net), at a comparable rate to similar lakes in the metro. The 2021 survey marked the highest Northern Pike catch rate in the previous 25 years. Although record catches were recorded, this did not negatively impact Northern Pike size structure. There were 54 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 24.9 inches and the largest measured at 34.3 inches. Northern Pike size indices describe a balanced population (an intermediate between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish). Northern Pike growth was fast compared to similar lakes across the metro, with an average length of 22.7 inches by age 4. Northern Pike had an annual mortality estimate of 37%, and consistent recruitment, with 6 consecutive year classes present during sampling and age analysis. Northern Pike in Whaletail Lake appear to be thriving with high numbers, fast growth, consistent recruitment, and low mortality. As a reminder, anglers can keep 10 northern pike on Whaletail Lake, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (17.5/net) and trap nets (5.8/net). There were 153 Black Crappie sampled during the 2021 survey, with an average length of 6.5 inches and the largest measured at 9.5 inches. Black Crappie in Whaletail Lake were mainly composed of small individuals with only 12% of fish sampled greater than 8 inches. Black Crappie growth was typical of the metro area, with an average length of 6.6 inches by age 3. Black Crappie mortality was high with an estimated annual mortality rate of 47%. While Whaletail Lake had been known as a crappie fishing destination, much of this was attributed to the White Crappie population. White Crappie were virtually non-existent from the 2021 survey with 3 fish sampled, and an average length of 6.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (39.4/net). Although not an extremely high catch rate based on similar lakes, the 2021 catch rate was the highest Bluegill catch on Whaletail Lake in the previous 25 years. There were 355 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2021 survey, with an average length of 5.0 inches and the largest measured at 8.1 inches. Bluegill densities are currently high, leading to competition among individuals, in turn reducing growth potential, and keeping sizes low. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Whaletail Lake, although targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2021 survey. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught 21 Largemouth Bass, which averaged 15.4 inches, with the largest measured at 19.5 inches. Targeted boat-electrofishing is intended for the next survey (scheduled for 2026 + 1 yr). <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, White Crappie, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

The average length sampled in the gillnets was 25.6 inches and was 28.4 inches in the trapnets. The yellow perch population was found to be average for this type of lake. The average length was only 5.8 inches. Yellow bullheads are very abundant and individuals up to 14.4 inches were sampled. Largemouth bass were sampled in average to above average numbers in this survey. The largest bass measured was 17.5 inches in length. The mean weight of these fish was above average for this type of lake. Other species present in Whaletail Lake include bowfin, brown bullhead, carp, golden shiner, white crappie, and pumpkinseed sunfish.    </p>",

Black crappie sizes, however, are average to slightly below average. Yellow perch were found in average numbers, and average mean weights for both gear types. Bluegills were also sampled in average numbers and weight. Their mean length is 6.5 inches, which is approximately the size anglers begin to harvest. Northern pike numbers were low in the gillnets and average in the trapnets. The mean weight of these fish was high and the mean length was 26.3 inches. Black bullhead numbers were low in the gillnets and average in the trapnets. The mean lengths were 10.8 inches in the gillnets and 12.2 inches in the trapnets. Only three largemouth bass were sampled in the trapnets, which is slightly below average. All other species were sampled in average numbers in the gillnets. In the trapnets bowfin and green sunfish were found in average numbers, while brown bullheads, golden shiners, white crappies, and white suckers were sampled in lower than average numbers. Pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow bullheads were captured in high numbers.</p>",

This catch rate is down from the 1999 survey (76.2 per gill net), but was similar to the 1993 catch rate (30.7 per gill net).  Size is similar to fish sampled in 1999 with black crappies sampled during this survey having a mean length of 6.4 inches and a mean weight of 0.13 lb.  Black crappies surveyed in 1999 had a mean length of 5.6 inches and a mean weight of 0.1 lb.  During this survey the larger black crappies were captured in trap nets than gill nets.  The average length and weight of black crappies sampled in trap nets was 7.3 inches and 0.21 lb., respectively, with the largest black crappie captured being over 13 inches long (13.03 inches).  The largest black crappie sampled in gill nets was 7.6 inches.  Most of the black crappies aged were from the 2001 and 2002 year classes (3 and 4 years old) and growth was below average.White crappie are also abundant in Whaletail Lake.  The number per gill net (15.8) exceeded the 75% quartile for class 38 lakes.  Similar to black crappies, trap nets caught larger white crappies than gill nets.  In gill nets, the mean length and weight was 6.3 inches and 0.11 lb., respectively, with the largest individual being 8.1 inches long.  In trap nets, white crappie mean length and weight was 8.1 inches and 0.26 lb., respectively, with the largest individual sampled being 13.7 inches long.  Of 44 white crappie measured, 17 (39%) were 8.5 inches or greater.  Three year classes (2001-2003) made up the majority of white crappie sampled, with growth being slower than average.  Bluegill were the most abundant fish in trap nets, but were sampled (17.6 bluegill per trap net) within the normal range for a class 38 lake.  This catch rate was less than what has been observed in 1999 (28.8 per trap net) and 1993 (32.3 per trap net).  Size has increased slightly from 1999, when mean length and weight was 5.1 inches and 0.08 lb., respectively.  Mean length and weight of bluegill during this survey was 5.9 inches and 0.16 lb., respectively.  Few fish over seven inches were sampled.  Several year classes were sampled, with growth being below average.  Northern pike and largemouth bass are the main predators in Whaletail Lake.  Both species should provide good fishing for anglers.  Northern pike abundance in gill nets was average for Whaletail Lake.  The number per gill net (3.3) was between the 25% and 50% quartile for a class 38 lake.  All northern pike sampled in gill nets were over 25 inches long, with a mean length of 28.9 inches and a mean weight of 6 lbs. Growth was above average with age 5, 7, and 8 fish being most abundant.  Largemouth bass catch per trap net (1.0 per net) was slightly above the 75% quartile for this lake class.  Size is good, with largemouth bass averaging almost 3 lbs. and 16 inches.  Two bass over 20 inches were sampled.  The yellow perch population is not abundant in Whaletail Lake.  Only 15 perch were sampled in gill nets and no fish over 7 inches were captured.  Yellow bullheads are abundant in the lake, with gill net catches (6.3 per gill net) being over the 75% quartile for class 38 lakes.  These bullheads average 0.71 lb. and 11 inches long.  Other fish sampled in minimal abundance were black bullhead, brown bullhead, golden shiner, green sunfish, and common carp.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whaletail Lake is a 558 acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The lake is located in west central Hennepin County, just south of Minnetrista.  Water quality is poor, compared to other West Metro lakes.  By late summer most species of fish cannot inhabit water deeper than 11 feet for extended periods of time.  Anglers should keep this in mind when pursuing northern and crappie.  Fishing in water deeper than 11 feet in mid to late summer could yield very few fish.  Boaters should also keep in mind that new state laws require the drain plug be removed while traveling on public roadways.    <br> \n <br> \nThe predator community in Whaletail Lake reflects a natural state. No stocking occurs.  Northern pike numbers were low compared to historic averages for Whaletail Lake.  Average length was 26.8 inches.  Average weight was high compared to similar lakes.  In the 2011 population assessment largemouth bass abundance was low compared to past surveys.  Average length of largemouth bass was 12.6 inches. Standard lake survey gear does not consistently provide an accurate estimate of largemouth bass abundance.    <br> \n <br> \nSix species of panfish are present in Whaletail Lake.  Black crappie abundance is above average.  Some large fish were sampled. Average length was under 7 inches, but individuals up to 12.3 inches were observed. Bluegill abundance decreased to the lowest measure of abundance seen in Whaletail.  Compared to similar lakes, abundance remains average.  Average weight of bluegill did not change.  Over 50% of sampled bluegill were greater than 6 inches.  Yellow perch abundance in Whaletail Lake is average.  Mean weight of yellow perch was below average.  Average length was 6.4 inches.  Pumpkinseed were sampled at a low abundance.  Hybrid sunfish were also sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nOverall, rough fish are present in low numbers.  Common carp abundance decreased to the lowest level since 1973.  Black bullhead were also sampled at low abundance.  Yellow bullhead numbers decreased as well, but remain above average compared to similar lakes.  White sucker abundance is low.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whaletail Lake (DOW# 27-0184-00) is a 558-acre lake with a maximum depth of 22 feet. The lake is located in west-central Hennepin County, just south of Minnetrista. Whaletail Lake is being actively managed for Northern Pike (NOP), Black Crappie (BLC), and Bluegill (BLG). Whaletail Lake also supports populations of White Crappie (WHC) and Largemouth Bass (LMB). A standard survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was conducted on Whaletail Lake during the week of 8/1/2016 to monitor water characteristics and fish populations. Water color was brown/green, with low water clarity (2.0 feet in the main basin and 3.5 feet in the southeast basin). During this August survey, dissolved oxygen sharply fell to zero parts per million (ppm) below 8 feet in the main basin and below 10 feet in the southeast basin. Eurasian Watermilfoil has also been documented in Whaletail Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike (NOP) gill net catches in Whaletail Lake averaged 7.3/net, more than double any catch rate in the previous 25 years. A catch rate of 7.3/net is also above the Whaletail Lake management goal of 4.7/net. Of the 44 NOP captured in gill nets, average size was 22.5 inches with the largest individual measured at 35.6 inches. Size structure was balanced and near management levels with high numbers of small fish and low numbers of large individuals. Historically Northern Pike body condition has been good; however 2016 was the exception, which saw the lowest average body condition in 25 years. The high numbers of NOP during the 2016 survey likely contributed to reduced body condition through increased competition. While a large year class (22/44) of age 2 Northern Pike made up the bulk of fish sampled, NOP were also identified in every age group from 1 through 8, suggesting consistent recruitment. Northern Pike catch rates and size structure are meeting or exceeding the long range goals for the species. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie (BLC) gill net catches averaged 13.5/net, double the expected catch of similar lakes. Average size of Black Crappie sampled was 6.4 inches, with the longest measured at 9.8 inches. Despite this high abundance, body condition was good. Intense angling pressure over recent winters may have begun to impact larger-sized crappie. Black Crappie recruitment is variable and the aging data reflects this, with inconsistent year classes showing up in the survey. However, the future outlook is bright with a strong year class of age-2 BLC, currently averaging about 6 inches; these fish have potential to benefit from their body conditions and fewer numbers. Age-2 fish should begin to reach preferred sizes (10 inches) in 1-2 years if sufficient numbers escape harvest. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill (BLG) trap net catches averaged 17.4/net, slightly above the target management level. Over the previous 25 years, Bluegill numbers have remained stable (16.4-32.3/net). During the 2016 survey, 157 Bluegill were sampled in trap nets, with an average length of 6.2 inches and a maximum length of 7.9 inches. Body condition of bluegill remains high. Age analysis reveals consistent reproduction among years, reinforcing the stable numbers seen in historic net catches. While Whaletail Lake may not provide a trophy Bluegill fishery, it does produce a consistent supply of catchable-sized (6 inches+) bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappie (WHC) in Whaletail Lake were sampled with trap nets (1.3/net) and gill nets (0.8/net), catch rates that are low compared to similar lakes. White Crappie, similar to Black Crappie, have the potential to produce a large year class given the right environmental conditions. Current numbers show multiple missing year classes, which may reflect recruitment problems. Despite low numbers, White Crappie may have benefitted from reduced competition, as size structure and body condition were well above expected rates. Of the 17 White Crappie measured, average length was 8.7 inches, with a maximum length of 14.7 inches. Although White Crappie numbers in Whaletail Lake are low, the population during this survey provided excellent opportunity for anglers to catch some good-sized (12 inches+) fish. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass (LMB) are present in Whaletail Lake, although boat electrofishing was not conducted in 2016. Seven (7) Largemouth Bass were captured with trap and gill nets, with an average length of 14.6 inches; the largest measured 20.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n</p>",
