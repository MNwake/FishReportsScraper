High Walleye densities of a decade ago may be associated with fry stocking in adjoining Mitawan Lake. Bluegill trapnet catches have also declined from 6.8/lift to 1/lift while at the same time Northern Pike catches have been increasing. The changes in these net catches may be statistically insignificant because of the low number of nets used. </p>",

The Northern Pike gillnet catch of 12.0/lift is near the all time high, and an average size near 3.0 pounds.           Yellow Perch densities have decreased substantially. Historical gillnet catches have averaged over 90.0/lift, while the 1992 gillnet catch was only 14.0/lift.     Trapnet catches of Bluegill have increased during the last two assessments, however there appears to be fewer Bluegill over 8.0 inches than in previous assessments. Age III and IV were the predominant year classes represented comprising nearly 83% of the aged sample.     Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass are present, but they are not abundant.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye catch in 2004 was average compared to other lakes in this class and typical of catches in other surveys in this lake.  The size of walleye collected in this survey was good, with an average weight of 1.9 lb and fish weighing up to 3.4 lb.  This is a small lake and overall the walleye population probably is not very large.Kitigan Lake has historically maintained a relatively high northern pike population and the catch in 2004 indicated numbers were still fairly high.  The average size was 3.1 lb with fish up to 10.6 lb sampled.  Most of the northern pike collected were between 21 and 25 inches.Yellow perch were sampled in above average numbers and averaged about 7.3 inches.  Approximately 33% of the fish were between 8 and 9 inches, the size many anglers consider large enough to keep.  Fish larger than 10 inches are not common in this lake.Bluegill were sampled in above average numbers and the catch included a good number of quality size fish.  Average size of bluegill was 7.5 inches with fish up to 9.9 inches collected. Approximately 33% of the bluegill were larger than 8 inches.Smallmouth bass and largemouth bass were collected in the nets; however, these species are \"net shy\" making it difficult to evaluate the status of the populations.  These species are best captured by electrofishing; however, it is not feasible to get this type of equipment into the lake.  Only one smallmouth bass was collected, which weighed 1.7 lb.  Largemouth bass ranged from 11 to 16 inches, with the largest weighing 2.7 lb.The fish population in Kitigan Lake is maintained through natural reproduction.  No stocking of any kind has been done since 1990.  The lake is connected to Mitawan Lake and small boats can travel between the lakes in years of normal water levels.  There is no designated public access to either Kitigan Lake or Mitawan Lake.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kitigan (Lower Sand) Lake is a moderately hard-water lake in the Mitawan Creek system of the Kawishiwi watershed.  The area of the lake is approximately 74 acres and the maximum depth is 6 feet.  The lake is accessible through Forest Service Road #177, which crosses the inlet from Mitawan Lake.  A private road to several cabins on the southeast shore is also present.  Kitigan Lake has one inlet (from Mitawan Lake) and an outlet.  A makeshift dam is present on the outlet, and a head of 0.4 foot was held by the dam at the time of the survey.  Kitigan Lake is mostly surrounded by moderately high forest land , with limited areas of shoreline marsh scattered about the lake.  Lake bottom soils are mostly muck, muck/sand and sand.  Limited areas of sand and gravel with rubble are also present.At the time of the survey, aquatic vegetation was abundant throughout most of the lake, at all depths.  Pondweeds and waterlilies were the most common plants.  In test nettting, White Sucker, Rock Bass, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were taken in numbers greater than state-wide and watershed averages.  Most of the Northern Pike taken were greater than 22 inches in total length, and most of the Bluegill were longer than 7 inches.  All of the Largemouth Bass taken were below 9.5 inches and most of the Rock Bass were below 7 inches in length.  The only Black Crappie taken was 11.2 inches long.  Shoreline seining caught young-of-the-year Rock Bass, Yellow Perch, Iowa Darter and several species of minnows.  Spawning facilities were rated \"fair\" for Northern Pike, \"fair to good\" for Largemouth Bass and centrarchid panfish, and \"poor to fair\" for Walleye and Smallmouth Bass.Residents reported fair Northern Pike and Bluegill fishing during the 1961 season.  Kitigan Lake gets less fishing pressure than adjoining Mitawan Lake, but Walleye have reportedly been taken in Kitigan Lake.  Waterfowl occasionally use Kitigan Lake during the migration.Fish and water samples collected in October 1961, were tested by the Minnesota Department of Health, Division of Environmental Sanitation.  The tests indicated the water had a total hardness of 56 ppm, and alkalinity of 50 ppm, chloride of 2.5 ppm, sulfate at 11.3 ppm ad calcium as CaCO2 at 35 ppm.  Sucker flesh tested had 29 (+ or - 4) micromicrocuries of strontium 90 per gram of calcium.There is an old wooden dam on the outlet, and there has been some argument among residents concerning the water level controls, and \"tampering\" with the dam.</p>",
