                "narrative": "<p>Bass Lake is primarily managed for panfish, although northern pike and largemouth bass both inhabit the lake.     The bluegill trap net catch rate (67.8/set) exceeded the expected range for this type of lake.  The mean length for sampled bluegill was 6.9 inches, ranging in length from 3.7 to 9.0 inches.  Growth rates were near the mean for this type of lake.     The black crappie trap net catch rate (8.0/set) exceeded the expected range.  Sampled crappie had a mean length of 7.2 inches, and ranged in length  from 6.1 to 9.0 inches.  Growth rates for crappie were below (<85%) the statewide mean for ages 1 and 2, and near statewide mean for age 3.     Pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled with trap nets at a rate (15.9/set) that exceeded the expected range.  The mean length of sampled pumpkinseed was 6.4 inches, ranging from 3.3 to 8.4 inches.     Yellow perch were sampled in gill nets at a rate (14.0/set) within the expected range.  The mean length was 6.8 inches, ranging from 3.7 to 10.6 inches.     Northern pike sampled with gill nets had a catch rate (1.3/set) below the expected range.  The mean weight (6.2 pounds), however, was much greater than the expected range.  Northern pike ranged in length from 23.9 to 38.8 inches, and had a mean length of 29.3 inches.  Growth rates for pike were greater than (>115%) the statewide mean for ages 1-4, and near the mean for age 5.     Largemouth bass sampled in gill nets had a catch rate (1.5/set) within the expected range, and had a range in length from 11.0 to 15.4 inches.  Daytime electrofishing had a catch rate of 5.1/hour, and a mean length of 13.1 inches.  The electrofishing catch rate is considerably less than the previous survey catch rate in 1992, which ranged from 9.0 to 60.0 per hour.  This is most likely due to water temperature, which was warmer in 1997 due to a later sampling date.  Growth rates for largemouth were below (<85%) the statewide mean.     Other species sampled in test nets include: golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass.     Anglers can ensure continued good fishing on Bass Lake by practicing catch and release fishing.</p>",
