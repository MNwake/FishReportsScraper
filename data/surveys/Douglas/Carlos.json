Catch rate values from previous assessments in 1973, 1980 and 1985 were under 5.0 fish/gillnet night. The increase may be due to fingerling stockings in 1985, 1986, and 1987. All three year-classes were well represented in the 1988 survey. Four trophy-size walleye exceeding 27.0 inches in length were captured. Northern pike remained abundant (10.70 northern pike/gillnet) and mean weight was correspondingly small (1.71 pounds). However, growth was above average through age 3 and their length frequency distribution indicates fair recruitment to quality sizes. Large northern pike may be difficult to sample during summer months. Yellow perch abundance has declined from previous surveys. The walleye population increase has probably caused the yellow perch decline. Bluegill abundance has steadily declined from past assessments. Bluegill mean weight remains small (0.10 pound) although largemouth bass and black crappie populations were not adequately sampled, both species provide quality fishing.</p>",

Catch rates have ranged from 3.4-10.9 fish/net in previous lake surveys dating back to 1973.  The highest catch rate of 10.9 fish/net was recorded during the last survey in 1988.  A long range goal of 10 fish/net is stated in the lake management plan.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.7 pounds.  There were numerous walleye that exceeded 20.0 inches in total length.  PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 48.3% and 34.5%, respectively.  Ages 2-10 were represented in the catch.  Analysis of age class distribution indicates that strong year classes were produced in 1986, 1989, and 1990.  It is difficult to evaluate the efficiency of past walleye fingerling stockings.  There were only two blank years out of the last ten which to evaluate occurrence of natural reproduction.  Growth of walleye in Lake Carlos is greater than the mean growth rate of walleye in other area lakes within lake class 22.  Age 5 fish average 18.9 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Northern pike catches averaged 10.2 fish/gillnet in 1992, which exceeds the third quartile of mean catch rates (8.0 fish/net) for lakes within lake class 22.  The catch rate in 1992 is almost identical to the catch rate of 10.7 fish/net recorded in 1988.  The size structure indicates the population is mostly comprised of small fish.  Mean weight of fish captured in gillnets was 1.7 pounds. PSD was calculated at 22.4%.  Northern pike PSD was calculated at 35% in the 1988 survey.  Ages 2-4 comprised 88.0% of the fish captured.  Growth of northern pike in Lake Carlos is similar to the mean growth rate of northern pike in other area lakes within lake class 22.  Daytime, ac electrofishing yielded 26.0 stock size largemouth bass per hour.  Sub-stock catch rate averaged 2.0 fish per hour.  PSD and RSD-P values were calculated at 40.4% and 3.8%, respectively. This electrofishing survey was the first largemouth bass assessment completed on Lake Carlos, thus there is no historical data or management objectives established by which to compare to the results of this effort.  The catch rate and size structure of largemouth bass is within the expectations for this lake type.  Largemouth bass growth is poor, but similar to other area lakes within the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Age 5 fish average 12.8 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Lack of preferred size fish (greater than 15.0 inches) captured in the sample is likely the result of the poor growth rate. Bluegill catches averaged 38.7 fish/trapnet in 1992 which is within the normal range of mean catch rates (3.3-42.8 fish/trapnet) for lake class 22. A catch rate of 26.3 fish/trapnet was recorded during the 1988 population assessment.  In addition to the slight increase in bluegill catch rate, PSD increased from 12.1% in 1988 to 41.6% in 1992. There were no fish that exceeded 8.0 inches in total length captured during either survey.  Lack of larger fish is likely the result of poor growth.  Age 5 fish average only 3.7 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Size selective harvest has the potential to shift size structure of the population downward, given the suppressed growth rate.  Yellow perch catches averaged  2.0 fish/net which is below the first quartile of mean catch rates (5.8 fish/gillnet) from lakes within lake class 22.  Catch rates have ranged from 12.3 to 1.6 fish/gillnet in previous surveys.  High predator densities may be limiting yellow perch abundance. Black crappie were not sampled in sufficient numbers to evaluate the population.  Trapnet catch rate averaged 0.3 fish/net in 1992.  Previous catch rates have ranged from 3.6 - 1.1 fish/net.  Tullibee were not captured during the survey but are likely present in the deepwater habitats of the lake that are not efficiently sampled with standard survey gear.  The tullibee population may provide an alternative forage for larger walleye and northern pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Carlos is a 2,605-acre basin located approximately 4 miles north of Alexandria.  It is the largest, deepest, and lower-most basin making up the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Mean and maximum depths are 50.0 and 163.0 feet, respectively.  The lake's outlet forms the headwaters of the Long Prairie River.  Lake Carlos has very good water quality with moderate levels of important nutrients.  Good water quality conditions are likely attributed to a relatively small immediate watershed area and the lake's downstream location in the Alexandria Chain.  Upstream basins assimilate nutrients and pollutants before runoff water is delivered to Lake Carlos.  Even though Lake Carlos is heavily developed and municipal-scale growth is occurring within south and eastern watershed areas, long-term water quality monitoring records depict declines in nutrient loading and above average water quality.  Similar to other lakes within the Alexandria Chain of Lakes, water clarity has increased substantially following zebra mussel infestation.  Mid-summer water clarity measurements on Lake Carlos now exceed 20.0 feet.  Because of its clarity and navigable connections to other lakes comprising the Alexandria Chain, Lake Carlos is a very popular destination for both recreational boaters and anglers.\n\nFour points of public access are available on Lake Carlos.  The west and north accesses have a loading/unloading dock, are deeper, have ample parking, and are better suited for launching larger boats.  The north access is located within Carlos State Park.  Use of this access requires a Minnesota State Park permit.  A fish cleaning station is adjacent to this access.  The northeast and east accesses are relatively small and have limited parking.\n     \nLake Carlos has a diverse fish assemblage and supports good fishing opportunities.  The 2016 lake survey revealed a fish community typical of many bass-panfish lakes found throughout west-central Minnesota.  Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass are abundant and support a very popular fishery.  The Alexandria Chain of Lakes is host to several bass tournaments throughout the year.  Both bass species tend to grow relatively slow in Lake Carlos and populations tend to be dominated by medium-sized fish.  However, Largemouth Bass exceeding 19.0 inches and Smallmouth Bass exceeding 18.0 inches were sampled during the 2016 survey.  Panfishing is also popular, especially during the open water season.  Anglers can expect good numbers of Black Crappies, Bluegills, and Pumpkinseed Sunfish.  Larger crappie are relatively common, whereas most Bluegill and Pumpkinseed tend to be small.  Harvestable-size Yellow Perch are also present but abundance is low.  The Northern Pike population is characterized as having moderate to high abundance and moderate size structure.  Larger pike are present but \"hammer handles\" (i.e., small pike) comprise much of this population.  Average size of 2016 gill net captures was 19.2 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleye anglers can expect low to moderate numbers of harvestable-size fish.  Average size of 2016 gill net captures was 18.2 inches and 2.4 pounds.  The Walleye population is supplemented with combined fingerling stockings by the DNR and a cooperative arrangement by the Lake Carlos Association and Vikings Sportsmen Club, Inc.\n \nOther species common to Lake Carlos include Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, and White Sucker.  Burbot have also been sampled in Lake Carlos, which is the only lake in the Glenwood Management Area known to support this species.  The next standard lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2020.\n \nLake Carlos is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels.  Eurasian watermilfoil was first confirmed in an upstream basin in 2012.  Zebra mussels were first confirmed in 2009.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.  For more information regarding aquatic invasive species in Minnesota see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html\n\nLake Carlos was selected as a sentinel lake in the Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE) project.  The SLICE project was initiated to monitor and document biological and chemical responses that may be associated with climate change and other environmental stressors.  For more information on the SLICE/Sentinel Lakes project see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/slice/index.html \n</p>",

The median size has improved slightly from 1.31 pounds each in 1980 to 1.6 pounds now. Walleye numbers remain virtually the same as in 1980 and are slightly above state medians. There is a relatively strong year class of age 3 walleyes that appears to be a result of a 1982 fingerling stocking. The 1983 fry stocking appears to have been a failure. No age 2 walleyes were sampled. Bluegill numbers remain high and average size is still small.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Carlos, located on the north end of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes on the outskirts of Alexandria, is the largest lake on the Chain.  Water quality is quite good as evidenced by a summer secchi reading of 10 feet.  Lake Carlos is the deepest lake in the area with a maximum depth of 163 feet.  Vegetation is relatively limited to the north and east central portions of the lake.  Protecting the existing vegetation is vital to maintaining the existing water quality and quality fisheries.  Think twice before you destroy the aquatic vegetation.Carlos State Park is located on the north end of the lake.  A good swimming beach and boat ramp are available.  With all of the recreational opportunities available on the Chain, this would be a great place to take a family vacation.A high quality, multi-species fishery exists on Lake Carlos.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 4.0 fish/net.  This catch is similar to the previous survey results.  These are nice sized fish averaging 18 inches with a mean weight of 2.2 pounds.  The largest fish sampled measured just shy of 28 inches.  Lake Carlos offers plenty of traditional walleye structure.  In the summer, look for these fish where the thermocline intersects dropoffs.  Ice anglers have had very good success with cooperative walleye.Northern pike are very abundant.  These fish averaged 19.5 inches and had an average weight of 1.8 pounds.  Although on the small side, these fish can add some fast paced fishing.  Plenty of fish are taken by walleye anglers on traditional lindy rigs but can be targeted by trolling spoons and crankbaits on the north end of the lake.Bluegill are plentiful in Lake Carlos.  These fish are small with an average length of 6 inches.  These fish can be caught right off the dock or along the weedlines on the north and east side.  Black crappie are present in fair numbers but can be difficult to locate.  Try the emergent vegetation stands south of the State Park.Largemouth bass fishing can be excellent.  Bass are extremely abundant with a spring electrofishing survey resulting in a catch of 103 fish/hour.  This is a numbers lake with the mean length of the fish going 12.5 inches.  The largest fish measured just under 19 inches.  These fish can be located on the north and east sides along the weedlines.  Don't be afraid to throw plastics on rocky dropoffs on the west side.  Smallmouth bass were once present in the Alexandria Chain of Lakes but are rare today.  Recently, smallmouth bass fingerlings were stocked in the Long Prairie River just downstream of Lake Carlos in an attempt to reestablish a smallmouth fishery in the river.  These fish were sampled at the outlet of Lake Carlos and hopefully they will also contribute to the fishery in the Chain.Lake Carlos can provide some phenomenal late season duck hunting.  When all the other area lakes are frozen, Lake Carlos is a magnet to a diversity of ducks.  The emergent vegetation on the north end can be a popular spot.  Be prepared for some big water duck hunting action.The Alexandria Chain of Lakes draws a diversity of recreational interests due to its navigable connection to over 6,000 acres of water.   From pleasure boating to jet and water skiing to swimming and fishing.  If the fishing slows down at your hot spot, or you just feel adventurous, try exploring the scenery and fishing opportunities throughout the Chain. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Lake Carlos was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff beginning 26 July 2021.  Twenty-four sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 24 sites.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample 21 sites, a 15-foot seine was used at two sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at one sampling site.  Nearshore sampling captured 27 native species of fish including nine species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 26-29 July 2021 by IBI Program Staff.  Fifteen trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill, Common Carp, and Walleye comprised a majority of the catch by biomass.  The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 22 lakes and the average length was 5.2 inches, with 4% over 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Carlos is a 2,605-acre basin located approximately 4 miles north of Alexandria.  It is the largest, deepest, and lowermost basin making up the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Average and maximum depths are 50 and 163 feet, respectively.  The lake's outlet forms the headwaters of the Long Prairie River.  Lake Carlos has very good water quality with moderate levels of nutrients.  Good water quality conditions are likely attributed to a limited watershed size and the lake's downstream location in the Alexandria Chain.  Upstream basins remove nutrients and pollutants before runoff water is delivered to Lake Carlos.  Similar to other lakes within the Alexandria Chain of Lakes, water clarity has increased substantially following zebra mussel infestation.  Mid-summer water clarity measurements on Lake Carlos now exceed 20.0 feet.  Because of its clarity and navigable connections to other lakes comprising the Alexandria Chain, Lake Carlos is a very popular destination for both recreational boaters and anglers.\n\nFour points of public access are available on Lake Carlos.  The west and north accesses have a loading/unloading dock, are deeper, have ample parking, and are better suited for launching larger boats.  The north access is located within Carlos State Park and use requires a Minnesota State Parks permit.  A fish cleaning station is adjacent to this access.  The northeast and east accesses are relatively small and have limited parking.\n\nA standard fisheries survey was completed during summer 2020 to provide updated information on the fish community of Lake Carlos.  Standard survey components typically include spring electrofishing, gill nets, and trap nets.  However, due to safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, gill nets were the only component used in 2020.\n  \nBlack Crappie catch rates were low, but are typically not sampled well in mid-summer because of their tendency to move offshore and into deeper water during summer months.  The population is likely greater than suggested by this survey.  However, crappies were at sizes that would be of interest to anglers with average and maximum lengths of 9.1 and 12.1 inches, respectively.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed are abundant in Lake Carlos but tend to be small.  Anglers willing to do some sorting should be able to find harvestable-size fish.  Yellow Perch were not very abundant, with most too small to be of interest to anglers.  Both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass are present in Lake Carlos.  Largemouth Bass tend to grow slow, but live long enough to reach larger sizes.  Largemouth Bass up to 15.8 inches and Smallmouth Bass up to 19.5 inches were sampled.\n \nNorthern Pike are very abundant.  Large pike are present but majority of this population is comprised of fish under 22 inches.  Average and maximum lengths were 20.8 and 31.7 inches, respectively.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike.  New Northern Pike zone regulations were implement in 2018 to increase pike size structure.  Lake Carlos is in the North-central Zone, where all pike 22 to 26 inches must be released.  Anglers can keep 10 pike but not more than two can be longer than 26 inches.  Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches, or two larger than 26 inches.  For more information see: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/pike/index.html.\n\nWalleye anglers can expect low numbers of Walleye in Lake Carlos.  Walleye tend to be larger because of the lack of young fish.  Average and maximum sizes were 18.7 inches and 28.0 inches, respectively.  The Walleye population is supplemented with fingerling stockings by the MN DNR.  Fingerlings are also stocked under private permit by the Lake Carlos Association.\n\nYellow Bullhead are abundant with over 28% exceeding 12.0 inches.  Additional species sampled include Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Greater Redhorse, hybrid sunfish, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, and White Sucker.  The next standard fisheries survey is tentatively scheduled for 2024.\n\nLake Carlos is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels.  Eurasian watermilfoil was first confirmed in an upstream basin in 2012.  Zebra mussels were confirmed in 2009.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can negatively affect lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain water from their boat before leaving the access.  For more information regarding aquatic invasive species see the following: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/ais/index.html\n\nLake Carlos was selected as a sentinel lake in the Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE) project.  The SLICE project was initiated to monitor and document biological and chemical responses that may be associated with climate change and other environmental stressors.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Carlos is a deep, 2,552-acre mesotrophic basin located approximately 4 miles north of Alexandria.  It is the lowermost basin making up the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  The lake's outlet forms the headwaters of the Long Prairie River.  Being the largest and deepest lake of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes at 163 feet, Lake Carlos was selected as a sentinel lake in the Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE) project.  The SLICE project was initiated to monitor and document biological and chemical responses that may be associated with climate change and other environmental stressors.  As part of the SLICE project, supplemental population and special assessments of Lake Carlos will continue in addition to routine monitoring efforts.  The current survey was completed as part of the SLICE project.  \n\nLake Carlos has very good water quality with moderate levels of important nutrients.  Mid-summer water clarity averages 12.0 feet.  Good water quality conditions are likely attributed to a limited watershed size (10,320 acres) and the lake's downstream location in the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Upstream basins assimilate nutrients and pollutants before runoff water is delivered to Lake Carlos.   Even though Lake Carlos is heavily developed and municipal-scale growth is occurring within south and eastern watershed areas, long-term water quality monitoring records depict declines in nutrient loading and above average water quality.  There are suspicions that increasing water clarity may be related removal of nutrients by zebra mussels.  Zebra mussels were found in Lake Carlos in 2009.  \n\nLake Carlos has a diverse fish assemblage and supports good fishing opportunities.  Finding fishes such as walleye and northern pike in this deep lake can be challenging.   At the time of the July 22 survey, there was sufficient dissolved oxygen at 100 feet to support these sought after gamefishes.  Unconfined distribution of gamefishes throughout the water column reduces their vulnerability to capture in survey gear.  Capture rates and size structure of sampled walleye and northern pike likely under-estimate true population abundance and average sizes.  Walleye catches averaged 5.7 fish/gillnet, which suggests walleyes are moderately abundant.  Lengths of captures varied from 8.1 to 26.6 inches and averaged 15.8 inches.  Northern pike are abundant.  Pike captures averaged 19.2 inches due to high proportion of young fish in the population sample.  The largest pike caught measured 31.5 inches.  \n\nSunfishes common to Lake Carlos include largemouth and smallmouth bass, black crappie, bluegill sunfish, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish, and sunfish hybrids.  Due to the low fertility of Lake Carlos and intense competition for food, sunfishes grow slow.  Black crappie catches averaged only 7.6 inches due to elevated catches of two-year-old fish.  The largest crappie caught was 12.3 inches.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish are abundant, but few captures in survey gear exceed 8.0 inches.  Rock bass captures averaged 7.8 inches.\n\nUnder-exploited fishes in Lake Carlos include tullibee (northern cisco) and yellow bullheads.  Tullibee is a coldwater fish species.  They will occupy deep water during summer months.  Yellow bullhead catches in gillnets averaged 11.0 inches.  Eating quality of bullheads is good in this clear, clean lake.\n\nFour points of public access are available in Lake Carlos.  One boat launch is located along the western shore (UTM coordinates [zone 15]; 315914E, 5093504N) and a gravel access is located on the eastern shore (317635E, 5092551N).  Two additional public boat launches are located in Lake Carlos State Park (319159E, 5096339N; 319486E, 5095925N) and require a Minnesota State Parks permit or a fee for access.\n\nUpcoming surveys include a continuation of SLICE surveys (2014, 2015) and routine fisheries management surveys (2016, 2020).\n\nTwo aquatic invasive species, Eurasian water milfoil and zebra mussels have recently become established in Lake Carlos.  Appropriate steps should be taken to reduce risks of the transmission to other aquatic systems.  When transporting objects from infested waters please follow these guidelines 1) drain water from live wells and remove drain plugs from boats, 2) remove all aquatic plants or invertebrates, and 3) allow appropriate drying time (> 5 days) when moving objects from one system to another.  \n      \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Carlos is a 2,520-acre basin located about 4 miles north of Alexandria. It is the largest and deepest lake within the Alexandria Chain of Lakes. Maximum depth is 163 feet. The lake fully supports recreational use and is popular for both angling and other water-based recreation. Boaters can access other lakes within the chain via navigable channels. Lake Carlos State Park is located along the north shore of the lake and provides camping sites, a swim beach, and a boat ramp. Public accesses are also located on the west and east shores. In addition, a public access on Lake Le Homme Dieu is within a quarter mile of the channel leading into Carlos. Most of the shoreline is developed with residential housing. Water quality and clarity are good. Secchi disk transparency averages about 11 feet during summer months. Lake Carlos supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community. These aquatic plants help to maintain water quality and clarity by competing with algae for available nutrients in the lake. Aquatic plants also provide spawning habitat and cover for many fish species, especially bass and panfish. The outlet of Lake Carlos is the beginning of the Long Prairie River. <br> \n <br> \nLake Carlos supports a stable, well- balanced fish community. Largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie and northern pike are abundant and provide good fishing opportunities. Anglers can expect high catch rates for all of these species. The lake is well known to bass anglers. The Alex chain hosts several largemouth bass tournaments throughout the summer.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are moderately abundant, but fishing quality, in terms of average size of walleye making up the population, is very good.  Walleye gill net catches averaged 4.0 fish/net in 2008.  Mean weight of netted walleye was 2.5 lbs.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp abundance has increased in Lake Carlos and other basins throughout the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.   A heavy rain in June of 2003 occured at onset of the carp spawning period.  Highwater and extended runoff afforded carp opportunity and avenues to move to ideal spawning areas.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Gillnet catcheshave ranged from 3.4 to 10.9 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1980.  The normal range ofmean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics is 4.0 - 9.6fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1996 was 1.5 pounds.  Northern pike catches averaged 7.7fish/gillnet which is within the normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes (3.0 - 7.9fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches were greater in previous surveys, ranging from 10.2 to 17.1 fish/net. Size structure has been relatively constant over the past fifteen years.  Approximately one-third ofthe fish are between 21.0 and 28.0 inches in length, however few exceed 28.0 inches.  Nightime, DCelectrofishing yielded 84.6 stock-size largemouth bass per hour in 1996.  Mean weight of fish capturedwas 1.0 pounds.  About fifty percent of the fish captured were between 12.0 and 15.0 inches in length,however few exceeded 15.0 inches.  Bluegill catches decreased from 38.7 fish/trapnet in 1992 to 18.2fish/trapnet in 1996.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 26.3 to 57.1 fish/net in previous surveysdating back to 1980.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds in 1996.  About one third of the fishwere 6.0 inches or greater, however no fish exceeded 8.0 inches.  The yellow perch population islimited.  Gillnet catches averaged only 1.4 fish/net which is below the normal range of 7.1 -33.9fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 1.6 to 12.3 fish/net in previous surveys.  Mean weightof fish captured was 0.2 pounds.  Tullibee may provide an alternative forage for larger northern pikeand walleye.  However, they occupy deepwater habitats in the lake that are not effectively sampled withstandard survey gear.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Carlos is a 2,520-acre basin located about five miles north of Alexandria.  It is the largest and deepest lake within the Alex chain.  Maximum depth is 163 feet.  The lake fully supports recreational use and is popular for both angling and other water-based recreation.  Boaters can access other lakes within the chain via navigable channels.  Lake Carlos State Park is located along the north shore of the lake and provides camping sites, a nice swimming beach, and a boat ramp.  Most of the shoreline is heavily developed with residential housing.  Water quality and clarity are considered good.  Secchi disk transparency averages about 11 feet during summer months.  Lake Carlos supports a stable, well-balanced fish community.  Largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and northern pike are abundant and provide ample fishing opportunities.  Anglers can expect high catch rates for all of these species.  The lake is well known to bass anglers.  The Alex chain hosts several largemouth bass tournaments throughout the year.  Walleye are present in low to moderate numbers.  Walleye gill net catches averaged 4.5 fish/net in 2004, which is within the normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics.  Walleye of various sizes were stocked in 8 of 9 years between 1995 and 2003.       </p>",
