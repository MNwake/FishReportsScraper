                "narrative": "<p>Albert Lea Lake is a 2,654 acre lake located in Freeborn County near the city of Albert Lea. A city-maintained public access is located in town on the northwest corner of the lake. A DNR-maintained public accesses is located on the south side of the lake at Saint Nicholas Landing along County Road 19. Another public access is located within Myre Big Island State Park. Albert Lea Lake is a large, shallow lake with a maximum depth of 5.5 feet and an average depth of only 3.5 feet. Albert Lea Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Black Crappie. Walleye fry are stocked every other year at a rate of 1,000 fry per acre (about 2.6 million fry). The shallow, fertile waters of Albert Lea Lake are subject to periodic winterkill events. The most recent partial winterkill took place during the winter of 2013-14. After such events, Walleye fry and Yellow Perch adults are stocked during the following spring. Situations like this are managed as \"boom and bust\" fisheries, since fish survival is typically high due to reduced predators in the system and fish grow relatively fast after a winterkill due to reduced competition for resources. The \"boom\" years are typically 2-3 years post-winterkill, while the \"bust\" years are 0-1 year post-winterkill. Recent stocking events in Albert Lea include Walleye fry stocking in 2015, 2014 (following partial winterkill), 2013, 2011, and 2009. About 3,675 Yellow Perch adults were also stocked in 2014 after the partial winterkill. Albert Lea Lake was surveyed the week of June 22, 2015 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying six gill nets and twelve trap nets throughout the lake, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nThe Walleye gill net catch rate in the 2015 survey was 12.0 fish/net, which was less than the long-term average of 34.3 fish/net. This long-term average is highly influenced by the 2006 gill net catch rate (60.5 Walleye/net) which resulted from a very strong 2004 year class following a significant winterkill. Also, the 2015 catch rate may not accurately represent the 2014 year class, as many age-1 Walleye may not have recruited to gill nets yet. Walleye abundance in Albert Lea Lake has remained highly variable throughout the past decade, ranging from 12.0 to 60.0 fish/gill net since 2005. This is largely due to periodic winterkills and the successful year classes that follow. The 2015 survey produced two main year classes of Walleye; age-1 (stocked in 2014) and age-2 (stocked in 2013). The average length of age-1 Walleye was 9.8 inches, while the average length of age-2 Walleye was 14.9 inches. Two age-4 individuals were sampled in the survey and averaged about 17.3 inches. The overall average length of all Walleyes sampled throughout this survey was 12.1 inches with less than 15% measuring 16.0 inches or longer. This relatively small size structure was indicative of a lake that was two years removed from a partial winterkill. The Walleye size structure should continue to improve throughout the next couple of years.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nYellow Perch was the most abundant fish species observed in the 2015 survey, averaging 173.0 fish/gill net and 44.6 fish/trap net. This exceeded the long-term average for Yellow Perch gill net catch rates in Albert Lea Lake (148.7 fish/net) and was the highest gill net catch rate on record. Although catch rates were high, the Yellow Perch size structure was relatively small. Total lengths ranged from 5.2 to 9.7 inches and averaged 7.1 inches. Most fish (74%) measured less than 7.0 inches. The Yellow Perch population in Albert Lea Lake had a fast growth rate, which was likely influenced by the partial winterkill in 2014. Yellow Perch averaged 5.5 inches by age-1 and 7.9 inches by age-2. Only two age groups were sampled in the 2015 survey (age-1 and age-2), suggesting a young Yellow Perch population on the rebound after the recent partial winterkill. With a very high abundance of young, fast growing Yellow Perch in the lake, anglers should expect great perch fishing at Albert Lea Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nThe Black Crappie gill net catch rate in the 2015 survey was 14.5 fish/gill net, which was near the long-term average for Albert Lea Lake (16.0 fish/gill net). The trap net catch rate was 22.9 fish/trap net, which was below the average since 2005 (25.5 fish/trap net). Most of the fish were small, averaging just 4.8 inches and ranging from 3.2 to 8.7 inches. Most fish sampled in the 2015 survey were age-1 (91%), so overall size structure should improve as this year class moves through the system. Black Crappies are not stocked in Albert Lea Lake, so the population exists from natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nThe Northern Pike population in Albert Lea Lake remained in low abundance. The 2015 gill net catch rate was 1.7 fish/gill net, which exceeded the long-term average for Albert Lea Lake (1.2 fish/gill net). Only six fish were sampled in trap nets in 2015 (0.5 fish/trap net). Despite the low abundance, the size of Northern Pike was moderate. The average length of Northern Pike from both gear types was 23.7 inches, ranging from 16.3 to 34.4 inches. Typical of southern Minnesota lakes, Northern Pike in Albert Lea Lake exhibited fast growth rates. Average length at capture was 16.8 inches at age-1, 19.0 inches at age-2, 24.4 inches at age-3, 29.7 inches at age-4, and 33.3 inches at age-5. Northern Pike are not stocked in Albert Lea Lake, so the population persists through natural reproduction or movement from connected Fountain Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nThe Bluegill population in Albert Lea also remained in low abundance. The Bluegill trap net catch rate in 2015 was 5.3 fish/trap net, which was greater than the long-term average for Albert Lea Lake (4.1 fish/trap net). The Bluegill size structure was small, with about 94% of the trap net catch measuring less than 6.0 inches. About 71% of the Bluegills sampled in trap nets were age-1, indicating a young population. Average length at capture was 3.5 inches at age-1, 4.9 inches at age-2, and 6.0 inches at age-3. Since Albert Lea Lake is often windswept and lacks aquatic vegetation that Bluegill prefer, the Bluegill population in Albert Lea Lake will likely remain in low abundance. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead <br> \nThe partial winterkill of 2014 apparently did not have a large impact on the Black Bullhead population, as catch rates increased since the 2010 survey in both gear types. The catch rates for the 2015 survey were 97.2 fish/gill net and 59.5 fish/trap net. Both catch rates are greater than the average for Albert Lea Lake since 2005 (89.0 fish/gill net and 53.6 fish/trap net). The average length of all Black Bullheads sampled in this survey was 7.2 inches, with the largest measuring 12.6 inches. Black Bullheads are tolerant of low oxygen levels, making them less susceptible to winterkill than game fish species. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nChannel Catfish were present in Albert Lea Lake, although in low abundance. The 2015 survey yielded a total of 5 Channel Catfish among all gear types. The average length of Channel Catfish was 23.0 inches, with the largest individual measuring 30.0 inches. Channel Catfish have been stocked in connected Fountain Lake, where they are in higher abundance. Common Carp were sampled at a rate of 19.7 fish/gill net, which was near the average for Albert Lea Lake since 2005 (18.8 fish/gill net). Seventy percent of Common Carp sampled from both gear types measured between 8 and 12 inches. Other fish species sampled throughout the survey included Bigmouth Buffalo (N = 12), White Sucker (N = 20), Goldfish (N = 13), Green Sunfish (N = 17), Golden Shiner (N = 39), Common Shiner (N = 18), Orangespotted Sunfish (N = 12), River Carpsucker (N = 2), and Tadpole Madtom (N = 2). <br> \n <br> \nAngling Summary <br> \nWalleye anglers at Albert Lea Lake should expect good fishing as the lake rebounds from the partial winterkill of 2014. The Walleye population consisted of mostly young fish (age-1 and 2) that are already measuring up to 16.5 inches. Walleye stocking will continue every other year and immediately after winterkills. Yellow Perch fishing also appears to have great potential in the near future as the young population continues to grow fast after the partial winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Kip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment was conducted on Albert Lea Lake in the summer of 2000.  This assessment was completed by using twenty-one overnight trap-net sets, seven in each of three major lake basins, as defined by the lake improvement committee.  In addition, eight shoreline areas were sampled with boat-mounted electrofishing gear in mid September.  This assessment was conducted to update information on resident fish populations, and, in part, because of increased local interest in rehabilitating the lake.  Similar population assessments were conducted in 1984 and in 1992.      Gamfish populations have generally increased over the last sixteen years.  Northern pike and largemouth bass are the only gamefishes native to Albert Lea Lake.  The pike population has increased by five-fold since 1992, although it is still at only half the level of abundance recorded in 1984.  Northern pike can reach trophy sizes (to 40 inches) and about one-fourth of the fish captured were thirty inches in length or larger.  Although about half of the largemouth bass were captured in trap-nets, these data taken together with the daytime electrofishing sample indicate a relatively low population.  Both of these species are often associated with vegetative or woody cover, both of which are generally lacking in Albert Lea Lake.Walleye and channel catfish populations are apparently increasing in lake, due to continued stocking of these species in upstream Fountain Lake.  Both the relative abundance and rate of growth of walleye are above average for lakes like Albert Lea Lake.  Approximately one-third of the fish sampled in this assessment were fifteen inches or larger.  Because the observed pattern of growth is similar to that for the Fountain Lake walleye population and each age-class of walleye found in this survey can matched to a specific stocking record in Fountain Lake, the presence of walleye in Albert Lea Lake is due to immigration of Fountain Lake fish via the Shellrock River.  Similarly, channel catfish are increasing in abundance despite never having been stocked directly into Albert Lea Lake.  Due to similar size distributions between the Albert Lea and Fountain Lake populations and that roughly three quarters of channel catfish captured in trap-nets were caught in a single net located at the mouth of the Shellrock River, channel catfish are present only as immigrants from Fountain Lake.Black and white crappie populations have dramatically increased in Albert Lea Lake.  Black crappie were the most abundant species observed in the trap-net catch and accounted for nearly one-half of the total weight of this sample.  White crappie were the third most common species and showed a quality size structure with nearly one-third of the adult population reaching sizes of twelve inches or larger.Although black and white crappie are the most abundant panfishes in Albert Lea Lake, bluegill and yellow perch were also sampled.  The bluegill population has remained relatively stable since 1992.  Although overall abundance is low, bluegills are average sized for lakes with growth conditions like Albert Lea Lake.  In contrast, the yellow perch population is at a historic low level, declining by about 90 percent in the trap-net sample and by 73 percent in the electrofishing sample.  Beyond the apparent increase in abundance of the major gamefishes and the explosion of the crappie populations, the decline in relative abundance of most rough fish species is another major shift in community structure.  With the exception of buffalo and white sucker, all rough fish populations were measured at or near historic low levels of abundance.  This was particluarly true for carp, which are currently at about five percent of the maximum abundance observed in 1984.  Overall fish distribution within the lake varied by species.  Larger bodied species (e.g., walleye, channel catfish and carp) tended to occur in the west basin of Albert Lea Lake where there is on average more deeper water than elsewhere in the lake.  Also Foutain Lake empties into the west basin of Albert Lea Lake via th Shellrock River.  Fountain Lake is the source of walleye and channel catfish.  Bluegill and orangespotted sunfish, in contrast, were more often found in the north basin where most of the submergent and emergent aquatic vegetation exists.  Black crappie and black bullhead were  concentrated in the central and west basins, respectively.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Albert Lea Lake is a 2,654-acre lake located in Freeborn County near the city of Albert Lea. A city-maintained public access is located on the northwest corner of the lake. Two DNR-maintained public accesses are located on the south side of the lake at Saint Nicholas Landing along County Road 19 and within Myre Big Island State Park. A county-maintained public access is located near the inlet channel along Frank Avenue. Albert Lea Lake is a nutrient-rich, shallow lake with a maximum depth of 5.5 feet and an average depth of only 3.5 feet. Albert Lea Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch. Walleye fry are stocked every other year at a rate of 1,000 fry per littoral acre (about 2.6 million fry). The shallow, fertile waters of Albert Lea Lake are subject to periodic winterkill events. The most recent partial winterkill took place during the winter of 2013-14. After such events, walleye fry are stocked at a rate of 1,000/littoral acre the following spring. The connection to Fountain Lake provides a source for other species to repopulate the lake. Situations like this are managed as \"boom and bust\" fisheries, characterized by high survival and fast growth due to a temporary reduction of competition for resources. The \"boom\" years are typically 2-3 years post-winterkill, while the \"bust\" years are 0-1 year post-winterkill. Recent stocking events in Albert Lea include Walleye fry stocking in 2021, 2019, 2017, and 2015. About 3,675 Yellow Perch adults were also stocked in 2014 after the partial winterkill.  <br> \n <br> \nAlbert Lea Lake was surveyed the week of June 14, 2021, as part of a standard survey program conducted by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. This survey was completed to assess the fish community by deploying 3 gill nets and 8 trap nets throughout the lake, as well as recording water quality parameters. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nA total of 50 Walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 16.7/net, which indicated high numbers were present. This represented a significant increase from the 2018 survey catch rate of 3.3/net. Since 2005, catch rates ranged from 3.3/net in 2018 to 60.5/net in 2006 with an average of 26.2/net. Walleye in 2021 ranged from 10.9 to 24.7 inches with an average of 16.0 inches. Four year classes were represented in the survey, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2014. The high numbers of 2014 year class fish sampled in 2015 were almost nearly absent from the 2021 survey despite their being no evidence of winterkill since 2014. One possible explanation involved the newly constructed outlet and electric fish barrier. During high water or stressful periods in the lake, fish could exit the lake into the Shellrock River, unable to return to the lake. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 59 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 7.4/net. Bluegills ranged from 3.2 to 6.7 inches with an average of 4.4 inches. The habitat in Albert Lea Lake remained largely unsuitable for Bluegill and their limited persistence in the lake was likely supported by emigration from Fountain Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie remain abundant in Albert Lea Lake with a total of 195 fish sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 24.4/net. Black Crappie catch rates have exceeded 20.0/net with an average of 50.6/net in all 8 surveys dating back to 1984. Black Crappie ranged from 3.7 to 8.5 inches with an average of 5.3 inches. Black Crappies also sampled well in the gill nets with a catch rate of 13.0/net. Despite frequent winterkills, Black Crappies sourced from upstream Fountain Lake remained abundant in Albert Lea. <br> \n <br> \nOnly 2 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.7/net, indicating low numbers were present. In five gill net surveys since 2005, only the 2018 survey exceeded 2.0/net. Northern Pike in Albert Lea Lake remained rare in 2021 but averaged nearly 27 inches. Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations are in effect for Albert Lea Lake. Anglers are allowed two Northern Pike which must be at least 24 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 55 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 18.3/net. This represented the second lowest catch rate on record and failed to exceed 120/net for the second time since 2005. Fish were mostly small with an average length of 6.8 inches. Like Walleye, the population of Yellow Perch in Albert Lea Lake had drastically changed since the 2015 survey with no clear reason why. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead was the most common fish in the 2021 survey with a total of 393 sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 131.0/net. Black Bullhead were sampled at historic high in 2018. Black Bullhead thrive in Albert Lea Lake due to shallow, fertile water and the lake's tendency to undergo stressful conditions in both winter and summer. Like Black Bullhead, Common Carp numbers dropped, down from an all-time high in 2018 (15.7/net) to only 3.3/net in 2021. This came as major local efforts to manage Common Carp numbers in the Shellrock River watershed had been implemented in recent years. Common Carp overabundance remains one of the biggest challenges to managing shallow, fertile lakes like Albert Lea Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2021 include Channel Catfish, Golden Shiner, Goldfish, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, Tadpole Madtom, White Crappie, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

Albert Lea Lake is a nutrient-rich, shallow lake with a maximum depth of 5.5 feet and an average depth of only 3.5 feet. Albert Lea Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch. Walleye fry are stocked every other year at a rate of 1,000 fry per littoral acre (about 2.6 million fry). The shallow, fertile waters of Albert Lea Lake are subject to periodic winterkill events. The most recent partial winterkill took place during the winter of 2013-14. After such events, walleye fry are stocked at a rate of 1,000/littoral acre the following spring. The connection to Fountain Lake provides a source for other species to repopulate the lake. Situations like this are managed as \"boom and bust\" fisheries, characterized by high survival and fast growth due to a temporary reduction of competition for resources. The \"boom\" years are typically 2-3 years post-winterkill, while the \"bust\" years are 0-1 year post-winterkill. Recent stocking events in Albert Lea include Walleye fry stocking in 2017, 2015, 2014 (following partial winterkill), 2013, 2011, and 2009. About 3,675 Yellow Perch adults were also stocked in 2014 after the partial winterkill. Albert Lea Lake was surveyed the week of June 11, 2018 as part of a standard survey program conducted by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. This survey was completed to assess the fish community by deploying 3 gill nets and 10 trap nets throughout the lake, as well as recording water quality parameters. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nA total of just 10 Walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 3.3/net, which indicated low to moderate numbers were present. This represented a significant decline from the 2015 survey catch rate of 12.0/net and the lowest on record since 2005. Since 2005, catch rates ranged from 3.3/net in 2018 to 60.5/net in 2006 with an average of 28.1/net. Lengths in 2018 ranged from 16.7 to 22.4 inches with an average of 19.1 inches. Two additional fish measuring 17.4 and 18.4 inches long were sampled with trap nets. All of the fish aged in 2018 were 3 years old with the exception of a 4-year-old individual. These ages coincided with years during which Walleye fry were stocked. The high numbers of 2013 and 2014 year class fish sampled in 2015 were almost completely absent from the 2018 survey despite their being no evidence of winterkill since 2014. One possible explanation involved the newly constructed outlet and electric fish barrier. During high water or stressful periods in the lake, fish could exit the lake into the Shellrock River, unable to return to the lake. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 47 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 4.7/net. Since 1984, catch rates have failed to exceed 10.0/net and averaged just 4.2/net. Lengths in 2018 ranged from 3.6 to 7.0 inches with an average of 5.0 inches. The habitat in Albert Lea Lake remained largely unsuitable for Bluegills and their limited persistence in the lake was likely supported by emigration from Fountain Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie remain abundant in Albert Lea Lake with a total of 388 fish sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 38.8/net. In all 8 surveys dating back to 1984, catch rates have exceeded 20.0/net with an average of 50.6/net. Lengths in 2018 ranged from 4.0 to 10.8 inches with an average of 6.5 inches. Only 4% of the sample exceeded 10 inches in length. Black Crappies also sampled well in the gill nets with a catch rate of 22.7/net. Despite frequent winterkills, Black Crappies sourced from upstream Fountain Lake remained abundant in Albert Lea. <br> \n <br> \nJust 9 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 3.0/net, indicating low to moderate numbers were present. In five gill net surveys since 2005, this was the first to exceed 2.0/net. The mean catch rate during that time was 1.5/net. Fish were mostly large in 2018 with a range of 22.9 to 37.4 inches and an average of 28.7 inches. Approximately 78 percent of the sample exceeded the newly instated minimum length limit of 24 inches for the southern Minnesota region. In 2018, Northern Pike in Albert Lea Lake remained rare but were of favorable sizes to angling. Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations are in effect for Albert Lea Lake. Anglers are allowed 2 Northern Pike which must be at least 24 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 46 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 15.3/net. This represented the lowest catch rate on record and failed to exceed 120/net for the first time since 2005. Fish were mostly small with an average length of 6.1 inches. Like Walleyes, the population of Yellow Perch in Albert Lea Lake had drastically changed since the 2015 survey with no clear reason why. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads were the most common fish in the 2018 survey with a total of 1,261 sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 419.7/net. This was the highest catch rate on record since 2005. Additionally, the trap net catch rate was also obscenely high at 189.2/net. This increase in Black Bullhead numbers coincided with the decline of game fish such as Walleye and Yellow Perch and pointed to some sort of disturbance occurring since the 2015 survey. Black Bullheads thrive in Albert Lea Lake due to shallow, fertile water and the lake's tendency to undergo stressful conditions in both winter and summer. <br> \n <br> \nLike Black Bullheads, Common Carp numbers swelled to an all-time high in 2018. Catch rates for gill nets and trap nets were 50.0/net and 21.4/net respectively, and represented a massive increase since 2015. This came as major local efforts to manage Common Carp numbers in the Shellrock River watershed had been implemented in recent years. Common Carp overabundance remains one of the biggest challenges to managing shallow, fertile lakes like Albert Lea Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2018 include Golden Shiner, Goldfish, Green Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, Tadpole Madtom, White Crappie, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements included water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and secchi depth. Water clarity was poor with a secchi depth of 1.5 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings were uniform throughout the shallow water column. The temperature was approximately 71 degrees Fahrenheit and dissolved oxygen was 8.6 ppm. The shallow, fertile, windswept nature of Albert Lea Lake makes it difficult to manage a consistent fishery. The boom-bust strategy continues to be the best fit here. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Albert Lea Lake in Freeborn County is a 2,654 acre lake located in the town of Albert Lea. A DNR-owned public access is located in Myhre Big Island State Park or in town near the lake's inlet on the northwest side of the lake. A county-owned public access is located on the south side of the lake at Saint Nicholas County Park. Albert Lea Lake was surveyed the week of June 14, 2010 to monitor the fish community and aquatic habitat.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were the most abundant fish in the assessment in both trap and gill net catches. Perch averaged 141 fish per gill net lift and 129 fish per trap net lift. Average (mean) size of gill net perch was just short of 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were expected to decline sharply in abundance since the 2006 survey when 61 walleyes per gill net were observed. During the 2010 survey, 41 walleyes per gill net lift were observed, only a modest decline from 2006. Walleye from gill nets averaged 16 inches. Walleye fry stocking has been successful in all years stocked; fish in the 2010 assessment came from the 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 year classes.  Walleye angling in Albert Lea Lake can be challenging because of the natural high productivity of the lake that keeps the fish well fed. Walleye were in good condition and had several forage options. Perch are the preferred forage because of their high abundance and body shape. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike maintain a low level of abundance in Albert Lea Lake, presumably from a lack of spawning habitat. Pike averaged one fish per gill net lift and a trace amount in each trap net. While forage is abundant for this top level predator, without establishing connections to adjacent wetlands pike will continue to be rare in Albert Lea Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are found in low numbers in Albert Lea Lake since most of the lake is large, exposed and windswept areas with little aquatic vegetation in places. Bluegills averaged ten fish per trap net set. Average size was 5.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie population is composed of small individuals. Crappies averaged 6.8 inches between trap and gill nets. Three black crappies were caught per gill net lift, and 22 per trap net lift. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish have been in Albert Lea Lake ever since connected Fountain Lake was stocked. Less than one fish was caught per trap net with none in the gill nets. The average size was 23 inches, with one fish measuring 27 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2006 survey cautioned that black bullhead and common carp appeared to be increasing in abundance and could eventually become dominant fish species in the lake. Thankfully that has not been the case in the last four years. Gill net abundance declined from 176 to 8 black bullhead per net and from 44 to 1 common carp per net. Trap net abundance declined from 77 to 21 black bullhead per net and from 10 to 1.5 common carp per net.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish seen in the survey include bigmouth buffalo, brook stickleback, central mudminnow, common shiner, fathead minnow, highfin carpsucker, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Johnny darter, orangespotted sunfish, tadpole madtom, yellow bullhead, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Albert Lea Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Albert Lea Lake a large, shallow, fertile lake, which has a history of winterkill.  The most recent kill event occurred in 2004.  The fish community of Albert Lea Lake has recovered well, providing excellent angling opportunities for several species.  An excellent yellow perch sample was obtained in 2006.  The length distribution was well balanced and 25% of the fish observed were 8 to 11.5 inches in length.  Black crappies were moderately abundant at 36.7/trap net.  The size distribution was balanced and about 25% of the black crappies observed exceeded 8 inches in length.  A strong walleye cohort appears to be present following the stocking of 4.36 million walleye fry in the spring of 2004.  Most of the walleyes sampled were of sizes preferred by anglers with many fish ranging from 13-18 inches long.  Black bullhead and common carp appear to be increasing in abundance and may eventually become the dominant species in the lake.  Given that most fish in the system are age-5 or younger, good fishing should continue for several years.  Exotic Chinese mystery snails (Vivaparus malleatus) were confirmed at the access near the inlet.  The Chinese mystery snail is a common aquarium pet and the occurrence of this species is likely due to release from aquaria.  The impact of this species on the community structure of the lake is unknown at this time.</p>",
