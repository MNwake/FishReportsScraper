Development on the lake is light to moderate, with 23 homes/cabins counted during the 1995 survey along 4.4 miles of shoreline.Walleyes are not stocked directly into Arrowhead, but fry and fingerlings are stocked into connected Whitefish Lake.  The walleye catch rate was low in 2005 when compared to similar lakes (1.0/gill net).  Average size was 20.1\" and 3.0 lbs.  All of the fish were over 12\".The northern pike catch rate was high (12.7/gill net).  Average size was 21.9\" and 3.0 lbs., with 39% of the fish being 24\" or larger.The black crappie catch rate was in the average category in both gill nets (2.3/net) and trap nets (2.3/net).  When both gears were combined, 76% of the fish were 8\" or larger.The bluegill catch rate was high (27.3/trap net).  Average length was 7.3\" and 74% were 7\" or larger.The yellow perch catch rate was average (19.3/gill net).  Average length was 6.5\" and only 5% were 8\" or larger.Other fish species captured included black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, golden shiner, greater redhorse, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

Arrowhead is located in the Pine River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on August 17, 2018, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 5 stations and the 50' 1/8th inch seine was not used.  Heavy vegetation and/or soft bottom prevented the use of seines at the other 5 sampling sites.  Thirteen species were sampled, including Iowa darter, which is intolerant of habitat disturbance.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on June 4-5, 2018 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

Repeat surveys are completed on 10% of all IBI lakes to verify results.  IBI sampling included backpack electrofishing and seining to more broadly sample the general fish community and develop a fish-based index of overall lake health.  The most abundant species during this repeat survey were golden shiner and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Arrowhead is a shallow lake surround by dense emergent vegetation.  These plants are extremely important to maintaining a healthy aquatic environment.  Emergent plants, like bulrush, cattail and wild rice, are important for shoreline protection, regulating nutrient levels, and they provide essential spawning habitat for northern pike, bass and panfish.  Arrowhead is connected to Upper Whitefish Lake by a channel.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in the highest numbers to date (21.3/gill net).  Size was on the small side, with only 6% of the fish measuring 24\" or larger and an average length of only 18.2\". <br> \n <br> \nBoth black crappie and bluegill had a nice average size, although anglers should note that the date of this survey was in early June when these fish are still up shallow and the actual size structure may be a bit skewed.  Bluegill numbers were average (14.7/trap net), with an average size of 7.9\".  Only 7 crappies were caught and all were over 10.5\".  Please exercise selective harvest if you fish for these species and release some of the larger panfish. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were not sampled by electrofishing in Arrowhead.  Electrofishing was done instead throughout various stations across the Whitefish Chain of Lakes resulting in good numbers (112.5/hr run-time), with an average length of 12.8\".  Fish as large as 18.7\" were measured. <br> \n</p>",

Walleyes can move through the chain and into Arrowhead.  The gill net catch of 3.0 was average when compared to similar lakes.  Walleyes ranged in length from 16.5\" to 27.4\" with an average length of 19.7\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in high numbers at 17.7/ gill net.  Most were on the smaller side with an average length of 18.4\".  Only one fish measured at least 24.0\" or larger.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass electrofishing was done across the Whitefish Chain of Lakes resulting in a combined catch rate of 68.8/hr run-time.  Average length was 13.5\".  Five smallmouth bass were also netted while electrofishing.  All but one were over 17\". <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in average numbers in both gill nets (4.7/net) and trap nets (1.0/net).  Average length was 9.1\" in gill nets and 7.5\" in trap nets.  For both gears combined 54% measured at least 8.0\" in length.  Black crappies up to 12.4\" were sampled.  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers in trap nets at 18.7/net.  Average length was 6.9\" with 46% at least 7.0\" in length.  Yellow perch were sampled in average numbers in gill nets at 21.0/net.  Average length was 7.1\".  Some perch were large enough to be of interest to anglers, with 16% measuring at least 9.0\" in length.   <br> \n <br> \nArrowhead Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
