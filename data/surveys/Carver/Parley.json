Bluegill are fairly abundant, with most being over 6 inches in length.  However, few bluegill over 8 inches were sampled.  Yellow perch abundance is down, but average length has increased by almost an inch to 7.4 since previous surveys.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Parley Lake is a 257-acre Class 38 lake with a maximum depth of 18 feet.  The lake is located northeast of Lake Waconia, near the town of Saint Bonifacius.  The majority of shoreline surrounding Parley is undeveloped; most of the eastern shoreline is part of Three Rivers Park District's Carver Park.  A DNR Parks and Trails-owned boat ramp is located on the southwest corner of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nParley Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Black Crappie.  Healthy populations of Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are also present in the lake.  Walleye fry are stocked every other year.  Parley is connected to Lake Minnetonka via Six Mile Creek, and fish likely move between the two systems.  In 2015, a Standard Fisheries Survey was conducted to assess the game fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nParley Lake's Walleye population was found to be mostly older, larger individuals.  These fish were moderately abundant (1.5 fish per gill net, with average size 20.9 inches and 3.19 pounds.  Seventy-eight percent of the fish were larger than 20 inches, with the largest Walleye measuring 22.8 inches.  Ages 5 through 13 were present in the sample, with most of the fish aged 5 \u0013 7 years.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were caught at a rate of 9.8 per trap net and 3.8 per gill net, near the median for this Lake Class.  Size structure of the fish skewed small.  Twenty-six percent of the trap-netted and 39% of the gill-netted crappie exceeded 8 inches.  Only one fish exceeded 10 inches.  Average size of sampled Black Crappie was 6.2 inches and 0.15 pounds.  The largest fish measured 10.0 inches and 0.49 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were highly abundant in Parley Lake, and of quality size.  The fish were caught at a rate of 12.7 per gill net, exceeding the 75th percentile for this Lake Class.  The average size of gill-netted fish was 21.4 inches and 2.76 pounds.  Fifty-four percent of the fish exceeded 21 inches, and 16% exceeded 28 inches.  The largest Northern Pike measured was 34.4 inches and 10.10 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill Sunfish were caught at a rate of 47.2 per trap net, a value between the median and 75th percentile for this Lake Class.  The average size of Bluegill was 6.6 inches and 0.23 pounds.  Seventy-three percent of the fish were larger than 6 inches;  11% of trap netted-bluegills were 7.5 inches and larger.  The largest fish measured 8.1 inches and 0.47 pounds. <br> \n   <br> \nLargemouth Bass are not vulnerable to the gill nets and trap nets used during Standard Surveys.  However, Nighttime boat electrofishing was conducted on Parley Lake during September 2012 to sample the Largemouth Bass population.  A total of 180 Largemouth Bass were sampled in 4 electrofishing transects, producing 107.4 bass per hour of on-time.  The size structure of the Largemouth Bass population reflected smaller-sized fish.  Largemouth Bass averaged 8.5 inches and 0.46 lbs.  The largest bass sampled was 18.5 inches long and 3.9 lbs.  Fish from the 2005 through 2011 year classes were present, indicating consistent reproduction and recruitment.  Largemouth Bass reached an average length of 14.6 inches by age 5 and 17.9 inches by age 7.   <br> \n <br> \nAbundant Yellow Perch were sampled in the gill nets.  The catch rate of 26.0 fish per net exceeded the 75th percentile for this Lake Class.  The fish tended to be small; only 9% of the sampled fish exceeded 8 inches.  The average length was 6.7 inches and 0.20 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance included Black Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

The average length for both species was less than 8.5 inches. Bluegills were sampled in average numbers. The mean length sampled was 6.3 inches. A total of 37.5% of the bluegills sampled were over 7 inches in length. Continued fry stocking has created a sustainable walleye fishery. The walleye catch during the survey was average for this type of lake. The average size sampled was 18.7 inches long and 2.4 pounds. Northern pike were sampled within the normal range for this lake. The average size captured was 21.0 inches long and 2.2 pounds. Largemouth bass were not targeted during this survey. During normal netting the bass population was found to be within the normal range.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Parley Lake is a 257 acre, class 38 lake with a maximum depth of 18 feet.  The lake is located in north central Carver County, just northeast of Lake Waconia.  The vast majority of shoreline surrounding Parley is in a natural state.  Despite very little development around the lake, water quality is poor.  In early summer most species of fish cannot inhabit water deeper than 15 feet for extended periods of time.  By late summer anglers should not fish for walleye or crappie in depths greater than 12 feet.  Parley Lake is stocked with walleye fry every other year.  Boaters should also keep in mind, new laws require the drain plug be removed while on public roadways.         <br> \n <br> \nThree species comprise the predator community in Parley Lake.  Walleye average length was 20.2 inches.  Average weight was 2.88 pounds.  Walleye abundance was average.  Weight was also average for this type of lake.  Northern pike numbers were near the historic averages for Parley Lake.  In the 2010 population assessment very few largemouth bass were sampled.  This low abundance has been observed in past surveys.  Standard lake survey gear does not consistently provide an accurate estimate of largemouth bass abundance.    <br> \n <br> \nFive species of panfish are present in Parley Lake.  Black crappie abundance is average.  Very few large fish were sampled.  Bluegill abundance increased dramatically compared to the 2004 survey.  The 2010 survey measured bluegill abundance at an all time high for Parley Lake.  Over 80% of sampled bluegill were larger than 6 inches.  Only 1% of sampled bluegill were 8 inches or larger.  Yellow perch abundance in Parley Lake is average.  Mean weight of yellow perch was average as well.  Pumpkinseed were sampled at an average abundance.  Hybrid sunfish were also sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nRough fish are present.  Common carp abundance decreased since the 2004 survey, but remains average compared to similar lakes.  Black and yellow bullhead were sampled at record low abundances.  White sucker abundance was also below average. <br> \n   <br> \nNearshore seining and backpack electrofishing found both Iowa and Johnny darters.  Darters are intolerant of very poor water quality.  Their presence in a metro lake is a positive sign.  Brook silverside, bluntnose minnows and central mudminnows were other species captured during nearshore sampling.  Overall, Parley Lake contains a fair forage base.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Parley Lake is a 242-acre lake with a maximum depth of 18 feet. Parley is located northeast of the City of Waconia in central Carver County. Public water access is provided by the DNR on the southwest side of the lake near the intersection of County road 30 and Parley Lake Rd (up to 6 vehicle/trailer parking spaces). Parley is primarily managed for Walleye, Black Crappie, and Bluegill, but supports catchable populations of Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (gill nets and trap nets) was conducted on Lake Parley during the week of 6/29/2020 to assess the fishery. During the 2020 survey, Parley was highly productive (green stained water), with poor water clarity, measured at 2.0 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen was zero parts per million (ppm) below 10 feet during the survey period. Eurasian Watermilfoil was confirmed present in Parley Lake in 2001 and remains present. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye in Parley Lake are maintained through fry stocking in even numbered years. During the 2020 survey Walleye were sampled at historically high numbers (5.5/net), above the expected catch rate of similar lakes in the area. There were 33 Walleye sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 20.0 inches and the largest measured at 23.8 inches. Size indices show a balanced population (an intermediate between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish). Growth rates were fast compared to the statewide average, with an average length of 17.2 inches by age 4. High catch rates and large sizes should provide excellent angling opportunity for Walleye on Parley Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Lake Parley, although targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2020 survey due to COVID-19 sampling restrictions. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught 6 Largemouth Bass, with an average length of 14.6 inches and the largest measured at 17.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled with gill nets (8.5/net) near the expected catch rate for similar lakes in the area. Although catch rates were down from the previous high in 2015 (12.7/net), size structure has increased substantially from 2015. The average length of Northern pike sampled in 2020 increased over 4 inches since the last survey in 2015. There were 50 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 25.8 inches, with the largest measured at 31.9 inches. Although lacking the largest individuals (34\"+), moderate numbers likely keep competition low, allowing Northern Pike to grow fast, reaching desirable sizes. <br> \n <br> \nRecord high numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (104.9/net). There were 839 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2020 survey, the highest catch rate in the previous 25 years. Bluegill averaged 6.4 inches, with the largest measured at 8.9 inches. Bluegill are growing fast until age 5 (about 7 inches), after which there is a large drop in the number of age 6 (7+\") fish sampled. While some of this could be attributed to natural mortality, it is likely that angler harvest plays a large part in the number of 7+\" BLG available. High harvest mortality, fast growth, and the potential for large sizes has led us to recommend Parley lake as part of the Quality Panfish Initiative which would place a 5 bag limit on panfish (beginning spring 2021) in an effort to increase their overall size structure. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets (15.3/net) and trap nets (18.0/net), near their expected catch rate. There were 236 Black Crappie sampled during the 2020 survey, with an average length of 8.3 inches, with the largest measured at 10.9 inches. Black Crappie are cyclical spawners with the ability to produce large year classes of offspring given the right environmental conditions. Over 70% of Black Crappie sampled came from two year classes (age 2 - 34%) and (age 4 - 38%). Despite these large year classes, growth remained fast with an average length of 7.2 inches at age 2, and an average length of 8.9 inches by age 4. Similar to Bluegill, when Black Crappie reach desirable sizes (9+\") they are immediately removed from the system. Parley Lake will also have a reduced 5 bag limit on Black Crappie (beginning spring 2021) in an effort to improve Black Crappie size structure. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
