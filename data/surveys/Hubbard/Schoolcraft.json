                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catch rates (2.83 fish/set and 4.07 lbs/set) were within the normal ranges for Lake Class 33.  Abundance was at its highest in 1992, but size was at its lowest.  Mean walleye weight in 1992 was 1.44 pounds.  The size structure (PSD=71, RSD-P=6) indicates a high proportion of quality-length fish in the population.  However, only one walleye sampled in the gillnets was over 18.0 inches.  The lack of large walleye is the result of the young age distibution of the population.  Eighty-one percent of the sampled walleye were age 4 or younger.  Growth rates are variable, possibly due to different sizes of stocked fingerlings or fluctuating prey densities, but are generally good.  Mean length at age 3 is 11.94 inches.  There is no evidence of walleye natural reproduction in Schoolcraft Lake.  Walleye year classes from years without fingerling stocking were not represented in net catches.Number of northern pike sampled (8.50 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range, whereas 21.85 lbs/gillnet was above the third quartile for lakes in Class 33.  Northern pike abundance has decreased since 1980, but along with the decrease in number has been an increase in size.  Mean weight in 1992 was 2.57 pounds.  The size structure (PSD=63), RSD-P=2) is similar to the walleye.  There is a high number of quality-length northern pike; however, only one sampled was over 28.0 inches.  Slow growth rates contribute to the lack of large northern pike.  Mean length at age 5 is 20.45 inches and growth continues to decline as the fish age.  Analysis of northern pike age structure suggests consistently high recruitment.Largemouth bass and bluegill trapnet catches were below the first quartile in 1992 and have been since 1980.  Only one largemouth bass and two bluegill were sampled in 1992.  Trapnet catch rates of pumpkinseed and black crappie have been within the normal ranges since 1980.  Both species have small size structures (pumpkinseed PSD =8, black crappie PSD=28); however, all but one black crappie of quality-length were also > 10.0 inches (RSD-P=22).  Black crappie exhibit good early growth, averaging 6.65 inches at age 3.  Growth rates decline slightly as black crappie age.  Yellow perch density was well above the third quartile for the first time in 1992.  Gillnet catches increased substantially between 1987 (5.50 fish/set) and 1992 (77.67 fish/set).  Yellow perch size structure (PSD=21) is small.  A small number of rock bass and hybrid sunfish were also sampled.Gillnet catches of white sucker and brown bullhead were within the normal ranges for Lake Class 33.  White sucker abundance has always been within the normal range.  In contrast, brown bullhead abundance had been above the third quartile until 1992.  Black bullhead density has also decreased since 1980, but remained above the third quartile in 1992.  Yellow bullhead catch rates were below the first quartile in 1992.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Schoolcraft Lake is located three miles southwest of Lake George in northern Hubbard County.  Schoolcraft has a surface area of 170 acres and a maximum depth of 37 feet.  A state-owned public access is located on the north shore of the lake next to the outlet culvert.  The access is very shallow and narrow with a cattail channel out to the lake.  Generally, only smaller sized boats are able to use the access. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Schoolcraft is in lake class 34.  Class 34 lakes generally have a very high percentage of littoral area (water depths less than 15 feet), hard and turbid water, with a very regularly shaped shoreline.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Alice, Stocking, and Big Stony. <br> \n <br> \nSchoolcraft has an abundant Northern Pike population.  Present and past surveys have shown Northern Pike abundance to fluctuate at very high numbers for this lake class.  The Northern Pike population in Schoolcraft is known more for numbers than size, dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" Pike.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 20.2 inches and 1.6 pounds with fish measured up to 29.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find a low to moderate Walleye population in Schoolcraft.  Walleye abundance was at the low end of the range typical for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 16.2 to 25.6 inches.  In addition to providing a forage base for the Walleye population, anglers will find some Yellow Perch to be an acceptable size for angling.  Yellow Perch abundance was below the range typical for this lake class.  Yellow Perch abundance has fluctuated from low to high numbers in past surveys.  Sampled Yellow Perch had an average length to 7.6 inches with fish measured up to 11.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish abundance was up from past surveys with Black Crappie numbers above the range for this lake class and Bluegill numbers within the range for this lake class.  Black Crappie and Bluegill abundance in past surveys have fluctuated from low to moderate numbers.  Anglers will find Black Crappie in the 9 to 10 inch size range and Bluegill in the 6 to 8 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Schoolcraft but are found in low numbers when compared to area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of Pumpkinseed, and low numbers of Rock Bass, Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, and White Sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Schoolcraft.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 28, 2022, to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, four sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Site conditions prevented the use of seines at six sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites with one being conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured eight species of fish including species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Central Mudminnow, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on August 15, 2022, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Schoolcraft Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Schoolcraft Lake is located in the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Schoolcraft Lake is located 18 miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County. It is 116 acres with a maximum depth of 37 feet, and 67% littoral area (less than 15 feet deep). There is a public access on the north end of the lake off 344th street west of County Road 4. Schoolcraft is managed primarily for walleye and stocked with walleye fingerlings in even-numbered years. Secondary management is for northern pike and black crappie.  The walleye population in Schoolcraft Lake is maintained strictly by the fingerling stocking. The 2000 survey showed low numbers of walleye present (1.0/gill net). Lengths of walleye ranged from 17-26 inches with an average weight of 3 pounds. All of the walleye were 4 years of age or older, with good growth rates. Northern pike abundance (25/gill net) was high and showed a considerable increase from previous surveys. Average size was small, due to the predominance of age 2-4 northerns in the population; the average weight was 1.2 pounds and lengths were mostly between 13 and 21 inches.  Normally a lake this size does not produce many large yellow perch, but the 2000 survey showed perch with a mean length of 10.6 inches and mean weight of 0.7 pounds. Abundance was not high, and overharvest of adult perch in a lake this size could have a significant impact on perch reproduction and availability of food for predator fish.  Sunfish were present in low numbers. Schoolcraft Lake has never had overly abundant populations of bluegill or pumpkinseed sunfish. Although previous surveys have shown bluegill as large as 10 inches, the average length in 2000 was just 3.6 inches.  Absent from nets in 2000 were black crappie. Previous surveys have shown crappie to be a \"boom or bust\" species in Schoolcraft Lake, occasionally producing good fishing. When a good year class comes along in a lake this size, it can quickly be overfished. Stocking is usually not necessary, however, unless subsequent nettings fail to show any crappies. Other species present in Schoolcraft Lake include largemouth bass, bullheads, rock bass, and white sucker, all at low to moderate abundance. Bullheads had been much more abundant in previous surveys than they were in 2000.</p>",

There is a state-owned public access on the north side of the lake.  Schoolcraft provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, walleye, and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Schoolcraft Lake is in lake class 34.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Alice, Stocking, and Big Stony.Schoolcraft Lake has an abundant northern pike population.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 16.0 pike/gillnet is well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  The northern pike population in Schoolcraft is known more for numbers than size, dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 18.4 inches and 1.4 pounds.  The northern pike population in Schoolcraft is limited by high reproduction and recruitment of young pike and slow growth rates.Anglers will find a low to moderate walleye population in Schoolcraft Lake.  Walleye abundance (1.6 walleye/gillnet) is at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  The current management goal is 1.5 walleye/gillnet.  Age analysis showed that the walleye population in Schoolcraft is being maintained by walleye stocking.  Schoolcraft is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even years.  Several year classes and sizes of walleye were sampled with fish measured up to 28.6 inches.  The walleye in Schoolcraft exhibited good growth rates when compared to class 34 and other area lakes.  An abundant yellow perch population is present in the lake providing a good forage base for the walleye.  Yellow perch were small in size with a few fish of an acceptable size for angling.Present and past surveys have shown low to moderate panfish abundance in Schoolcraft Lake.  Bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie have generally been sampled below or near the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  While numbers are low, size of panfish is good for all species.Other species sampled included moderate numbers of brown bullhead, and low numbers of largemouth bass, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

There is a state-owned public access located on the north shore of the lake.  Schoolcraft provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, panfish, and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Schoolcraft Lake is in lake class 34.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Alice, Stocking, and Big Stony. <br> \n <br> \nSchoolcraft Lake has an abundant northern pike population.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 13.3 pike/net is well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class, and similar to past surveys.  The northern pike population in Schoolcraft is known more for numbers than size, dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 17.7 inches and 1.2 pounds, with pike measured up to 30.9 inches.  The northern pike population in Schoolcraft is limited by high reproduction and recruitment of young pike and slow growth rates. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find a low to moderate walleye population in Schoolcraft Lake.  Walleye abundance (2.0 walleye/gillnet) is at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  The current management goal is 1.5 walleye/gillnet.  Schoolcraft is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  In addition to providing a forage base for the walleye population, anglers will find yellow perch to be of an acceptable size for angling.  Yellow perch abundance and quality has fluctuated over time in Schoolcraft. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown low to moderate panfish abundance in Schoolcraft Lake.  Bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie have generally been sampled below or near the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  While numbers are low, size of panfish is good for all species.  Largemouth bass are present in Schoolcraft, but they are found in low numbers when compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include high numbers of brown bullhead, and low numbers of yellow bullhead, black bullhead, white suckers, and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tSchoolcraft Lake is located three miles southwest of Lake George in Northern Hubbard County. Schoolcraft has a surface area of 170 acres and a maximum depth of 37 feet. A state owned public access is located on the north shore of the lake. The access is very shallow with a narrow channel out to the lake.  Because of this, generally only smaller boats are able to use the access. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Schoolcraft is in lake class 34. Class 34 lakes generally have a very high percentage of littoral area (depths less than 15 feet), hard and turbid water, with very regularly shaped shoreline. Other class 34 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Alice, Stocking and Big Stony. <br> \n\tNorthern Pike abundance has been above the range typical for this lake class in the past, and was again in 2015. The average length is small at 17 inches, with the largest fish 28.3 inches. <br> \n\tWalleye abundance has been consistent in previous years, and comparable with similar lakes. Most Walleyes were a great size for anglers at 15-22 inches, with some smaller fish for the future. The average length was 17 inches, with the largest Walleye sampled at 23.5 inches.  <br> \n\tYellow Perch are important forage for Walleyes and Northern Pike.  Perch abundance was lower than past surveys and similar lakes. Perch were an acceptable size for anglers, with an average size of 8.6 inches and sampled up to 12.5 inches.  <br> \n\tAngling opportunities for panfish include Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed. Black Crappie abundance was lower than similar lakes and most past surveys. Most crappies were 9-10 inches. Bluegill and Pumpkinseed abundance was similar to other recent surveys at Schoolcraft Lake, but low compared to other similar lakes. Most sunfish were very small, but two were over 9 inches. <br> \n\tCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Schoolcraft. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",
