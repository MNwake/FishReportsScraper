                "narrative": "<p>Lost Lake is a small, mesotrophic lake located approximately 12 miles southeast of Bigfork, Minnesota.  It is 88 acres in size, of which 46 acres (53%) is less than 15 feet in depth. The maximum depth is 28 feet and the shoreline length is 1.9 miles. A public access and a State Forest Campground are located on the south shore The lake is relatively clear and supports a diverse aquatic plant community.  The Secchi disk reading, a standard measure of water clarity, was was 8.0 feet in 2015, and has ranged from 9.0 - 19.0 feet in previous surveys.  Lost Lake is in lake class 29.  Other Grand Rapids Area lakes in this class include Beauty and Deadhorse.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2004 Lake Management Plan (LMP) lists Walleye, Black Crappie and Bluegill as primary species for management and Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass as secondary species.  The LMP goals were to achieve a Walleye catch of 2.0/gill net, achieve a Black Crappie catch of 6.0/trap net and maintain a Bluegill catch of 16.0/trap net.   <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in June of 2015 to assess the status and characteristics of the fish community using three gill nets and nine trap nets.  An electrofishing survey in late April evaluated the Largemouth Bass population.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were the most common fish captured in gill nets.  The catch rate of 10.7/gill net was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Northern Pike gill net catches have been above this range in all previous surveys. Size structure of pike improved slightly from the 1989 and 2003 surveys, but remained relatively poor as only 31% of the sample exceeded 21 inches in length.  Northern Pike from gill nets ranged in length from 11.7-33.4 inches, with an average length of 21.7 inches.  Seven consecutive age classes (1-7) were sampled with 80% being age 2-4.  Growth was near the statewide average with an average length of 21.1 inches at age-4.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch increased from 1.0/gill net in 2003 to 1.7/gill net, but remains within the expected range.  Walleye natural reproduction appears to be sustaining a low level population.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2006, 2008 and 2010. Of the five Walleye sampled in 2015, only one corresponded to a stocked year class. In the 2003 assessment, no Walleye sampled were from stocked years.  Walleye ranged in length from 20.1-21.6 inches, with an average length of 20.9 inches. The LMP goal of 2.0/gill net was not met.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were captured at a rate of 25.0 /trap net, which is within the expected range.  Bluegill trap net catches have ranged from 16.2-32.8/net in previous surveys.  Eight consecutive year classes were represented in the sample (age 2-9) and recruitment appears consistent.  Bluegill attained a length of 6.1 inches at age-5, which is above average for the lake class.  Bluegill from trap nets ranged in length from 2.7-10.2 inches, with an average length of 6.9 inches. The LMP goal of 16.0/trap net was exceeded.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie trap net catch increased from 0.1/net in 2003 to 2.6/net, which is within the expected range.  Black Crappie trap net catches have exceeded the lake class expected range in two of four surveys.  Four consecutive age classes were represented in the sample (age 2-5).  Growth exceeded the statewide average with an average length of 7.1 inches at age-3.  Black Crappie from trap nets ranged in length from 8.1 to 10.9 inches, with an average length of 9.0 inches.  The LMP goal of 6.0/trap net was not met.   <br> \n <br> \nThe first electrofishing survey of Lost Lake was conducted in late April to evaluate the Largemouth Bass population.  A total of 22 Largemouth Bass were sampled, ranging in length from 12.8-20.0 inches, with a mean length of 15.9 inches.  Size structure appeared good as 77% of the sample exceeded 15 inches in length.  The on-time catch rate was 17.2 per hour.  Largemouth Bass averaged 13.5 inches at age-4, which exceeds the statewide average.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were captured at a rate of 0.3/gill net, which is below the lake class expected range of 2.0-21.5/gill net.  Gill net catches in previous surveys have ranged from 3.0-20.0/gill net.  High Northern Pike density may limit Yellow Perch numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in this, and previous, assessments included Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass and White Sucker.  <br> \n <br> \nInvasive species are not known to be present in Lost Lake.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The lake has 88 acres, a littoral area of 46 acres, a maximum depth of 28 feet and very clear water.     The northern pike population is characterized by large numbers of small fish.  Most sampled in this assessment were aged between 2 and 4 years old.  They ranged in length from 11.9-37.2 inches.  The mean weight of the northern pike sampled was 1.6 pounds.       Walleye were not sampled in the initial 1979 survey.  They were, however, sampled in this and the 1989 assessment. Walleye were stocked four times from 1985 to 1990.  Of the 6 walleye captured in this assessment, three were from the 2001 and 2002 year class (age 1 and 2).  The other 3 were from the 1995 year class.  Anglers report catching walleye but mainly in the spring.     Yellow perch were sampled above the lake class median at 11.7/gill net.  They were small, ranging in length from 5.4 to 6.8 inches with a mean length of 5.9 inches.  This catch was up from the 3.0/gill net observed in the 1989 assessment.     A large decline in black crappie abundance was noted in this assessment.  Only two were sampled, one in the gill nets and one in the trap nets.  This compares with 6.0/gill net and 26.5/trap net in 1979 and 6.8/trap net in 1989.       Bluegill were sampled at 14.6/trap net while none were sampled in the gill net.  They ranged in length from 3.4 to 10.2 inches and had a mean length of 7.6 inches.  A 5 year old bluegill in Lost Lake is 6.8 inches.     Other species sampled in this assessment were rock bass, white sucker and pumpkinseed sunfish.  No largemouth bass were sampled.  </p>",
