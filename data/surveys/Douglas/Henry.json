                "narrative": "<p>Lake Henry, along with Lakes Agnes and Winona, comprise a chain of lakes within the city limits of Alexandria.  Lakes Henry and Agnes are broadly connected basins with a common \"narrows\" on the north side of Lake Agnes and south side of Lake Henry.  A 200-foot long sand and rock bar separates the two basins.  This bar is only one to two feet under the water surface during normal water levels.  Public ownership of portions of the southeast shoreline of Lake Henry allows angler access to shore fishing opportunities.  A handicapped accessible fishing pier is located in City Park on the northeast shore of Lake Agnes.  A public water access is located on the southwest shore of Lake Agnes.  Boaters should note that motorized water craft operation on Lake Agnes is regulated by a slow, no-wake restriction. <br> \n <br> \nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in June 2017 to assess the fish community.  The fish population continues to recover following a fish kill event in the winter of 2010-2011.  Black Crappies and Yellow Perch are abundant in Lakes Henry and Agnes.  Large 2011 year-classes are present from both species.  Black Crappies are growing slow, but most captures were between 8 and 10 inches in length.   Yellow Perch growth is moderate and many were between 7 and 10 inches in length.  Bluegills are also present, although in lower numbers.  Some of the larger Bluegills observed during the survey were over 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked in alternate years since 2004.  Fingerling survival has been poor thus far and Walleye abundance is low.  Most Walleyes caught during the 2017 survey were between 14 and 16 inches in length.  Northern Pike abundance remains low, but high average size offers quality fishing opportunities.  Half of the Northern Pike caught during the survey were over 30 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOnly two Largemouth Bass were sampled during the 2017 survey.  Numerous juvenile Largemouth Bass were observed in other surveys.  In 2006 a harvest regulation was implemented that requires immediate release of Largemouth Bass from 12-20 inches and allows only one fish over 20 inches in possession.  The regulation is still in effect while this population recovers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Henry, along with lakes Agnes and Winona, comprise a chain of lakes within the city limits of Alexandria.  Lakes Agnes and Henry are broadly connected basins with a common \"narrows\" area on the north side of Lake Agnes and south end of Lake Henry.  There is a 200-ft long sand and rock bar that separate the two basins.  This bar is 0.5 to 1.5 feet under the water surface under normal water levels. These lakes received partially treated sewage effluent from the city of Alexandria dating back to the 1920's.  The modern sewage treatment plant (ALASD) began operating on the south shore of Lake Winona in 1977 and reduced the phosphorus inflow into the lakes by approximately 90 percent.  Water quality in lakes Agnes and Henry improved following the operation of the modern sewage treatment plant.  The city of Alexandria recently constructed two retention ponds to partially treat the stormwater runoff entering Lake Agnes from the urban watershed.  Lake Henry supports a quality fish community.  Northern pike are abundant and averaged about 2.7 pounds.  Largemouth bass are also relatively abundant and about one-fourth of the fish captured were 15.0 inches in length or greater.  Smallmouth bass are also present, but they are not adequately sampled with standard survey methods.  Bluegill and black crappie are also abundant and reach quality sizes. Walleye were not present in survey catches.  Anglers have reported catching a few large walleye in recent years.  Walleye fry were stocked in 2000 and 2002 to provide some additional fishing opportunities in Lake Henry.  These stockings were apparently were unsuccessful.  The Lake Management Plan was amended to include walleye fingerling stockings instead of fry in even-numbered years beginning in 2004.      </p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Henry.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nNine species were collected during this survey, indicating a relatively simple nearshore fish community.  Only one species (Iowa Darter) was considered \"intolerant\" and three species (Black Bullhead, Commn Carp, and Green Sunfish) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Henry. </p>",

Black Bullhead comprised 87% of the total weight of fish collected in trapnets.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.53 lbs.  Black Bullhead may be approaching a size that would be of some commercial value.  Yellow Perch are also abundant in Lake Henry. The CPUE was 82 fish/gillnet for Yellow Perch. The average size of fish captured was small.  The mean weight of Yellow Perch was 0.18 lbs and PSD was measured at 4%.  Panfish populations are limited in Lake Henry.  The Black Crappie catch rate averaged 2.57 fish/trapnet.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed catch rates averaged 1.2 fish/trapnet and 0.85 fish/trapnet, respectively.  Lake Henry is further downstream from the Alexandria Lakes Area Sanitary District discharge than Lake Winona and Lake Agnes and exhibits better water clarity and water quality characteristics.  However, the fish community present in Lake Henry is similar to those communities found in Lake Agnes and Lake Winona.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Henry, along with Lakes Agnes and Winona, comprise a chain of lakes within the city limits of Alexandria.  Lakes Agnes and Henry are broadly connected basins with a common \"narrows\" area on the north side of Lake Agnes and south end of Lake Henry.  There is a 200-ft long sand and rock bar that separates the two basins.  This bar is 1.0 to 2.0 feet under the water surface during normal water levels.  These lakes received partially treated sewage effluent from the city of Alexandria as far back as the 1920's.  The modern sewage treatment plant (ALASD) began operating on the south shore of Lake Winona in 1977.  Total phosphorus loading into the lakes was reduced by approximately 90 percent.  Water quality in Lakes Agnes and Henry has gradually improved.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Henry now supports a diverse fish community.  Northern pike are abundant and many are large enough to provide high quality fishing experiences.  Pike captured in 2007 averaged 27.5 inches in length and weighed 5.1 pounds.  The largest fish sampled measured 34.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass expanded and developed to support an excellent fishery.  Forty percent of the sampled fish exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  The largest bass measured was 18.9 inches in length.  In an effort to sustain good fishing quality, a 12-inch maximum length limit allowing possession of one bass over 20.0 inches was implemented on Lakes Agnes and Henry in 2006.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie are abundant.  Trapnet catches greatly exceeded the normal range for similar lakes.  The significant increase in crappie abundance is not likely a sustainable event.  A single year class of age-4 fish comprised 88% of the total crappie catch.  Mean length of sampled fish was 7.5 inches.  If average growth can be sustained, many crappie will be near 10.0 inches in length in 2008.  This single year class will likely stimulate and support intense fishing for at least a year. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are also abundant.  Size distribution of the 2007 capture sample was relatively poor since 96% of the total catch was comprised of three- and four-year-old fish.  Fortunately, bluegill growth has not slowed in response to greater population abundance.  Older individuals in the catch grew to 8.0 inches in four growing seasons.  Eighty-five percent of the population sample exceeded 6.0 inches in length.  Average length was 6.8 inches.  Fishing quality should improve with greater longevity. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are very abundant, but average size has declined.  Few captures exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Anglers enjoyed high catch rates of 10.0 inch and larger perch in the late 90s. <br> \n <br> \nA walleye stocking program was initiated in 2000.  Walleye fingerlings are now stocked in even-numbered years in efforts to create and sustain a viable fishery.  Contributions of stockings have been marginal in 2004 and 2006, but a low-density population comprised of medium-size walleye now exists.  Average size of walleye measured was 19.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community has expanded with addition of non-native or unique fishes.  Smallmouth bass have become established.  Population density is very low.  A single channel catfish was captured in 2007.  More recently, common carp have invaded Lakes Agnes and Henry.  Source of these fish is uncertain and unfortunately, this very tolerant fish species is proliferating, particularly in Lake Agnes and likely, Lake Winona. <br> \n</p>",

Catch rates of 225.0 Black Bullhead/gillnet and 91.0 Black Bullhead/trapnet were determined from the assessment. Bullhead were too small to have any angling or commercial value. Most sunfish sampled were the less desirable Pumpkinseed and Green Sunfish. Only five Bluegill were captured during the assessment. Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass populations were not adequately sampled by the netting assessment. Length frequency distribution and visual observations would indicate a limited sportfishery. Yellow Perch abundance remains high. Catches averaged 99.0 Yellow Perch/gillnet. PSD has decreased from 74.0 percent in 1985 to 10.0 percent in 1989 in response to natural recruitment</p>",

These lakes received partially treated sewage effluent from the city of Alexandria datingback to the 1920's.  Large amounts of phosphorus were  discharged into the lakes prior to 1977.  Thecurrent sewage treatment plant (ALASD) began operating on the south shore of Lake Winona in 1977 andreduced the phosphorus inflow into the lakes by approximately 90 percent.  Water quality in lakes Henryand Agnes improved dramatically following the operation of the modern sewage treatment plant.  However,there is still a considerable phosphorus load in Lake Henry from historic inputs by the old sewagetreatment plant.  Surprisingly, water clarity on Lake Henry is outstanding.  Submergent vegetation isabundant around the entire shoreline.  This vegetation provides essential habitat for many fish andcompetes with nuisance algae for the excess phosphorus in the lake.    Lake Henry offers good angling opportunities for several gamefish species.  Northern pike arerelatively abundant and are targeted by many anglers.  The average size of fish captured in survey netswas almost four pounds.  Bluegill and black crappie are present in moderate numbers, however averagesize tends to be small.  Yellow perch are very abundant, but the average size is small at this time. Largemouth bass were not adequately sampled with electrofishing gear because of the extreme waterclarity.  Local reports would suggest that Lake Henry supports a viable fishery.  Smallmouth bass arealso present.  However, abundance is likely low so please practice catch and release.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Henry, along with Lakes Agnes and Winona, comprise a chain of lakes within the city limits of Alexandria.  Lakes Agnes and Henry are broadly connected basins with a common \"narrows\" on the north side of Lake Agnes and south side of Lake Henry.  A 200-foot long sand and rock bar separates the two basins.  This bar is one to two feet under the water surface during normal water levels.  These lakes received partially treated sewage effluent from the City of Alexandria dating back to the 1920's.  A new tertiary sewage treatment plant (ALASD) began operating on the south shore of Lake Winona in 1977.  Total phosphorus discharges were reduced by approximately 90 percent.  Water quality in Lakes Henry and Agnes improved greatly with less nutrient loading, but the basins remain nutrient rich. <br> \n   <br> \nA partial fish kill event was reported on March, 20, 2011.  Numerous dead fish were observed at the inlet to Lake Agnes and outlet of Lake Henry.  An ice-out electrofishing survey in May, 2011 yielded very few fish.  Adult broodstock largemouth bass, bluegill and black crappie were stocked in the spring of 2011 to accelerate restoration of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nA follow up fish community assessment was completed in June, 2011.  No largemouth bass were sampled during the electrofishing survey.  However, mid-summer shoreline seining efforts yielded numerous juvenile largemouth bass.   The 12.0-inch maximum with one over 20.0 inches harvest regulation established in 2006 remains in effect and will provide additional protection to this recovering population. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch abundance declined since the 2007 survey.  Black crappie remained fairly abundant, but trapnet catches did decline substantially since the 2007 survey in probable response to the fish kill.  Mean length of sampled fish was 7.8 inches.  Bluegill trapnet catches averaged 1.8 fish/net in 2011 as compared to 35.8 fish/trapnet in 2007.  Average size of bluegill was 5.8 inches in length.  Yellow perch gillnet catches averaged 20.3 fish/net in 2011, compared to 141.0 fish/trapnet in 2007.  Most perch captures were too small to interest anglers. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers remain stable.  Gillnet catches averaged 4.7 fish/net in 2011.  Average weight of sampled northern pike was 3.8 pounds. Fishing quality, expressed in terms of average size captured, was relatively good.  Twenty eight percent of the sample exceeded 28.0 inches in total length.  The largest northern pike captured in the 2011 survey was 34.4 inches.   Some portion of the adult pike population was likely comprised of adult pike that migrated upstream from Lake Le Homme Dieu. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp were captured from in Lake Agnes in 2007 after many years of absence.  Abundance has increased with reproduction and additional migration from downstream lakes.   Average length of sampled fish was 17.2 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Henry is a small (152 acres), productive basin located within the Long Prairie River watershed.  Mean and maximum depths are 13 and 32 feet, respectively.  Lake Henry, along with lakes Agnes and Winona, comprise a chain of lakes within the city limits of Alexandria.  Lakes Henry and Agnes are broadly connected with a common \"narrows\" area between the two basins.  A shallow sand and rock bar separates the two basins.  This bar is only one to two feet under the water surface during normal water levels.  There is no public access on Lake Henry.  Boaters access the lake via the public access on connected Lake Agnes, although that can be challenging when water levels are low.  Boaters should note that motorized watercraft operation across Lake Agnes is regulated by a slow, no-wake restriction.  Alexandria's City Park, which includes a public swimming beach, is located on the southeast shoreline of Lake Henry.  The park also has a fishing pier that protrudes into connected Lake Agnes.     <br> \n <br> \nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in summer 2023 to assess the fish community.  Gamefish populations continue to expand in this basin as water quality and clarity continue to improve and aquatic vegetation becomes more abundant.  The shallow, productive nature of this basin results in fast growth and larger average size for most gamefishes.  A quality Largemouth Bass population was evident in 2023.  This population is currently protected by a special 12- to 20-inch protected slot limit.  All bass 12 to 20 inches in length must be immediately released with one bass over 20 inches allowed in possession.  Panfish species commonly targeted by anglers include Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch.  Black Crappie abundance has substantially declined in recent years due to a 2021 summerkill event that predominantly affected this species.  Crappie fisheries are typically \"boom or bust\" in nature so hopefully this population recovers soon.  Bluegill numbers have increased in recent years.  The current population is characterized as moderate, in terms of both abundance and size structure.  Yellow Perch are abundant.  Harvestable-size perch are available but smaller fish tend to dominate this population.  Northern Pike tend to exhibit lower abundance but larger average size on this basin.  Record-high Walleye abundance was documented in 2023.  Multiple year classes were sampled, with an average size of 17.9 inches and 2.2 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in the 2023 survey included Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.  White Suckers were particularly abundant.  The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2028. <br> \n   <br> \nLake Henry is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels, which were first confirmed in 2022.
