                "narrative": "<p>Powderhorn Lake is completely located within the 77.6-acre Powderhorn Park in the city of Minneapolis.  A fishing pier provides access to the lake along with over a half mile of shoreline.  Powderhorn Lake was used as a walleye-rearing pond in the 1970's and then in 1980 managed as a Kid's Fishing Pond until 2000.  In 2001 the DNR's Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN), began to oversee the management.  Under the management of the FiN program, Powderhorn Lake will continue to receive stockings in 2004, as well as working with park staff to promote and introduce the public to fishing and improving water quality.  Litter reduction, erosion control work, and shoreline restoration began in the fall on 2001.During the survey black crappies numbers were above average for this lake type. The average crappie measured 6 inches in length, the largest black crappie measured 11.4 inches in length. Another species of interest in to anglers in Powderhorn Lake is bluegill sunfish; with the average bluegill length at 4.6 inches, the largest bluegill sampled measured 7.4 inches. Black bullheads, the most numerous species sampled in this survey, reproduce easily in large numbers; no special efforts are made to increase their population size. The black bullheads population was above average, sizes were good, averaging 5.4 inches in length with the longest fish close to 11 inches. Occasionally, other species make their way into Powderhorn Lake that are not in the management plan. Two northern pike were sampled with gill nets (21 and 23 inches in length). Other sampled fish include: hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and bowfin..Smaller fish from the 2002 and 2001-year classes of black crappies and bluegills were captured in the survey, indicating that there is some natural reproduction; this will also provide additional forage for the adult fish, thus promoting more growth. The 2001 update of the aeration system has nearly eliminated the risk of a winterkill, which helps keep Powderhorn Lake a great local place to fish and catch some keepers or toss them back for another day.

                "narrative": "<p>A special fish assessment was conducted at Powderhorn Lake on the 9th through the 12th of July 2007.  Powderhorn Lake is a 12-acre lake located within Powderhorn Park in the city of Minneapolis.  Powderhorn Lake is managed by the DNR Fishing in the Neighborhood Program (FiN), and has received annual stockings of adult bluegill and occasional stockings of black crappies and largemouth bass.  In 2004, a channel catfish stocking program was begun at Powderhorn Lake.  In 2007, 85 adult channel catfish were stocked.  Anglers can try their luck fishing at the accessible pier or at many spots along the shoreline.  Anglers report good luck fishing for panfish and catfish during the spring and early summer, after the fish are stocked.    <br> \n <br> \nThe city of Minneapolis operates a subsurface aerator in Powderhorn Lake year round.  In addition, the city has worked to improve the water quality through reductions in storm water inputs and a shoreline restoration project.  <br> \n <br> \nSmall panfish dominate the fish community in Powderhorn Lake. The trap net catch of bluegills was 11.4 fish per net.  Bluegills ranged in length from 3.2 to 7.4 inches, with a mean length of 4.7 inches.  Black crappie abundance has decreased in trap net catches from 12.9 fish per trap net in 2005, to 1.6 fish per trap net in 2007. However, black crappie catch in gill nets averaged an increase from 2.0 fish per gill net in 2005, to 20.0 fish per gill net in 2007.  Black crappies were 5.2 to 6.1 inches, with a mean length of 5.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish were the most abundant predator species sampled in Powderhorn Lake.  The gill net catch was 2.0 fish per net.  The channel catfish had an average length and weight of 23.5 inches and 4.6 pounds.  The largest fish sampled was 26.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included black bullheads, pumpkinseed sunfish and two goldfish. <br> \n <br> \nAn invasive plant, Brazilian elodea, new to Minnesota water was discovered in Powderhorn Lake.  The plant is native to South America.  Brazilian elodea can cause problems like those caused by other invasive aquatic plants like Eurasian water milfoil.  Though no one can say for sure how the plant reached the lake, it is suspected someone may have dumped the contents of an aquarium, including the Brazilian elodea, into the lake.  Goldfish, which are also widely sold in the aquarium trade and are not native to Minnesota, previously have been seen in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe DNR wants to remind people with aquariums that it is illegal to release or dump unwanted plants or animals in lakes or streams.  Instead, the DNR recommends that people either find another aquarium owner who will take the unwanted plants or animals or dispose of contents safely.  In the case of aquatic plants, seal them into a plastic bag and dispose of them into the trash.  In the case of animals, contact a veterinarian or pet retailer for guidance or humane disposal. <br> \n <br> \nPowderhorn Park has many amenities in addition to the lake.  The Park is a great place to spend a day fishing, swimming in the pool, and visiting the Powderhorn Community Center.  In the winter, an ice skating rink is maintained on the lake.  More information about the Powderhorn Park can be found at: www.minneapolisparks.org. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at: www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Powderhorn Lake is a 12-acre Class 40 lake located within Powderhorn Park in the City of Minneapolis. Powderhorn Lake was managed as a Kids Fishing Pond and regularly stocked with adult Bluegill and Black Crappie beginning in 1980. Since 2001, Powderhorn Lake has been managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program, and has received annual stockings of adult Bluegill and occasional stockings of Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass. Adult Channel Catfish have been stocked since 2004. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the 2016 survey, Black Bullhead was the most abundant species sampled. Bluegill abundance was above average for this lake class and several of the Bluegills sampled were larger than nine inches. Channel Catfish was the most abundant predator species sampled in Powderhorn Lake. Lengths of Channel Catfish ranged from 3.1-20.6 inches with an average length of 16.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes captured during the survey were Goldfish, hybrid sunfish, and Pumpkinseed sunfish.  <br> \n <br> \nPowderhorn Park has many amenities in addition to the lake. The park is a great place to spend a day fishing, swimming in the pool, and visiting the Powderhorn Community Center. In the winter, an ice skating rink is maintained on the lake. On National Get Outdoors Day, which is usually the second or third Saturday in June, Powderhorn Park holds a free event that welcomes children and families to participate in outdoor events such as canoeing, fishing, birding, archery, mountain biking, and rock climbing.  More information about Powderhorn Park can be found at: www.minneapolisparks.org  <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at: www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin.  <br> \n</p>",
