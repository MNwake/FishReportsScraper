                "narrative": "<p>Lake Martha is a 97-acre lake located two miles southwest of Hanover in Wright County.  Seventy-four percent of the lake is littoral with 1.5 miles of shoreline.  Lake Martha has a maximum depth of 25 feet and has one state owned public access located along the south shore.  The last lake survey was conducted in 1996 with previous sampling conducted in 1961, 1978, 1980, 1986, and 1991. <br> \n <br> \nWith water quality improving and no winter kill since 1978-79, the fishery in Lake Martha has changed from being dominated by black bullheads and crappies to that of northern pike, bluegill and largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing on May 4, 2006.  A total of 73 largemouth bass were sampled for a catch rate of nearly 71 fish/hr, which is higher than the average of 59 fish/hr for Montrose Area lakes.  Largemouth bass sampled ranged from 5 to 20 inches with an average length of 13.7.  Of the catchable size bass (greater than 8 inches), nearly 70 percent were greater than 12 inches.   Growth rates of largemouth bass were similar to calculated statewide averages.  The oldest largemouth sampled was 12 years old and 20 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 14.3/gill net, which is above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Martha and similar to the last three surveys.  Northern pike ranged in length from 14 - 34 inches. Estimated growth rates were similar to those calculated from statewide data. Based on this high level of abundance, Lake Martha should provide angling opportunities for above average size northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were caught at a rate of 74/trap net, nearly twice the rate observed in 1996.  The average length of bluegill caught was 5.7 inches, and the largest bluegill sampled was slight over eight inches.  Growth rates of bluegill were slower than statewide averages, reaching on average only seven inches by age nine.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of black crappie (3.7/trap net) was identical to that of 1996. Black crappie caught in trap nets set in 2006 ranged in size from 6 - 11 inches with an average of 7.5 inches.  Growth rates of black crappie were slower than statewide averages taking ten years to attain a length of eight inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Martha Lake is a 96 acre lake located two miles southwest of the city of Hanover.  The maximum depth of the lake is 25 feet and during mid-June adequate oxygen was present down to 17 feet.  The public access for Martha Lake is on the south end of the lake. Martha Lake is located within 30 miles of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area and therefore it receives a moderate amount of fishing pressure for a lake of its size.  Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Northern Pike are all present in the lake.  In the summer of 1996, a lake survey was conducted on Martha Lake.  The netting of the lake revealed the following information about the fish population.  The Northern Pike catch rate in gill nets (19.0/lift) increased from the 1990 survey (10.7/gill net).  This catch rate of Northern Pike was above expected levels for lakes that are similar to Martha Lake.  The average size northern caught in gill nets weighed 2.6 pounds and was 21.9 inches long.  The growth rate of Northern Pike was average when compared with lakes similar to Martha Lake. The trap net catch of Bluegill in Martha Lake (42.4/trap net) declined from the previous netting (129/trap net) but remained above normal levels for this lake type.  Changes in catch rates of panfish in trap nets are highly dependent on the weather; therefore, a small change in catch rate like this may not mean a significant change in the fish population.  Bluegill caught in trap nets ranged in length from 3.6-7.8 inches and averaged 5.2 inches in length.  The growth rate of Bluegill was average. The catch rate of Black Crappie (75.2/trap net) dropped from the last netting (195.4/trap net) but remained high for lakes similar to Martha.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 4.8-8.9 inches and averaged 6.0 inches.  Two year old fish made up the majority of the Black Crappie and growth of Black Crappie was average.</p>",

Northern Pike (10.7/gill net) were abundant and fish ranged in size from 17-22 inches.  Growth was average for both sexes but was slow for female Northern Pike aged 5 and 6.  Walleye were present in low numbers (0.7/gill net).  Only two Walleye were captured, measuring 14 and 16 inches long.  However, this was the first time that Walleye had ever been taken in test nets at Lake Martha.  White Sucker had average abundance (1.3/gill net).  \n\nThe most important species taken in trap nets were Black and Yellow Bullhead, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. All were abundant and catches were above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Martha. Black Bullhead and Yellow Bullhead were taken at rates of 543 and 336/trap net, respectively.  Black Bullhead ranged from seven to nine inches (average length 7.5 inches) and were not commercially sized.  Black Crappie were caught at a rate of 195/trap net, more than five times the top of the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Black Crappie ranged in size from 5-11 inches and the average length group was five and a half inches. Bluegill were taken at a rate of 129/trap net, far above the range of expected values.  The average length was four inches.  Largemouth Bass were not taken during this survey but are thought to be common. Anglers report catching bass of all sizes, including Largemouth Bass that are five pounds or more.\n</p>",

Lake had lush growth of Curled Pondweed to about 10' of water.  One-quarter inch trapnets were used to supplement normal gear and assess small fish.  Concern about reclamation was expressed by several local residents. The Northern Pike population is strongly dominated by rough fish spawned following the 1978-79 winterkill. The panfish population consists primarily of fish stocked following the recent winterkill with many large individuals present.  The bullhead population is very large with several year classes evident from the length frequency. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Martha is a small 97-acre lake located two miles southwest of Hanover in Wright County. Martha has a maximum depth of 25 feet and an average water clarity of six feet. A state-owned public access is located along the south shore and offers parking for two to three vehicle/trailer combos. A standard survey was conducted in 2022 to update fisheries data last collected in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nThe highlight of Lake Martha is its Bluegill and Largemouth Bass fisheries. The lake produces good populations of nice-sized fish for the area. Anglers can expect respectable numbers and size of Bluegill. The average length of Bluegill sampled was just over seven inches with fish up to 8.5 inches measured in the survey. Anglers can also expect good Largemouth Bass action. Bass over 12 inches are common with some larger-sized fish up to 20 inches. Black Crappie numbers are making a comeback and average 7.5 inches with a few over 10 inches. Northern pike numbers are the lowest they have been since the 1980's. With the lower abundance and an ample food source, pike have the potential to grow to larger sizes over time. We hope that this will be the case in Lake Martha. Pike sampled ranged in length from 18 to 33 inches with an average length and weight of 25 inches and just under four pounds. Walleye have not been stocked in the lake since 1989 and are quite rare. An angler looking for Walleye would need to rely more on luck than skill to catch one. Only two Walleye have ever been surveyed in Lake Martha over the last 36 years, one of which was sampled in 2022 and measured 22 inches. Other species that were seen in the survey were Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n</p>",
