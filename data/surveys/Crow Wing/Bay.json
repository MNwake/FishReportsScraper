                "narrative": "<p>Bay Lake is a 2,392 acre lake located about 4 miles south of Deerwood in Crow Wing County.  Public access are located on the east and west sides of the lake.  The lake is quite popular and supports a wide variety of water-related recreational uses in addition to angling.  The lake is heavily developed with 614 homes/cabins, 3 resorts, and a church camp along 20 miles of shoreline as of 1997.  A number of these are small cabins and conversion of these may be an issue in the future.  It is imperative that lakeshore property owners exercise good stewardship to prevent water quality problems.  The maximum depth is 74' and about 42% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates are primarily sand, gravel, and rubble.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 24 species of submerged vegetation and 39 emergent species present, and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are common along much of the shoreline.  It is essential to protect and maintain these plants as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide critical spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  Two exotic species of particular interest are purple loostrife and Eurasian watermilfoil. Various methods have been used to control these plants, but lake users must take measures to prevent them from being introduced into other lakes and wetlands.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes have been stocked regularly since 1967 and currently fingerlings are stocked in alternate years at a rate of two pounds per littoral acre (2010 lbs).  Historical catches have ranged from 0.5 to 3.7/gill net and averaged 2.0/gill net since 1971.  The 2008 walleye catch of 1.9/gill net was typical for this lake but below average when compared to similar lakes.  A mix of fish from natural reproduction, fry, and fingerling stockings were sampled with no strategy clearly working better than another.  It is likely that the walleye population is limited by the high abundance of northern pike and largemouth bass as well as the low number of yellow perch present.   Average length and weight were 19.6\" and 2.9lbs.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in above average numbers at 17.4/gill net.  This was the highest catch to date.  Previous catches have ranged from 6.1 to 16.6/gill net and averaged 13.4/gill net.  Northern pike abundance in the 6 most recent nettings, dating from 1982, has been above average.   The 2005 and 2006 year classes contributed 89% of the catch with most of these fish measuring 13\" to 22\".  Average length and weight were 17.3\" and 1.2lbs. <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass catch of 1.4/trap net and 1.3/gill net were above average when compared to similar lakes.  The trap net catch is similar to past nettings while the gill net catch was the highest to date.  About 40% of all bass measured (gill nets and trap nets) were 12\" or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch of 39.3/trap net was average compared to similar lakes and typical of recent catches.  Past catches have ranged from 38.2 to 157.1/trap net.  Size was respectable with 36% of trap netted bluegills measuring 7\" or larger, compared to 15% in 2002.  Black crappie abundance measured by trap nets also remained average at 1.7 /trap net.  Gill net abundance was above average at 1.3/gill net.  Average weight of all crappies was 0.4lbs and 40% of the fish sampled were larger than 8\", compared to 59% in 2002. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage species for the lake's game fish and abundance has always been very low, never ranging above the 1971 catch of 0.8/gill net.  Only 1 perch was caught in 2008 resulting in a catch rate of 0.1/gill net.  Tullibee are also an important food source and as with the perch, only one was sampled in 2008.  Past catches have ranged as high as 12.9 in 1982, but have not exceeded 0.3/gill net since 1987.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bay Lake is a 2,392 acre lake located about 4 miles south of Deerwood in Crow Wing County.  Public access are located on the east and west sides of the lake.  The lake is quite popular and supports a wide variety of water-related recreational uses in addition to angling.  The lake is heavily developed with 614 homes/cabins, 3 resorts, and a church camp along 20 miles of shoreline as of 1997.  Because of this, lakeshore property owners in particular need to exercise good stewardship to prevent water quality problems.  Alterations such as installing sand beaches, fertilizing lawns and mowing them to the water's edge, and \"cleaning up\" the lakeshore by removing shoreline trees and vegetation all have negative impacts on the health of the lake.  The maximum depth is 74' and about 42% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates are primarily sand, gravel, and rubble.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 24 species of submerged vegetation and 39 emergent species present, and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  Two exotic species of particular interest are purple loostrife and Eurasian watermilfoil. Various methods have been used to control these plants, but it is imperative that lake users take measures to prevent them from being introduced into other lakes and wetlands.  Walleyes have been stocked since 1967 and currently 1 million fry are stocked on an annual basis.  Historical catches have ranged from 0.5 to 3.7/gill net and averaged 2.1/gill net since 1971.  The 2002 walleye catch of 2.1/gill net was average for this lake and typical when compared to similar lakes.  The 1994 year class was the strongest, representing 29% of the catch.  Approximately 48% of the fish sampled were from years that were not stocked, suggesting that ample reproduction is occurring in addition to stocking efforts.  Average length and weight were 21.3\" and 3.0lbs.  It is likely that the walleye population is limited by the high abundance of northern pike and the low number of yellow perch present.    Northern pike were caught in above average numbers at 16.6/gill net.  This was the highest catch to date.  Previous catches have ranged from 6.1 to 15.6/gill net and averaged 12.8/gill net.  Northern pike abundance in the 5 most recent nettings dating to 1982 has been above average.   The 1998 and 1999 year classes contributed 74.3% of the catch with most of these fish measuring 16\" to 23.5\".  Average length and weight were 19.5\" and 1.6lbs, which is very similar to 1997.The largemouth bass catch of 0.8/trap net and 1.1/gill net was average when compared to similar lakes.  The trap net catch is similar to past nettings while the gill net catch was the highest to date.  About 32% of all bass measured (gill nets and trap nets) were 12\" or larger.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 90.7/hr with an average length of 11.8\" and 47% measuring at least 12\".  The bluegill catch of 50.8/trap net was above average compared to similar lakes.  Past catches have ranged from 38.2 to 157.1/trap net.  Growth after the first year was slow with 15.1% of trap netted bluegills measuring 7\" or larger, compared to 5.5% in1997.  Black crappie abundance measured by trap nets was average at 1.3/net, but the gill net catch was above average at 1.7/net.  Average weight was 0.4lbs and 59% of the fish sampled were 8\" or larger, compared to 33% in 1997.Yellow perch are an important forage species for the lake's game fish and abundance has always been very low, never ranging above the 1971 catch of 0.8/gill net.  The 2002 catch was below average at 0.2/gill net.  Small perch were sampled by shoreline seining although they were not particularly abundant.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Abundances of northern pike, yellow bullhead, bluegill and largemouth bass were high. Tullibee (cisco), black bullhead, and yellow perch were low in abundance.  Other species were taken in average numbers for the lake class.  The northern pike catch was 15.0/gillnet in 1987 and dropped to 8.25/gillnet in 1992, both high abundance values for the lake class.  A Wilcoxon signed rank test (appended) was used to verify (5% sig. level) that the change in catch rate represented a change in abundance between 1987 and 1992.  Ages 2-4, 6 and 8 were sampled. Most were from the 1988 (35%) or 1989 (53%) year classes.  Growth was good.  Average size remained small (1.3 lb.) and similar to 1987 (1.5 lb.). The walleye catch (3.67/gillnet) continued to increase and became average for the lake class in 1992; however, a Wilcoxon signed rank test (not appended) indicated that walleye abundance was not different from 1987 (2.13/gillnet) (2-tailed p- value = 0.5782; 5% sig. level).  Age analysis showed good agreement with stocking records. Only the 1991 stocking was not sampled.  The 1987 year class comprised 73% of the walleye sampled. Growth was good.  Average size remained in the 1987.  Abundance of largemouth bass (1.17/trapnet) was high for the third time in four nettings.  Size (0.49 lb.) was sampled.  Growth was good but appeared to be slower for younger aged fish.  Bluegills continued to be abundant (43.92/trapnet).  Ages 3-8 were sampled.  The 1988 (at 39%) and 1987 (at 30%) year classes were most abundant.  Bluegill growth was slow.  Average size (0.13 lb.) was at the lower quartile value for the lake class.  About 5% of the fish measured from trapnets were 7.0 longer, compared to 13% in 1987.  The black crappie numbers (0.5/trapnet) and size (0.42/lb) were both average for the lake class.  Ages 2-6 were sampled, growth was good and the 1989 year class was most abundant (39%).  Yellow perch abundance (0.67/gillnet) remained low and was similar to previous catches as far back as 1948.  Only the 1989 year class was sampled by stationary gear.  There was good shoreline seine hauls produced reasonable numbers of yoy (young of year) perch.  The catch of tullibee (cisco) in previous nettings has been rather variable.  The 1992 catch (0.25/gillnet) was low and average size (0.37 lb.) was small.  Bowfin (0.5/trapnet) and brb (0.83/trapnet) catches were average for the lake class. Black bullhead (0.08/trapnet) were taken in low numbers. Abundance of yellow bullhead (11.25/trapnet) was high.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bay Lake is a popular 2,392 acre lake located five miles south of Deerwood in Crow Wing County.  Development is heavy on its 24.3 miles of shoreline.  Maximum depth is 74 feet, with 42% of the lake 15 feet deep or less.  A public access is located on the west shore of the northwest bay.  Bay Lake has substantial recreational boating activity, especially on weekends and holidays.  Three islands are present.   Church Island is protected from future development through a conservation easement AMA (aquatic management area).   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are currently stocked annually as fry.  A variety of walleye stocking strategies have been tried in Bay Lake since 1967, including fry and various rates of walleye fingerlings.  However, none of these have been successful in creating more than a low-level walleye population.  The 2014 walleye catch of 1.6/ gillnet remains below average for the lake class, but is typical of past catches on Bay Lake.  The average size was quite nice at 19.9 inches and 3 lbs.   Walleye numbers seem to be kept low by the high abundance of northern pike, and the low number of yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch of 19.6/gillnet was extremely high, and the highest catch to date.  Average size was small at 17.9 inches and 1.3 lbs.  A few larger northern pike were present with 5% of the catch 24 inches or larger.  On all lakes it is important to practice catch and release of these larger northern pike, as they help to control the population of smaller northern pike.  This is especially true on Bay Lake.  Two year classes (2011 and 2012) made up 82% of the total catch.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey.  Largemouth were captured at a rate of 100.3/hr of run time.  Average length was 12.0 inches, with 58% measuring 12 inches or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie gillnet catch of 1.2/net was above average.  Average length was 9.7 inches.  The trapnet black crappie catch of 1.6/net was average, with an average length of 9.0 inches.  For both gears combined, 74% of black crappies measured at least 8 inches in length with fish up to 12.4 inches captured.  The bluegill catch of 12.3/trapnet was the lowest catch to date.  The average length was 6.9 inches, with 57% of the catch 7 inches or larger. <br> \n   <br> \nBay Lake is designated as an infested water because of Eurasian watermilfoil.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as remove the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

The pumpkinseed, bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie and black bullhead net catches indicate average populations with net catch rates between the first and third quartile. The yellow perch and walleye populations are low with net catches below the first quartile. The northern pike population has remained stable since 1982 but the abundance has increased from previous nettings. The length-frequency was from 12.0 to 31.0 inches. The mean size at 18.5 indicated a decrease in average length. The northern cisco population, which seemed to be the major forage base for the northern pike, showed a high, stable population with most fish in the 7.0-7.9 inch range. The walleye population remains low (below the first quartile) but shows fair gains since the start of the stocking program. the age classes present were 4 thru 8+.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bay Lake is a popular 2,392 acre lake located five miles south of Deerwood in Crow Wing County.  Development is heavy on its 24.3 miles of shoreline.  Maximum depth is 74 feet, with 42% of the lake 15 feet deep or less.  The lone public access located on the west shore of the northwest bay can get very crowded at times.  Bay Lake has substantial recreational boating activity, especially on weekends and holidays.  Three islands are present.   Church Island is protected from future development through a conservation easement AMA (aquatic management area).   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are currently stocked annually as fry.  A variety of Walleye stocking strategies have been tried in Bay Lake since 1967, including fry and various rates of walleye fingerlings.  However, none of these have been successful in creating more than a low-level walleye population.  The 2021 Walleye catch of 1.1/gill net remains below average for this type of lake but is typical of past catches on Bay Lake.  The average size was quite nice at 21.1\".   Walleye numbers seem to be kept low by the high abundance of northern pike, and the low number of yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch, although down from 19.6/gill net in the previous survey, was still high at 9.9/gill net.  Efforts by the lake association and local anglers to encourage harvest of more abundant smaller Northern Pike coupled with the North Central zone regulation should help reduce overall pike numbers while improving size structure.  Average size in 2021 was small at 19.2 inches and only 17% were above the 22-26\" protected slot.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by night electrofishing at a rate of 64.1/hour, down from the 2014 rate of 100.3/hour.  Average length was 12.7 inches, with 71% measuring 12 inches or larger.   <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were average, with 47% measuring 8\" or larger.  Bluegill numbers, although average as well, were the lowest to date at 9.5/trap net.  Average length was 6.0\" and 42% of the fish were 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBay Lake is designated as an infested water because of Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as remove the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bay is a 2,392 acre lake located about four miles south of Deerwood, in Crow Wing County.  Development was extensive, with 614 homes/cabins, 3 resorts and a church camp located along the lake's 20 miles of shoreline in 1997.  Public accesses included a township-owned access on the east side and a State-owned access on the west side.  The lake is 74 feet deep and about 42% of the lake's surface area is less than fifteen feet deep.  Lake water was moderately hard and phosphorus fertility was moderate-good in '97.  Water clarity was about average for the area.  Bottom soils in water less than 4 feet deep are primarily sand; but a variety of other bottom soils are also present in lesser quantities.The aquatic plant community is quite diverse.  Emergent species are important for control of nutrients and shore erosion.  Species like bulrush enhance the quality of spawning habitat for species like bass and panfish.  Cattail and burreeds help stabalize shorelines.  Wild rice can enhance northern pike spawning habitat.  Submergent and floating leafed species are quite diverse, as well.  They provide cover and food resources for a wide variety of aquatic species.Two exotic species of concern are present in Bay Lake.  Purple loosestrife is common in many marshy/shoreline areas.  Biological control, using insects, has recently been initiated as an alternative to chemical control.  Eurasian watermilfoil was discovered in the lake in 1992.  Its distribution continues to spread in spite of extensive control efforts, but plant density has tended to remain light.A lake survey was conducted in 1997.  Catches of northern pike, black crappie and rock bass were in the \"high\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  Catches of walleye, tullibee, white sucker and black bullhead were in the \"low\" category.  Other species were present in \"average\" numbers when compared to similar type lakes.Northern pike abundance has been in the \"high\" category since the 1992 netting.  Several year classes were sampled in '97 and growth rate was good.  Age 3 and 4 fish were most abundant in the catch in both the '92 and '97 nettings.  Size averaged 19 inches and 1.7 lbs. in '97, 18 inches and 1.3 lbs. in '92.Walleye abundance has remained in the \"low\" category since this species was first sampled in 1971.  Walleye stocking has been done on a fairly regular basis since 1967.  Walleye catches have been fairly consistent over the past three nettings, ranging from 2.1-3.7/GN.  A number of year classes were present and represented both stocking and non-stocking years.  Growth appeared to be good.  Over the past three nettings walleyes averaged 20 inches and 2.9 lbs. in 1987, 19 inches and 2.4 lbs. in 1992 and 20 inches and 2.7 lbs. in '97.The largemouth bass catch was in the \"average\" category and similar to the 1992 catch rate.  Several year classes were sampled.  Most abundant were fish from the 1993 year class and their growth was slow.Bluegill catches have been fairly consistent over the past three nettings, straddling the boundary between the \"high\" and \"average\" abundance categories.  Several age classes were sampled in '97 and growth was slow.  About 6% ofmeasured bluegills were 7.0 inches or more in length, similar to the '92 value.The black crappie catch has been rather variable over time; typical for this species.  The '97 catch was in the \"high\" category and growth was good.  Fish from the '92 and '93 year classes were most abundant in the sample.Yellow perch provides an important forage base for northern pike and walleyes.  Perch catches in gillnets has been in the \"low\" category in every netting.  In 1997, perch were only caught by shoreline seine.  Young perch averaged 2.0 inches long by mid August.  Tullibee is another good food source for gamefish.  Their abundance has been in the \"low\" category the past two nettings.  White sucker also has had abundances in the \"low\" category.  The '97 sucker catch was \"low,\" but very similar to past catches in Bay Lake.Other species sampled in '97 included: bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish.  All were caught in numbers considered \"average\" when compared to similar type lakes.</p>",

Walleyes were first stocked in 1967, with regular fingerling stocking occurring until 1995.  No stocking occurred from 1996-1998.  From 1999-2003 walleye fry were stocked annually.  In 2004 stocking was switched to alternate year fingerling stocking with the current rate of 2lbs/littoral acre beginning in 2006.  None of these strategies has been successful in producing a good walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gillnet catch of 1.5/net was well below average for this type of lake.  Historic gillnet catches, also well below average, have ranged from 0.5 (1971) to 3.7 (1992).  Average size was nice at 19.6 inches and weighing 3.1lbs.  Walleye growth was above average.  Northern pike gillnet catches were high at 12.9/net.  Average size was 18.5 inches and 1.6 lbs.  Fish up to 35.9 inches were sampled, with 11% over 24 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass gillnet catch was above average with a catch of 0.9/net.  Average size was 12 inches and about 1 lb.  The black crappie gillnet catch of 3.9/net was above average for this lake class.  Size was decent with an average of 9.2 inches and 0.5 lbs and 76% measuring at least 8 inches.   <br> \n</p>",
