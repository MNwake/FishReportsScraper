Small populations of yellow perch, black crappie, and rock bass were also present.  No smallmouth bass were captured despite a fair abundance of this species in this lake.  Crappie and perch dominated the seine catches despite low numbers in the gillnetting and trapnetting.  Overall, fish populations in Garden Lake were very low: gillnets captured a total of only 9.9 fish/net (7.5 lbs/net), while trapnets captured a total of only 7.1 fish/net (4.1 lbs/net).Too few fish of the major species were captured to determine consistency of reproduction; however both yellow perch and walleye numbers were dominated by a strong 1991 year-class, which was also a year when walleye fingerlings were stocked.  Forty-one percent of all walleye captured in this survey were from the 1991 year-class.Cisco sizes ranged from 6\" to 14\".  Large northern pike (40\"), crappie (12\"), and walleye (22\") were captured during this survey.  Northern pike, bluegill, and crappie growth is faster than average for the area, while yellow perch and walleye growth is slower than average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Garden Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Garden Lake is smaller (670 acres) than the lake class average of 1,807 acres, but it is part of a reservoir and is broadly connected to Farm and South Farm lakes; the combined area of this reservoir is 2,606 acres. <br> \n <br> \nGarden Lake was thermally stratified on 08/11/2008 with a surface temperature of 72 F and a bottom temperature of 57 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 20 ft, where the temperature was 66 F.  The Kawishiwi River flows through Garden Lake with flows of 400-1,000 CFS, depending on the rainfall.  The outlet has a hydroelectric dam and the reservoir is used for power generation.  The \"inlet\" from Farm Lake is about 500 ft wide and 10 ft deep.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, muck, and rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 6 ft; wild rice and various pondweeds are the most common plants. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 fish population assessment used 7 gillnets and 12 trapnets.  The entire reservoir (Garden, Farm, and South Farm Lakes) was assessed, and 20 gillnets were distributed proportionally among the three basins.  Fourteen previous investigations on Garden Lake, dating back to 1965, used 2-12 gillnets.  Trapnets (2-25 nets) were used during seven of these previous investigations.  Gillnet and trapnet catches in this lake have historically been very poor, with median catches of only 13 fish per gillnet and 7 fish per trapnet. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2008 were dominated by northern pike, walleye, cisco, white sucker, and yellow perch.  Bluegill numbers were lower than in recent investigations.  No smallmouth bass were captured in the nets in 2008, but anglers catch fair numbers of smallmouth. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2008 (2.3/gillnet) were near the median for this lake class and were higher than the median pike catch of 1.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes averaged 22.6\" (3.0 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class.  The largest pike was 37.0\".  Pike scales were difficult to read, but most pike appeared to be ages 3 and 4, and pike growth appeared to be normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2008 (2.7/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median walleye catch of 2.1/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes averaged 12.8\" (1.1 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class.  The largest walleye was 28.4\".  Most of the walleye captured in 2008 were ages two and three.  Walleye growth was slower than normal by area standards.   <br> \n <br> \nCisco numbers in 2008 (1.7/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median cisco catch of 3.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes averaged 10.0\" (0.4 lb), which was near the median for this lake class and was similar to the median size of 10.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest cisco was 12.6\".  Cisco are a cold water fish and their abundance is probably underrepresented in the gillnet catches because only a small portion of the nets extend into cold water.  Cisco are a rich forage food for predatory fish and their presence is probably responsible for occasional large walleye and northern pike that are caught in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2008 (3.1/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were at the median perch catch of 3.1/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes averaged 6.9\" (0.17 lb), which was near the median for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 6.5\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch (caught in a trapnet) was 10.8\".  Most perch were age 3, and perch growth was normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish and black crappie are not abundant in Garden Lake, but some nice-sized bluegill (over 9\") and black crappie (over 13\") are present.  Smallmouth bass are more abundant than indicated by the net catches and are commonly caught by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nMany of the game fish examined in 2008 were infected with Neascus.  Many of the yellow perch were also infected with yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish. <br> \n <br> \nTen native crayfish (probably Orconectus Virilis) were captured in one of the trapnets in 2008.  Rusty crayfish (O. rusticus) were captured in Birch Lake, White Iron Lake, Farm Lake, and Garden Lake (near the dam) in crayfish traps by the U.S. Forest Service in the summer of 2007.  Rusty crayfish have been present in Fall Lake for over 20 years, and experience tells us that they will eventually become abundant in this chain of lakes.  Rusty crayfish are native to the Ohio River Valley and were probably brought to this area by anglers using them for bait.  They are very aggressive and usually displace native crayfish.  They can destroy beds of rooted aquatic vegetation and will nip swimmer's feet. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Garden Lake is five miles east of Ely, covers 653 acres, and is one of three connected lakes that with Farm and South Farm comprise the Garden Reservoir. This system is also connected to White Iron Lake via the South Kawishiwi River. A public access with a concrete plank boat ramp is located near the northwest corner of the lake off CR 18 (Fernberg Road). Garden Lake can also be accessed by boat from Farm Lake. A hydroelectric dam at the outlet of Garden Lake affects water levels seasonally on Garden Lake and the other connected lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 lake management plan for the Garden Reservoir lakes listed walleye and northern pike as the primary management species and the plan also listed bluegill, smallmouth bass, and black crappie as capable of providing quality fishing. A standard survey was conducted in mid-summer 2023 to assess the populations of these species and to monitor lake quality and habitat. The survey crew sampled fish with gill nets and trap nets, and they measured water quality. Garden Lake was thermally stratified, with a surface temperature of 71 F and a temperature of 52 F at 50 feet. Adequate oxygen levels for gamefish were present to a depth of about 15 feet. Garden Lake has brown, bog-stained water with visibility around 6 feet. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye harvest by anglers on the Garden Reservoir chain is restricted with a special regulation that requires releasing all fish from 17 to 26 inches, with only one fish over 26 inches allowed in a 6-fish limit. This regulation has been in place since 2006 with the goal of maintaining overall catch rates while increasing the number of fish over 17 inches and applies to all the connected lakes mentioned above. The gill-net catch for walleye was higher than the historic median for the lake. Walleye tended to run small, averaging just 12.8 inches long and only 27% of the fish sampled were over 14.0 inches. The largest walleye was almost 31 inches. Six additional walleye were also sampled in trap nets with a larger average size of 14.2 inches. Walleye ages ranged from 0 to 12 and indicated natural reproduction is occurring in the system. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike (pike) harvest by anglers on the Garden Reservoir chain is restricted with a special regulation that requires releasing all fish from 24 to 36 inches, with only one pike over 36 inches allowed in a 3-fish limit. This regulation, which applies to all the connected lakes mentioned above, has been in place since 2003 with the goal of maintaining the overall catch rate and increasing the abundance of pike over 24 inches.  Northern pike were caught at a slightly higher rate than the historic median for Garden Lake. Northern pike were 21.6 inches on average, which was smaller than the historical average for the lake. Additional northern pike were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 2.3 fish/trap net. These fish tended to be smaller, averaging 18.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were caught at rates that were above average for Garden Lake. Plus, the fish were 7 inches on average and displayed some of the fastest growth compared to other bluegill populations in the Tower area. The largest bluegill sampled was 9.4 inches in length, and ages ranged from 2 to 10.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were caught at a lower-than-normal rate for Garden Lake. Black crappie averaged 11.2 inches in length. The largest black crappie sampled was 12.8 inches long, and ages ranged from 3 to 9. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in 2023 included burbot, cisco, rock bass, smallmouth bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

Garden Lake Reservoir - Garden, Farm, South Farm, combined data: This assessments shows average numbers of cisco and white sucker, and below average numbers of northern pike, walleye and yellow perch. Smallmouth bass, bluegill, rock bass and black crappie are present and their numbers appear to be increasing. One whitefish was captured during this assessment - the first report of this species in these three lakes. Burbot were captured in 1965, but have not been captured since. Both of these species are occasionally captured in White Iron Lake. Numbers and sizes of most species have been quite stable since 1965, when the first assessment was done. Walleye in this reservoir are small and exhibit the slow growth typical of the area. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Garden Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Garden Lake is smaller (670 acres) than the lake class average of 1807 acres, however Garden Lake is part of a reservoir and is broadly connected to Farm and South Farm lakes; the combined surface are of this reservoir is 2606 acres.Garden Lake was slightly thermally stratified on 08/16/99 and retained adequate oxygen for fish (2 ppm) to within a foot of the bottom, where the temperature was only 2 F cooler than at the surface.  The Kawishiwi River flows through Garden Lake with summer flows of 400-1,000 CFS, depending of the rainfall.  The outlet is dammed and the reservoir is used for hydropower generation.  The \"inlet\" from Farm Lake is about 500 ft wide and 10 ft deep.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, muck, or rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 6 ft; wild rice and various pondweeds are the most common plants.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1999 of 11 fish/net (6 lb/net) was lower than normal for this lake class, and was slightly lower than the median catch of 14 fish/net (11 lb/net) in twelve  previous gillnettings on this lake, dating back to 1965.  Fewer yellow perch were captured in 1999 than in most previous investigations.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1999 of 11 fish/net (9 lb/net) was higher than the median catch of 7 fish/net (4 lb/net) in five previous trapnettings on this lake, dating back to 1965.  More bluegill sunfish were captured in 1999 than in most previous investigations.Fish populations in 1999 were dominated by northern pike, followed by bluegill, white sucker, walleye, and cisco.Northern pike numbers in the gillnets in 1999 (0.7/net) were lower than normal for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 1.0/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Pike numbers in the trapnets (2.2/net) were higher than the median catch of 0.8/net in previous investigations.  Pike sizes in 1999 averaged 22\" in the gillnets and 17\" in the trapnets; the largest pike was 38.2\".  Pike growth was normal for area lakes.Bluegill numbers in 1999 (3.4/trapnet) were normal for this lake class and were higher than in previous investigations on this lake.  Bluegill were present in very low numbers (0.0-0.2/trapnet) through 1986, and have gradually increased since then.  Bluegill sizes in 1999 averaged 7\"; the largest was 9.4\".  Most bluegill (59 percent) were age four.  Bluegill growth was faster than normal for area lakes.White sucker numbers in 1999 (1.3/gillnet) were lower than normal for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 2.5/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 1999 averaged 14\"; the largest was 18.3\".Walleye numbers in 1999 (2.7/gillnet) were lower than normal for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 2.0/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 1999 averaged 11\", which is smaller than the average length of 13\" in previous investigations.  The largest walleye in 1999 was 17.7\".  Walleye growth was normal for area lakes.Cisco numbers in 1999 (4.7/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 4.2/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes in 1999 averaged 8\"; the largest was 14.6\".Black crappie numbers in 1999 (0.8/gillnet) were lower than normal for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 1.0/trapnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Crappie sizes in 1999 averaged 10\"; the largest was 12.0\".  Crappie growth was faster than normal for area lakes.No smallmouth or largemouth bass were captured in 1999.  These species have been captured occasionally in low numbers in previous investigations on this lake; the first largemouth was observed in the initial investigation in 1965, while the first smallmouth was observed in 1981.  Both of these species are probably present in numbers that are greater than indicated by their net catches.  Bass tend to avoid gillnets and trapnets more than other fish species.Neascus (black spot) was present on many of the gamefish examined in 1999.  Yellow grubs were also present on many of the perch.  Neascus and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area and are found in or under the skin of fish.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed by cooking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Garden Lake is located approximately 5 miles NE of Ely. This popular lake is highly developed by area standards with homes and cabins being common particularly on the western shores. There are two resorts also. Garden is one of four lakes that with Farm, South Farm and White Iron comprise the Garden Reservoir. This reservoir is used for generating hydropower at the electric plant located near the outlet of Garden Lake. Water level fluctuations are common.\n\nThere is a navigable channel from nearby Farm Lake for public access. A concrete planked boat ramp is located near the NW corner of the lake off the Fernberg Road (CR18) for another access option. The nearby parking area is limited in space though. \n\nNine species of fish were sampled during the 2017 survey of Garden Lake. The catch rates were similar to past results indicating a stable fish community with generally low relative abundances. Cisco (31%) was the most common species sampled in 2017, followed by yellow perch (25%), walleye (20%) and northern pike (10%). Bluegill and black crappie are likely more abundant than the gill net catches indicate. Smallmouth bass are also present, although none were sampled during the survey.\n\nWalleye numbers in 2017 (3.1/gill net) were slightly above the historical average (2.3/gill net) for Garden Lake and below average (6.2/gill net) compared to other similar area lakes with walleye. The average walleye sampled was 11.6 inches and about 5 years old. The growth rate for walleye from Garden Lake is currently the slowest in the area. The largest walleye sampled measured 26.2 inches. Walleye fingerlings are stocked during even-numbered years and in 2017, 46% of the walleye sampled were from years where stocking occurred. There has been a protected slot for walleye in Garden Lake from 17 to 26 inches with one over 26 inches in possession since 2006.\n\nNorthern pike numbers in 2017 (1.6/gill net) were slightly higher than the historical average (1.1/gill net) but slightly below average (2.1/gill net) compared to other similar area lakes with pike. The average pike sampled in 2017 was 22.8 inches which is slightly smaller than the historic average length of 23.3 inches. The largest pike measured 31.0 inches. There has been a protected slot for northern pike in Garden Lake from 24 to 36 inches with one over 36 inches in possession since 2003.\n\nYellow perch numbers in 2017 (3.8/gill net) were similar to the historic average (3.1/gill net) and similar to the average (4.0/gill net) compared to other similar area lakes. The average perch sampled was 6.7 inches and the largest perch measured 9.0 inches.\n\nCisco numbers in 2017 (4.8/gill net) were nearly identical to the historical average (4.7/gill net) for Garden Lake and slightly lower (5.3/gill net) than average when compared to other similar area lakes with cisco. Cisco average length was 9.3 inches which is slightly below the historical average length of 9.9 inches. The largest cisco sampled in 2017 was 14.4 inches long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Garden Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Garden Lake is smaller (670 acres) than the lake class average of 1,807 acres, but Garden Lake is part of a broadly connected reservoir (along with Farm and South Farm Lakes); the combined surface area of this reservoir is 2,606 acres.Garden Lake was thermally stratified on 08/16/2004 with a surface temperature of 66 F and a bottom temperature of 50 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 20 ft, where the temperature was 63 F.  The Kawishiwi River flows through Garden Lake with summer flows of 400-1,000 CFS, depending on the rainfall.  The outlet has a hydroelectric dam and the reservoir is used for power generation.  The \"inlet\" from Farm Lake is about 500 ft wide and 10 ft deep.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, muck, and rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 6 ft; wild rice and various pondweeds are the most common plants.The walleye fingerling stocking in 1999 and 2001 was recorded as Garden Lake Reservoir (38-0738), and the number of fingerlings stocked in each basin (Garden, Farm, and South Farm Lakes) cannot be determined.  The Garden Lake Reservoir walleye fingerling stocking in 1999 was 17,490 fingerlings averaging 32.7/lb and in 2001 was 17,518 fingerlings averaging 33/lb.The 2004 fish population assessment used 7 gillnets and 12 trapnets.  The entire reservoir (Garden, Farm, and South Farm lakes) was assessed, and 20 gillnets were distributed proportionally among the three basins.  Thirteen previous investigations, dating back to 1965, used 2-12 gillnets.  Trapnets (2-25 nets) were used during six of these previous investigations.  Trapnet catches in this lake have historically been very poor, with a median catch of only 7 fish per net.Fish populations in 2004 were dominated by northern pike, walleye, cisco, white sucker, yellow perch, and bluegill sunfish.Northern pike numbers in 2004 (2.1/gillnet) were at the median for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 1.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes averaged 22.1\" (2.7 lb), which was at the median for this lake class.  The largest pike was 35.2\".  Pike scales were difficult to read, but most pike appeared to be ages two and three, and pike growth appeared to be somewhat faster than normal (in the third or fourth quartile, depending on the age) by area standards.Walleye numbers in 2004 (1.1/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 2.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes averaged 16.0\" (2.3 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  The largest walleye was 26.3\".  Walleye scales were difficult to read, but seven year-classes appeared to be represented by the eight walleye captured in 2004, and walleye growth appeared to be slower than normal (in the first or second quartile, depending on the age) by area standards. Cisco numbers in 2004 (2.6/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 4.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes averaged 10.0\" (0.4 lb), which was near the median for this lake class and was similar to the median size of 10.3\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest cisco was 13.3\".  Cisco are a rich forage food for predatory fish and their presence is probably responsible for the occasional large walleye and northern pike which are caught in this lake.Yellow perch numbers in 2004 (3.0/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 4.1/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes averaged 6.7\" (0.15 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 6.5\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch (caught in a trapnet) was 11.5\".  Most perch were age three and perch growth was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.Bluegill numbers appear to have increased in recent investigations and their numbers in 2004 (4.4/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class.  Bluegill sizes averaged 7.9\" (0.44 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 6.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  Most bluegill were age six, and bluegill growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.Black crappie and smallmouth bass are not common in this lake, but some nice-sized individuals are present.  A 13.2\" crappie and a 16.3\" smallmouth were caught in 2004.Many of the northern pike and yellow perch examined in 2004 were infected with neascus.  Bass tapeworm were present in some of the smallmouth bass, triaenophorus were present in a few of the cisco, and yellow grub were present in some of the yellow perch.  These are all common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting (except for triaenophorus, which is encysted in the muscle), and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Garden Lake is a 670 acre lake located about two miles east of Winton, MN.  Garden, along with Farm and South Farm Lakes make up the Garden Lake Reservoir.  There is a dam located at the outlet of Garden Lake that discharges into Fall Lake.  This dam, owned by Minnesota Power, impounds the reservoir and is used to generate hydropower. \n\nThe lakes of the Garden Lake Reservoir are managed primarily for their walleye and northern pike fisheries.  A population assessment was conducted on Garden Lake during the summer of 2012 to determine the status of the fish community, the effectiveness of walleye fingerling stocking (1.0 lb/littoral acre biennially)and protected length limit (protected length limit of 17-26\" with one over 26\" in possession) and the impacts of a northern pike special regulation (protected length limit of 24-36\" with one over 36\" in possession). \n\nWalleye made up 18% of the 2012 Garden Lake gill-net catch by number and 13% by weight.  Abundance in the gill-net catch (3.0/net) was the highest recorded for Garden Lake since 1981.  Despite this, abundance was below normal for lakes in the same classification as Garden.  The average weight of walleye was 0.49 pounds and was below normal.  Walleye lengths in the catch ranged from 7.2 to 17.8 inches with an average of 11.2 inches.  Sixty-three percent of the catch was from years in which fingerling stocking occurred. Growth of Garden Lake walleye was slow.\n\nBecause the Garden Lake Reservoir is an open system, fingerling stocking was evaluated concurrently for all three lakes.  The results of the evaluation showed that walleye cohorts from years that were fingerling stocked contributed approximately 50% more to assessment catches than those cohorts from years in which no stocking occurred. \n\nA special regulation was implemented for walleye in 2006 on the Garden Lake Reservoir requiring the immediate release of fish between 17 and 26 inches.  One walleye over 26 inches is allowed in possession.  The two assessments that have occurred since 2006 indicate that this regulation has met the goal of increasing abundance of walleye greater than 17 inches. The average gill-net catch of walleye greater than 17 inches from 2008-2012 was 0.93/net.  The 1991-2004 average was 0.30.  The number of walleye over 17 inches has tripled while the number of walleye over 26 inches has doubled.\n\nNorthern pike gill-net abundance in Garden Lake in 2012 (1.1/net) was equal to the historic average since 1965. Abundance in 2012 was below the first quartile for lakes in the same classification. Garden typically exhibits low pike abundance.  Pike ranged from 15.4 to 31.9 inches with a mean of 22.28 inches.  The largest pike ever caught during an assessment was 44.0 inches and was caught during 1965.\n\nEvaluation of the northern pike length regulation also included all the lakes of the reservoir.  The special regulation on pike went into effect in 2003 and requires the immediate release of pike between 24 and 36 inches with one over 36 inches allowed in possession. The goal of the northern pike regulation was to increase the overall abundance of northern pike in the reservoir and specifically to  increase the abundance of pike over 24 inches.  The evaluation indicated that the special regulation appears to have attained its goal.  The catch rate of pike over 24 inches increased from 0.38/net in 1991-1999 to 0.86/net in 2004-2012.\n\nThe bluegill population in Garden Lake exhibits low density but relatively large individual size.  The trap-net abundance in 2012 (1.7/net) was equal to the historic average.  Average length in 2012 was 7.1 inches.  The largest bluegill in the catch was 9.5 inches.  Mean bluegill weight (0.39 lbs) was above average for lakes in this classification.  Bluegill growth in Garden Lake was very fast. \n\nOther species present during the 2012 survey included black crappie, rock bass, smallmouth bass, yellow perch and white sucker.  Abundance for all four of these species was below the first quartile for lake class 7.  One rusty crayfish, a non-native species, was captured in Garden Lake.   </p>",
