There is no history of game fish ever inhabiting the lake.Conditions are poor for game fish in this lake as the maximum depth is only 4 feet.  Spawning habitat is non-existent for most game fish species as the bottom substrate is comprised almost entirely of soft muck.There is no developed public access to the lake.  The road leading to the lake is on private land.</p>",
