                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is 16 miles northeast of Finland in the Superior National Forest. The lake has a maximum depth of 18 feet and is relatively clear with a Secchi disc visible to a depth of 16 feet. There is a Forest Service access with a concrete ramp on the northwest side of the lake. Except for a small resort and a few private cabins on the north end of the main basin the shoreline is mostly undeveloped and in a wild state.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Crooked Lake is comprised of walleyes, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, muskellunge and northern pike. The lake is managed primarily for walleyes and although there is some natural reproduction occurring, the lake is stocked on a regular basis with walleye fingerlings.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2006 walleyes were sampled in above average numbers as they have been in most of the recent assessments on this lake. Mean size was 1.4 pounds, which is somewhat larger than the mean size in past assessments, but was still considered normal for the lake class. The assessment identified relatively strong year classes from 2001 and 2002 that make up a large part of the fishery at this time.  It appears that 2004 and 2005 are good year classes as well, which should recruit to the fishery in a couple of years.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were sampled in above average numbers as they were in the 2002 assessment. Smallmouth bass collected in past assessments have typically been smaller than average for the lake class; however, the mean size increased somewhat in the 2006 assessment and was considered normal for the lake class. There were fair numbers of smallmouth bass larger than 14 inches collected, with fish up to 17.8 inches present, though the majority of the fish were smaller than 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nShoepack strain muskellunge were introduced into Crooked Lake in the 1970\u0019s and were stocked periodically through 1982. The lake is no longer managed for this species although a small population has been maintained through natural reproduction. Muskellunge numbers have been declining in Crooked Lake for several years and the 2006 assessment continued to show this with a catch that was below normal; only one muskellunge (30.1 inches) was captured in this assessment. Crooked Lake is not a designated muskellunge lake but the minimum size regulation of 40 inches still applies to this lake.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers and the population appears to be increasing in Crooked Lake. This species is relatively new to Crooked Lake, having been sampled in DNR nets for the first time in 2002. It is uncertain how northern pike entered Crooked Lake, but it is suspected that they may have been illegally introduced.  The mean size was above average for the lake class, with a mean weight of about 4.0 pounds and fish up to 37 inches (11.8 pounds) collected. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch was higher than catches in previous assessments and was also above average for the lake class. The mean length was 7.8 inches with a fair number of fish between 9 and 10.5 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

The standard survey was conducted to monitor the fish community in Crooked Lake and to evaluate the Walleye fingerling stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nZooplankton sampling was also completed during the standard survey to monitor the lake after Zebra Mussels were first reported in 2014 and to provide baseline data about the community composition and abundance. Samples collected in August 2019 did not contain any Zebra Mussels. The lake remains listed as infested despite no additional detections of Zebra Mussels in any sampling efforts since the initial report. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 43 Walleye were caught in the gill nets and was within the normal range compared to similar lakes, but was lower than the previous four surveys. The average size of Walleye was 15.5 inches and 1.5 pounds. Forty-five percent of the catch was over 16 inches long. The largest Walleye caught was 24.6 inches long and weighed 4.7 pounds. Growth was average for the area and recruitment is consistent with only one year class absent in the last ten years. Stocking of 193 pounds of Walleye fingerlings occurs for two consecutive years out of every four years, the most recent stockings were in the falls of 2018 and 2019. Results from this survey are similar to previous investigations that have determined natural reproduction contributes more to the population than stocking. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass were sampled at average numbers for similar lakes in the area and comparable to the previous two surveys on the lake. Bass size structure was good with fish over 18 inches long present and an average size of 15 inches and 1.9 pounds. Natural reproduction is able to maintain the population with only two year classes absent over the last ten years.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was within the normal range for similar lakes and higher than the four most recent investigations. A total of 38 pike were caught and average size was 22.5 inches and 2.9 pounds with 24% of the catch greater than 26 inches. Growth of Northern Pike was fast for the area, and natural reproduction currently sustains the population with eight different ages represented in the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch and White Suckers are important forage species in the lake and were captured in normal numbers. No Muskellunge were sampled during the 2019 survey. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is 16 miles northeast of Finland Minnesota.  There is a public access with a concrete boat ramp on the northwest side of the middle basin.  This is one of the few lakes in the Finland Management Area that has a resort open all year.     The fish population is comprised of walleye, muskellunge, smallmouth bass, yellow perch and white sucker.  Test nets in 1997 found walleye numbers above average when compared to similar lakes of this class.  Walleye averaged just under one pound each, however approximately 20% of the fish sampled were greater than 17.0 inches in length.  The largest walleye sampled was 19.9 inches.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year.     Test nets in 1997 indicate the muskellunge population is about average when compared to other muskellunge lakes in this lake class.  The muskellunge ranged in length from 13.9 inches to 32.6 inches, with most of the fish sampled between 24.0 inches and 26.0 inches.  Crooked Lake probably does not contain many legal size muskellunge (40 inches) because these fish are of the Shoepack Lake strain which does not produce many large fish.  The muskellunge population is being maintained thru natural reproduction as the last stocking occurred in 1982.     Smallmouth bass are present in average numbers, however their average size was small.  Smallmouth bass up to 14.0 inches were observed , but 90% of the fish sampled were less than 10.0 inches in length.     Yellow perch abundance is average, however few fish are large enough to interest anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is a 283 acre body of water located approximately 13 miles east of Isabella, MN.  The public access is located on the northwest side of main lake basin, off of USFS Road #358.  There are two small parking areas with space for a total of four vehicles.  There was no dock at this access.  Crooked Lake Resort on northeast side of the main lake basin, off of Lake County Road #7, also has lake access available for their guests and to the general public with permission and a fee. <br> \n   <br> \nWalleye were sampled in above average numbers in 2010, for northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics, and similar to recent catches on Crooked Lake.  The average size of the walleye was 1.5 pounds (15.8 inches) and includes 39% over 16 inches with the largest walleye measuring 25.1 inches.  Walleye growth was generally above average for the Finland area.  Walleyes fingerlings are stocked 2 consecutive years out of 4 years with the last stocking in 2010.  Natural reproduction in Crooked Lake also contributes to the walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 smallmouth bass numbers were above average for lakes with similar characteristics in northeastern Minnesota, but below recent catches on Crooked Lake.  The average weight of smallmouth bass was 0.9 pound (10 inches) and was the largest observed recently.  The largest smallmouth bass measured 16.8 inches.  Since northern pike were documented in Crooked Lake the number of smallmouth bass has decreased but the size has increased. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were first reported to be in Crooked Lake in 1998 when one was caught by an angler.  By 2002, during the next fisheries assessment, the northern pike population was well established.  Northern pike catch in 2010 was below average for this lake type, but the highest recorded since the 2002 assessment.  The average weight of northern pike was 2.6 pounds (21.6 inches) with 30% of the catch over 24 inches; the largest northern pike was 27 inches.  Northern pike growth was above the Finland area average with age-4 northern pike averaging 21.4 inches.   Northern pike were never stocked into Crooked Lake by the Department of Natural Resources and immigration from an adjoining water body is unlikely. <br> \n   <br> \nTwo muskellunge were sampled in 2010; one was 19.8 inches the other 34.8 inches (10.1 pounds).  The three previous investigations have also sampled low numbers of muskellunge.  The muskellunge sampled, in all investigations since the initial stocking in 1977, have rarely reached 35 inches, the largest measured only 39 inches.  This growth pattern is typical of the Shoepack strain muskellunge that were stocked in Crooked Lake, as the bulk of the adult population never exceed 28 - 30 inches.  The muskellunge numbers in recent investigations have fallen, possibly from the northern pike presence.  Natural reproduction was sufficient in the early management to sustain the muskellunge population, predation from northern pike on YOY/ juvenile muskellunge may now be limiting the population.  Crooked Lake is not a designated muskellunge lake, although statewide regulations for muskellunge do apply to Crooked Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch in 2010 was the highest recorded on Crooked Lake and above average for the lake class.  The average weight was approximately 0.2 pound (7.2 inches); 24% of the sample was greater than 8 inches, the largest yellow perch was 9.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCrooked Lake is a fairly clear lake with a secchi disk reading of 8.5 feet in 2010.  There is a resort and a few cabins on the middle (eastern) basin; however it is typical of the Finland area, a quiet lake to visit.  The north and south basins of the lake are generally less than three feet deep, having a deep layer of suspended organic substance over the bottom.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is characterized as a lake class 12 lake and is located seven miles northwest of Schroeder in the Superior National Forest.  The lake is 272 acres with 95% of the lake less than 15 feet and a maximum depth of 18 feet.  The north and south basins of the lake are less than three feet deep, having a deep layer of suspended organic substance over the bottom.  Crooked Lake is a fairly clear lake with a Secchi disk reading of 11.5 feet in 2014.  Although there is a resort and a few cabins on Crooked Lake it is generally a quiet lake to visit, typical of the Finland area.  Public access is a concrete ramp at the end of USFS Rd 1887.  There is a small parking area present adequate for up to four vehicles with trailers.  Crooked Lake Resort on the northeast side of the main lake basin, off of Lake County Road #7, also has lake access available for their guests and to the general public with permission and a fee. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in above average numbers in 2014, for northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics, and similar to recent catches on Crooked Lake.  The average weight of one pound was slightly smaller than average.  The largest fish sampled in 2014 was 24.8 inches and weighed 5.2 pounds with 25.5% of the catch greater than 16 inches. Ten year classes were sampled in this investigation. Age-2 a non-stocked year was the strongest year class and represented 29% of the catch with a total of 47% of the catch from non-stocked years. Growth of Walleye in Crooked Lake is faster than average for the Finland Area. Catch comparisons for all species will be based on investigations using the same amount of netting effort.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked 2 consecutive years out of 4 years.  Natural reproduction in Crooked Lake also contributes to the Walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 Smallmouth Bass numbers (gill net catch of 5.2/lift) were above average for lakes with similar characteristics in northeastern Minnesota.  The average weight of Smallmouth Bass was 0.9 pound (10 inches) and was the largest observed recently.  Six percent of the catch was greater than 15 inches.  The largest Smallmouth Bass measured 18.3 inches and weighed 3.5 pounds.  Smallmouth Bass growth was average by Finland Area standards.  Smallmouth Bass population is maintained by natural reproduction.  Since Northern Pike were documented in Crooked Lake the number of Smallmouth Bass has decreased but the size has increased. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were first reported to be in Crooked Lake in 1998 when one was caught by an angler.  By 2002, during the next fisheries assessment, the Northern Pike population was well established.  However, the number of Northern Pike caught has always been below average in Crooked Lake.  In 2014, the Northern Pike gill net catch was below average again with a catch of 1.2 /lift.  Mean weight of 4.2 pounds/fish was well above average; mean weights the past three investigations have consistently been above average.  The largest fish sampled was 31.9 inches and weighed 7 pounds with 45% of the catch greater than 24 inches.  Northern Pike population is maintained by natural reproduction.  Growth is much faster than average for the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge gill net catch of 0.5/lift was below average and similar to the previous three investigations. Mean weight of 7.7 pounds/fish was well above average and similar to the previous three investigations with the exception of 2010 when one fish sampled that weighed 1.5 pounds. The largest fish sampled was 36.7 inches and weighed 13.2 pounds.  The Muskellunge sampled, in all investigations since the initial stocking in 1977, have rarely reached 35 inches, the largest measured only 39 inches.  This growth pattern is typical of the Shoepack strain Muskellunge that were stocked in Crooked Lake, as the bulk of the adult population never exceed 28 - 30 inches.  The Muskellunge numbers in recent investigations have fallen, possibly from the Northern Pike presence.  Natural reproduction was sufficient in the early management to sustain the Muskellunge population.  However, predation from Northern Pike on juvenile Muskellunge may now be limiting the population.  Recent reproduction appears to be very sporadic.  Crooked Lake is not a designated Muskellunge lake, although statewide regulations for Muskellunge do apply to Crooked Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch of 8.3/lift was slightly above average for Northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics.  Mean weight of 0.2 pounds/fish was slightly above average and similar to the past two investigations.  The largest individual sampled was 10.6 inches.  Twenty percent of the total catch larger was than nine inches.  <br> \n</p>",

Yellow Perch densities are still low but appear to be increasing, maybe the result of Yellow Perch stockings in the 1980's. The Smallmouth Bass gillnet and trapnet catches were both higher than the 1985 assessment with Ages I & II comprising 92% of the catch. The White Sucker catch of 22/gillnet lift was a significant increase over past assessments.</p>",

Quarter inch mesh trapnetting shows fingerling numbers only in years when the lake is fry stocked. Walleyes will be stocked at the rate of 1,000 fry per acre. Fry stocking will be done until it is determined to be successful or a failure. If the fry stocking proves not to be successful fingerling plants will be made. Plants will be made on a yearly basis until a productive rotation can be established.     Muskellunge plants have been very successful with two strong year classes established. Stomach samples of net caught Muskellunge show that they are feeding heavily on Smallmouth Bass. Muskellunge in Dumbbell Lake have reduced the Smallmouth Bass population to a level where large bass are again being taken and stunting is not occuring. Muskellunge will be stocked at a rate of one yearling fish per 2 littoral acres.     A large plant of adult perch will be tried to increase the perch population of the lake. The present population is so low that virtually no recruitment occurs. The fish will come from a perch removal project in the International Falls Management Area. A one time plant of approximately 8,000 perch is anticipated.     Crooked Lake will eventually be added to the designated muskie lake list.</p>",

In light of this, Walleye gillnet catches of 12/lift seem to indicate Walleyes are abundant at this time. Walleye natural reproduction is occurring however historical data has shown that in most years stronger year classes are associated with stocked years. Age I and III walleyes correspond with stocked years and comprised nearly 1/2 of the sample. Average size of Walleyes has remained consistant over the past 3 assessments at about 12.5\".     Muskellunge are naturally maintaining a sizeable population as all of the Muskellunge sampled during the assessment were from natural reproduction. Muskellunge are exhibiting good growth and some eventually may exceed size expectations of the Shoepac strain.     Yellow Perch have never been abundant and still are not despite numerous stockings of large numbers of adults.      Smallmouth Bass historically have had a tendency to exhibit slight fluctuations in trapnet catches. The 1992 assessment continued to show this as trapnet catches declined to 0.7/lift. It is suspected that predation by Muskellunge is contributing to Smallmouth Bass densities that are below historic levels.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2002 assessment in Crooked Lake sampled walleye in above average numbers for the lake class.  The fish ranged from 8.3 inches to 21.5 inches (3.5 pounds) and averaged about 1 pound.  Approximately 28% of the walleye captured were between 16 inches and 18 inches.  Crooked Lake is managed primarily for walleye and is stocked with walleye fingerlings on a regular basis.  Stocked year classes accounted for at least 70% of the walleye catch in 2002.Muskellunge were introduced into Crooked Lake in the late 1970's and were stocked until 1982.  The population is now maintained through natural reproduction and this assessment indicates that low to moderate numbers of muskellunge are present.  The muskellunge in Crooked Lake are the Shoepack strain, which are not known for attaining trophy size, as the Leech Lake strain does.  The largest muskie collected in this assessment was 31.5 inches; however, past assessments have captured muskies up to 39 inches and there have been reports of a 40 inch fish taken.  Fish of this size are rare in this lake.  Crooked Lake is not a designated muskellunge lake; however, the minimum legal size for possession (40 inches) still applies.Smallmouth bass were sampled in above average numbers compared to other lakes in this class; however, the size of the fish in the sample was below average.  Smallmouth bass up to 17.9 inches (3.0 pounds) were collected; however, 94% of the fish sampled were smaller than 12 inches.  The small size of the smallmouth bass captured during this assessment is typical of the sizes collected in the past assessments on this lake.Northern pike were captured for the first time during this assessment.  Low numbers of northern pike were collected, and it remains to be seen how well established the population may become.  A 34 inch (7.5 pounds) northern pike was collected in this assessment; however, all the other northern pike were relatively small, ranging from 19.9 inches to 20.5 inches (1.8 pounds).Yellow perch were sampled in average numbers for this lake class.  The largest yellow perch sampled was 11.8 inches; however, fish of this size were rare in this assessment.  A number of yellow perch between 9 inches and 10 inches were captured, but most of the fish in the sample were too small to interest most anglers.</p>",
