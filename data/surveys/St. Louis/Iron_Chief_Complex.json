                "narrative": "<p>Iron Chief Complex is a series of three abandoned mine pits (now connected) near the town of Buhl.  Like most pit lakes, the water is relatively infertile and clear.  Rainy and windy weather occasionally loosens sediment from the pit walls causing the water to cloud up temporarily.  There is a city-owned public access on the south side of the lake.  DNR Fisheries has done no stocking or management of the lake, and the 2008 assessment was the first ever conducted on the pit. <br> \n <br> \nVery few fish were captured in the test nets.  Green sunfish was the most numerous species in the standard assessment gears, at 1.2/gill net and 1.2/trap net.  These fish were rather small, ranging from 3.7 to 5.6 inches in length.  Four rainbow smelt were also captured in the gill nets for a catch rate of 0.7/net. <br> \n <br> \nTwo small-mesh gill nets specifically designed to sample small fish such as rainbow smelt were also used in this assessment.  A total of 32 smelt were captured for a catch rate of 16/net.  These fish ranged from 4.6 to 6.3 inches in length.     <br> \n <br> \nOne northern pike (28.4 inches) was captured in a trap net.  This was the only large predator fish sampled.  Other fish sampled in low numbers were black bullhead, black crappie, blacknose shiner, bluegill and white sucker.  Good water quality characteristics and the presence of a modest population of rainbow smelt appear to make Iron Chief Complex suitable for a cold-water species such as lake trout. <br> \n</p>",
