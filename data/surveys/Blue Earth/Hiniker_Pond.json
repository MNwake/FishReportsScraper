FIFTY POUNDS OF FINGERLINGS WERE STOCKED IN THE FALL 1990, AND 40 ADULT FISH WERE STOCKED IN SPRING 1991.  IMPROVED GROWTH OF BLG AND CRAPPIE MAY BE DUE TO THE WAE STOCKING.  THE BLC TRAP NET CATCH DECREASED FROM 22.33/NET IN 1990 TO 2.50/NET.  AGES 1 AND 2 WERE REPRESENTED, A CHANGE FROM 1990, WHEN FISH AGES 1-5 WERE SAMPLED.  CRAPPIE AVERAGE 6.7 INCHES AT AGE 2, MUCH LARGER THAN THE 1990 AGE 2 LENGTH OF 3.7 1991, WITH RESPECTIVE CATCHES OF 34.67/TRAP NET AND 37.25/TRAP NET.  THE CATCH WAS COMPOSED OF 2 AND 3 YEAR OLD FISH, WITH 2 YEAR OLDS DOMINATING. THE AGE 3 FISH THAT DOMINATED THE 1990 SURVEY DID NOT APPEAR IN THE SAMPLE.  THE 5.9 INCH LENGTH AT AGE 3 WAS BOTH LARGER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE OF 4.9 INCHES AND THE 1990 AGE 3 LENGTH OF 4.3 INCHES.  THREE YEARLING LMB WERE SAMPLED AND ARE GROWING AT AN AVERAGE RATE.  ONE YEP AND ONE GSF WERE NETTED.  SAND SHINERS WERE ABUNDANT IN SHORE- LINE SEINING COMPARED TO MODERATE NUMBERS OF SAND SHINER AND SPOTTAIL SHINER CAPTURED IN 1990.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hiniker Pond (18 acres) is a former gravel pit located in Blue Earth County in the city of North Mankato. The pond was converted from a gravel pit to a city park that provides urban recreational activities for Mankato residents. The city park is located on the south side of the pond and provides access for the public. Hiniker pond is relatively deep in relation to its surface area, having a maximum depth of 24.0 ft. The game fish community consists of northern pike, bluegills, and yellow perch. Hiniker Pond was stocked regularly with walleye fingerlings, yearlings, and adults (2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010), with adult northern pike (2003, 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009), and with adult bluegills (2007 and 2008). A lake population assessment was conducted the week of 6-13-2012 to monitor the fish community of Hiniker Pond using 1 gill net and 4 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe water in Hiniker Pond was clear and had a secchi depth reading of 8.5 ft. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 11.8 ppm at 11.0 ft to 0.1 ppm at 20.0 ft. Thermal stratification of the water column occurred between 12 and 13 ft of depth as evidenced by a drop in temperature from 68.5 to 66.9 degrees Fahrenheit. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured at a rate of 7.0/gill net, well above historic catch rates for this water body. Length of northern pike ranged from 23.7 to 31.0 inches and averaged 27.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch rates have been highly variable over the last several surveys ranging from 0.0/gill net in 2007 to 35.0/gill net in 1984. In 2012, yellow perch were captured at a rate of 10.0/gill net. Yellow perch ranged in size from 5.6 to 8.2 inches and averaged 6.4 inches. The perch population is likely the main prey base for the northern pike in this system.  <br> \n <br> \nHistoric catch rates of bluegills have hovered around the 20.0 to 30.0/trap net in the last two decades. The 2012 catch rate of bluegills was 19.0/trap net, which is similar to historic catches. The bluegills ranged from 3.2 to 7.7 inches in length and averaged 6.0 inches, with 85% being greater than 5.5 inches long. This is similar to the 2007 assessment where the majority of the bluegills were between 6.0 and 7.5 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking appears to be unsuccessful, as no walleye were sampled in either the 2007 or 2012 survey despite stocking efforts. Black crappie, gizzard shad, orangespotted sunfish, quillback, freshwater drum, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, and white crappies were sampled, but in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

FIFTY POUNDS OF FINGERLINGS WERE STOCKED IN THE FALL OF 1990 AND 40 ADULT WAE WERE STOCKED THE SPRING OF 1991 AND 1992.  THOUGH IT WOULD SEEM LIKELY THAT STOCKING 6.0 LB/A OF WAE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS WOULD IMPACT THE PANFISH COMMUNITY, THE IMPACT REMAINS UNCLEAR.  BOTH THE CONTINUED LOW ABUNDANCE OF BLC AND THE SHIFT OF THE BLG POPULATION TO MORE AND YOUNGER FISH MAY BE RESPONSES TO INCREASED PREDATION.  HOWEVER, THE LOW WAE NET CATCH (1.0/ NET) OVER THE PAST FOUR SURVEYS, AND THE HIGH ABUNDANCE OF YEP AND SHINERS SUGGEST A LOW WAE POPULATION - ONE NOT LIKELY TO BE EXERTING PREDATORY PRESSURE ON THE BLG AND CRAPPIE.  TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT (IF ANY) OF WAE STOCKING, MORE TIME AND EVALUATION ARE NEEDED.  BLGS HAVE SHOWN THE MOST CHANGE IN ABUNDANCE, INCREASING FROM 37.25/TRAP NET IN 1991TO 101.00/TRAP NET. BLG WERE DOMINATED BY 2 YEAR OLDS, COMPARED TO THE DOMINANT 1 YEAR OLDS NOW PRESENT.  GROWTH CONTINUES TO BE FAST THROUGH AGE 3 AND THEN LEVELS OFF.  BLG AVERAGE 6.2 INCHES AT AGE 3 COMPARED TO THE STATE AVERAGE OF 4.9 INCHES.  BLG TEND TO DISAPPEAR AFTER AGE 3.  THE LARGE COHORT OF 3 YEAR OLDS SAMPLED IN 1990 WERE NOT SAMPLED IN 1991. ONLY TWO 4 YEAR OLDS HAVE BEEN NETTED IN THE PAST 2 YEARS.  BLC REMAIN IN LOW ABUNDANCE, AVERAGING 5.33/TRAP NET COMPARED TO 25.33 AND 2.50/TRAP NET IN 1990 AND 1991, RESPECTIVELY.  CRAPPIE ARE REPRESENTED BY Y-O-Y THROUGH 4 YEAR OLDS COMPARED TO THE 1 AND 2 YEAR OLDS NETTED IN 1991.  CRAPPIE GROWTH CONTINUES TO BE GOOD COMPARED TO THE SLOW GROWTH NOTED IN 1990, WHEN FISH AVERAGED 3.7 INCHES AT AGE 2.  BLC NOW AVERAGE 5.7 INCHES AT AGE 2 COMPARED TO 6.7 INCHES IN 1991.  WHB AVERAGED 11.00/GILL NET AND WERE 12.0-14.9 INCHES IN LENGTH.  WHB ARE REPRESENTED BY AGES 3-5, WITH AGES 4 AND 5 MOST ABUNDANT.  WHB WERE NOT SAMPLED IN TRAP NETS IN 1991.  YEP AVERAGED 20.00/GILL NET COMPARED TO ONE SAMPLED IN TRAP NETS IN 1991.  YEP AVERAGED 13.00/GILL NET IN 1990 AND WERE DOMINATED BY A SINGLE COHORT OF 2 YEAR OLDS, COMPARED TO THE 2 AND 3 YEAR OLD NOW PRESENT.  GIS WERE NOT SAMPLED IN TRAP NETS IN 1991 BUT NOW AVERAGE 36.00/GILL NET, COMPARED TO 5.50/GILL NET IN 1990. SHAD ARE DOMINATED BY SMALL FISH, 9.5-10.9 INCHES. WAE REMAIN IN LOW ABUNDANCE WITH ONLY ONE FISH NETTED, COMPARED TO NONE SAMPLED IN 1991, 1990, AND 1 SAMPLED IN 1988.  SPO AND SDS IN SHORELINE SEINING.

NORTHERNS SAMPLED WERE SMALL AND BOTH WERE 2 YEAR OLDS. WHITE BASS WERE RELATIVELY ABUNDANT AVERAGING 11.50/GILL NET. WHITE BASS SAMPLED WERE REPRESEN- TED BY AGES 1-6 WITH AGES 2 AND 4 MOST NUMEROUS. THE WHITE BASS SAMPLED HAD A GOOD SIZE DISTRIBU- TION WITH HALF THE FISH 10.0-14.9 INCHES IN LENGTH PANFISH NUMBERS WERE QUITE LOW, WHICH MAY BE PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE DIFFICULTY IN MAKING GOOD TRAP NET SETS; DUE TO LOW WATER CONDITIONS NETS WERE SET ON A STEEP INCLINE. ONLY 4 BLUEGILLS WERE CAPTURED COMPARED TO 17.50/TRAP NET SAMPLED IN 1984 NETTING. THE BLACK CRAPPIE CATCH RATE REMAINS LOW WITH ONLY ONE FISH CAPTURED COMPARED TO 5 SAMPLED IN 1984. WHITE CRAPPIES WERE NOT SAMPLED IN 1988 AND ONLY 1 WAS SAMPLED IN 1984. ONE LARGE WALLEYE WAS SAMPLED AND CORRESPONDS WITH THE STOCKING OF 1979 YEAR CLASS FISH IN 1982. YELLOW PERCH CATCH RATES HAVE SHOWN A LARGE DE- CLINE FROM 35.00/GILL NET IN 1984 TO 1.50/GILL NET IN 1988. YELLOW PERCH IN 1984 WERE DOMINATED BY A STRONG AGE CLASS COMPARED TO AGES 2 AND 3 PRESENT IN 1988. THE DECLINE IN PERCH NUMBERS MAY REFLECT THE INCREASED PREDATION LEVEL FROM ANNUAL STOCKING OF PIKE. TWO SMALL LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE SAMPLED AND INDI- CATE SUCCESSFUL REPRODUCTION OF BASS SINCE THEIR INTRODUCTION IN 1981. QUILLBACK AVERAGED 5.50/ GILL NET COMPARED TO NONE SAMPLED IN 1984 AND 2.50/GILL NET IN 1981. GIZZARD SHAD WERE ABUNDANT, AVERAGING 10.00/GILL NET COMPARED TO 3.00/GILL NET IN 1983 AND 2.50/ GILL NET IN 1981. OBSERVERS REPORTED SEEING SCHOOLS OF SMALL SHAD SWIMMING NEAR THE SURFACE. THE SHAD NETTED WERE DOMINATED BY 4 YEAR OLDS, WITH MANY 13.0-15.0 INCHES IN LENGTH.</p>",

Other species present in low abundance include black crappie, white crappie, northern pike, walleye, yellow perch and carp.  A gizzard shad mortality event, perhaps related to rapid temperature changes, was observed by staff in the April 2007.  No shad were observed in the survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hiniker Pond is an 18-acre lake within the city of Mankato. Hiniker Pond has a maximum depth of 21 feet with approximately 66% of the lake classified as littoral area. Hiniker Pond was excavated in the 1940s and has been under private and municipal ownership since. The pond is located within a city park which includes a walking path around the lake, a swimming beach, and a fishing pier. There is no public boat access although small craft may be carried to the lake. Hiniker Pond is connected to an oxbow lake and the Minnesota River during high water. Hiniker Pond is primarily managed as a Kid's Fishing Pond and is stocked with Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, crappies, and Northern Pike on an as-needed basis. Hiniker Pond also contains riverine species such as Gizzard Shad and Shortnose Gar due to its periodic connection to the Minnesota River. Hiniker Pond was stocked with Rainbow Trout in January 2024 to provide an additional angling opportunity in southern Minnesota. If successful, the stocking will become annual. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed the week of 30 June 2023 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 2 gill nets and 6 trap nets. Water quality parameters were also recorded. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled very few fish. Three each of Northern Pike, Shortnose Gar, and Walleye were sampled with gill nets. Additionally, two Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nThirty-three Black Crappies (5.5/trap net) were sampled with trap nets. Black Crappie ranged from 4.1 inches to 11.7 inches and averaged 8.0 inches. Black Crappie were aged using otoliths. Seven year-classes (age-1 through age-7) were present. Black Crappie reached 9 inches in length by their 4th year. <br> \n <br> \nThirty Bluegill were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 5.0/trap net. Bluegill ranged from 3.9 inches to 7.2 inches and averaged 5.6 inches. Bluegill were aged using otoliths. Bluegills age-2 through age-5 were present with 83% being age-3 or age-4. Bluegill growth was similar to other area lakes with fish reaching 6 inches by their 4th year. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in trap nets but in low numbers included Common Carp, Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), hybrid Sunfish, Shortnose Gar, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nWater temperature ranged from 76.6 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 68.2 degrees Fahrenheit at 10 feet. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 9.3 ppm at the surface to 0.2 ppm at 10 feet. A thermocline was detected between 7 and 8 feet deep. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor <br> \n</p>",
