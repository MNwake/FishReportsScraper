IBI data was collected in conjunction with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency watershed sampling. Fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lakeshore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.  Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Twenty fish species were represented, including young of the year gamefish such as Walleye, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass. Non-game species sampled included Bluntnose Minnow, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, and Spottail Shiner.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Franklin Lake is a 1,336-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately ten miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN. The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots. The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 56% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. There is a shallow, un-navigable outlet along the south shoreline that flows into Crystal Lake. The secchi disk reading during the 2020 survey was 14.5 feet. Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 5.1 to 13.0 feet. <br> \n     Residential development is scattered around the entire shoreline of the lake. The development consists primarily of homes and cottages. DNR owned public water accesses are located on the east and north shorelines. There are stands of Hardstem Bulrush, Common Cattail, and other emergent plants scattered around the lake. Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals. Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish. They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish. Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  <br> \n     Franklin Lake can be ecologically classified as a Walleye-Centrarchid type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community. Northern Pike, Walleye, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present in the fish community. The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n    The 2020 standard survey documented a moderate Walleye abundance. Walleyes ranged in length from 7.8 to 18.9 inches with an average length and weight of 13.3 inches and 0.8 pounds. Walleye attain an average length of 15.6 inches at four years of age. <br> \n    A high-density Northern Pike population exists. Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good. Northern Pike size structure remains poor with twenty-seven percent of the pike within the 22.0 to 26.0-inch protected slot limit while only one pike exceeded 26.0 inches. Pike ranged in length from 13.0 to 27.1 inches with an average length and weight of 19.8 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 20.7 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     A special regulation for Black Crappie was implemented in 2006.  It is a 10-inch minimum length limit and a reduced possession limit of five. The intent of the regulation is to maintain or improve the size structure of the Black Crappie population. A spring trapnetting survey was scheduled to analyze the Black Crappie population but was postponed due to Covid-19 implications.  It is rescheduled for the spring of 2021.      <br> \n     Bluegill abundance remains moderate to high but size structure fluctuates due inconsistent reproduction. In this survey, the 2018, 2017, and 2016 year classes dominated the trap net catch.  As a result, only nineteen percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length. Bluegills attain an average length of 6.8 inches at six years of age.      <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare. Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n      Franklin Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2016. Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters. Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations. Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.       <br> \n</p>",

Supplemental walleye fry stocking along with natural reproduction produces year classes of equivalent strength as compared to fingerling stocking and natural reproduction. <br> \n     The yellow perch gill net catch rate has declined from 39.0 per net in the 1972 survey to 7.1 per net in this survey.  <br> \n     The northern pike gill net catch rate has increased from 5.8 per net in 1972 to 10.0 per net in this survey.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance appears to have increased and the individual average weight has declined. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Franklin Lake is a 1,336-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately ten miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN. The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots. The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 56% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. There is a shallow, un-navigable outlet along the south shoreline that flows into Crystal Lake.  Historical secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.1 to 14.5 feet. <br> \n     Residential development is scattered around the entire shoreline of the lake. The development consists primarily of homes and cottages. DNR owned public water accesses are located on the east and north shorelines. Shoal water substrates in the main lake basin consist primarily of sand and gravel with muck being the prevalent substrate in the three western bays.  Stands of Hardstem Bulrush, Common Cattail, and other emergent plants are scattered throughout the lake. Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals. Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish. They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish. Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  <br> \n     A 10.0-inch minimum length limit for Black Crappie, along with a reduced possession limit of five was implemented in 2006 to maintain the size structure of the Black Crappie population. Catch and length data from ensuing special spring surveys indicate that the regulation has been successful in maintaining a high quality Black Crappie population.  In this survey, Black Crappies ranged in length from 5.3 to 12.4 inches with an average length of 11.1 inches.  Eighty-eight percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that Black Crappie reproduction is consistently good.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare. Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n     Franklin Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2016. Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters. Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations. Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Franklin Lake is located about 10 miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, in northwestern Otter Tail County.  There is a gravel public access on the northeastern shore of the lake off of county road 31, and a concrete access off of the township road on the north side of the lake.  Franklin Lake is 1336 acres in size, although 56% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  There is a shallow, unnavigable outlet that flows into Crystal Lake, which is immediately to the south.  The secchi depth was 10 feet during the most recent survey, indicating good water quality.  Landowners on the lake can protect water quality in the lake by properly maintaining septic systems, using fertilizers that do not contain phosphorous, and maintaining a buffer of vegetation along the shore.     There are remnant stands of hardstem bulrush and other emergent plants in shallow areas of the lake that serve as important spawning and nursery areas for fish, and so are protected by law.  A DNR permit is required before any emergent aquatic plants are removed, although limited amounts of submerged or floating leaf vegetation may be removed by landowners to allow for swimming or a boat dock.  Check with DNR Fisheries before undertaking any aquatic vegetation removal to learn about specific regulations.     Franklin Lake supports a diverse fishery.  There are good numbers of walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie, and moderate numbers of largemouth bass and yellow perch.  There are also several non-game species found in the lake.  Walleye is the only specie that is stocked in the lake.     Walleye catch rates during the 1999 survey were the highest they have been since 1972, averaging 13.8 per gill net.  This is well above the statewide median for this lake type (3.0), and the previous survey in 1995 (8.6).  Walleye averaged 13.3 inches and 0.8 lbs., and 18% were over 15 inches.  The 1997 year class dominated, comprising 61% of the catch.  The 1995 and 1996 year classes are moderately strong.  Walleye fry are stocked every other year at a rate of 1,000 per littoral acre, or 749,000 fish.  Good numbers from 1996, a year in which no stocking occurred, indicate that natural reproduction is contributing to the population.  However, the strongest year classes have generally corresponded to stocked years such as 1995 and 1997, indicating that stocking is supplementing natural reproduction.  Walleye averaged 12.9 inches at age 3, which is typical for this lake type.     Northern pike averaged 8.9 per gill net, which is above the expected range, but below the previous survey (13.3).  Pike averaged 17.7 inches, and 7% were above 24 inches.  The largest was 34.8 inches.  Reproduction seems consistent, as 8 consecutive year classes were sampled.  The 1996 year class comprised 53% of the catch.  Pike averaged 17.2 inches at age 4, while the area average for lakes of this type is 20.6 inches at age 4.     Spring electrofishing for largemouth bass had a catch rate of 17.97 per hour, down from 25.8 per hour in the previous survey.  Bass averaged 8.2 inches, and 25% were over 10 inches.  Catch rates for larger fish were higher in the previous survey.     Yellow perch averaged 5.1 per gill net, which is within the expected range for this type of lake.  The previous survey averaged 4.6 per gill net.  Perch averaged 7.2 inches, and 27% were over 8 inches.  No perch exceeded 9 inches.     Bluegill averaged 28.8 per trap net, while the previous survey averaged 41.0.  Both are within the normal range for this lake type.  The average size was 6.3 inches, and 34% were above 7 inches.  The 1995 year class dominated, comprising 44% of the catch.  Bluegill reached 6.4 inches at age 6, which is near the area average for this lake type.     Spring trap netting for black crappie yielded 5.4 per trap net, indicating that good numbers of fish are present.  The average size was 10.2 inches, and 84% were above 10 inches.  Crappie reach 8.7 inches at age 4, which is typical of this lake type.     Tullibee averaged 1.8 per gill net, which is within the expected range for this type of lake.  The previous survey averaged 3.3 per gill net.  The average size for the most recent survey was 16.1 inches and 2.4 lbs.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Franklin Lake is a 1,336-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately ten miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 56% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  There is a shallow, un-navigable outlet along the south shoreline that flows into Crystal Lake.  The secchi disk reading during the 2012 survey was 5.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.8 to 13.0 feet. <br> \n     Residential development is scattered around the entire shoreline of the lake.  The development consists primarily of homes and cottages.  DNR owned public water accesses are located on the east and north shorelines.  There are stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and other emergent plants scattered around the lake. Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  <br> \n     Franklin Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, walleye, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n    Historically, walleye abundance has fluctuated.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.8 to 25.6 inches with an average length and weight of 15.2 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 16.0 inches at five years of age. <br> \n    A high-density northern pike population exists.  Northern pike have historically been very abundant.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike size structure has consistently been poor.  Pike ranged in length from 12.6 to 28.0 inches with an average length and weight of 18.5 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 20.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that black crappies are abundant and that size structure is good.  Ninety-six percent of the black crappies were at least 10.0 inches in length.  The 2005 year class is strong and should provide good crappie angling for several years.  Black crappies attain an average length of 10.2 inches at five years of age.  A harvest regulation for black crappie was implemented on Franklin Lake in 2006.  The regulation is a 10.0-inch minimum length limit with a reduced possession limit of five.  The regulation is in effect until 2016.  The intent of the regulation is to maintain or improve the size structure of the black crappie population. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance is high and size structure is also good.  Twenty percent of the blugills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.5 inches at six years of age.      <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.       <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Franklin Lake is a 1,336-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately ten miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots. The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 56% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  There is a shallow, un-navigable outlet along the south shoreline that flows into Crystal Lake.  Historical secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.1 to 14.5 feet. <br> \n     Residential development is scattered around the entire shoreline of the lake. The development consists primarily of homes and cottages.  DNR owned public water accesses are located on the east and north shorelines.  There are stands of Hardstem Bulrush, Common Cattail, and other emergent plants scattered around the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  <br> \n     A reduced daily bag limit regulation for sunfish (5 per day) was implemented in 2021.  The objective of the regulation is to improve and maintain the quality of the Bluegill size structure.  A special spring trapnetting survey was conducted to collect baseline data on the Bluegill population, which will be used for regulation evaluation purposes in future surveys.  The Bluegill population is abundant with a moderate quality size structure.  Sixty-three percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length, while 20% was 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.9 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n      Franklin Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2016.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Franklin Lake is a 1,336-acre mesotrophic lake located approximately ten miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN in northwestern Otter Tail County.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots.  Maximum depth is 48 feet; although, 56% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  There is a shallow, unnavigable outlet along the south shoreline that flows into Crystal Lake.  The secchi disk reading was 11.0 feet during the 2003 lake survey, indicating good water clarity.  Lakeshore owners can protect water quality in the lake by properly maintaining septic systems, using fertilizers that do not contain phosphorous, and maintaining a buffer of vegetation along the shoreline.  Franklin Lake is included in lake class 25 of the MNDNR lake classification scheme.     Residential development is scattered around the entire shoreline of the lake.  The development consists primarily of homes, cottages, and resorts.  DNR owned public water accesses are located on the east and north shorelines.  There are stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and other emergent plants scattered around the lake. Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.      Franklin Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.      The walleye test-net catch rate was slightly below the upper limit of the normal range for class 25 lakes.  Historically, walleye abundance has fluctuated.  Walleye ranged in length from 11.0 to 25.9 inches with an average length and weight of 17.3 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.2 inches at four years of age.    Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that natural reproduction can be substantial in some years; however, it does not occur consistently.  To supplement the population produced by natural reproduction, the DNR stocks walleye fry on a biennial basis.  In an attempt to increase walleye abundance, the standard stocking rate of 749,000 fry will be doubled in 2004 to 1,498,000 fry.  This stocking regime and natural reproduction will be evaluated over the future series of lake surveys to determine if the walleye test-net catch rate can be increased to management goals.    The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye in Franklin Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the excellent water quality and fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the water quality and fish habitat.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.          </p>",

                "narrative": "<p> Franklin Lake is a 1,336-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located approximately ten miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN in northwestern Otter Tail County.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 56% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  There is a shallow, unnavigable outlet along the south shoreline that flows into Crystal Lake.  The secchi disk reading during the 2007 survey was 6.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 9.5 to 13.0 feet. <br> \n     Residential development is scattered around the entire shoreline of the lake.  The development consists primarily of homes and cottages.  DNR owned public water accesses are located on the east and north shorelines.  There are stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and other emergent plants scattered around the lake. Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  <br> \n     Franklin Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, walleye, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n    Historically, walleye abundance has fluctuated.  Walleye ranged in length from 11.0 to 25.9 inches with an average length and weight of 17.3 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.2 inches at four years of age. <br> \n    Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that natural reproduction can be substantial in some years; however, it does not occur consistently.  To supplement the population produced by natural reproduction, the DNR stocks walleye fry on a biennial basis.  In an attempt to increase walleye abundance, the standard stocking rate of 749,000 fry was doubled in 2004 to 1,498,000 fry.  This stocking regime and natural reproduction will be evaluated over the future series of lake surveys to determine if the walleye test-net catch rate can be increased to management goals. <br> \n     A high-density northern pike population exists.  Northern pike have historically been very abundant.  Age data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike size structure has consistently been poor.  Pike ranged in length from 13.2 to 27.7 inches with an average length and weight of 18.7 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Northern pike growth is moderate; pike attain an average length of 20.9 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that black crappie are abundant and that size structure is good.  Seventy-two percent of the black crappies were at least 10.0 inches in length.  The 2002 year class is strong and should provide good crappie angling for several years.  Black crappie attain an average length of 10.4 inches at five years of age.  A harvest regulation for black crappie was implemented on Franklin Lake.  The regulation  is a 10.0-inch minimum size limit with a possession limit of five.  The intent of the regulation is to maintain or improve the size structure of the black crappie population. <br> \n     Test-netting catch data indicate that bluegill are abundant and that size structure is also good.  Forty-two percent of the blugills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills reach an average length of 6.3 inches at six years of age.      <br> \n    The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye in Franklin Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the excellent water quality and fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the water quality and fish habitat. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.       <br> \n  <br> \n     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Franklin Lake is a 1,336-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately ten miles northeast of Pelican Rapids, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 56% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  There is a shallow, un-navigable outlet along the south shoreline that flows into Crystal Lake.  The secchi disk reading was 5.7 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 5.1 to 13.0 feet. <br> \n     Residential development is scattered around the entire shoreline of the lake.  The development consists primarily of homes and cottages.  DNR owned public water accesses are located on the east and north shorelines.  There are stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and other emergent plants scattered around the lake. Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  <br> \n     Franklin Lake can be ecologically classified as a Walleye-Centrarchid type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Walleye, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n    Walleye abundance is moderately high. Walleyes ranged in length from 7.8 to 18.9 inches with an average length of 13.2 inches. Walleyes attain an average length of 16.4 inches at five years of age. <br> \n    A high-density Northern Pike population exists. Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike size structure remains poor with only 3% of the pike measuring 24.0 inches or greater in length.  Pike ranged in length from 11.9 to 27.2 inches with an average length and weight of 18.8 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 22.4 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that Black Crappies are abundant and that the size structure is good.  Ninety-seven percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  The 2011 year class is strong and should provide good crappie angling for several years.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 11.0 inches at five years of age.  A special regulation for Black Crappie was implemented in 2006.  It is a 10-inch minimum length limit with a reduced possession limit of five.  The intent of the regulation is to maintain or improve the size structure of the Black Crappie population. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance is high and size structure is also good.  Thirty-nine percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.7 inches at six years of age.      <br> \n    Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.          <br> \n</p>",
