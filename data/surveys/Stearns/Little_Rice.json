Seventy-eight percent of the sample was 3, 4 and 5 year old fish, 15 to 26 inches in length. The Bluegill population is abundant, well above the local median of 26.6/ trap net. Ages 1 through 7 were sampled; growth is good. Yearling fish made up 84% of the sample. No 3 or 6 year old fish were sampled. Largemouth Bass abundance appears high at 1.8 per trap net ages 2 and 3 were sampled. Growth is good. Black Crappie abundance is average. Ages one through four were sampled; growth is good. Pumpkinseed were abundant but small. The Yellow Perch population is also average and along with an average abundance of Golden Shiners provide some forage for game fish. Rough fish abundance varies with species from scarce to average to high. Common Carp were observed but none were captured. The Black Bullhead population is high, 16 times the local median of 5.7/trap net. The sample was comprised of 4.5 to 4.9 inch fish and 7.0 to 8.5 inch fish.</p>",
