                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted on March 22, 2017 to assess the fish community of Caron Lake. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Results from this targeted survey should not be compared to results from standard surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey consisted of six trap nets (3/4 inch, single-frame) that were set for 24 hours. Ice was accumulated near the access and snow was still visible along portions of the shoreline. Due to shallow water, most nets were set about 20 ft from the shoreline. The southwest corner of the lake, near the outlet, was especially shallow with a very soft, muddy bottom. The benthic substrate near the inlet by the access was firm; sandy in places. Besides cattails, no vegetation was observed.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates were very high, as most nets were too heavy to be lifted into the boat. Common Carp were the most abundant species, with a catch rate of 629.0 fish/trap net. All Common Carp were small, averaging only 6.0 inches. Black Bullhead were also very abundant (619.4 fish/trap net). The average length of Black Bullheads was 4.1 inches. Black Crappie were the third most abundant, with a catch rate of 362.4 fish/trap net. Black Crappie were also small, with an average length of 6.7 inches. Bluegills were sampled at a rate of 98.0 fish/trap net and averaged 5.6 inches. Yellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 31.8 fish/trap net and averaged 4.7 inches. A few of the Yellow Perch were large, gravid females, measuring up to 11.1 inches. Largemouth Bass (3.8 fish/trap net) averaged 10.0 inches. A total of 7 Northern Pike (1.4 fish/trap net) averaged 14.0 inches. All of the Northern Pike were young, ripe males. Other fish species sampled in the trap nets included Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Bigmouth Buffalo, Tadpole Madtom, and Hybrid Sunfish.  <br> \n <br> \nCaron Lake appears to be serving as a nursery for young fish populations. We suspect that young fish may stage in Caron Lake until sexual maturity, then swim up- or down-stream into Devil Creek. There is direct connectivity with Cedar Lake and the Cannon River, which may pose a problem considering the number of Common Carp and Black Bullhead that Caron Lake appears to produce. A watershed project involving strategic fish barriers should be considered. Caron Lake is managed for Northern Pike, but the last stocking event on record was Walleye fry in 2010. <br> \n <br> \n-Kip Rounds, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

The shallow access is located at the end of an unimproved, often rough access road.  A fishery survey was conducted in August 2003 to monitor the fish community and aquatic habitat.   Black crappie, black bullhead, common carp, bluegill, yellow perch, and white crappie are common in Caron Lake.  Caron Lake likely often experiences winterkill.  However, fish can recolonize from Cedar Lake which outlets though Caron Lake.  </p>",
