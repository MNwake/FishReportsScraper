                "narrative": "<p>North Twin Lake contains 933 acres of which 676 acres (about 72 percent) is shallower than 15 feet.  The maximum depth is near 15 feet with a median depth of 12 feet.  Waters of the lake are hard and contain good growths of muskgrass, coontail, bulrush, Canada waterweed, and various submerged pondweed species.  Shoal water soils appear to be mainly sand and mud with a little gravel and boulder.  There are two inlets and one outlet to the lake, but there is little or no fish migration due to dams or boggy terrain.Comparisons of net catches with regional medians show that a large bluegill population was present.  In addition there were somewhat above average numbers of northern pike, perch, bullheads, largemouth bass, and black crappies.  Populations of tullibees, common suckers, walleyes, pumpkinseeds, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass were below the regional medians of fish abundance.It would seem that the lake receives a goodly amount of fishing pressure as it has one resort, 22 cottages, 42 boats, and a public access.  South Twin Lake which has a considerable number of cottages and boats lies just across the road and undoubtedly contributes to the pressure too.  North Twin Lake on the north and east abuts the Indian community of Nay-tah-waush.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Twin is a 901 acre lake lying within the boundaries of the White Earth Indian Reservation near the town of Nay-Tah-Waush.  North Twin is in lake class 39.  Other nearby lakes in this class are Sargent, Roy, Lone, and Little Vanose.  Class 39 lakes are typically shallow and may be susceptible to an occasional winterkill, although test netting results from the last 40 years have not indicated any serious die-offs in North Twin.  Fish populations in North Twin have fluctuated considerably over this time period, but most of these fluctuations seem to be naturally occurring and not the result of winterkill or stocking efforts.Walleye abundance in North Twin was relatively low in the 1960's and 1970's, increased to record highs in the mid-1980's, and returned to more normal levels in the 1990's.  Most of the increase in walleye numbers during the 1980's was the result of exceptional levels of natural reproduction.  Stockings of walleye fry by the MN DNR have met with limited success.  Walleye frylings were stocked by the White Earth Conservation Department from 1990 through 1994, but these introductions appear to have contributed little to the population.  From 1996-1998, the White Earth Conservation Department stocked larger, fall walleye fingerlings.  The effectiveness of this stocking program has not yet been fully evaluated, but walleye abundance appears to have increased slightly since the 1994 test netting.  Most of the walleyes sampled in the 1999 assessment were less than 5 years of age.  Average length of these fish was 14.3 inches and average weight was 1.13 pounds.Yellow perch abundance has declined since the 1994 assessment but is still slightly above the normal range for similar lakes.  Northern pike abundance has increased since 1994, but is still within the normal range.  Recent high water levels have created good spawning conditions for northern pike.  Most of the pike sampled in 1999 were age 1 or 2, and less than 22 inches in length.Bluegill abundance has declined somewhat, but the average size is good at 7.7 inches and 0.4 pound.  As in previous assessments, black crappies were captured in low numbers.  The average size of crappies remains good though, with most fish over 10 inches in length.  Largemouth bass and pumpkinseeds were captured in above normal numbers, while smallmouth bass and green sunfish were not sampled and are probably rare.  Cisco (tullibee), white sucker, rock bass, hybrid sunfish, and three species of bullhead were also captured in test nets in similar numbers to previous assessments.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Twin is a relatively shallow (16-ft maximum depth), 901-acre, productive lake located in southeast Mahnomen County.  The lake's productivity is evident in the relatively fast growth rates of many of the fish species in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nNaturally reproducing populations of northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, bullhead, white sucker, tullibee, and others are found within this lake.  Although some walleye natural reproduction has been reported, the walleye fishery is generally sustained by stocking.  Walleyes have been regularly stocked by the White Earth Biology Department since 1990.  Although abundance is not high, the average size of walleye is a comparatively large 1.9 pounds.  It is likely that predation and competition from the currently high northern pike population is having a negative impact on walleye abundance. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are encouraged to harvest the abundant smaller pike for eating and release those over 24 inches.  Larger pike tend to help balance the population by feeding on smaller ones. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills have the potential to reach large sizes in North Twin.  While large bluegills (over 8.0 inches) are not common, they can still be found in this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Twin is a relatively shallow (16-ft maximum depth), 901-acre, productive lake located in southeast Mahnomen County.  The lake's productivity is evident in the relatively fast growth rates of many of the fish species in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nNaturally reproducing populations of Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Black Crappie, bullhead, White Sucker, Tullibee, and others are found within this lake.  Although some Walleye natural reproduction has been reported, the Walleye fishery is generally sustained by stocking.  Walleyes have been regularly stocked by the White Earth Natural Resources Department since 1990.  Although abundance is currently low, the average size of Walleye is a comparatively large at 3.6 pounds.  It is likely that predation and competition from the currently high Northern Pike population is having a negative impact on Walleye abundance. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are encouraged to harvest the abundant smaller pike for eating and release those over 24 inches.  Larger pike tend to help balance the population by feeding on smaller ones. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills have the potential to reach large sizes in North Twin.  While large Bluegills (over 8.0 inches) are not common, they can still be found in this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Twin is a relatively shallow (16-ft maximum depth), 901-acre, productive lake located in southeast Mahnomen County.  The lake is located just southwest of the city of Nay-Tah-Waush on the White Earth Indian Reservation.  The recreational fishery today can be described as predominantly Northern Pike, Walleye, Bluegill, and Black Crappie.  Walleye have been stocked into North Twin by the White Earth Natural Resources Department since 1990, however recruitment has been poor in recent years.  Zebra mussels were discovered in the lake in 2019.   <br> \n <br> \nOnce relatively low in numbers, Northern Pike have increased dramatically in North Twin since 1994.  Pike are now abundant in the lake, averaging 21.5 inches.  Pike between 19 and 23 inches dominated the catch, accounting for approximately 64% of the pike sampled in 2019.  Although low in numbers, sizable Walleye can be caught in North Twin.  Walleye sampled measured up to 25.8 inches, with the average Walleye caught measuring 17.9 inches.  It is likely that predation and competition pressures exerted by the abundant Northern Pike population are linked to the low densities of Walleye and Yellow Perch found in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorth Twin sustains a hearty Bluegill population, with sampled fish ranging in length from 3.4 to 10.3 inches and averaging 6.1 inches long.  Modest numbers of Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were collected in survey gears.  Black Crappie had an average length of 9 inches and Largemouth Bass over 16 inches were captured.  Brown and Yellow Bullhead are common in North Twin, many reaching lengths greater than 10 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBecause Northern Pike grow relatively slowly in Minnesota, an over-abundance of small pike has become common in many north central lakes.  Anglers are encouraged to follow the new Northern Pike regulations, and harvest the abundant Northern Pike under 22 inches for consumption. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Twin is a 933 acre lake lying within the boundaries of the White Earth Indian Reservation near Nay-Tah-Waush.  Maximum depth is approximately 15 feet and the lake may be susceptible to a rare winterkill.  However,test netting results during the past 34 years have not indicated any serious winterkill.     Fish populations have fluctuated over the past three decades but fish stocking does not appear to have causedthose fluctuations or to have had much impact.  Walleye abundance is relatively low as it was during the sixtiesand seventies.  Low numbers often means large fish and that is the case with North Twin Lake walleyes.  Theycurrently average over four and a half pounds each.  For reasons not yet understood, natural reproduction ofwalleyes was exceptionally successful during the early and mid-eighties and the population peaked about 1984 withmuch higher-than-normal numbers.  The boom in walleye abundance had a detrimental effect upon it's primary foodsource, yellow perch.     Yellow perch were being eaten by record numbers of walleyes in the mid-eighties and by 1989 perch had beendecimated.  During the past five years, yellow perch have rebounded as walleye abundance has decreased.  Theyellow perch crash in the late eighties may, in turn, have allowed a significant increase in bluegills, whichreached historically high abundance in 1989.     Like the walleye, bluegills have since decreased to more \"normal\" numbers.  Some large ones are present, butsix inchers dominate the catch.  Large crappies also exist but are not numerous.  Sampled crappies averaged nearlya pound in weight.  Largemouth bass, cisco (tullibee), white sucker, three species of bullhead, rock bass, andthree other species of sunfish were also captured in test nets.  Smallmouth bass have not been caught in test netssince 1984 but were rare before that; only two have been sampled in five assessments.     Unlike some of the other fish species in North Twin, northern pike have remained relatively stable since1960.  Pike abundance is considered \"normal\" and natural reproduction appears to be moderately successful mostyears.  Northern pike in the lake average just over three pounds, somewhat larger than in most area lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Twin is a relatively shallow (16 ft maximum depth), 901 acre, productive lake located in southeast Mahnomen County.  The lake's productivity is evident in the relatively fast growth rates of many of the fish species in this lake.Naturally reproducing populations of northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, bullhead, white sucker, tullibee, and others are found within this lake.  Although some walleye natural reproduction has been reported, the walleye fishery is generally sustained by stocking.  Walleyes have been regularly stocked by the White Earth Biology Department since 1990.  Despite this regular stocking, test net catches of walleye decreased to all-time lows in 2004.  Although abundance is down, the average size of walleye is a comparatively large 2.7 pounds.  It is likely that predation and competition from the currently high northern pike population is having a negative impact on the walleye abundance, as well as on yellow perch.Anglers are encouraged to harvest the abundant smaller pike for eating and release those over 24 inches.  Larger pike tend to help balance the population by feeding on smaller ones.Bluegills are also relatively fast growing in this lake and, if they are not harvested too quickly, they have the potential to reach large sizes in North Twin.  While large bluegills (over 8.0 inches) are not common, they can still be found in this lake.</p>",
