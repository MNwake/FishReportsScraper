Northern pike plumpness appears to be improving as the forage base increases.  Tullibee and yellow perch populations drastically declined between 1956 and 1976.  They have now begun to increase in abundance and there appears to be an improvement in yellow perch natural reproduction.  Largemouth bass abundance is above our local median and reproduction is adequate to maintain the population.  Panfish and black crappie abundance has decreased over the years although reproduction appears sufficient to maintain these fish in the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chase Lake is located approximately three miles northeast of Deer River, MN and within the Mississippi River Headwaters watershed.  The 209 acre lake has 68 littoral acres, a 95 foot maximum depth and is moderately developed along the 2.9 mile shoreline.  There is an unimproved access off the township road along the southwest shore, but ownership of the landing is uncertain.  Secchi disk transparency, a standard measure of water clarity, has averaged 20.8 feet over seven surveys and has ranged from 16.0 - 25.5 feet, which is considered very clear. There are no inlets or outlets.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2002 management plan (LMP) lists Northern Pike and Black Crappie as primary species for management and Largemouth Bass and Bluegill as secondary species.  These designations are based on habitat suitability as well as angler interest. The LMP goals were to: 1) maintain Northern Pike abundance in gill nets below 8.7/net, and 2) provide a Black Crappie fishery with the opportunity to catch fish of preferred size (>10 inches) with at least 50% of the fish from the trap net sample >10 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in August 2016 to assess the status and characteristics of the fish community using six gill nets and nine trap nets.   The first night electrofishing survey of Chase Lake was conducted on May 19, 2016 to obtain additional information on the Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie populations.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate remained similar to 2002 at 6.5/gill net, which is within the normal range for lakes with similar habitats and met the management goal.  Northern Pike captured in gill nets ranged in length from 15.5 - 40.0 inches, with a mean length of 22.8 inches.  Size structure was moderate with 13% of the fish from gill nets >28 inches. Chase Lake has the potential to produce large Northern Pike as fish over 28 inches have been sampled in each of the past three assessments. Anglers are encouraged to release Northern Pike over 22 inches to help improve size quality. Analysis of ageing structures identified six consecutive age classes, ages 2 - 7. Growth was near the statewide average for lakes with similar habitats, with a mean length of 21.1 inches at age-5.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were captured at a rate of 2.1/trap net, which is near the upper limit of what would be typical of lakes with similar habitats.  Electrofishing sampled Black Crappie at a rate of 28.3/hr. on-time.  Size structure from electrofishing was good with 63% of the fish >10 inches. The management goal from trap nets was not met, but was exceeded in the electrofishing sample. Black Crappie sampled by electrofishing ranged in length from 9.1 - 12.8 inches, with a mean length of 10.6 inches.  Five consecutive age classes were represented in the sample, ages 4 - 8.  Black Crappie grew to 10.2 inches at age-5, which is near the average for similar lakes.  Spring electrofishing appears to be an efficient method of sampling Black Crappie as 38 were captured electrofishing compared to19 in trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass electrofishing catch rate was 55.8/hr. on-time.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 5.8 - 17.4 inches, with a mean length of 12.8 inches.  Size structure was moderate as only 12% of the fish sampled were > 15 inches.  There were eight consecutive year classes identified in the sample, ages 2 - 9.  Growth rates were similar to the statewide average with a mean length of 12.1 inches at age-5.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap net catch rate was 7.2/net, which is typical for the lake.  The Bluegill trap net catch has ranged from 4.9 - 7.3/net in the previous four surveys. Size structure improved from 2001, but remains moderate as only 4% of the fish were >8 inches.  Eight consecutive age classes were represented in the sample, ages 2 - 9. Bluegill attained an average length of 6.2 inches at age-7, which is considered slow, but near the average for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nChase Lake has a low density Walleye population which is maintained through natural reproduction. Walleye were captured at a rate of 0.5/gill net, which is considered low. The Walleye gill net catch has been below what would be expected in lakes with similar habitats in six of eight surveys. Three Walleye were captured in gill nets ranging in length from 16.8 - 20.6 inches, and averaging 19.0 inches. Two of the Walleye were age-12, while the other was not aged. Walleye have only been stocked twice, in 1985 and 1987.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch rate of 0.2/net was considered low for similar type lakes, and has been low in most surveys since the initial survey in 1955. This decline corresponds to the introduction of Northern Pike in 1956. This one time stocking resulted in the establishment of the Northern Pike population and subsequent declines in prey populations.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Tullibee gill net catch rate has followed the same downward trend as Yellow Perch, and for the same reason.  The Tullibee gill net catch rate of 0.3/net was considered low, and has been low in six of seven surveys since 1955.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and White Sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike are abundant and small in size.  The current catch rate of 13.2/gillnet is the highest on record for Chase Lake.  Northern pike abundance has been above the third quartile in every assessment since 1976.  The initial survey in 1955 indicated that northern pike were not present in the lake.  A single stocking of 182 northern pike fingerlings in 1956 appears to have resulted in a self-sustaining and abundant population.Yellow perch, tullibee, laregmouth bass, black crappie and bluegill populations all declined sharply following the introduction of northern pike.  The 1955 survey indicated that these species were all fairly abundant.  Net catches for these species have remained below their respective first quartiles since the 1976 assessment.  Approximately 11,000 adult yellow perch were stocked since 1976 in an attempt to stabilize the population.  These plantings were ineffective.  The yellow perch gill net catch was 0/gillnet in the current survey.Walleye abundance has always been low.  The highest gill net CPUE of any test netting study was 1.4 fish/net in 1984.  The walleye in that sample were the result of natural reproduction, since no walleye stocking had occurred.  Walleye subsequently were stocked in 1985 and 1987 in an effort to maintain or improve this abundance.  These stockings appear to be unsuccessful.  Only 2 walleye were captured in the current survey, for a catch rate of 0.4/gillnet.  Aging revealed that these 2 fish could have resulted from the 1985 fingerling stocking.  No walleye from the 1987 fry stocking were sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chase Lake is a 234 acre lake located 3 miles northeast of Deer River, MN.  Chase Lake is in ecological lake class #23.  Lakes of this class have an average surface area of 289 acres, and are generally deep, clear, and have moderately hard water.  Other class #23 lakes in the area include Caribou, Little Bass and Ruby Lakes.  Chase Lake has a maximum depth of 95 feet and water clarity of 20 feet.The initial survey in 1955 indicated that northern pike were not present in Chase Lake, but prescribed stocking them \"to improve the fishing potential of the lake.\"  A single stocking of northern pike fingerlings in 1956 appears to have resulted in a self-sustaining and abundant population.  The gill net catch for pike remained above the expected range in all four assessments from 1976 to 1990, but the average size was relatively low (1.5 pounds).  The northern pike gill net catch of 6.4/net in 2001 marks the lowest catch rate recorded since pike were introduced in 1956.  The drop in northern pike abundance appears to have resulted in an improvement in size structure.  The average size of northern pike in the 2001 assessment increased to 22.9 inches and 2.8 pounds. The establishment of a northern pike population appeared to have a dramatic effect on the fish community in Chase Lake.  Yellow perch, tullibee, black crappie and bluegill populations all declined sharply following the introduction of northern pike.  Net catches of these species have remained low in recent surveys, but appear to have stabilized within their expected ranges.  Net catches of largemouth bass also declined following the northern pike introduction, but their abundance appears to have increased in the most recent assessment.Walleye abundance in Chase Lake has always been low.  The walleye gill net catch of 1.5/net in 2001 is higher than in any previous assessment.  Several year classes were represented in the sample, all from natural reproduction.  Walleyes have not been stocked in Chase Lake since 1987.  Sampled walleyes had an average length of 17.6 inches and faster than average growth.Overall, Chase Lake has good water quality and sufficient habitat to maintain decent populations of northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish, as well as a limited fishery for walleye.  Lakeshore owners can help protect water quality and fish populations by following shoreland best management practices, including: (1) leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, (2) leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, (3) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4) ensuring compliance of septic systems, and (5) utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.          </p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 23 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 51.9 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 5.4?C (41.7?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1976-2016 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1981. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress.  <br> \n</p>",
