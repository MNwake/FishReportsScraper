                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest Two (EN2) is a 408-acre lake with a maximum depth of 39 feet located seven miles east of Soudan in northeastern St. Louis County.  EN2 is one of four lakes that comprise the Eagles Nest chain of lakes.  Based on physical and chemical characteristics, EN2, along with the other three Eagles Nest lakes, is categorized in lake class 5.  Lakes in this class are typically deep, with soft and clear water.  There is a public access on the north side of Eagles Nest Two off of Co. Rd. 599. EN2 is managed primarily for walleye. <br> \n <br> \nResults of our 2010 assessment indicate that EN2 has good populations of walleye, smallmouth bass, and bluegill.  In 2010, walleye abundance was higher than what you would typically find in a class 5 lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.7 inches to 25.8 inches and averaged 17.3 inches in length and 2.2 pounds.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in odd-numbered years.  In the 2010 sample, 95% of the walleye were from stocked years. <br> \nEN2 is home to a quality-sized bluegill population. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2010, 37% of the bluegill were greater than eight inches in length.   Please consider selective harvest and keep the smaller bluegill and release the larger bluegill (greater than eight inches).  Over time, this will maintain or improve the size structure of the bluegill population.  Nine different year classes were identified in the 2010 sample indicating consistent recruitment.  Growth of bluegill was above average.  EN2 bluegill were 5.1 inches long after four years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2010, smallmouth bass up to 18 inches were sampled.  The 2010 sample contained nine different year classes indicating consistent recruitment.  The bass growth rate was average.   In EN2, it takes three years for a smallmouth bass to grow to seven inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2010 include yellow perch, largemouth bass, rock bass, white sucker, and pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish, an invasive species is abundant in EN2.  Their introduction into Eagles Nest chain of lakes was probably accidental by anglers using them as bait.  It is unlawful to harvest and transport crayfish. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a fish consumption advisory for walleye and northern pike from EN2 due to mercury levels.

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest Lake 2 is located approximately 8 miles NE of Tower. This clear water lake is surrounded by mature pines with white cedar and is moderately developed with homes and cabins. There are several shallow rock piles for boaters to be cautious of and aquatic plants are common in the shallow water regions. A concrete planked boat ramp is located on the north side off CR 599 for public access. Boaters use this access to get to connected Eagles Nest 2 also. \n\nFish sampling in 2015 consisted of gill nets, trap nets, smelt gill nets and  electrofishing for bass. The total number of fish sampled from the gill nets in 2015 was the lowest since the 1970's. The bluegill catch from the trap nets was the lowest since 1955. However, bass abundance was the highest on record for EN2. \n\nRusty crayfish appear to have declined compared to recent past surveys and only 2 smelt were sampled. Both rusty crayfish and smelt are non-native species that were likely unintentionally introduced as bait.\n\nWalleye abundance was lower than the historic average of 6.8/gill net on this lake but comparable to similar area lakes. The average walleye sampled was 16 inches long (age 4). The largest walleye was 28.3 inches long. Walleye fingerlings have been stocked during odd-numbered years since 1991 and in 2015, sixty percent of the walleye sampled in the gill nets were from stocked years.\n\nNorthern pike numbers were slightly lower than the historic average of 4.2/gill net. The average piked sampled was 24 inches long and the largest pike was just over 38 inches long.\n\nBluegill abundance was much lower than the historic average of 35.1/trap net and also low compared to other similar area lakes. Bluegill averaged 6.7 inches long but very few were over 8 inches. Rusty crayfish have removed much aquatic vegetation and this may be negatively effecting bluegill since this vegetation provides a preferred habitat.\n\nSmallmouth bass electrofishing catch was almost double the average of past surveys. Smallmouth averaged 12 inches long, much larger than in the past at 8.6 inches. Forty-one percent of the smallmouth in the electrofishing sample were 12 inches or larger. Rock bass were sampled in above average numbers in the trap nets.\n\nLargemouth bass catch in the electrofishing sample was lower than the past average of 18.5/hr but the fish were generally larger. The average size of the 11 largemouth caught was almost 17 inches long.\n\nWhite sucker and yellow perch were also sampled in the gill nets. White sucker and yellow perch numbers were slightly above average in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest Lakes 1 & 2 are in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that have clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Eagles Nest Lakes 1 & 2 are broadly connected by a navigable channel 75 ft wide and 10 ft deep.  Since fish populations are similar and fish may move freely between the two lakes, they are managed as a single body of water.Eagles Nest Lake 1, with a surface area of 322 acres, total alkalinity of 50 ppm, and Secchi water clarity of 11 ft, is typical of lakes in Lake Class 5.  Eagles Nest Lake 1 is deeper (76 ft) than the lake class average of 44 ft, and has a smaller proportion littoral area (27 percent) than the lake class average of 38 percent.  Eagles Nest Lake 1 ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index, with chlorophyll-a of 2.9 ppb and total phosphorus of 30 ppb.Eagles Nest Lake 1 was thermally stratified on 08/15/2005 with a surface temperature of 70 F and bottom temperature of 45 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 40 ft, where the temperature was 48 F.  Eagles Nest Lake 2, with a surface area of 408 acres, maximum depth of 39 ft, total alkalinity of 52 ppm, and Secchi water clarity of 11 ft, is typical of lakes in Lake Class 5.  Eagles Nest Lake 2 has a larger proportion of littoral area (56 percent) than the lake class average of 38 percent, and has a higher Shoreline Development Factor (2.76) than the lake class average of 1.87.  Eagles Nest Lake 2 ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index with chlorophyll-a of 5.0 ppb and total phosphorus of 28 ppb.Eagles Nest Lake 2 was thermally stratified on 08/15/2005 with a surface temperature of 70 F and a bottom temperature of 52 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 25 ft, where the temperature was 64 F.The major inlet to these lakes, from Eagles Nest Lake 3, enters Eagles Nest Lake 2 on the south shore.  The outlet, the East Two River to Lake Vermilion, exits Eagles Nest Lake 2 in the northwest bay.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of both lakes are mostly rubble and gravel.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of about 15 ft, and are moderately abundant in the shallows, especially in Eagles Nest Lake 2, which has more shallow water.  Aquatic plants have not been affected by rusty crayfish in these lakes as much as in some other lakes (Eagles Nest Lake 3, for example) where they are abundant.Fish populations in 2005 were sampled with nine standard survey gillnets, twelve standard survey trapnets, three small mesh smelt gillnets set in deep water, and six electrofishing runs along the shoreline that were done at night in the fall.  Nine previous investigations dating back to 1955 used 4-12 standard gillnets.  Trapnets (6-12 nets) were used during five of these previous investigations.  Shoreline seining or small mesh trapnetting for young-of-year fish was done in three of these investigations.  Fall night electrofishing was done in the three most recent investigations.  Smelt gillnetting was done in seven years from 1980 through 2005.Fish populations in Eagles Nest Lakes 1 & 2 in 2005 were dominated by walleye, bluegill sunfish, smallmouth bass, and rainbow smelt.  Fair numbers of northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie were also present.Walleye numbers in 2005 (13.6/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median walleye catch of 6.6/gillnet in all investigations on these lakes.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked every other year (in odd-numbered years), and 102 of 122 (84 percent) of walleye captured in 2005 were from years stocked with fingerlings.  Many of these walleye (48 percent) were from a strong 2001 year class.  Walleye sizes in 2005 averaged 19.3\" (3.0 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the median size of 18.3\" in all investigations on these lakes.  The largest walleye was 29.7\" (10.6 lb).  Growth of walleye captured in 2005 was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.Bluegill numbers were fairly low in the first two investigations on these lakes: 2.2/trapnet in 1955 and 10.5/trapnet in 1980.  Bluegill numbers then exploded, with catches of 106/trapnet in 1990, 130/trapnet in 1995, 54/trapnet in 2000, and 68/trapnet in 2005.  Bluegill are more vulnerable to trapnetting early in the summer, and trapnetting dates in these lakes was switched from mid August in early investigations through 1990, to mid July in 1995 and later investigations.  The fact that high numbers of bluegill were captured in 1990, prior to switching the trapnetting date, means that the increase in bluegill catches represents a real increase in the bluegill population.Bluegill sizes in 2005 averaged 6.1\" (0.19 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 5.6\" in all investigations on these lakes.  The largest bluegill captured in 2005 was 9.3\".  Bluegill year classes from 1998 through 2002 were all well represented.  Growth of bluegill captured in 2005 was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.Smallmouth bass numbers in 2005 (3.8/gillnet, 1.3/trapnet) were in the fourth quartiles for this lake class and were higher than the median smallmouth catches of 3.2/gillnet and 0.6/trapnet in all investigations on these lakes.  Bass are \"net shy\" and difficult to sample well in standard gillnets and trapnets.  Good numbers of smallmouth (39.1/hour of on-time) were caught during electrofishing in 2005.   Smallmouth sizes in 2005 averaged 14.9\" in the gillnets, 9.2\" in the trapnets, and 7.7\" in the electrofishing.  The largest smallmouth (caught in a gillnet) was 18.4\".  Growth of smallmouth captured in 2005 was slower than normal (in the first or second quartile, depending on the age) by area standards.  Largemouth bass are also present in these lakes, but in lower numbers than smallmouth.  Largemouth up to 18\" have been caught during electrofishing.Smelt were first observed in Eagles Nest Lakes 1 & 2 in 1980.  Smelt numbers in Eagles Nest Lake 1 in 2005 (98/smelt net) were higher than in Eagles Nest Lake 2 (3/smelt net).  This is similar to previous smelt investigations in these lakes since smelt were introduced.  Smelt are a cold-water species and Eagles Nest Lake 1 is deeper and has more cold water with adequate oxygen in the summer.  Many of the walleye examined in these lakes in previous investigations had smelt in their stomachs.  Smelt are a rich, oily food source, and are largely responsible for the fast growth of walleye in these lakes.  Smelt are native to the Atlantic Ocean and made their way through the Great Lakes.  They were likely introduced to Eagles Nest Lakes 1 & 2 intentionally, or by smelt netters from Lake Superior releasing fertilized eggs into the lakes while cleaning their gear.Northern pike numbers in 2005 (2.3/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 4.6/gillnet in all investigations on these lakes.  Pike sizes in 2005 averaged 24.1\" (3.6 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 21.0\" in all investigations on these lakes.  The largest pike caught in 2005 was 39.6\".  Pike scales were moderately difficult to read and growth was too inconsistent to draw conclusions about growth rates. Black crappie numbers in 2005 (3.3/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 2.2/trapnet in all investigations on these lakes.  Crappie sizes in 2005 averaged 8.3\" (0.35 lb), which was at the median for this lake class, but was smaller than the average size of 8.9\" in all investigations on these lakes.  The largest crappie was 13.1\".  Most of the crappie captured in 2005 (23 of 30) were age three. Crappie growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.Yellow perch numbers in 2005 (6.2/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 2.3/gillnet in all investigations on these lakes.  Perch sizes in 2005 averaged 7.1\" (0.16 lb), which was at the median for this lake class, but was smaller than the average size of 7.7\" in all investigations on these lakes.  Perch growth was somewhat faster than normal (in the third quartile) by area standards.Many of the game fish examined in 2005 were infected with neascus (black spot).  Many of the smallmouth bass had bass tapeworm larvae in their viscera.  Some of the yellow perch had yellow grub cysts.  All of these parasites are native to the area and are common.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.Rusty crayfish were first observed in Eagles Nest Lakes 1 & 2 in 1987.  They get entangled in the gillnets and have been counted in all four investigations from 1990 to 2005.  Their numbers in 2005 (97/gillnet) were similar to previous counts (range: 93-116/gillnet).   Rusty crayfish are native to the Ohio River valley and were likely introduced to this area by anglers using them for bait.  They out compete and displace native crayfish.  They are very aggressive and have been associated with the destruction of rooted aquatic vegetation in lakes and the subsequent decline of bluegill populations. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest 2 is a 388 acre lake located seven miles east of Tower.  It is accessed by a concrete ramp and has a water access channel that connects with Eagles Nest 1.  The lake has a maximum depth of 39 feet and at the time of this survey, the water was light green colored due to a slight algae bloom.  On August 3, 2020 the lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 73 F and a bottom temperature of 51 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 25 feet where the temperature was 58 degrees.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble, gravel, and sand with some muck in the bays.  Aquatic vegetation is sparse due to a rusty crayfish infestation. \n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 50.0 fish/net which was above the average compared to past surveys on the lake.  Yield was 44.1 lbs/net which was also better than the average of past surveys.  Fish species sampled were yellow perch, walleye, smallmouth bass, white sucker, northern pike, rock bass, and bluegill.  Trap nets caught fish at an overall rate of 21.0 fish/net which was below the average of past surveys on the lake.  Yield was 7.0 lbs/net which was also below the lakes historic average.  Black crappie was the only additional species sampled in trap nets that wasn't also caught in gill nets.  The small mesh gill nets sampled rainbow smelt, spottail shiner, yellow perch, and two incidental walleye.  \n\nFifty-three walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 13.3 fish/net, which was very good compared to other lakes in the Tower area and better than the Eagles Nest 2 historic average.  Walleye lengths ranged from 7 to just over 20 inches with an average of 14 inches.  This average length was slightly below average compared to past surveys.  Walleye growth was excellent with a four year old walleye averaging nearly 17 inches.  Ages ranged from 1 to 5 years with the 2017 year class representing 65% of the catch.  Most of the catch (80%) correlated to years that were stocked, although the proportion of wild versus stocked walleye is unknown overall.\n\nSpring electrofishing occurred to assess the largemouth and smallmouth bass populations on June 11 and 15th, which was somewhat late for this type of sampling.  Twenty total bass were captured in 1.0 hour of on-time for a total catch rate of 20.0 bass/hour. \n\nSixteen smallmouth were captured in the 1.0 hour of fishing for a catch rate of 16.0 fish/hour.  This was right at the average compared to other Tower area smallmouth lakes.  Lengths ranged from 9 to over 19 inches with an average of 15 inches.  Twenty-two additional smallmouth were sampled in gill nets and two more were caught in trap nets.  Those sizes ranged from 8 to 18 inches.  Growth rates were slightly better than average compared to other area smallmouth lakes with the average four year old smallmouth reaching nearly 10 inches. \n\nFour largemouth bass were electrofished for a catch rate of 4.0 fish/hour.  This was just below average compared to other largemouth lakes in the area.  Lengths ranged from 13 to 17 inches with an average of nearly 16 inches.   \n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch rate was 2.3 fish/net which was below average for Eagles Nest 2.  Lengths ranged from 18 to 32 inches with an average of just over 23 inches.  Sizes were similar to past surveys on Eagles Nest 2.  \n\nThe black crappie trapnet catch was 1.5 fish/net which was below average compared to other similar lakes, but slightly better than the lakes historic average.  Lengths ranged from 8 to 10 inches which was similar to past surveys.  All nine fish were either three or four years old.\n\nThe bluegill trapnet catch was 3.8 fish/net which was below average compared to other similar lakes and well below the average of all past surveys on Eagles Nest 2.  Sizes ranged from 4 to nearly 10 inches with an average of 7 inches.  Ages ranged from 2 to 8 years old with strong representation from the 2016 year class.  Growth rates were exceptional with the average bluegill reaching nearly 7 inches by 4 years old.    \n\nEighty-nine yellow perch were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 22.3 fish/net which was very good compared to other similar lakes and the highest catch rate ever on Eagles Nest 2.  Sizes were similar to past surveys with a range of 6 to 9 inches.  \n\nRainbow smelt are a non-native invasive fish that were first caught in DNR nets in 1980.  In the 2020 survey, 178 smelt were sampled for a catch rate of 89.0 fish/net.  Previous surveys of smelt catches were highly variable.  Sizes have remained relatively constant through time, although 2020 had the lowest average length on record at just under 5 inches. The smelt are likely one reason the walleye grow fast in the lake but they reduce the ability of walleye to produce wild year classes. Smelt are thought to prey on walleye eggs and compete with very young walleye for food resources. \n\nRusty crayfish have been in Eagles Nest 2 since at least 1987.  The 2020 catch rate was 135.5 crayfish/net which was higher than the lakes historic average.  \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest Lake 2 is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that have soft (unmineralized) and clear water.  Eagles Nest Lake 2 has a more irregular shoreline shape than most of the lakes in this lake class.  According to Carlson's Trophic State Index, Eagles Nest Lake 2 ranks as mesotrophic using a water clarity of 4.3 m and a chlorophyll-a of 5.0 ppb, and ranks as eutrophic using a total phosphorus of 28 ppb.Eagles Nest Lake 2 was thermally stratified on 08/14/2000 and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 23 ft, where the temperature was 65 F.  The major inlets are a navigable channel from Eagles Nest Lake 1 that is 75 ft wide and 10 ft deep, and a creek from Eagles Nest Lake 3.  The outlet is to the East Two Rivers.  Shoal substrates are mostly rubble and gravel.  Aquatic plants are moderately abundant and grow to a depth of 15 ft; sweetgale, sedges, and several species of pondweed are the most common plants.Riparian development on Eagles Nest Lake 2 increased from two homes and cottages in 1955 to 44 homes and cottages in 1980, and to 64 homes and cottages in 2000.   A public access with a concrete ramp is on the northeast end of the lake.Fish sampling in the 2000 fisheries lake survey consisted of six gillnet sets, six trapnet sets, night electrofishing for bass in late summer, two small mesh smelt gillnets, and three small mesh trapnet sets.  Eight previous investigations, dating back to 1955, consisted of 3-6 gillnet sets.  Trapnets (5-6 sets) were used during four of these previous investigations.  Shoreline seining was done in 1950 and 1980.  Electrofishing was done in 1994 and 1995.  Smelt netting was done in 1980, 1984, 1987, 1990, and 1995.Fish populations in 2000 were dominated by walleye, bluegill sunfish, and northern pike.  Fair numbers of yellow perch, white sucker, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass were also present.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2000 of 41 fish/net (40 lb/net) were in the third quartile for this lake class and was at the median for all investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 5 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 2000 of 45 fish/net (11 lb/net) was at the median for all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill numbers have increased over time in the trapnet catches and have been quite high since 1990.  In contrast, catches of other fish species in the trapnets have remained stable over time.Walleye numbers in 2000 (6.7/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were at the median for all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2000 averaged 18.4\" (2.4 lb) which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class; the largest walleye was 25.6\".  Most of the walleye captured in 2000 (80 percent) were age three, from the 1997 year class.  All of the walleye captured in gillnets in 2000 were from fingerling stocked year classes.  Walleye growth was in the fourth quartile for area lakes.Bluegill numbers in 2000 (34.0/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Previous trapnet catches were 2.0/trapnet (1955), 7.6/trapnet (1980), 117.8/trapnet (1990), and 117.0/trapnet (1995).  Bluegill sizes in 2000 averaged 5.0\" (0.10 lb) which was in the first quartile for this lake class; the largest bluegill was 8.0\".  Bluegill growth was in the first quartile for area lakes.Northern pike numbers in 2000 (6.0/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 4.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2000 averaged 20.0\" (2.0 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class.  Most of the pike captured in 2000 were ages two and three, from the 1997 and 1998 year classes.  Pike growth was in the normal range for area lakes.Yellow perch numbers in 2000 (14.7/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 2.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2000 averaged 7.3\" (0.17 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class; the largest perch was 11.5\".  Perch growth was in the fourth quartile for area lakes.White sucker numbers in 2000 (4.3/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were at the median catch in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2000 averaged 14.9\" (1.5 lb), which was at the first quartile for this lake class; the largest sucker in 2000 was 20.1\".Smallmouth bass numbers in the gillnets in 2000 (1.5/net) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 1.8/net in all investigations on this lake.  Smallmouth numbers in the trapnets (0.8/net) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 0.3/net in all investigations on this lake.  Smallmouth numbers in the electrofishing (51.5/hour on-time) were higher than previous catches of 38.9/hour on-time in 1994 and 25.8/hour on-time in 1995.  Smallmouth sizes in 2000 averaged 12.1\" in the gillnets, 8.6\" in the trapnets, and 6.6\" in the electrofishing; the largest smallmouth (caught in a gillnet) was 15.4\".  Smallmouth growth was in the first quartile for ages 1 and 2, in the second quartile for ages 3-5, and in the third quartile for age 6.Largemouth bass numbers in the gillnets in 2000 (0.2/net) were at the first quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 0.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Largemouth numbers in the trapnets (0.3/net) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were at the median for all investigations on this lake.  Largemouth numbers in the electrofishing (17.9/hour on-time) were similar to previous catches of 13.0/hour on-time in 1994 and 27.8/hour on-time in 1995.  Largemouth sizes averaged 13.0\" in the gillnets, 12.6\" in the trapnets, and 11.2\" in the electrofishing; the largest largemouth (caught in a trapnet) was 16.1\".  Largemouth growth was generally in the second quartile for area lakes.About half of the bluegill examined in 2000 had neascus (black spot).  A few of the smallmouth bass had bass tapeworm, and a few of the the yellow perch had yellow grub.  Neascus, bass tapeworm, and yellow grub are all common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.   No smelt were captured in the smelt nets in 2000.  Previous investigations captured generally low numbers of smelt.  Smelt numbers in Eagles Nest Lake 1 have been quite high.Rusty crayfish were first observed in Eagles Nest Lake 2 in 1987.  Subsequently, their numbers in the gillnets were 75/net (1990), 136/net (1995), and 92/net (2000).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest #2 is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which is comprised of 64 medium sized, deep, and clear lakes in northeast Minnesota.  Eagles Nest #2 has more shallow water area than most of these lakes, has a more irregularly shaped shoreline, and is more chemically productive.Eagles Nest #2 stratifies thermally in midsummer and has less than 2 ppm oxygen below about 25', at which depth the water temperature is about 63 F.  There is a broad connection between Eagles Nest #2 and Eagles Nest #1 which is about 75' wide and 10' deep.  The inlet from Eagles Nest #3 has no barrier to fish movement, but the outlet (the East Two River) does have barriers in the form of rapids and beaver dams.  The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 1995 (all species combined) was average for this lake class in terms of the number of fish caught, but was above average in terms of the weight of fish caught, due to the abundant population of large walleye.  The total catch of fish in the trapnets was above average in terms of the number of fish caught, but was average in terms of the weight of the fish caught, due to the very abundant population of small bluegill sunfish. Fish populations in 1995 were dominated by bluegill sunfish, walleye, northern pike, rainbow smelt, and smallmouth and largemouth bass.Bluegill numbers in 1995 were far above average for this lake class, and have increased in each of the four trapnettings since the initial survey in 1955.  The reason for this increase is not known.  The average bluegill was small, at 5\"; no bluegill were over 8\".  Bluegill growth was very slow: 4\" at age five; 5\" at age six.  All bluegill captured in 1995 were age four or older; younger bluegill may have been too small to be caught in the trapnets we used.  Almost all bluegill were infested with Neascus, also known as \"black spot\".  Neascus is a parasite in or beneath the skin of fish which is usually removed by filleting, is killed by cooking, and is harmless to humans.Walleye numbers in 1995 were average for this lake class and were near the long term average of 6.9/gillnet for this lake.  Most walleye were from years which had been stocked with walleye fingerlings.  The average size of captured walleye (20\") was very large; the largest walleye was 26\" and 7.5 lb.  Walleye were eating smelt, were growing very fast (19\" at age four), and were very fat. Northern pike numbers in 1995 were average for this lake class and were similar to previous catches in this lake.  Pike sizes were fairly small, averaging 19\"; the largest was 28\".  Growth was average for the area.Rainbow smelt were first observed in 1980.  Smelt were abundant in the deeper, cold water in 1995.  Smelt sizes were small, averaging 5\".Smallmouth and largemouth bass are present in average numbers according to net catches and night electrofishing catches.  The largest bass caught were a 15\" smallmouth and a 17\" largemouth.  Bass growth was slow: 8-9\" at age five.Yellow perch, rock bass, and white sucker numbers were average for this lake class.  Crappie numbers were below average.  Rusty crayfish, a large \"exotic\" crayfish from the Ohio River Valley, were first observed in 1987 and are now abundant.SMELT NETS:Smelt were first observed in this lake in 1980.  This special smelt assessment consisted of two sets with standardized smelt gillnets.  A total of 423 smelt (211/net) were caught in this assessment which is considerably higher than numbers caught in previous smelt assessments on Eagles Nest #2.  Smelt ranged in size from 4.6\" - 6.9\", but most smelt were 4.6\" - 5.5\".</p>",
