Each species was sampled in numbers well above average for similar lakes. The average size of fish, for both species, was slightly below average. Only 4 bluegills were sampled during the survey, even though 400  were stocked by the city of Edina in 1994. None of the 600 Largemouth bass stocked by the city were sampled.</p>",
