                "narrative": "<p>Heritage Lake (69-0469) is a small, rocky lake with bog stained water located in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. The lake is only accessible via portage trails from Loon, Shell or Lynx Lakes. The U.S. Forest Service maintains two primitive campsites on the lake. The fish community is relatively simple with only a few species present. Northern pike appear to be the primary predator species present in Heritage Lake. The number of pike caught in nets was typical for lakes like Heritage. The average individual weight of 4.1 pounds, however, was exceptional.  Two size groups of pike were found during this investigation. Most individuals averaged about 20 inches in length, however, 23% of the catch exceeded 35 inches. The largest individual pike captured was 40.7 inches long and weighed over 16 pounds.Walleye and smallmouth bass are also present in Heritage Lake in low numbers.  Lengths of walleye ranged from 12.5 to 18.2 inches and averaged 15.6 inches.  The only smallmouth bass captured was 10.7 inches in length.Other species caught during the 2003 Heritage Lake survey included cisco, white sucker, shorthead redhorse, rock bass, and yellow perch.     </p>",
