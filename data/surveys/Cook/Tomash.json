Fingerlings remaining after harvest can sometimes provide angling for adult walleye in subsequent years if winterkill has not occurred.In the mid-1980s yellow perch and white sucker became abundant, causing competition and predation that made conditions unsuitable for rearing walleye.  The lake was treated with rotenone to kill the fish life, and returned to use as a rearing pond.  These species were again abundant in 2000, along with a few adult walleye that are also undesirable predators, and so reclamation is planned in fall 2001.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The winter of 2013-2014 was long and severe.  Winter dissolved oxygen was tested on several shallow Cook County lakes (including Tomash) that were considered susceptible to winterkill.    Beginning in 1978 Tomash Lake was used to rear walleye to fingerling size to stock in other lakes in the area.  Winterkill is a desirable feature of rearing ponds, since it removes other fish species that might prey upon, or compete with, stocked walleye fry.  Tomash Lake did not always winterkill, and periodically supported holdover walleye and populations of yellow perch, white sucker, and other fish species.  Walleye fry were last stocked in this lake for rearing in 2006, and walleye were last known to have been present in the spring of 2007.\n\nWinter dissolved oxygen testing was done on Tomash Lake on 9 April 2014.  Oxygen levels were very low; only 0.8 ppm was found at a depth of 3.0 ft, three inches under the bottom of the ice.  In many lakes, some winterkill could be expected under those conditions; however, fish in Tomash Lake had survived similarly poor conditions in the past.  They did so again in 2014.\n\nDespite low oxygen concentrations measured on 9 April, June trap netting and gill netting revealed that yellow perch remained abundant, white sucker were common, and northern redbelly dace and central mudminnow were present.  Most of the yellow perch present were small; the average length for fish taken in gill nets was 7 inches and just 11% of the perch caught exceeded 8 inches.  The lack of walleye suggested that a self-sustained walleye population did not develop after stocking was discontinued, possibly because walleye were more susceptible to winterkill than the remaining species.  Northern pike, known to have some resistance to winterkill, are found in the next lake downstream (Cascade Lake), but have never been collected in Tomash Lake.\n\n</p>",
