Only two smallmouth bass were taken in 1996, but they may be more abundant than that, since gill nets are a poor sampling tool for smallmouth.  Fair numbers of northern pike were present, including some very large fish; however, most of the northern pike collected were less than 25 inches in length.  Yellow perch abundance apparently has declined, probably due to the walleye introduction.</p>",
