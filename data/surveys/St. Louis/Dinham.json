                "narrative": "<p>Dinham is a 207 acre lake located 2 miles south of Melrude, MN on County Road 59.  There is a DNR administered public access in the northeast bay off of Township Road 542.  Maximum depth is 25 feet, with 64% of the lake less than 15 feet deep.     Walleye abundance of 0.7 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Due to small sample size, growth was not evaluated.  Only two year-classes (1997 and 1998) were represented.  The lack of good spawning habitat for walleye limits the naturally sustained population in Dinham.     Northern pike abundance of 3.7 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of northern pike was 21.8 inches.  Due to small sample size, growth was not evaluated.  Six year-classes were represented from 1995 through 2001.  A strong 1999 year-class should currently provide good angling.     Black crappie abundance of 2.1 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of black crappie was 7.3 inches.  Growth was slow, with length at age four of 6.6 inches.  Five year-classes were represented from 1994 through 2001.  Black crappie were also captured in gillnets.  Abundance was very high with 13.0 per lift.     Bluegill abundance of 6.4 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of bluegill was 5.2 inches.  Growth was slow, with length at age four of 4.2 inches.  All year-classes were represented from 1992 through 1999, with a strong 1998 year-class (57% of the fish).     Largemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing.  Largemouth bass abundance was 16.6 per hour of electrofishing, which was down from 1998 (38.1).  Mean length of largemouth bass was 13.8 inches.  Growth was average, with length at age four of 10.9 inches.  Six year-classes were represented from 1993 through 1999.     Other fish sampled include yellow perch, white sucker, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, black bullhead, common shiner, golden shiner, and pumpkinseed sunfish.      Northern pike currently provide the best angling opportunity in Dinham.  Black crappies and bluegill are present in good numbers as well, but fish tend to be on the small side.       </p>",

Northern pike numbers are down slightly from the previous investigation in 1989, however, the 1994 population assessment catch is typical of this lake type.  Northern pike sizes ranged from 14 to 30 inches with the average fish measuring 23.2 inches.     Black crappie and bluegill assessment catches are also typical of this type of lake.  Sizes range from 6 to 9 inches for black crappie and 3.5 to 7 inches for bluegill.  A few pumpkinseeds are also present.     A nice largemouth bass population was reported in the 1993 electrofishing investigation.  Average size then was 11.1 inches with fish up to 18.5 inches present.     Brown bullhead, yellow bullhead and yellow perch with a rare walleye are also available to round out the anglers catch.</p>",

There is a DNR administered public access in the northeast bay off of Township Road 542.  Maximum depth is 25 feet, with 64% of the lake less than 15 feet deep.  Dinham was last assessed in 2010.  Dinham was surveyed during the summer of 2018 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 114 Largemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The Largemouth Bass catch rate was 67.4 fish per hour, which was slightly lower than 2010 (72.7 per hour).  Average length of sampled Largemouth Bass was 12.4 inches, but large fish over 18 inches were sampled and should provide quality angling opportunities.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 2.7 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 24.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill population densities were above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes, but size was small.  Black Crappie average length was 7.0 inches, while Bluegill average length was 5.0 inches.  Yellow Perch were scarce.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have not been stocked into Dinham since 2001.  Walleye abundance of 0.7 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes, but gillnet abundance has historically been low in Dinham and has never exceeded 1.0 per gillnet lift.</p>",

Largemouth bass are reproducing as indicated in shoreline seining where 44 young of the year were taken in 0.54 acres seined.  Several 1 to 2 pound bass were observed cruising the shoreline by the survey crew.     A slight decline in black crappie is noted even throwing out the high catch rate noted in the 1957 survey.  The average size was down from previous surveys, possibly because of the strong 1986 and 1987 year classes.  There are individuals in excess of 10 inches.  The 1982, 1983 and 1987 year classes dominate the bluegill population.     Walleye catch rates have always been 1.0 per gillnet lift or lower, and 1989 was no exception (0.2/lift).  Walleye catch rates have no relation to walleye stocking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dinham is a 207 acre lake located 2 miles south of Melrude, MN on County Road 59. There is a DNR administered public access in the northeast bay off of Township Road 542.  Maximum depth is 25 feet, with 64% of the lake less than 15 feet deep.  Dinham was last assessed in 2002.  Dinham was surveyed during the summer of 2010 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 0.2 per gillnet lift was down from 2002 (0.7) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The walleye gillnet has historically been low on Dinham and has ranged from 0.0 in 1972 to 1.0 in 1957 and 1978.  Walleye average length was extraordinary at over 27 inches but only two individuals were captured.  Not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Two year-classes were represented, 1999 and 2001.  Both year-classes correlate to years that walleye fry were stocked before the discontinuation of stocking in 2001. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 1.3 per gillnet lift was down from 2002 and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 24.8 inches, but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  All year-classes from 2005 to 2008 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 1.3 per trapnet lift was up from 2002 (2.1) and was below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 7.1 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2007 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 10.2 per trapnet lift was up from 2002 (6.4) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 5.2 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2007 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 53 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 72.7 fish per hour of electrofishing.  The 2002 largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 16.6 fish per hour.  Largemouth bass average length was 12.4 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 through 2007 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 0.7 per gillnet lift was down from 2002 (1.0) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 5.4 inches, but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Perch from the 2006 and 2008 year-classes were present. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included brown and yellow bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed and white sucker.  <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Thirty-five aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 20 transects.  Large-leaf pondweed and flat-stem pondweed were the most frequently found plant species (90% of transects) followed by variable-leaf pondweed (85% of transects).  The most common substrate types were sand and gravel which were identified along 70% and 50% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Dinham is an alkaline, moderately hard water lake with moderate fertility. <br> \n <br> \nDinham was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2010.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.</p>",
