Four year classes were represented in the 1992 catch, with the 1984 year class the strongest.  Lake trout growth appeared to be above average for Cook County.All the white sucker collected in this assessment were small enough to provide some forage for lake trout.  White sucker of similar size were collected in 1980, and the availability of these small white sucker may explain the good lake trout growth rate.</p>",
