                "narrative": "<p>Barker Lake is currently managed for Walleye and Northern Pike.  Management goals from the latest (2014) lake management plan are to maintain a Walleye population with a minimum gill net catch of 5.0 fish/set, with some fish over 20 inches.  Goals for the Northern Pike population are a minimum gill net catch of 2.0 fish/set, with some fish over 25 inches present.  This was the first of two standard surveys scheduled in the 2014 plan.  Objectives for those surveys were to determine whether the Walleye and Northern Pike populations were meeting their catch and size goals, and to monitor development of the Black Crappie population. <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of Walleye were seen in the 2018 survey.  The Walleye gill net catch fell short of the long range catch goal for the species in this lake; however, it still fell within the normal range for a lake of this class, and was similar to catches seen when the lake was regularly stocked with Walleye.  The mean weight of Walleye taken in gill nets was one of the highest seen in this lake, and the size goal from the 2014 plan was met by the capture of two fish over 20 inches in length.  Several year classes contributed to the catch.  None appeared to have been exceptionally strong, but all had been naturally produced.  Walleye growth appeared to have been close to average.  Fish reached a mean length of 12.4 inches at the end of their fourth year, compared to an area mean of 13.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 survey also saw fair numbers of Northern Pike, in a range of sizes (up to 31.9 inches). The Northern Pike gill net catch also fell short of the goal set in the 2014 plan, but the size goal was met.  Similarly low Northern Pike catches had also been seen in the last two surveys (2004 and 2013), and catches have never exceeded 3.00 fish/set in this lake.  Although no structures were taken to determine age or growth, it was apparent from the lengths of fish captured that  several year classes had contributed to the 2018 catch. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Yellow Perch gill net catch fell within the normal range for a lake of this type, and was similar to all past catches seen in this lake.  Most of the Yellow Perch taken were too small to have been of much interest to anglers, but the species should have provided adequate forage for Walleye and Northern Pike.  A few small White Sucker were also available as forage for some of the larger Northern Pike present. <br> \n <br> \nPast surveys of this lake have collected small numbers of Black Crappie, and it was thought that population might at some point begin to expand.  None were taken in this survey.  Smallmouth Bass have also been taken in small numbers in this lake in the past, and have been reported by anglers, but they also were absent from the 2018 catch.  Both species were likely still present in 2018. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

MOST WAE COLLECTED RANGED FROM 10 TO 13 IN, WITH NONE OVER 20 IN.  WAE GROWTH WAS SLOW BY COOK COUNTY STANDARDS; AGE III WAE WERE ONLY 8.3 IN AT LAST ANNULUS FORMATION, COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE FOR COOK COUNTY OF 11.0 IN AT AGE III.  THE WAE POPULATION IN BARKER LAKE WAS APPARENTLY SUSTAINED PRIMARILY BY STOCKING AT THE TIME OF THIS ASSESSMENT.  WAE HAVE BEEN STOCKED IN EVERY EVEN YEAR SINCE 1984.  IN THIS ASSESSMENT THE 1988 AND 1990 YEAR CLASSES WERE STRONGEST, TOGETHER ACCOUNTING FOR 79% OF THE WAE COLLECTED, WHILE UNSTOCKED YEAR CLASSES ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY 14%.  NOP, YEP, AND WTS CPUE'S WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE OBSERVED IN PAST ASSESSMENTS. ALTHOUGH CPUE'S FOR THESE SPECIES HAVE FLUCTUATED, THERE HAS BEEN NO CLEAR TREND SINCE THE 1971 SURVEY.  NO BLC WERE COLLECTED; HOWEVER, ANGLER STILL REPORT CATCHING AN OCCASIONAL CRAPPIE IN THIS LAKE.</p>",

Unstocked years accounted for 80% of the walleye collected in 1998, including a strong natural year class produced in 1995 that alone accounted for 50% of the walleye collected.  Despite good forage provided by yellow perch, walleye growth rates had been slow by area standards.The northern pike catch in 1998 was also within the normal range for lakes of this type, and it was similar to past catches in this lake.  The larger northern pike collected had shown fairly fast growth; the largest, a 32-inch fish, was just five years old.  Compared to other lakes in the area, Barker Lake appeared to support a fairly high-quality northern pike population.Smallmouth bass were collected for the first time in this lake in 1998.  Both fish were two years of age, and had grown fairly quickly.  Black crappie were collected for the first time since 1974.  Black crappie year classes were apparently produced in 1994, 1995, and 1998, and the older fish had also shown fairly fast growth.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Barker Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, and secondarily for Northern Pike. The objective of the 2013 assessment was to evaluate those populations to determine if they were meeting long-range abundance and size goals established for the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were fairly abundant in Barker Lake in 2013, but were also fairly small.  The Walleye gill net catch in 2013 was within the normal range for the lake class, and all Walleye sampled in 2013 were produced naturally.  Despite discontinued stocking, the 2013 Walleye catch rate was slightly higher than that observed in the previous three assessments (1991, 1998, and 2004) when stocking was still occurring. The mean weight of Walleye sampled in 2013 was the lowest seen to date for Barker Lake, likely due to a high proportion of small one- and two-year-old fish in the gill net catch.  Growth rates of two-year-old Walleye were about average for the area and lake class.  Walleye up to 23 inches in length were captured during the 2013 assessment, but most were under 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers appeared to have been low in 2013.  The Northern Pike gill net catch in 2013 was slightly below the normal range for this lake class, but the mean weight of sampled fish was within the normal range.  Northern Pike growth rates were about average for this lake class in the Grand Marais area, with Northern Pike reaching 17 inches by the end of their third year. <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to past assessments of Barker Lake a few Black Crappie were present in the 2013 gill net catch, although their abundance appeared to have been low.  Relatively few Cook County lakes support Black Crappie, and they are not abundant in any area lakes.  A few larger Yellow Perch were taken in 2013; however the proportion of fish 8 inches or longer was lower than in prior assessments. Yellow Perch and White Sucker were present in average numbers, and likely provided the primary forage for Walleye and Northern Pike. The 2013 assessment was the first to document the presence of Pumpkinseed sunfish within Barker Lake.  No Smallmouth Bass were collected in 2013; to date they have only been captured in the 1998 assessment. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The 2004 catch was dominated by young (one and two-year-old), small fish, resulting in a smaller-than-usual average size for walleye.  Most of the 2004 catch had been produced naturally, with stocked years (2000 and 1998) accounting for less than 10% of the catch.  Northern pike abundance was also low in 2004, and no large fish were taken.  A few black crappie were present; the 2004 catch was low for a lake of this type, but was similar to past catches in this lake.  The presence of black crappie is unusual for a Cook County lake.  Yellow perch abundance appeared to have been at normal levels for a lake of this type, and for this lake historically.  A few larger yellow perch were present (50% of the catch was eight inches or larger).  Yellow perch provided the primary forage for walleye and northern pike, although some of the white sucker were small enough to be taken by larger northern pike.</p>",
