                "narrative": "<p>Hay Lake is a 215 acre lake with 214 acres (99.5%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 16 feet.  It is located southwest of Wrenshall, MN off of County Road 4.  It has a county-owned earthen access located at the extreme southern end of the lake.  Walleye is the primary management species.  Different life stages have been stocked over the past six years.      Prior to 1998, walleye had not been stocked or sampled in Hay Lake.  The 2003 investigation was the first assessment to evaluate the success of recent intensive walleye stocking.  Walleye abundance of 3.3 fish/gillnet was average compared to Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length of walleye captured in gillnets was 15.3 inches.  The mean length of age 4 walleye was 14.0 inches and represented average growth for Duluth area lakes.  Sixty-percent of the 20 fish aged were born in years that correspond to walleye stocking.  Age 1 (2002 year class) may be due to natural reproduction.  Northern pike abundance was 7.5 fish/gillnet, average for Minnesota lakes of similar type, and was an increase from 1997 (4.0 fish/gillnet).  The mean length of northern pike sampled in gillnets was 18.8 inches.  The mean length of age 4 northern pike was 18.2 inches and represented relatively slow growth for Duluth Area lakes.  Eight-four percent of the fish aged were age 2 or age 3.  Yellow perch abundance was below average for Minnesota lakes of similar type and decreased from 17.3 fish/gillnet (1997) to 3.7 fish/gillnet (2003).  The mean length of fish sampled in gillnets was 7.1 inches.  Bluegill abundance was 1.6 fish/trapnet and was below average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  No bluegill were sampled during the 1997 population assessment.  Eighty-five percent of the fish aged were age 1 or age 2.  The mean length of fish sampled was 5.2 inches.  Black crappie abundance was 0.9 fish/trapnet.  This value was below average from Minnesota lakes of similar type and was a decrease from 1997 (1.4 fish/trapnet).  Growth for age 4 black crappie was 10.3 inches and was fast for Duluth Area lakes.  The overall mean length of fish sampled decreased from 11.5 inches to 10.9 inches.    Pumpkinseed abundance of 2.4 fish/trapnet was average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  However, the mean length fish sampled was 7.4 inches which was relatively large for Duluth Area lakes.

                "narrative": "<p>Hay Lake is a 215-acre lake with 214 acres (99.5%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 16 feet.  The lake is located southwest of Wrenshall, MN off of County Road 4.  It has a county-owned earthen access located at the southern end of the lake.  The current fisheries management plan for Hay directs fry stocking in odd years.  Fry stocking was temporarily discontinued in 2007 due to prolonged low water levels that could lead to winterkill conditions.  Water levels had partially rebounded by 2011 when walleye fry stocking resumed.  Prior to 1998, walleye had not been stocked or sampled in Hay Lake.  Hay Lake was last assessed in 2003.  Hay Lake was assessed during the summer of 2011 to update information about fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 0.7 per gillnet lift was down from 2003 (3.3) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 16.5 inches but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Walleye from the 2003, 2007 and 2008 year-classes were present.  Sixty percent of walleye aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 7.3 per gillnet lift was down from 2003 (7.5) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Northern pike average length was 18.8 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2004 to 2009 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 3 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 4.5 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  One other bass electrofishing assessment was conducted on Hay in 1998 and the catch rate was 11.1 per hour.  Mean length was 17.9 inches but not enough individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth.  Recruitment appears sporadic, with year-classes from 2002, 2004 and 2005 present in the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 3.8 per trapnet lift was up from 2003 (0.9) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 10.8 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  A high quality black crappie fishery exists with fish up to 14.1 inches sampled.  All year-classes from 2001 through 2010 were represented, except 2007 and 2009. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 3.2 per trapnet lift was up from 2003 (1.6) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 8.7 inches and growth was very fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  A high quality bluegill fishery exists with fish up to 10.5 inches sampled.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2009 were represented, except 2003.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 4.5 per gillnet lift was up from 2003 (3.7) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 6.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include golden shiner, pumpkinseed, brown bullhead and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nHay Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2011.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hay is a 215 acre lake located 4 miles south of Carlton, MN.  Hay Lake has a developed, county administered, public access at the southerly most point of the lake, off County #4.  The maximum depth is 16 feet with 99% of the lake shallower than 15 feet.  Fish population assessments have been conducted in 1955, 1975 and 1977.     Hay Lake has had a recorded history of low levels of dissolved oxygen during winter months.  The present fish population, which is dominated by northern pike, bullhead, yellow perch and pumpkinseed sunfish, is representative of a lake subjected to oxygen stress.  However, presence of largemouth bass and black crappie may indicate winter oxygen depletion may have been less severe in recent years, perhaps as a result of greater water depth.     Northern pike abundance indexed with assessment nets was 4.0 per lift in 1997.  Mean length of northerns was 19.2 inches and growth rates were slow compared to other populations in the Duluth Area.  Yellow perch catch rate of 17.3 per lift was relatively high.  Both the yellow perch mean length of 8.1 inches and length at age IV of 7.0 inches were good for the Duluth Area.  Populations of both black crappie and pumpkinseed sunfish were considered excellent.  Mean length of black crappie and pumpkinseed sunfish sampled in 1997 was 11.5 and 7.5 inches.  black crappie and pumpkinseed growth rates were also good.  Bullheads were very abundant, but mean length was also very long.  Largemouth bass, white sucker, golden shiner and pugnose shiner were also sampled during the survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hay Lake is a 215 acre lake with 214 acres (99.5%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 16 feet.  The lake is located southwest of Wrenshall, MN off of County Road 4.  It has a county-owned earthen access located at the southern end of the lake.  The current fisheries management plan for Hay directs Walleye fry stocking in odd years.  Prior to 1998, Walleye had not been stocked or sampled in Hay Lake.  The fish community of Hay Lake is occasionally subject to stressful oxygen conditions during extreme winters and as a result can experience wide fluctuations in the abundance of some species.  Hay Lake was last assessed in 2011.  Hay Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2021 to evaluate the success of the Walleye stocking program and update information about other fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 4.0 per gillnet lift was up from 2011 (0.7) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was large at 17.6 inches.  The proportion of adult Walleye that exceeded quality size (greater than 15 inches) was 79%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 20 inches was 17%.  One-hundred percent of the Walleyes aged corresponded to stocked year-classes suggesting limited, if any natural reproduction.  Young fish captured from the 2019 year-class suggests that Hay Lake will continue to provide good opportunities for Walleye angling in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to Walleye, Hay offers quality angling opportunities for Northern Pike.  Northern Pike abundance of 4.7 per gillnet lift was down from 2011 (7.3) but still average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Northern Pike average length was 19.2 inches but several memorable size fish (greater than 34 inches) were sampled in the trapnets.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie abundance was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Yellow Perch were abundant but small.</p>",
