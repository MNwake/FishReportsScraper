The forest surrounding the lake has been logged in recent years and a prescribed burn on the south side was completed. During the 2014 population assessment, the water levels on Flash Lake were very high resulting in dying trees occurring frequently along the shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nAccess is by portage from the Moose Lake Road (250 rods) or a 140 rod portage from Snowbank Lake. There are no designated campsites on the lake, however there is evidence of camping at a couple of locations. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 assessment sampled northern pike (14%), walleye (71%), white sucker (4%) and yellow perch (10%). Only walleye were sampled during the previous assessment in 1998. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2014 (3.3/gill net) were lower than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. Pike sizes averaged 22.3 inches long which is slightly larger than in the past. The largest pike sampled was 25.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2014  of 16.3/gill net was higher than the long term average on this lake of 10.5. Walleye averaged 14.0 inches long and were about 4 years old.  The largest walleye sampled was 22.0 inches. Walleye were last stocked in 1989. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2014 (2.3/gill net) were lower than in the past. Most perch were about 6 inches long. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Flash Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 13, which consists of 84 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.Flash Lake was thermally stratified at the time of the June, 1998 fish population assessment, and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 18 ft, where the temperature was 61 F.  The bottom temperature, at 20 ft, was 59 F.  There is an inlet from Blackstone Lake which seeps through a sedge bog.  There is no outlet.  Lake bottom substrates are mostly muck, boulder, and rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 10 ft; the most common plants are largeleaf pondweed, bladderwort, and white and yellow waterlilies.  There is a large bog fringe along the south shoreline.The 1998 fish population assessment consisted of two gillnet sets.  Four prior fish population assessments and a fisheries lake survey have been done, dating back to 1978, with each consisting of two or three gillnet sets.  No trapnets have been set on Flash Lake due to the difficult portage access.Walleye were the only fish species caught in 1998.  Walleye were introduced in 1979 and were stocked four additional times through 1989, after which stocking was discontinued to see if natural reproduction could maintain the population.  Walleye numbers in 1998 (53/gillnet) were extremely high, and as a consequence the third \"standard\" gillnet for this lake was not set.  Most walleye captured in 1998 (78 percent) were from strong 1994 and 1995 year classes, although seven other year classes were present.  Walleye sizes averaged 14.5\", which was smaller than in previous surveys and assessments.  Walleye growth (12\" at age three, 14\" at age four) was normal for the area, but was slower than in previous surveys and assessments on Flash Lake.Northern pike numbers declined from 12/gillnet in 1978 to 5/gillnet in 1993, and none were caught in 1998.  Yellow perch numbers declined from 43/gillnet in 1978 to 11/gillnet in 1993, and none were caught in 1998.  White sucker numbers were low during the period 1978-88, averaging less than 1/gillnet.  No sucker were caught after the 1988 assessment.</p>",
