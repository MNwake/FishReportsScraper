Perch Lake is located in the Foothills State Forest west of Backus.  Other trout lakes in the area are; Willard (located two miles north and two miles east of Backus), Hazel (located three and ? miles west of Longville), and Teepee (located three miles south and one mile west of Whipholt), Lakes.  All trout existing in Perch Lake is the result of stocking.  Prior to 1981, brook trout were stocked in Perch Lake with marginal success.  Since 1981, rainbow trout have been stocked.The 1995 assessment was the result of angler complaints of poor fishing.  A total of seven rainbow trout were captured.  These trout ranged in length from 8.3 to 10.6 inches with an average length and weight of 9.7 inches and 0.4 pound.  All seven trout were determined to be one year-old fish.</p>",

All trout existing in the lake are the result of stocking.  Various strains of rainbow trout have been stocked over the years.  For the past several years, anglers have reported poor angling success in Perch Lake.Testnetting in 1999 resulted in no rainbow trout being sampled.  In the summer of 1998 and 1999, the lake was also sampled for zooplankton (tiny animals that are important food for trout).  In 1998, low numbers of zooplankton were found.  Due to what appears to be limited food availability, stocking was discontinued.  In 1999, lower numbers of zooplankton were sampled.  Further assessments in 2000 will continue to monitor zooplankton numbers.</p>",

PERCH LAKE, THEREFORE, CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A BASS-PANFISH LAKE OF THIS TYPE.SINCE THERE IS AN INLET WITH INTERMITTENT FLOW, THIS SHOULD BE DAMMED TO PREVENT ANY MIGRATION OF FISH.BROOK TROUT FINGERLINGS SHALL BE STOCKED AT THE RATE OF 250 PER SURFACE ACRE FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS.  AN EVALUATION OF RETURNS TO THE ANGLERS SHALL BE MADE DURING THIS TIME TO FIND OUT IF FURTHER STOCKING IS FEASIBLE.  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE PRESENT POPULATIONS OF PERCH BE REMOVED WITH A FISH TOXICANT.  THERE ARE NO SPECIAL REGULATIONS OTHER THAN THOSE THAT PERTAIN TO TROUT LAKES, TO BE MADE.DISCUSSION:PERCH LAKE IS A SMALL, DEEP LAKE TYPICAL OF SEVERAL IN THIS AREA.  IT HAS AN INLET FROM A SWAMP WITH POSSIBLE INTERMITTENT FLOW DURING HIGH WATER.  THERE IS NO OUTLET.  AS IS TRUE WITH LAKES OF THIS NATURE, ANY FISH PRESENT IN THE LAKE APPARENTLY HAVE RESULTED FROM ARTIFICIAL STOCKING. THE USUSAL COMBINATION OF FISH FOUND IN THESE LAKES IS STUNTED BLUEGILLS AND CRAPPIES, WITH LARGEMOUTH BASS PRESENT IN FAIR ABUNDANCE.  IN YEARS OF SEVERE PROLONGED DROUGHT AS IN THE 1930'S, THESE LAKES MAY SUFFER A WINTER KILL SUFFICIENT TO ALMOST ERADICATE THE FISH PRESENT.

WITH SUCH A FISH POPULATION, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE ONLY FISH WHICH SURVIVED LOW WATER WAS THE PERCH.PERCH LAKE HAS A SHORELINE CONSISTING OF ABOUT 85 PERCENT MUCK AND 15 PERCENT GRAVEL.  NO AQUATIC VEGETATION WAS SEEN IN THE LAKE AT THE TIME OF THE SURVEY.PERCH LAKE HAS A SUMMER TEMPERATURE RANGE AND DISSOLVED OXYGEN CONTENT SUFFICIENT FOR BROOK TROUT.  THE LAKE IS NOT NOW USED BY ANGLERS.LAKE SURVEY ABSTRACT:PERCH LAKE IS 7 ACRES IN AREA AND UP TO 44 FEET DEEP.  IT IS A SMALL GLACIAL ICE BLOCK LAKE, A TYPE OCCURRING QUITE COMMONLY IN THIS REGION.  WITH ONLY A SMALL INFLOW FROM A SWAMP AND NO OUTLET, THIS LAKE HAS BEEN ISOLATED FROM OTHER FISH INHABITING ITS WATERS FOR A LONG TIME.THE VERY INFERTILE AND CLEAR WATER VARIES IN TEMPERATURE FROM WARM SURFACE WATERS TO COLD WATER (42 DEGREEES) AT THE BOTTOM, HOWEVER, ONLY THE UPPER 20 FEET OF WATER POSSESSES SUFFICIENT OXYGEN FOR FISH LIFE. THE ONLY KIND OF FISH IN PERCH, AS DETECTED BY THE SURVEY CREW, IS YELLOW PERCH.  THESE PERCH WERE QUITE ABUNDANT BUT AT THE TIME OF THE SURVEY, ALL APPEARED TO BE SMALL 3-YEAR OLD FISH.  BECAUSE OF THE ISOLATED NATURE OF THIS LAKE, NATURAL FISH IMMIGRATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN POSSIBLE AND THE POOR COMPOSITION OF FISH SPECIES IS THE RESULT.  PROPER FISH MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO BE CARRIED OUT BY THE BUREAU OF FISHERIES ARE PLANNED FOR RESTORTION OF A FAVORABLE FISH POPULATION.ACCESS TO PERCH LAKE IS BY TRAIL FROM A STATE FOREST SERVICE ROAD TO THE PINE MOUTAIN LOOKOUT NEAR BACKUS.</p>",

Perch Lake is one of five lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area stocked annually with stream rainbow trout.  The trout population in Perch Lake depends upon stocking because rainbow trout do not naturally reproduce in this lake.Perch Lake was reclaimed in 1956 and rainbow trout have been stocked various years.  Gill net catch rates have varied since this lake was initially surveyed in 1955.  Since 1988, the management goal of 10 to 20 fish per lift has only been achieved two times (1988 and 2003).  However, no rainbow trout were sampled in 2005.  Since 1998, Fisheries personnel have been sampling zooplankton, the tiny animals on which Perch Lake rainbow trout feed.  The quantity of zooplankton available in Perch Lake is relatively low and biologists are currently investigating the annual fluctuation in trout survival by examining the food supply.</p>",

There is a public access on the northeast shore of the lake on a State Forest Trail. Perch Lake offers Rainbow Trout fishing in a remote, wilderness-like setting. The lake is located in the Foot Hills State Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped. Because of its small size, the lake is ideal for canoes or float tubes. Perch Lake is one of four lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area stocked annually with Rainbow Trout. The other designated stream-trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Diamond, Hazel, and Teepee Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nPerch Lake was first used as a stream trout lake in 1956 after being reclaimed. Rainbow Trout do not reproduce in this lake and the population is instead supported entirely by stocking to provide a unique angling opportunity. The average length of Rainbow Trout sampled in 2014 was 12 inches and lengths ranged from 11 to 13 inches. The majority of fish captured were likely from the spring 2014 stocking. While the size range was smaller, catch rates were similar to previous years indicating that anglers can expect similar fishing as in past years. Historically Perch Lake has supported trout that survive over summer-winter. While no trout were captured from the 2013 or previous stockings, anglers should expect some fish from the 2014 stocking and subsequent 2015 stocking during the 2015 trout season. In January 2015, Perch Lake was opened to winter Trout fishing, providing increased opportunities for trout anglers in the Walker area. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.

There is a public access on the northeast shore of the lake on a State Forest Trail. Perch Lake offers Rainbow Trout fishing in a remote, wilderness-like setting. The lake is located in the Foot Hills State Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped. Because of its small size, the lake is ideal for canoes or float tubes. Perch Lake is one of four lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area stocked annually with Rainbow Trout. The other designated stream-trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Diamond, Hazel, and Teepee Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nPerch Lake was first used as a stream trout lake in 1956 after being chemically reclaimed. Rainbow Trout do not reproduce in this lake and the population is supported entirely by stocking to provide a unique angling opportunity. The average length of Rainbow Trout sampled in 2015 was 12 inches and lengths ranged from 10 to 18 inches. Catch rates were similar to previous years indicating that anglers can expect similar fishing as in past years. Historically Perch Lake has supported trout that survive over summer through winter. The presence of large trout (18 inches) confirms that over summer-winter survival is occurring. In January 2015, Perch Lake was opened to winter Trout fishing, providing increased opportunities for trout anglers in the Walker area. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Perch Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
