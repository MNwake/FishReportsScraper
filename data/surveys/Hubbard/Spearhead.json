Spearhead has a surface are of 172 acres and a maximum depth of 81 feet.  There is no public access on the lake.  The entire shoreline is owned by the Headwaters Audubon Society.  Spearhead provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, panfish, and an occasional walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Spearhead is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same class include Benedict, Big Bass, Blue, East Crooked, and Tripp. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown Spearhead to have an abundant northern pike population.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 2.3 pounds, with pike measured up to 34.5 inches.  Bluegill abundance (10.7 bluegill/trapnet) was up from recent surveys and within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-7 inch size range, however, larger fish are present with bluegill measured up to 9.8 inches.  Black crappie and largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers, similar to the 2000 survey.  Walleye were sampled in low numbers (0.8 walleye/gillnet), below the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 19.3 to 28.0 inches.  Walleye have not been stocked into Spearhead by the DNR.  Yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) populations are present in Spearhead and provide a forage base for the larger predator fish such as walleye and northern pike.  Yellow perch were small in size and generally not of an acceptable size for angling.  Other species sampled included moderate numbers of rock bass, and low numbers of hybrid sunfish and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spearhead Lake is located in northern Hubbard County, 6 miles east of Becida and one mile southwest of Plantagenet Lake. Spearhead is 172 acres with a maximum depth of 81 feet. There is no publicly owned access; the entire shoreline is owned by the Headwaters Audubon Society. Spearhead Lake maintains populations of northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass, with walleye caught occasionally by anglers. The Minnesota DNR has classified lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics. Spearhead is in Lake Class 23. Other area lakes in this class include Big Bass (near Akeley), Benedict, Blue, and East Crooked.  Spearhead Lake has an abundant northern pike population, although sizes tend to be small. The mean weight of northern pike seen in the 2000 survey was 1.4 pounds.  Walleye are not stocked in Spearhead Lake by the DNR, but low numbers are present. One 27 inch walleye was sampled in the survey. There is little suitable spawning habitat for walleye in the lake, but when the outlet is not blocked by beaver dams there could be some migration from nearby Plantagenet Lake. Black crappie numbers were low in the trap nets; all crappie sampled were in the 8-9 inch range. Bluegill numbers were low for this lake class, but there were some good sized bluegill present; the largest one seen in the survey was 9.5 inches. Four largemouth bass were sampled in trap nets, with lengths from 12-18 inches. Other species present include bullheads, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, tullibee (cisco), rock bass, and yellow perch. There are enough catchable-sized rock bass and perch to make these of some interest to anglers.</p>",

There is no public access located on the lake, as the entire shoreline is owned by the Headwaters Audubon Society. Spearhead provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, panfish and Walleye. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Spearhead is in lake class 23, one of eight class 23 lakes in the Park Rapids management area. Class 23 lakes are generally very large, deep, have very hard water and are regularly shaped. Other class 23 lakes in the work area include: Bennedict, Blue, Boot, East Crooked, Eleventh Crow Wing, LaSalle, and Ninth Crow Wing. <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance is relatively high, but still supports a healthy size structure. Anglers will find most northern from 15 - 24 inches in length, with the largest fish sampled at 38 inches. Northern Pike sampled had an average length of 22.6 inches and weighed 3.1 pounds. <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in low numbers again in 2022, with fish averaging an impressive length of just over 17.8 inches.   <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in moderate numbers although most fish were smaller.  However, some fish were sampled over 10 inches, with the largest at 12.5 inches. Spearhead also provides good fishing for Bluegill and Pumpkinseed, with some nicer fish up to 8.7 inches. <br> \nWalleye abundance has generally been low at Spearhead Lake but was higher than average in 2022.  Fish were relatively large, with an average length of 20.4 inches. Yellow Perch were sampled in average numbers, with a few large enough for anglers to target. <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Spearhead Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Spearhead Lake was conducted on August 8-9, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at nine sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured sixteen species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Northern Sunfish, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured nine species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Bowfin comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Spearhead Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the general use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Spearhead Lake is fully supporting for aquatic life use. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nA temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Spearhead Lake on August 8, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 16 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 35.1 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 6.4?C (43.5?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1985-2010 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1985. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on August 1, 2022, to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, four sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Site conditions prevented the use of seines at six sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites with five being conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured ten species of fish including zero species intolerant of disturbance.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Central Mudminnow, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Iowa Darter, Largemouth Bass, Northern Sunfish, Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on May 31, 2022 to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Spearhead Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Spearhead Lake is located in the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed. <br> \n</p>",
