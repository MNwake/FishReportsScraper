Average length increased slightly from 17.8\" to 18.0.\"  Most of the fish measured were over 16 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were average when compared to similar lakes (4.6/gill net) and the fish were good size (average length of 26.6\" and weight of 4.6 lbs.).  These fish were fast growing and 64% were 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured at the rate of 75.0/hr run-time while spring electrofishing, which was down from last time (114.6/hr run-time).  These fish averaged 13.1\" and 64% were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were caught in above average numbers in gill nets (1.9/gill net) and average numbers in trap nets (0.6/trap net).  Average length was 7.9\" and 45% of the fish were 8\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills numbers were the lowest recorded (10.2/trap net), but still normal for this type of lake.  They averaged 5.5\". <br> \n <br> \nTullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for this lake.  Tullibees were caught in good numbers (9.4/gill net) and averaged 13.2.\"  Yellow perch numbers were low. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Cullen is the smallest of the three lakes in the \"Cullen lakes chain\" and is in the center of the watershed.  There is an inlet from Upper Cullen and the outlet flows to Lower Cullen, and eventually to Gull Lake.  Middle Cullen is 382 acres in size.  Maximum depth is 46 ft. and about 33% of the lake is shallower than 15 ft. deep.  Bottom soils in shallow water (less than 4 ft. deep) are about 50% sand, 25% marl, 20% gravel and rubble sized rock (3-10\" rock) and 5% muck.  A diverse variety of aquatic vegetation is present and grows to a depth of about 16 ft..  Scattered bulrush beds are present around the lake and wild rice is found on the northeast end.  Protection of emergent vegetation, especially bulrush, is very important to maintaining the good to excellent quality of spawning habitat available for fish, most notably bass, sunfish, crappies and perch.  The lake is classified as a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is about average for the area.Largemouth bass, sunfishes and black crappies are fish species most likely to be sought by anglers in Middle Cullen.  Bluegills were abundant in 1993 and were slow growing.  Other sunfish species and black crappies were found in \"average\" numbers compared to lakes similar to Middle Cullen.  Bass were poorly sampled in '93 but have been present in average to high numbers in previous nettings and most likely remain so.Northern pike numbers were low compared to similar lakes, but was similar to previous catches in this lake.  Fish averaged about 3.5 lbs. each and growth rate was fast.  Walleyes were found in average numbers and had good growth.  Several year classes were present.  Most recent fingerling stockings were not represented in the catch.Forage appeared to be adequate in '93.  Tullibees were found in high numbers and are probably an important food source for northern pike.  Yellow perch were caught in average numbers compared to similar lakes.  Perch are important food sources for both walleyes and northern pike.  Yellow bullheads were found in average numbers and bowfin (dogfish) in low numbers compared to similar lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Cullen is a 382 acre lake located about one mile northeast of Nisswa in Crow Wing County.  This is the middle lake in a three lake chain that eventually drains into the Gull Lake Chain.  A public access is located on the northeast side of the lake.  Development is fairly extensive, with 115 homes/cabins along 5.6 miles of shoreline in 1998.  The maximum depth is 48' and about 33% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand with areas of gravel, marl, rubble, muck, and silt present as well.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 36 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as hardstem bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  The 2003 walleye catch of 1.3/gill net is typical when compared to similar lakes.  Average length and weight decreased slightly from 18.9\" and 2.8 lbs in 1998 to 17.8\" and 2.3lbs in 2003.  Northern pike were caught in average numbers in 2003 at 4.3/gill net.  The 1998 and 1999 year classes were the strongest and contributed 56% of the catch.  Average length and weight increased to 25.9\" and 4.4 lbs in 2003 from 23.8\" and 3.7 lbs in 1998.Largemouth bass abundance measured by gill and trap nets was average when compared to similar lakes.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 113/hr with an average length of 9.4\" and 19% measuring at least 12\".  The bluegill catch of 29.1/trap net was typical for this type of lake.  Black crappie abundance in trap nets continued to decline and at 0.3/trap net are considered to be low in number.  Tullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Yellow perch were sampled in average numbers at 2.8/gill net in 2003.  The tullibee catch of 4.3/gill net was the lowest catch on this lake to date, but remains in the average range when compared to similar lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Cullen Lake is a 397 acre lake located in west-central Crow Wing County, just north of the City of Nisswa.  It has a maximum depth of 48 feet with a secchi disc reading of 16 feet.  Northern pike and walleyes are the primary management species while largemouth bass is the secondary management species.  Spring electrofishing for bass was conducted on May 21, 2015 with gill and trap nets set during the week of July 13, 2015. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate for this survey was 8.4/ gill net.  This is the historical high catch for Middle Cullen Lake.  The average catch rate for lakes similar to Middle Cullen is 5.0/ gill net.  The average size of northern pike during this survey was 24.2\" with fish as large as 37.8\" sampled.  Nearly 41 percent were 24\" or larger while 9 percent were 30\" or larger.  Growth was above average for these fish.  This is most likely due to the high population of tullibees, which are a high-fat and protein rich forage species that northern pike prey upon.  In order to maintain and improve the northern pike size distribution, anglers are encouraged to harvest the smaller fish while releasing some of the larger fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate for walleye was 1.0/ gill net.  Previous catch rates have ranged from 0.0/ gill net to 3.5/ gill net.  The average size was 19.5\" with fish up to 25.5\" sampled.  A total of 127 pounds of walleye fingerlings are stocked in Middle Cullen every 3 years.  When aged, all but 1 walleye sampled in 2015 came from a stocked year class.  There is also likely some fish movement coming up from the Gull Chain as well.  Growth was above average for walleye, again, most likely due to the high population of tullibees which are an excellent forage species. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass electrofishing produced a catch rate of 58/hr.  The average size was 12.3\" with fish up to 16.8\" sampled.  Nearly 57 percent were 12\" or larger.  Smallmouth bass were also sampled for the first time in Middle Cullen.  A 13.7\" smallmouth was sampled during electrofishing while an 18.8\" fish was sampled during the standard survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate was 1.0/ trap net, which is average for lakes like Middle Cullen.  The average size was 8.2\" with as large as 9.3\" sampled.  Fifty percent were 8\" or larger.  The growth of these fish was slightly above normal compared to other lakes similar to Middle Cullen. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rate was 9.6/ trap net, which is the historical low for Middle Cullen.  Past catches have been as high as 97.6/ trap net.  Fish tended to be small with the average size of bluegill measuring only 4.6\".  The largest fish measured 7.3\" and only 12 percent measured 6\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nTullibees were sampled at a catch rate of 17.6/ gill net.  This is the highest catch rate since 1993 when they were sampled at a rate of 37.0/ gill net.  Anglers would be able to target them as the average size was 11.9\" with fish up to 19.0\" sampled.   Two size groups (7-9\" and 12-16\") each accounted for nearly 50 percent of the total sample. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Cullen is a 382 acre lake located about one mile northeast of Nisswa, in Crow Wing County.  There is a public access located on the northeast side of the lake.  Development is fairly extensive, with 20.5 homes/cabins per shoreline mile.  One resort is present, as well.The lake has a maximum depth of 48 feet and about 33% of the lake surface is less than 15 feet deep.  It is classified as a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity was above average for the area in 1998.The aquatic plant community is quite diverse.  Hardstem bulrush is quite common and provides important spawning habitat for a variety of fish species.Middle Cullen was test netted in 1998.  Bluegill, yellow perch and tullibee were caught in \"high\" numbers when compared to similar type lakes.  Yellow bullhead was caught in \"low\" numbers.  Northern pike was caught in numbers that were \"average\" compared to similar type lakes but close to the previous high catch value for the lake.  A number of age classes were present and growth was above average.  Pike averaged 23 inches and 3.7 lbs. in size, similar to averages from recent nettings.  The walleye catch was \"average\" when compared to similar type lakes but equalled the previous high catch for the lake.  Eight age classes were present in low but fairly uniform numbers.  The absence of relatively strong year classes suggests generally low survival of young walleyes, whether from stocking or natural reproduction. Largemouth bass were present in \"average\" numbers but fish sampled were generally aged two or three and grew slowly.  Bluegills were caught in numbers which were \"high\" when compared to similar type lakes but were typical for the lake.  Strong 1993 and '95 year classes were present and growth was above average.  About 11% of bluegills measured were 7.0 inches or more in length.  Black crappie numbers were \"average\" when compared to similar type lakes but in the low range compared to previous catches in Middle Cullen.  Three age classes were sampled, in about equql abundance, and growth appeared to be good.  Important forage species include yellow perch and tullibee.  Perch catches were in the \"average\" range compared to similar type lakes.  The two highest perch catches recorded for the lake occurred in the '93 and '98 nettings.  Two strong year classes dominated the '98  catch and growth bordered on slow.  Tullibee numbers continued to be \"high\" when compared to similar type lakes.  A variety of sizes were present and fish averaged 13 inches and 1.0 lbs. in size.</p>",

Middle Cullen is located in the Crow Wing River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place September 3rd, 2021, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 2 stations (no fish were caught) and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 4 stations.  Nineteen species were sampled, including six species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted July 12-15, 2021, to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

A low population of bowfin, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, rock bass and yellow perch. The northern pike sampled indicated average growth rates for all age groups. Length frequency ranged from 17 to 38 inches, with 23 and 24 inches length groups dominant. Year classes 3 to 8 were represented by the fish that were sampled. Bluegill sampled ranged from 2 to 8+ years old, with 5 and 6 year old fish most abundant. All age groups were below the first quartile of statewide median growth rates which would indicate a stunted population. Length frequency ranged from 3 to 8 inches with the 5 inch group making up 61% of the sample. Largemouth bass sampled were slow growing when compared to statewide averages. Year classes 1, 2 and 3 were represented, with year class 3 comprising 60% of the sample. Black crappies were present in average numbers but were also slow growing. Length frequency ranged from 6.0 to 10.5 inches, with 83% in the 6 inch group. Age groups represented were 2 thru 6 with the 3 year old group representing 43% of the sample. A low population of yellow perch was indicated by the test netting. Age groups ranged from 4 to 8+, with the 4 and 5 year age groups comprising 70% of the sample. Growth rates were slow on the yellow perch also. Walleyes ranged from 2 to 8 years old, with 6 and 7 year old fish comprising 75% of the sample. Length frequencies were from 9 to 20 inches, with 17 and 18 inch fish making up 60% of the sample. Growth rates appear to be about average when compared to statewide averages. A high population of northern cisco was present with length frequencies from 7 to 13 inches. White sucker and pumpkinseed were also present in the lake.</p>",

Size was good, with an average length of 20.2\" and 93% of the fish measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were caught in high numbers for this type of lake (10.6/gill net); however, size wasn't great.  Average length was 21.6\", with 13% measuring larger than 26\" and only 3% measuring larger than 30\". <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers seemed high while electrofishing in the spring (112.5/hr), although size again was not great.  Average size was 9.6\" and 27% of the fish were 12\" or larger.  Fish up to 17.3\" were captured.  Two Smallmouth Bass were also captured while night electrofishing that measured 10.9\" and 13.2\". <br> \n <br> \nIf you are looking for panfish, Black Crappie seems to be the best bet.  They were caught in average numbers (1.2/trap net) and 65% were 8\" or larger.  Bluegill numbers were the lowest to date (4.8/trap net) and average length was only 4.8\", with 9% measuring at least 7\". <br> \n <br> \nAnother species that might provide some angling opportunities is Tullibee (Cisco).  While catches have been higher in the past, the 2021 sampling caught an average number (4.3/gill net) for this type of lake.  There were a range of sizes, with fish from 7.6\" to 17.9\" and an average size of 12.1\".   <br> \n</p>",
