Black bullhead was the most abundant species sampled, with most between 5 and 6 inches.  Northern pike were also abundant. Northern pike up to 35 inches were sampled and lengths averaged 23 inches.  Black crappie were abundant.  Most black crappies between 5 and 6.5 inches, but a group of 9.5 to 11.5 inch fish was also sampled.  Bluegill abundance was low, with an average length of 6.2 inches, but none were over 7 inches.  Largemouth bass appear to be at moderate to low abundance, with fish between 13 and 18 inches.  Two 19 inch walleye were sampled.  These have not previously been sampled in the lake, and were most likely the result of a citizen introduction.  Yellow perch abundance was low, with most fish between 5.5 and 6 inches.</p>",

Northern pike were in the 2 pound range and smaller, bullheads less than 10 inches long.  Nearly half the bluegill and black crappie were of acceptable size to anglers, with good numbers of quality size fish.  Yellow perch numbers were good, with fish over 9 inches long present.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were slightly smaller than bluegill, but still had a good percentage of acceptable size fish.  Twelve largemouth bass were captured, none of acceptable size to anglers.  Only one white sucker was sampled.</p>",

A few white crappies were also found.Management Recommendations: Alimagnet Lake is shallow (maximum depth 11.5 feet) and subject to severe frequent (virtually annual) winterkills.  As the lake presently is, it cannot logically be managed for gamefish.  The only way in which this could be managed would be by installation of a winter aeration device and by total chemical rehabilitation.  An adequate free access and an aeration device would be projects to be undertaken by local government units.  With assurance that this would be done, the lake could be rehabilitated and stocked by the Department of Natural Resources.  Stocking of northern pike and yellow perch could be carried out to establish a fishery for these species with the assurance of an aeration device eventually being established.</p>",
