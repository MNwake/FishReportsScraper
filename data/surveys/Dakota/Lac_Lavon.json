The northern pike catch was near the local median; all were age I and 15-17\" in length.  Larger NOP are believed to inhabit deeper, cooler water and were not vulnerable to the gear used in this investigation.  The largemouth bass catch was above the local median.  Age II was most abundant; I through IV were represented.  Growth of LMB was slow.  The bluegill catch was also above the local median but all were less than 6\" in length.  Other species present in low numbers were black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, black and white crappies.</p>",

No gas engines are allowed on the lake.In addition to this survey, a creel survey of anglers was performed throughout 1999.  Sunfish species dominated the net and angler catch in 1999, with the most common species being bluegill.  Sizes of fish ranged from under 2 inches to over 7 inches in length.  Largemouth bass were the next most abundant species caught by anglers, with most fish released.  Net catches in this survey were low, but the nets used were not designed to effectively sample largemouth bass.  Black crappie were captured in nets and by anglers in much lower numbers than sunfish, but a larger percentage of the fish were of acceptable size, with several netted fish measuring over 10 inches in length.  Northern pike were the most abundant predator sampled in the nets, in higher numbers than in previous nettings.  The largest fish measured over 30 inches in length.  Angler catch was moderate, with most fish released.  Three walleye were sampled in nets, all three near 20 inches in length.  Anglers in the creel survey did not catch walleye.  A few white sucker, a golden shiner, a black bullhead and three snapping turtles were captured in nets.  No trout were captured.  Anglers caught an estimated 171 rainbow trout during the year, with over 2/3 released.</p>",

Pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled in average abundance and were of small sizes. Largemouth bass were also sampled in low numbers. Electrofishing, which is more efficient at sampling largemouth bass, was not done as part of this assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bluegill and hybrid sunfish are present in numbers above the local median.  Black bullhead and green sunfish are present in numbers below the local median.  Northern pike are present but were taken in trap nets and shoreline seine.  Northern pike were aged as V and VI annulus fish.  No reproduction is evident from this and lack of spawning sites.  Bluegill were found as III to VI annulus fish and also young of the year taken in seine hauls.  All bluegills aged showed good growth.LacLavon is a private lake which was investigated for potential as a stream trout lake.  This lake was formed by a gravel mining operation which is still going on.  Temperature-oxygen profiles taken during the survey do not indicate that trout could survive due to lack of oxygen at cold enough temperatures.  This may be due to lack of water clarity from rock particles suspended in the water.  This may clear up on termination of the gravel operation.  A further examination could be made at this time to detect any changes.  Due to the present situation with lack of access and warm water fish populations no further recommendations are made.</p>",
