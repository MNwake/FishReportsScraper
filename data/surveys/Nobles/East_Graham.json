                "narrative": "<p>The northern pike population is considered normal compared to lakes similar to East Graham.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 15 to 30 inches with the average length around 21 inches.  The average weight of northern pike was about 2 ?  pounds. The walleye population is considered high compared to lakes similar to East Graham.  Walleye lengths ranged from 9 to 27 inches with an average length of about 15 inches.  The average weight of the walleye we sampled was about 2 pounds.  Local anglers reported good angling for walleye from 1 to 6 pounds in 1995.East Graham has a very impressive black crappie population.  The number of black crappie per trapnet was almost three times higher than what we would consider a normal population.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 9 to almost 14 inches with an average length of about 10 ? inches. The average weight for black crappie was just under 1 pound.  Out of 241 crappie measured, 39 were 12 inches or longer. Other fish species sampled in East Graham included yellow perch, bigmouth buffalo, carp, white sucker, yellow and black bullhead.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of East Graham Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Graham is a 604 acre lake located in Nobles County.  The lake has 6.5 miles of shoreline and has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet.  East Graham has been aerated since 1985 in attempt to reduce winterkill of gamefish.  The lake is presently managed primarily for walleye and northern pike while yellow perch are managed secondarily.  Walleye were never stocked until 2001 but historically the lake has maintained a good walleye population.  It is possible that walleye enter into East Graham from West Graham and/or the Des Moines River.Walleye numbers would be considered normal when compared to other lakes similar to East Graham.  Numbers were down however from the last two assessments.  Heavy fishing pressure combined with a fairly substantial winterkill in West Graham could explain why the numbers are lower.  It appears the fry stocked in 2001 had good success and should be available for harvest in the near future.  Lengths of walleye ranged from 10.3 to 22.1 inches and averaged 15.4 inches.Northern pike numbers would also be considered normal when compared to similar lakes.  Numbers were similar to what we saw during are assessment in 1999.  Lengths of northern pike ranged from 16.9 to 28.8 inches and averaged 21.5 inches during the 2003 assessment.  Several different ages were observed during the assessment which tells us there is pretty good natural reproduction.Black crappie numbers were high when compared to other lakes similar to East Graham.  Lengths of black crappie ranged from 5.5 to 12.8 inches and averaged about 7.7 inches.  Many of the fish sampled were only one year old and should provide for excellent fishing oportunities in the future.No yellow perch were sampled during the 2003 survey.Black bullhead numbers were normal when compared to similar lakes.  Lengths of black bullhead ranged from 5.1 to 10.6 inches and averaged 7.2 inches.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of East Graham Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Graham Lake is a 604-acre lake located near the Town of Kinbrae in Nobles County.  East Graham Lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet, and typically has turbid water. East Graham Lake has historically been susceptible to low dissolved oxygen levels during winters, as it was opened to liberalized fishing 16 times from 1952 to 1982.  Historically lakes were opened to liberalized fishing once dissolved oxygen levels got down to 2.0 parts per million.  Subsequently we have learned that many times these systems achieve that level and don't winterkill. More recently, East Graham Lake experienced low dissolved oxygen levels during the winter of 2009-2010 and the winter of 2013-2014; however, no significant winterkills were reported.  The Power House Ice Eater system replaced the old Helixor system in 2007 and continues to be operated by the Nobles County Parks Department.  East Graham Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Black Crappie.  Walleye fry are stocked at a rate of 500 per littoral acre, two out of three years.  Black Crappie have not been stocked in the last decade because they are able to maintain their population through natural reproduction, or through immigration from connected waterbodies.  Northern Pike were stocked in 2022 to supplement the existing population, but prior to that had not been stocked in the last decade.  East Graham Lake was surveyed the week of June 14, 2022 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and eight trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in East Graham have varied from 3.7 per gill net in 2003 to 33.7 per gill net in 1999 and have averaged 12.4 per gill net since 1986.  The 2022 Walleye catch rate was 4.7 per gill net, which is below the long-term average of 12.4 per gill net, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Walleye lengths ranged from 13.4 inches to 25.6 inches and averaged 19.2 inches.  Six year classes of Walleye were sampled including fish from stocked years (2013, 2017, and 2018) and fish from non-stocked years (2016, 2019, and 2020).  These year classes of fish that show up in non-stocked years may be an indication of natural reproduction and/or immigration.  Despite the lower catch rate, East Graham produces a good Walleye bite during early ice annually.   <br> \n <br> \nSince 1986, Northern Pike catch rates have averaged 3.2 per gill net, with catch rates ranging from 0 per gill net in 1991 to 8.3 per gill net in 2015.  In 2022, the Northern Pike catch rate was 1.3 per gill net, which is near the lower end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 per gill net).  Historically, the Northern Pike Population has been sustained through natural reproduction, as there are several wetlands present around the lake that provide spawning habitat when connected during the spawning season. Additionally, connections to the West Fork of the Des Moines River, West Graham Lake, and Fulda Lakes likely allow for Northern Pike movement from these waterbodies. Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 17.7 inches to 34.6 inches and averaged 25.6 inches.  Northern Pike fingerlings (n=676) were stocked during the fall of 2022 to supplement the existing population.  East Graham Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike longer than 24 inches can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates in East Graham Lake have been highly variable since 1986, ranging from 0.5 per trap net in 2015 to 68 per trap net in 2007 and averaging 25.6 per trap net over that span.  In 2022, the Black Crappie catch rate was 26.3 per trap net, slightly above the long-term average and exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 6.0 inches to 13.4 inches and averaged 7.7 inches.  Black Crappie exceeding 10.0 inches comprised nearly 20 percent of the trap net sample and should provide a quality angling opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum have not been sampled in East Graham prior to the 2022 survey, during which they were sampled at a rate of 2.7 per gill net and 0.1 per trap net.  Lengths of Freshwater Drum ranged from 10.4 inches to 12.6 inches and averaged 11.0 inches.  Three Freshwater Drum were aged and were from the 2020 year-class (age-2).  This is the first time Freshwater Drum have been sampled in the West Fork of the Des Moines River watershed.  Although it is possible that the presence and/or sampling Freshwater Drum may be from illegal stocking, it would also be possible from another source (such as a watershed breach from the Little Sioux Watershed or Rock River Watershed) downstream via high water. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Yellow Perch have occurred in low abundance in East Graham Lake and that trend continued as the 2022 catch rate was 1.7 per gill net.  The Black Bullhead catch rate remained similar to prior years at 73.3 per gill net, slightly above the long-term average of 61.3 per gill net and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net).  Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 5.0 to 11.9 inches and averaged 8.7 inches.  The Channel Catfish catch rate in 2022 was the same as the catch rates in 2015 at 2.7 per gill net.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Quillback, White Sucker, Orangespotted Sunfish, White Crappie and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nEast Graham Lake is a 604-acre lake located about one mile south of the Town of Kinbrae in Nobles County.  East Graham Lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet, and has turbid water.  East Graham Lake is considered to be one of the headwaters of the West Fork of the Des Moines River, resulting in immigration and emigration of fish from the river.  East Graham Lake has historically been susceptible to low dissolved oxygen levels, as it was opened to liberalized fishing 16 times from 1952 to 1982.  More recently, East Graham Lake experienced low dissolved oxygen levels during the winter of 2009-2010 and the winter of 2013-2014; however, no significant winterkills were reported.  The Power House Ice Eater system replaced the old Helixor system in 2007 and continues to be operated by the Nobles County Parks Department.  East Graham Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Black Crappie.  Walleye are stocked at a rate of 1000 per littoral acre, two out of three years (i.e., 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016).  Northern Pike and Black Crappie have not been stocked in the last decade because they were able to maintain their populations through natural reproduction, or through immigration from connected waterbodies.  East Graham Lake was surveyed the week of June 1, 2015 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and eight trap nets. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Walleye on East Graham Lake have been highly variable, ranging from 3.7 per gill net in 2003 to 33.7 per gill net in 1999 and averaging 13.4 per gill net since 1986.  In 2015, Walleye were captured at a rate of 8.0 per gill net, which is an increase from the 2011 catch rate of 7.3 per gill net, and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net).  Lengths of Walleye in gill nets ranged from 7.7 to 20.8 inches and averaged 13.3 inches.  Eighty-six percent of the Walleye sampled in trap nets and gill nets were 12.0 to 16.0 inches in length and were age-2 fish from the 2013 fry stocking.  Other year classes sampled included Walleye from 2014 (age-1, N=2) and 2011 (age-4, N=1), which were non-stocked years.  The likelihood of natural reproduction is low, so these fish from non-stocked years likely emigrated from West Graham Lake which was stocked with Walleye fry in 2011 and 2014.  Lengths at age were 9.2 inches at age-1, and 12.8 inches at age-2, which is slightly slower growth than what is observed on other similar lakes around the state (11.0 inches at age-1 and 14.3 inches at age-2).  The 2013 year class should provide a decent angling opportunity in the near future.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate in East Graham Lake in 2015 was 8.3 per gill net, which is the highest recorded catch rate for this lake, and nearly four times higher than what we would expect for lakes similar to East Graham in the Windom management area.  Previous catch rates have ranged from 0.0 per gill net in 1991 to 4.0 per gill net in 1999 and 2003, and have averaged 3.5 per gill net since 1986.  Northern Pike have not been stocked in East Graham Lake since 1994, suggesting that this population sustains itself through natural reproduction.  Several wetlands are present around East Graham Lake which would provide good spawning habitat if water levels are high enough for Northern Pike to move into them during the spawning season. Additionally, connection to the West Fork of the Des Moines River, West Graham Lake, and outflow from Fulda Lake, likely increases Northern Pike abundance.  Lengths of Northern Pike captured in gill nets and trap nets ranged from 9.8 to 27.7 inches and averaged 21.4 inches. Northern Pike are aggressive fish that can easily be caught at times. Northern Pike angling on East Graham Lake should be good in the near future.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE  <br> \n <br> \nSince 2007, the Black Crappie catch rate has declined from 68.0 per trap net, to 2.6 per trap net in 2011, to 0.5 per trap net in 2015.  The 2015 catch rate of 0.5 per trap net was the lowest observed catch rate on East Graham Lake and is below the expected range of catch rates for lakes in the Windom management area (0.7 to 15.3 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 7.6 to 11.2 inches and averaged 10.3 inches. The decreased abundance of black crappie is likely a result of a lack of natural reproduction in recent years.  Black crappie natural reproduction tends to be highly variable and is often characterized as cyclic, with strong year classes reoccurring every three to five years.  Many times the abiotic conditions at the time of spawning determine success.  Typically, crappies key in on wind protected bays with some emergent aquatic vegetation like cattails for reproduction.  This variable and cyclic recruitment often results in a \"boom-or-bust\" crappie fishery, where years of increased angler catch rates are followed by years of decreased angler catch rates. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate in trap nets increased from 31.0 per trap net in 2011 to 144.9 per trap net in 2015, and in gill nets increased from 62.7 per gill net in 2011 to 87.0 per gill net in 2015.  The trap net catch rate exceeded the normal catch rates for similar lakes (11.5 to 132.6 per trap net), and the gill net catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net).  Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 5.1 to 13.3 inches and averaged 8.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Common Carp in gill nets and trap nets were down from the 2011 survey, decreasing from 8.7 per gill net in 2011 to 3.7 per gill net in 2015, and from 9.2 per trap net in 2011 to 2.5 per trap net in 2015.  Lengths of Common Carp ranged from 9.9 to 28.2 inches and averaged 17.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bigmouth Buffalo gill net catch rate of 36.3 per gill net was the highest recorded catch rate on East Graham Lake.  It greatly exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.8 to 7.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Bigmouth Buffalo ranged from 8.6 to 24.2 inches and averaged 12.0 inches.  Eighty percent of gill netted Bigmouth Buffalo were between 11.0 and 13.0 inches, and only four exceeded 18.0 inches.  While Bigmouth Buffalo are not a highly sought after fish by the hook and line angler, they are a native fish and prized by commercial fisherman.    <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 Channel Catfish catch rate of 2.7 per gill net was consistent with the 2011 catch rate of 3.3 per gill net.  Channel Catfish lengths ranged from 14.2 to 19.1 inches and averaged 17.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included White Sucker (N= 29), Yellow Perch (N=14), Quillback (N=3), and Yellow Bullhead (N=2).  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

East Graham Lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet, and typically has turbid water.  East Graham Lake is considered to be one of the headwaters of the West Fork of the Des Moines River, resulting in immigration and emigration of fish from the river.  East Graham Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for crappie.  East Graham Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fry in the spring of 2017, due to surplus production of this strain.  The Lower Mississippi strain was last stocked decades ago, but has persisted in several area lakes despite extensive stocking of northern strain Walleye.  A nighttime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 20, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful. <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 122.1 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that the fry stocking was very successful.  A tissue sample from 50 age-0 walleye were collected and genetically analyzed which resulted in determining that over 88% of the fish are a byproduct of this stocking.  In stocked years, the goal is to attain 30.0 per hour electrofishing.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 4.4 to 7.5 inches and averaged 5.1 inches.  If they survive the winter, the 2017 year class should be a very strong year class in the East Graham Lake Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Graham Lake is a 523-acres lake located in Nobles County.  East Graham is managed primarily for northern pike and secondarily for black crappie, yellow perch and walleye.  East Graham, like many of our area lakes, is prone to \"winterkill\", which prompted installation of a helixor aeration system in 1985.  East Graham has been and is commercially fished for common carp, bullhead, and bigmouth buffalo.The northern pike population catch rates were as expected compared to other area lakes similar to East Graham.  Total length of northern pike ranged between 14.9 and 27.3 inches and had an average of 16.7.  A considerable number of northern pike were recorded in the range of 16-18 inches which are one to two years old.  Even though walleye is managed as a secondary species, the walleye population was quite abundant.  The average gill net catch was almost 34 fish per gill net which was considerably higher than other area lakes.  Total lengths of walleye ranged between 10.4 and 21.7 inches, with an average of 16.7.  Interestingly, most of the walleye caught were from the 1995 and 1996 year classes which will likely result in good fishing the next few years providing dissolved oxygen remains adequate.The average black crappie trap net catch rate was 4.88 fish/net set which is expected for this type of lake.  Lake surveys conducted in previous years indicated black crappie numbers have been higher but crappie populations tend to be erratic in the pothole prairie region and can rebound quickly.  Even though the density was lower compared to previous surveys, the fish were larger which means more \"keepers.\"  Total lengths of black crappie in trap nets ranged between 8.1 and 12.7 inches, with an average of 11.5.  Many of the crappie sampled were in the range of 12 to 13 inches, which may be greater than six years old.  The long range goal of providing a secondary fishery was met by management efforts.The average yellow perch gill net CPUE was 4.0 fish/net set which was on the low side for this type of lake.  Total lengths of yellow perch ranged between 7.8 and 16.1 inches, with an average of 9.6.  Only two year classes of yellow perch were sampled in gill net catches which indicates limited natural reproduction.  Both adult and fingerling yellow perch were stocked in 1994.  The long range goal of providing a secondary yellow perch fishery was met by management efforts.Other fish species sampled in East Graham Lake were bigmouth buffalo, channel catfish, white sucker, yellow bullhead, fathead minnow, johnny darter, orangespotted sunfish, and spotfin shiner.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of East Graham Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Graham, in Murray County, is one of several lakes that are connected to the West Fork of the Des Moines River.  It is a 604-acre lake with a maximum depth of 8 feet.  East Graham has a history of low dissolved oxygen in winters as it was opened to liberalized fishing 16 times from 1952 to 1982.  A helixor aeration system was installed in 1985 and winterkill has not occurred since then.  In 2007, Murray County replaced the helixor system with Power House Ice Eaters.  East Graham is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike and secondarily for black crappie and yellow perch.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 4, 2007 using 3 gill nets and 8 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has rebounded since the 2003 survey.  The catch rate of walleye in gill nets was 14.7/set, which was within the expected range.  Many (59%) of the fish were 14 inches and greater.  Ageing information from bone structures indicated most (75%) of the fish were from a fry stocking in 2004.  Previous surveys on East Graham also documented success of fry stocking.  Anglers should definitely consider East Graham if they are looking to take a couple of eaters home for a meal.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch rate in East Graham has been relatively consistent over the years.  The catch rate in gill nets was 3.7/set in 2007, 4.0/set in 2003, 4.0/set in 1999, and 2.6/set in 1995.  The large watershed and a connection to the West Fork of the Des Moines River likely contribute to the consistent northern pike abundance.  No northern pike have been stocked in East Graham since 1994.  Total lengths in 2007 ranged from 17.6 to 30.0 inches with an average of 22.3 inches.  There is real potential to catch some northern pike in the middle of summer if an angler would target the cool water refuge of field tile inputs. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was the highest ever documented on East Graham.  Total lengths ranged from 7.4 to 13.0 inches with an average of 10.6 inches.  Most of the fish (87%) were 10 inches and greater.  The take home message is that if an angler wants some potentially good crappie fishing, consider East Graham as your first stop.  The numbers are high and the sizes are big. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance in East Graham has never been considered \"good\" over the years.  Only 4 yellow perch were sampled in 2007 in gill nets and trap nets combined.  Consider some other area lake for yellow perch angling. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance equaled the highest recorded on East Graham.  Total lengths ranged from 5.1 to 8.5 inches with an average of 6.5 inches.  If you want some bullheads in the spring consider some other area lakes for some bigger bullheads. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured were bigmouth buffalo, channel catfish, common carp, green sunfish, and white suckers. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Ryan Doorenbos     <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Graham, in Nobles County, is one of several lakes that are connected to the West Fork of the Des Moines River.  It is a 604-acre lake with a maximum depth of 8 feet.  East Graham has a history of low dissolved oxygen in winters as it was opened to liberalized fishing 16 times from 1952 to 1982.  A Helixor aeration system was installed in 1985 and winterkill has not occurred since then.  In 2007, Murray County replaced the Helixor system with Power House Ice Eaters.  East Graham is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike and secondarily for black crappie.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of May 31, 2011 using 3 gill nets and 10 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of walleye in gill nets was 7.3 per set, which was within the expected range for lakes similar to East Graham.  Many (63%) of the fish were 14 inches and greater with an impressive average length of 16.5 inches.  Ageing information from bone structures indicated (90%) of the fish aged came from the 2008 and 2009 fry stocking.  Previous surveys on East Graham also documented success of fry stocking.  The odds certainly fall in your favor when you hook up with a walleye on East Graham it will be a \"keeper\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch rates in East Graham have been relatively consistent over the years.  The catch rate in gill nets was 2.0 per set in 2011, 3.7 per set in 2007, 4.0 per set in 2003, 4.0 per set in 1999, and 2.6 per set in 1995.  The large watershed and a connection to the West Fork of the Des Moines River likely contribute to the consistent northern pike abundance.  No northern pike have been stocked in East Graham since 1994. Total lengths ranged from 14.1 to 32.8 inches with a mean of 23.8 inches. There is real potential to catch some northern pike in the middle of summer if an angler would target the cool water refuge of field tile inputs. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie trap net catch rate in East Graham was 2.6 per set and within the expected range of lakes similar to East Graham. Total lengths ranged from 6.6 to 12.2 inches with an overall average of 9.9 inches.  The overall relative weight for all length groups was 110, which indicates the fish are pleasantly plump. The crappies currently in East Graham are not trophies but can provide some action when other species are not cooperating.  <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill net catch rate in East Graham was up from 1.3 fish per set in 2007 to 6.0 fish per set in 2011. Despite the unimpressive catch rate for a Windom area lake, the yellow perch catch rate was the highest ever recorded at East Graham. Lengths of yellow perch in East Graham ranged from 5.6 to 9.3 inches.  Yellow perch in East Graham are not trophies, but in a few years could provide some decent fishing. <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead catch rate in gill nets was 62.7 per set, which was within the expected range of lakes similar to East Graham. Total lengths ranged from 5.8 to 11.5 inches with a mean of 8.3 inches. The black bullhead population is down from 2007, but the overall size has increased from an average size of 6.5 inches in 2007 to 8.3 inches in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in 2011 were bigmouth buffalo, channel catfish, yellow bullhead, common carp, bluegill, green sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, white suckers, johnny darter, emerald shiner, and fathead minnow.  <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Luke Rossow    <br> \n         <br> \n</p>",
