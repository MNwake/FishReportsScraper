                "narrative": "<p>Lichen Lake is currently managed for walleye and northern pike, although it also supports a limited muskellunge fishery.  The lake has a reputation for producing large numbers of walleye, and the management goal for the species has been set at a relatively high 10.0 fish/gill net set.  Although northern pike are the designated secondary management species, the management goal is directed at the combined northern pike and muskellunge populations (a minimum gill net catch of 1.5 fish/set for northern pike and muskellunge combined).  Smallmouth bass became established in this lake sometime after 1991, and were first sampled in DNR gear in 2005. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were fairly abundant in Lichen Lake in 2014, although most were small.  Although good numbers of fish were present, the 2014 walleye gill net catch failed to meet the ambitious goals for the species established in the 2010 management plan, and was the second lowest observed to date in this lake.  No walleye larger than 20 inches were collected in gill nets, although two fish of that size were taken in trap net gears.  The mean weight for walleye taken in gill nets was below the normal range for this lake type, and was the lowest seen to date in this lake.  Walleye reproductive success had been good; several year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the catch, and it appeared that 2012 and 2010 year classes had been fairly strong.  Low mean weight for walleye taken in gill nets may have been the result of the relatively high number of small two-year-old fish included in the catch.   Growth of young walleye collected in 2014 had been somewhat slower than average.  Fish reached an average length of 12.3 inches by the end of their fourth year, compared to an area mean of 13.8 inches in similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe combined gill net catch of northern pike and muskellunge in 2014 (1.5 fish/set), and the presence of several muskellunge larger than 25 inches, met goals established in the 2010 management plan for the two species combined.  However, no northern pike were collected in any of the sampling gears used, suggesting their abundance was very low.  Northern pike gill net catches have been low in this lake since muskellunge became well established (in the early 1980s).  Muskellunge gill net catch and mean weight were within normal ranges for the lake type in 2014.  Muskellunge in this lake are all descendants of Shoepack-strain fish stocked in 1977; as a result, this lake will likely produce very few, if any, fish larger than 40 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were still present in Lichen Lake in 2014, but were probably not abundant.  Gill and trap net catches were at the low end of normal ranges for this type of lake.  No smallmouth bass larger than 11 inches were collected. <br> \n <br> \nForage for walleye and muskellunge was provided by yellow perch and white sucker.  Gill net catches of both species have been lower since muskellunge became established, and have generally been near the low end of normal ranges for the lake type since that time.  Catches in 2014 were similar to those observed in assessments done since 1982.  Most of the yellow perch collected were under eight inches in length, and offered little angling potential. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The average size of walleye caught was also the lowest recorded for this lake, but exceeded over one-fourth of the values recorded for this lake class.  Walleye have not been stocked, so all walleye resulted from natural reproduction, which was successful in most years.  Ages of caught walleye were determined to be two through five, and seven through ten.  Walleye had grown at close to the average rate for the lake class.The number of muskellunge caught was normal for this lake, but was low for the lake class.  The number of northern pike caught was low for both this lake and the lake class.This is the first assessment that caught smallmouth bass, although anglers reported the presence of bass since the last assessment (1991).  Bass appeared to have grown at about the average rate for the area.Yellow perch abundance appeared to be about the same as in 1991, and was low for this lake.  The average size of perch was larger than usual, and some large fish were present. </p>",
