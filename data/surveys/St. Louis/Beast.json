It is located in Voyageurs National Park and the access is limited to a 3/4 mile portage going west off of Mica Bay on Namakan Lake.  The sportfish community is comprised of northern pike and smallmouth bass.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net abundance in this investigation was 2.33/set which is just below the median of similar lakes, and mean weight was 3.52 lbs.  Lengths ranged from 14.0 to 30.4 with a mean of 25.5 inches.  Ages ranged from 2-9 with good representation of all year classes present.  Growth rates were near the average for lakes in the International Falls management area.   <br> \n <br> \nOpen water angling was also used to sample smallmouth bass.  Nineteen bass were captured in 8 angler hours of fishing for a CPUE of 2.38/hour.  Lengths ranged from 5.3 to 17.5 with a mean of 10.7 inches.  Eleven year classes were present with ages ranging from 2 to 12 years and good distribution throughout the ages.  Growth rates appeared to be slightly slower than average for lakes in the area.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled were one white sucker in a gill net and 122 blacknose shiner's in quarter inch trapnets. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beast Lake is a 81 acre lake located approximately 29 miles ESE of International Falls.  The lake is in Voyageurs National Park and access is limited to a portage from Mica Bay on Namakan Lake.  Northern pike and smallmouth bass compose the sport fish community.  However, Beast Lake is currently closed to fishing.  Fishing was closed in 1995 to facilitate the restoration of a breeding population of northern pike, which at one time was the native predator in Beast Lake.  Northern pike were reintroduced in 1995; a total of 223 adults were stocked from 1995-1997.       Northern pike were captured by using a variety of gear types in the 2001 survey.  Northern pike gill net abundance was 0.7 fish/lift, which was well below average for similar lakes.  Mean weight of northern pike in gill nets was also well below average.  Seven year-classes were present in all gear types combined and age ranged from 0-7 years.  Several recent year-classes were present, indicating that the stocked northern pike have successfully spawned in Beast Lake.  Total length in all gear types combined ranged from 2.6-34.4 in and length at age-4 was similar to the area average.           Smallmouth bass were only captured by angling.  Six year-classes were sampled.  Age ranged from 2-7 years with age-3 fish composing 39% of the sample.  Although no age-0 fish were captured, they were observed at several locations during the survey.  Total length of fish captured by angling ranged from 4.6-15.5 in and the mean was 9.4.  Total length at age-4 was similar to the area average.  Sizes and numbers of smallmouth bass found in Beast Lake are indicative of a balanced population.               </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beast Lake is located approximately 28 miles ESE of International Falls on the Kabetogama Peninsula in Voyageurs National Park. Access is limited to a portage trail from the west end of Mica Bay on Namakan Lake. Beast is a Class 10 lake with a total surface area of 85 acres, maximum depth of 66 feet and a mean depth of 20 feet. Water chemistry analysis indicates a soft-water lake typical of the Canadian Shield, with low productivity and low fertility. Two small inlets are present and one outlet that drops approximately 92 feet on its way to Namakan Lake. The aquatic vegetation survey in 2001 found a relatively diverse plant community, with low abundance. Shoal water substrates consisted primarily of ledge rock, boulder, rubble, silt, and muck. Northern Pike and Walleye spawning habitat was rated poor, sunfish spawning habitat was rated fair, and Smallmouth Bass spawning habitat was rated good. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fishing regulations on Beast Lake for Northern Pike follow the Northeast Zone regulation, which is a possession limit of two with not more than one over 40\" in possession and all Northern Pike from 30-40\" must be immediately released. Bass fishing regulations follow the Northeast Zone regulation, which is six combined Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass possession limit. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catch rate was 2.2 fish per net, which is below the average for similar lakes. Catch rate was below the management goal of 3.0 fish per net for Beast Lake. Total length ranged from 21.7 to 28.7 inches and the mean length was 24.1 inches. Mean weight of Northern Pike captured in gill nets was 3.2 pounds which is well above average for similar lakes. A total of four year classes were present, and ages ranged from 3 - 6 years. Beast Lake offers a decent fishing opportunity for Northern Pike, with the right size Northern Pike for a good shore lunch.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass gill-net catch rate was 0.3 fish per net, which is below the average for similar class lakes. Smallmouth bass fishing can be fair in Beast Lake. <br> \n</p>",
