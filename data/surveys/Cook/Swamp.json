                "narrative": "<p>Swamp Lake lies just inside the BWCAW boundary and can be reached by a single modest (0.3 mile) and level portage trail from Poplar Lake. The native fish community of Swamp Lake likely consisted of Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and White Sucker. Walleye were first stocked into Swamp Lake in 1939 and 1940 which resulted in a naturalized population. A suspected winterkill in 1976 triggered frequent Walleye fry stocking between 1977 and 1993 to restore the fishery. Results from a 1993 standard lake survey identified several strong, naturally produced year classes, confirming a naturalized population had been restored. <br> \n <br> \nThe current (2015) lake management plan for Swamp Lake identified Walleye as the primary management species with a goal of maintaining a population with a minimum gill net catch of 6.0 fish/set and some fish over 20 inches present. Northern Pike are the secondary management species and have a management goal of maintaining a minimum gill net catch of 3.0 fish/set and some fish over 25 inches present. The 2022 survey was completed to evaluate the status of the Walleye and Northern Pike populations, to monitor for new species introductions, or identify population changes caused by potential winterkill. This was the first standard lake survey completed since 1993. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have typically appeared very abundant in Swamp Lake in past standard surveys not influenced by winterkill, with gill net catch rates in those surveys falling well above the normal range for Walleye in this type of lake. Because of the potential for very high catches (and high sampling mortality) in this small wilderness lake, the 2022 standard survey was to include up to four gill net sets but could be halted if a sufficient sample size was obtained with fewer nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Walleye gill net catch (32.50 fish/set) was once again very high and included fish across a wide range of sizes (8.5-23.7 inches), thus meeting the abundance and size goal identified for the population. As a result, only two gill net sets were completed. The mean length and weight of Walleye was a respectable 16.5 inches and 1.6 pounds. Twelve naturally produced year classes (ages one through twelve) contributed to the sample. A stronger year class produced in 2012 accounted for about 36% of the Walleye catch, although multiple year classes between ages two and seven were well represented. Walleye growth rates from this survey were considered average; fish reached a mean length of 15.9 inches by the end of their fifth year, compared to an area mean of 16.3 inches for this class of lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catches fluctuated between high and low catch rates in past surveys of Swamp Lake. The 2022 survey sampled a few Northern Pike in the 23-24-inch range, but relative abundance appeared to fall below the catch goal for the population. Yellow Perch appeared moderately abundant in 2022 and represented a good forage base for Walleye and Northern Pike. White Sucker and Pumpkinseed Sunfish abundance appeared low in 2022. No new fish species were observed in 2022. <br> \n <br> \nThe Grand Marais area has been subject to multiple severe winters over the past ten years that could have resulted in low dissolved oxygen levels or potential partial winterkills in shallow lakes. The winter of 2022 qualified as such, with a deep snowpack and the period of ice cover running from December to May. These survey results suggested no measurable winterkills had occurred in Swamp Lake in recent years. <br> \n</p>",
