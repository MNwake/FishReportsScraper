                "narrative": "<p>Middle Crooked Lake is located in Hubbard County, five miles north of Nevis.  Middle Crooked has a surface area of 294 acres and a maximum depth of 33 feet.  There is a DNR access with a concrete ramp located on the northeast shore of the lake.  With the exception of the middle bay, much of the lake is shallow, with 88% of the lake area less than 15 feet deep.  Due to its shallow depth, Middle Crooked has experienced periodic partial winterkill events.  Dissolved oxygen levels can become low during long winters with heavy snow fall.  Gamefish such as largemouth bass and bluegill are less tolerant of low oxygen levels than are black bulllhead and northern pike.  Abundance of certain gamefish species has fluctuated with these winterkill events.Middle Crooked provides fishing opportunities for northern pike and panfish.  Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (4.1 pike/gillnet), similar to past surveys.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.1 inches and 2.0 pounds, with pike measured up to 31.8 inches.  Good numbers of black crapppie and bluegill were sampled, however, fish ran small in size.  Black crappie up to 10.5 inches were sampled, while few bluegill over 6.0 inches were sampled.  Past surveys have shown larger bluegill (> 7.0 inches) to be present in moderate numbers.  Age analysis showed slow growth rates for gamefish species.  Middle Crooked has an abundant black bullhead population.  A high black bullhead population in this area is an indicator of a lake that experiences partial winterkill.Other species sampled included low numbers of largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, yellow perch, and golden shiner.  White sucker were sampled in moderate numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Crooked is located five miles north of Nevis in central Hubbard County.  Middle Crooked has a surface area of 289 acres and a maximum depth of 33 feet.  With the exception of the middle bay, much of the lake is shallow, with 89% of the lake area less than 15 feet deep.  There is a state-owned public access located on the northeast shore of the lake off County Road 2.  Due to its shallow depth, Middle Crooked has experienced periodic partial winterkill events.  Dissolved oxygen levels can become low during long winters with heavy snow fall.  Gamefish such as Largemouth Bass and Bluegill are less tolerant of low oxygen levels than are Northern Pike and bullhead species.  Abundance of certain gamefish species has fluctuated with these partial winterkill events. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) had classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Middle Crooked is in lake class 35.  Class 35 lakes generally have a very irregular shaped shoreline and very high littoral area (water depth less than 15 feet). <br> \n <br> \nMiddle Crooked provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, panfish, and Largemouth Bass.  Present and past surveys have shown a moderate Northern Pike population composed of small to medium sized fish.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 20.9 inches and 2.0 pounds with fish measured up to 31.9 inches.  Good numbers of Black Crappie and Bluegill were sampled, however, fish ran small in size.  Sampled Black Crappie were less than 10 inches and few Bluegills were over 7 inches sampled.  Age analysis showed very slow growth rates for Black Crappie and Bluegill.  The Largemouth Bass population in Middle Crooked fluctuates from very low to moderate numbers depending on the frequency of winterkill events.  Largemouth Bass up to 17.5 inches were sampled.  Yellow Perch were sampled in low numbers and generally not a preferred size for angling.  Yellow Perch up to 8.5 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of Yellow Bullhead, and low numbers of Pumpkinseed and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Middle Crooked.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft ad drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

Both species of Bullhead were above the region average.  No Largemouth Bass were caught, therefore they could have winter killed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Numbers of Walleye sampled (0.50 fish/gill net) were below the first quartile, but 2.15 lbs/gill net was within the normal range for lake class 35 of the Schupp classification system.  These numbers result in a high mean weight of 4.30 lbs., however, sample size is small (n=2).  1986 was the first year Walleye were sampled during a survey.  Sample size was too low to analyze age, growth or size structure.  Middle Crooked Lake is not stocked.  Catch rates of Northern Pike (3.25 fish/gill net & 4.35 lbs/gill net) were below the first quartile in 1991.  Northern Pike exhibit slow growth (16.53 inches at age 5) with high variability within year classes.  The small sizes are reflected in the mean weight of fish sampled (1.34 lbs.) and the low gill net Proportional Stock Density (PSD) of 8.  No Northern Pike are reaching preferred length and few are even reaching quality length.  Recruitment appears consistent for those year classes vulnerable to the sampling gear.  Bluegill and Black Crappie catches were within the normal ranges for lakes of this class.  Both species also have good, nearly identical, size distributions (Bluegill PSD=49, Relative Stock Density-Preferred (RSD-P) =12; Black Crappie PSD=49, RSD-P=11, Relative Stock Density-Memorable (RSD-M) =3.  Bluegill growth rates are good, with age 4 fish averaging 5.59 inches.  Black Crappie exhibit slower growth as a species than the Bluegill, attaining a mean length of 6.71 inches at age 4.  Bluegill densities have consistently been within the normal ranges, while those of Black Crappie are recovering from low years in 1962 and 1986.  Catches of Largemouth Bass and Pumpkinseed were above the third quartile.  1991 was the first year Largemouth Bass were sampled in Middle Crooked Lake.  Pumpkinseed abundance has been fluctuating above and below the normal range since 1962, with no apparent trends.  Growth rates are slow (4.43 inches at age 4) and this results in a population dominated by small fish (PSD=11).  Yellow Perch catch rates (1.25 fish/gill net and 0.15 lbs/gill net) were below the first quartile in 1991, decreasing greatly since 1986.  Catches of Golden Shiner and White Sucker were within the normal ranges for lakes of this classification.  Yellow Bullhead catch rates were also within the normal ranges, however, Black Bullhead abundance is well above the third quartile.  Sizes of Bullhead are small.  In 1964 and 1974, Bullhead were removed from the lake, but they continue to thrive.  The historical abundance fluctuations observed for many of the species is probably the result of occasional partial winterkills.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Crooked Lake is located five miles north of Nevis in central Hubbard County. Middle Crooked has a surface area of 289 acres and a maximum depth of 33 feet. There is a state owned public access located on the northeast end of the lake off County Road 2.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Middle Crooked is in lake class 35.  These lakes generally have an irregular shape and a very high littoral area. Based on the 2012 sampling Middle Crooked provides angling opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish. <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was in line with past surveys and similar lakes.  Northern pike had an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 2 pounds, with the largest measuring 33 inches. <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was in line with similar lakes in 2012. Black crappies sampled had an average length of 8.5 inches.  Only one fish sampled was over 10 inches in length.  The low abundance of large crappies provides minimal angling opportunities. <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in low numbers compared to similar lakes. Yellow perch sampled were 6.5 \u0013 9 inches in length.  Yellow perch are likely not abundant or large enough to attract anglers. <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance was above the normal range for similar lakes. Fish were sampled up to 19 inches in length with an average length and weight of 14 inches and 1.6 pounds. <br> \nBluegills were the most abundant panfish species sampled in 2012.  Abundance was below the long term average for Middle Crooked, but still near the average for similar lakes. Bluegills sampled were from 3.5 \u0013 8 inches in length with an average length of 6 inches. <br> \nOther species sampled included a large number of yellow bullheads, moderate numbers of pumpkinseed, walleye and rock bass. <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Middle Crooked Lake.  These species are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake-shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.</p>",
