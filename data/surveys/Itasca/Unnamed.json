                "narrative": "<p>Unnamed water (31-1225) is known locally as O'Brien Reservoir #4 and is located about two miles east of Nashwauk, MN.  There is a city administered park, including a beach and fishing pier, along with an access on the east side of the impoundment.  The reservoir was created as a water supply for mining in 1977-1978 by impounding O'Brien Creek, but has since been abandoned.  Walleye have been stocked at various times since 1983.  Black crappie and northern pike were listed as primary management species while bluegill, largemouth bass, and walleye were secondary management species. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one black crappie was sampled, below the range for lakes similar to O'Brien.  This was down from the previous historically high catches observed in gill nets and trap nets.  Angler reports suggest crappie were frequently targeted with good success at times. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the most numerous fish sampled in gill nets, sampled at the lake class average and similar to the previous assessment.  Size structure was poor.  Lengths ranged from 14.1 to 30.0 inches with an average of 20.4 inches.  Scale and bone analysis identified ages 1 to 5 suggesting relatively consistent recruitment.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for all ages.  Northern pike averaged 21.4 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate exceeding the lake class average and above the previous assessment.  Lengths ranged from 14.5 to 20.8 inches with an average length of 16.8 inches.  Scale and bone analysis identified ages 3, 4, and 8.  Age 3 comprised 67% of the sample, which correlates to the 2010 stocking.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for all ages.  Walleye averaged 17.4 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were actively sampled by electrofishing at a rate of 94.2/on-time, double the previous assessment (42.6/on-time).  Size structure was moderate.  Lengths ranged from 4.9 to 19.3 inches with an average length of 9.6 inches.  Scale analysis identified ages 2 to 9, indicating consistent recruitment.  Growth was slow early, but similar to the statewide average by age 3.  Largemouth bass averaged 15.2 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled at a rate lower than expected and below the previous assessment.  Size structure was surprisingly favorable.  Lengths ranged from 5.2 to 12.4 inches with an average length of 9.0 inches.  Scale and otolith analysis identified ages 3 to 9 in the sample and growth appeared average.  Perch averaged 10.3 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate lower than expected and the previous assessment.  Size structure was poor, as lengths ranged from 2.9 to 7.5 inches with an average length of 4.2 inches.  Scale analysis identified ages 2 to 4, 6, and 7 present in the sample.  Growth was similar to Ecological Lake Class 28 averages. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAs part of IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) near shore sampling, Iowa darter, blacknose shiner, bluegill, green sunfish, and yellow perch were sampled in one 15 foot seine haul.  Backpack electrofishing sampled Iowa darter, Johnny darter, black crappie, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, central mudminnow, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, tadpole madtom, and yellow perch at 10 stations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Unnamed water (31-1225) is known locally as O'Brien Reservoir #4 and is located about two miles east of Nashwauk, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  There is a city-administered park, including a beach and fishing pier with an access on the east side of the impoundment.  The reservoir was created as a water supply for mining in 1977-1978 by impounding O'Brien Creek, but has since been abandoned.  The lake management plan (LMP) was last updated in 2014.  Black Crappie and Northern Pike were listed as primary management species while Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Walleye were secondary management species.  A standard lake survey was conducted in August 2023 to update information on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nOnly three Black Crappie were sampled for a catch rate of 0.3/trap net, well below average for the lake and lakes with similar habitat.  Sampled crappie varied from 7.0 to 9.5 inches.  While catch rates for crappie have varied considerably, previous surveys mention they are targeted by anglers with good success at times. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch for Northern Pike was typical for the lake and lakes with similar habitat.  Size structure was poor.  Lengths ranged from 13.2 to 30.2 inches with an average length of 19.9 inches.  Ages 1 through 4, 6 and 8 were represented in the sample with average growth rates.  Pike averaged 20.8 inches after 4 years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population has typically had low to moderate numbers and poor size structure.  The 2023 trap-net catch was below the typical range for comparable lakes but similar to the previous survey on O'Brien.  Size structure remained poor; sampled Bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 7.8 inches with an average length of 4.4 inches.  Ages 2 through 6 were represented in the sample.  Growth was average with Bluegill exceeding six inches after five years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill-net catch was above average for O'Brien Reservoir and lakes with similar habitat.  Size structure was favorable; Walleye ranged from 11.7 to 21.8 inches with an average length of 15.8 inches.  Five year-classes from ages 2 to 9 were represented in the sample.  Walleye have been stocked at various times since 1983, but only twice since the previous survey in 2013.  Five of the eleven Walleye corresponded to a fry-stocked year (2019), with the remaining fish attributed to natural reproduction.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with Walleye exceeding 17 inches after five years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch for Yellow Perch was below the typical range for comparable lakes and below average for O'Brien Reservoir.  Some larger perch were present as fish up to 12.6 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in low numbers with one fish exceeding 17 inches.  A previous survey employing electrofishing showed O'Brien Reservoir contains good numbers of moderate-sized bass. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test-nets included Black Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>O'Brien Reservoir is located two miles east of Nashwauk, MN.  The lake has a city administered park and access on the east side.  The lake management plan indicated that black crappie and northern pike were the primary species and bluegill and largemouth bass were secondary species for management.Black crappie catch rates for gill nets and trap nets were at record highs for the lake.  In 2003, the gill-net (6.0 fish/net) and trap-net catch rates (6.3 fish/net) were both high relative to other lakes similar to O'Brien Reservoir.  Although catch rates were high, most of the fish were smaller and a result of two strong year-classes.  The sampled fish ranged from 4.0 to 7.6 inches and averaged 5.4 inches.  Four year-classes from one to four years old were determined from scale analysis.  The strong 2001 and 2002 year-classes represented 60 and 33% of the sample, respectively.  Growth was similar to statewide averages.  Despite bluegill not being sampled in any assessments prior to 1989, they now represent a substantial part of the fish community.  In 2003, trap net catch rates (25.4 fish/net) were above average for these types of lakes.  The fish ranged from 3.4 to 6.9 inches and averaged 4.6 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.Largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing during the spring.  A total of 51 largemouth bass were sampled resulting in a catch rate of 41.9 fish/hour.  These fish ranged from 3.8 to 17.1 inches and averaged 10.2 inches.  Scale analysis indicated nine year-classes from one to nine years old were present.  Two and three year old fish accounted for 67% of the sample.  Growth rates were similar to statewide averages with fish attaining nearly 14 inches in five years.The northern pike gill-net catch rates have varied between 1.8 and 4.8 fish/net.  The 2003 catch was the highest on record at 4.8 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 15.2 and 26.7 inches and averaged 21.3 inches.  Five year-classes from one to five years old were sampled.  Age-3 and age-4 fish represented 65% of the sample.  Growth rates were similar to the statewide average.  After four years of growth, northern pike averaged 20.5 inches.Walleye have not been stocked in O'Brien Reservoir since 1994.  Previous assessments evaluating periods of stocking found only low numbers of walleye.  The highest catch of four walleye occurred after most of the 1980s were stocked.  In 2003, four walleye were sampled in the gill nets resulting in a catch rate of 0.7 fish/net.  The fish ranged from 10.3 to 27.2 inches and averaged 16.7 inches.  Three year classes were identified from bone and scale analysis.  The two age-1 fish and the age-4 fish were naturally produced since there had been no stocking.  Growth for these fish was similar to statewide averages.Yellow perch were sampled at a gill-net catch rate of 6.8 fish/net, which was just above average for the lake.  Yellow perch were first documented in the lake in 1989 and have fluctuated about the lake class average in each assessment since.  The fish ranged from 3.7 to 12.8 inches and averaged 6.2 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.Other species sampled during the population assessment included common shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.</p>",
