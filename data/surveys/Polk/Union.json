                "narrative": "<p>Union Lake is a moderately fertile, hard-water, prairie lake.  The lake reaches a maximum depth of 84 feet with a median depth of 13 feet.  Of the total 851 acres the littoral area (less than 15 feet) covers 449 acres (53%).  Shoal water soils are entirely made up of sand or a mucky sand.  Aquatic vegetation is varied and dense.Net catches from the 1960 survey show the lake to contain normal numbers of northern pike, perch, pumpkinseed and black crappies.  Common sucker, carp, bullhead, and largemouth bass populations are lower than the regional or statewide medians.  Numbers of walleyes are somewhat below average while bluegills are over 5 times the average index of fish abundance.Present angling appears to be mainly for sunfish and with good success.  Not many years ago excellent catches of good-sized crappies were made, and angling success for walleyes and northern pike was much better too.Over the years there has been considerable development of the lakeshore property until at the present time there are 3 boat liveries and 102 cottages.  Two hundred and thirty boats were counted on the lake.  A public access has been acquired on the southern-most shore of the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Union Lake supports a diverse fishery with several popular  species including walleye, northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Its fish community has been affected by many factors including high water levels, shoreline development, vegetation removal, fishing pressure, and stocking.  Overall, however, the status of Union Lake's fishery is quite desirable and it is clear that high water has not harmed fish populations.The 1997 assessment showed that northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch indices of abundance were at an all-time high.   Northern pike and perch are generally benefited by high water since it opens up more spawning habitat for them.  Northern pike showed strong year classes in 1994 and 1995 but large pike (over 30 inches) were available as well.  The average size of northern pike was 23.0 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Yellow perch are important as the primary forage for pike, walleye, and largemouth bass as well as a control upon overabundant bluegills.Unlike other species, walleye populations in Union Lake are sustained by stocking.  The 1997 assessment came at the mid point of a ten year evaluation of walleye stocking in Union Lake.  Stocking has recently rotated between fry and fingerling to determine which is most effective in the lake.  So far, both stocking sizes have contributed to the walleye fishery, resulting in net catches exceeding those of the past and those of most other lakes of similar type.  The average walleye sampled was 16.8 inches and 1.8 pounds.Bluegill and black crappie were sampled in good numbers in Union Lake.  While net catches of bluegill are down from the extreme high in 1992, they remain strong and the average size of bluegills has increased significantly.  Nearly a fourth of the bluegills sampled were longer than seven inches.  Fishing for black crappie should get even better in the near future due to strong two and three year old age groups.Largemouth bass were present but it's difficult to speak of relative abundance because standard mid summer test net gear is not effective for sampling them.  Their angling popularily in the lake is better evidence of abundance than are test net catches.In summary, the fish community is strong, diverse, and healthy in Union Lake.  Angling for most popular target species should be good for the near future.  Landowners and anglers can help maintain fish populations, property values, and water quality by exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems (understandably difficult with current water levels), not fertilizing lawns (or using phosphorus free fertilizers), leaving wide shoreline buffer zones of unmown, natural vegetation, leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially emergents like bulrushes and cattails) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water, releasing medium to large fish, and acquiring DNR permits for aquatic plant removal and shoreline alterations.  Guides are available from the DNR for riparian owners who desire to alter shoreline areas while doing the least harm to (or even benefitting) the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike numbers have decreased from the highest recorded mean gillnet catch of 8.1/GN in 1987 to 2.9/GN in 1992, slightly less than the first quartile for class #25 lakes.  Even though two and five-year-old fish made up 64% of the sample, the small sample size and the lack of fish smaller than 17 inches indicate poor natural reproduction in recent years.  Although northern pike spawning habitat is considered to be favorable in Union Lake, drought conditions during the past three years probably affected spawning success.  A general increase in size of sampled pike has developed since the initial survey in 1947, when fish averaged 15.9 inches and 1.0 lb.  Presently, average weight is 3.3 lb., PSD is 75% and RSD(30) is 4%.  Growth rates are within the normal range.  \"Rescued\" northern pike were stocked regularly in the lake during the fifties, sixties and early seventies.  They have been stocked in only one year (1986) since 1974.  Brown bullheads continue to occupy a very small portion of the total net catch at 0.5 fish/GN and none in trapnets.  Black bullheads have not been sampled since 1960 and yellow bullheads have never been captured in test nets in Union Lake.  Carp are observed annually during spawning movements, but, none were taken in nets in 1992.  They were first reported in 1960.  In contrast to some lakes, more vegetative damage in Union Lake can be attributed to human destruction (especially bulrush beds) than to carp activity over the past 30 years.Bluegills remain overabundant, small and slow-growing.  The only information about bluegills on the 1947 survey was a statement that \"sunfish\" were below average numbers.  Sunfish were stocked (possibly an initial stocking) in 1942 and 1943.  By 1960, bluegills were considered abundant and stunted at 37 fish/TN.  Labor-intensive sunfish removal in the early eighties did not slow the trend and bluegills presently average 82 fish/TN.  The increasing trend in abundance has been accompanied by a decreasing trend in average size.  Only 14% of the 1992 sample consisted of bluegills over six inches in length, with none longer than eight inches.  In contrast, the PSD for bluegills in 1960 was 46% and RSD(8) was 18%.  Their growth rate is slower than normal.Black crappies and largemouth bass are difficult to assess during normal summer netting operations.  Abundance of both species, however, appears to be within the normal range for class #25 lakes.  Scale aging indicates a high proportion of the sample for both species consists of '91-year-class fish.  Growth rates appear normal.  Although size trend analysis is generally unreliable with small samples, evidence points to a decline in average size of black crappies.  In fact, 14 net-captured crappies in 1947 averaged 0.75 lb. and 10.4 inches.  In 1992, 26 crappies averaged only 0.2 lb. and lengths of sampled fish ranged from 3.0-10.1 inches.  As stated previously, the 1992 sample consisted of over 50% yearlings, lowering mean size considerably.Yellow perch, considered an over-abundant nuisance rather than a valuable forage fish in 1947, declined significantly through the seventies (10.7 fish/GN in 1976).  Perch were even removed by fall netting in the early fifties.  Since '76, abundance has steadily rebounded to the current 46 fish/GN, nearly double the third quartile value for similar lakes.  Coincidentally, perch numbers were at their lowest during the period of heavy northern pike stocking.Walleye abundance has remained relatively stable during the past 45 years.  The present catch of 4.6 fish/GN is within the normal range for similar lakes.  The average weight of sampled walleyes has ranged from slightly less than one pound in 1947 to just over three pounds in 1960 and is currently over 2 pounds.  The presence of favorable sizes for anglers is indicated by a PSD of 76% and an RSD(20) of 21%.  Year-class strength comparison reinforces survey reports of fair to poor walleye spawning habitat in Union Lake.  Though some natural reproduction undoubtedly occurs, the strongest year-class (1988) comes from a year with fingerling stocking.  Similar results were reported in 1987.  Walleyes have been stocked regularly as either fry, fingerlings or yearlings since 1945 and irregularly from 1920 to 1944.The present status of fish populations in Union Lake, a highly-developed and heavily-angled Polk County lake, may be summarized as follows: (1) as northern pike numbers are decreasing, average size is increasing; (2) the increasing yellow perch population may be a result of the pike decline; (3) rough fish are not a large factor; (4) largemouth bass and black crappie are present, popular with anglers and not well-evaluated with current survey techniques; (5) bluegills continue to be over-abundant, small and slow-growing, though increasing perch numbers may impact that condition, (6) the walleye population is relatively stable, is maintained artificially by fingerling stocking and is composed of a high proportion of quality fish longer than 15 inches.</p>",

This data will be analyzed in conjunction with the Standard Survey that was completed in 2017 to evaluate the biological condition of Union Lake, and contribute to the assessment of the watershed.   <br> \nFourteen sites within Union Lake were sampled during this survey, using a backpack electrofishing unit and seines.   The fish community sampled during this assessment was not diverse, dominated by Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Spottail Shiners.  Other species sampled inclulded Iowa Darter, Central Mudminnow, Tadpole Madtom, and Yellow Perch.  Common Carp and White Sucker were observed, but not sampled.   One species intolerant of poor habitat conditions were found (Iowa Darter).  The results of this survey suggest that the fish population in Union Lake does not meet expectations for lakes of similar characteristics, suggesting that this lake is likely biologically impaired.   <br> \nMany areas of altered shoreline habitat and vegetation were observed during the survey.  A healthy, diverse aquatic plant community, along with adequate shoreline buffers are important to maintain a diverse fishery. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Union Lake continues to support a diverse fishery with several popular fish species including walleye, northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Most of these species naturally reproduce in Union Lake, despite water level fluctuations, shoreline development, aquatic vegetation removal, and fishing pressure.  Conversely, the lake's walleye population has required stocking to sustain a fishery.In 2002, net catches of walleye (6.5 per set) remained above the lake's historic average of 5.0 per set.  These walleyes averaged 15.5 inches in length and 1.6 pounds in weight.  There was a relatively strong year class of walleyes stocked as fry in 2001.  These fish were growing at a rate slightly faster than the statewide average and were about seven to nine inches long.During the past ten years, the walleye stocking regimen in Union Lake has alternated between fry stocking, fingerling stocking, and no stocking.  This was part of an attempt to evaluate the most effective stocking size for the lake.  Data indicate that both fry and fingerlings have added to the fishery, but fry may be more effective at producing strong year classes and are less expensive to stock.Northern pike, yellow perch, and bluegill net catches dropped from the assessment in 1997.  However, with the decreased competition, bluegill growth rates have improved and there are larger fish present than in recent times.  Northern pike averaged 22.5 inches (just under three pounds) but pike up to 34 inches in length were caught in test nets.As a primary forage fish for the predator fish in Union Lake, yellow perch are an important part of the fish community.  Recent decreases in net catches of perch are of concern.  The cause of the decline is likely linked to heavy predation by northern pike and walleye during the past five years.  Net catches of these two species were at historic highs in Union Lake in 1997.  Fluctuations in the perch population may also be due to the effects of changing water levels on spawning success during recent years.Climate patterns, water levels, and fish communities are dynamic, but there are some things landowners, anglers, and the DNR can do to help sustain fish populations, property values, and water quality in Union Lake.  Some of the more important actions include leaving shoreline buffer zones of natural vegetation to slow down runoff, not using fertilizers on lawns (or using phosphorus free fertilizers), protecting aquatic vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail), using guides available from the DNR or Minnesota Bookstore for designing shoreline alterations, releasing medium to large fish, and obtaining DNR permits for aquatic plant removal and desired shoreline changes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Union Lake continues to support a diverse fishery with several popular fish species including walleye, northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Most of these species naturally reproduce in Union Lake, despite water level fluctuations, shoreline development, aquatic vegetation removal, and fishing pressure.  The lake's walleye population has generally required stocking to sustain the fishery, although some natural reproduction has occurred recently. <br> \n <br> \nAt 16.1 fish per gill net, walleye catch rates in 2012 were the highest ever recorded in this lake and two of the three most abundant year classes were attributed to natural reproduction.  It is possible that fry stocking has increased the walleye population to the point where natural reproduction can be more successful than in the past.  It is also possible that water levels were favorable for providing good walleye spawning habitat during the two successful years.  Walleyes sampled in 2012 averaged 15.2 inches in length and 1.4 pounds in weight. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for northern pike, largemouth bass, and black crappie were near their historical averages for Union Lake.  Northern pike averaged 22.4 inches (about 2.4 pounds) and pike over 30 inches in length were caught in test nets.  Largemouth bass averaged 11.3 inches, but there were good ranges of size and age classes found.  Black crappies were relatively small on average (8.3 inches), but fish over 10 inches in length were not uncommon. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for bluegill and yellow perch were lower than historical catches in Union Lake but similar to those of the two prior evaluations since high water levels began in the late 1990's.  As a primary forage fish for the predator fish in Union Lake, yellow perch are an important part of the fish community.  However, in 2012 northern pike and walleye growth rates remained strong compared to statewide and historical lake indices.  At an average length of 5.4 inches, bluegills were not large, but several over eight inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nEurasian watermilfoil was found in the lake in 2007.  Initial sampling during that year revealed no signs of Eurasian watermilfoil outside of Union Lake after a series of river inspections and spot checks of the watershed that meanders southwest of Union Lake to the Red River.  The primary concern is to contain the plants so they don't spread to other lakes, or downstream into the Sand Hill River to the Red River and into Manitoba, where Eurasian watermilfoil has never been found.  More monitoring will occur, with effort focused on the drainage pump located on the southwest corner of the lake, where lake water passes into the local watershed. Because of drier conditions recently, the pump has not been operating.  Boaters entering and leaving the lake are required to drain all water and check boats, trailers and equipment for vegetation and invasive species. <br> \n <br> \nLakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging of the lake (eutrophication) by using the best management practices available.  These practices include (1) exceeding setbacks for structures and septic systems, (2) leaving buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shoreline, (3) leaving vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail) intact, (4) and minimizing fertilizer and other chemical use in the watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Union is an 887-acre, class 25 lake located in south central Polk County.  This lake has a history of large fluctuations in water levels, which are influenced primarily by ground water.  The most recent water level rises in the late 1990's resulted in the formation of a lake improvement district (LID) made up of riparian owners on both Sarah and Union lakes.  The LID facilitated construction of a pumped outlet to the Sand Hill River watershed, following property damage along the lake's shoreline.  A filtered channel from nearby Lake Sarah was also constructed as part of this project to equalize lake levels.  The channel was constructed as a filter barrier to prevent Common Carp from migrating from Union Lake to Lake Sarah, where they have not yet been found.  The discovery of Eurasian watermilfoil in Union Lake in 2007 had an effect on the future operation of the outflow pump.  Initial testing found no signs of Eurasian watermilfoil outside of Union Lake after a series of river inspections and spot checks of the wetland that meanders southwest of Union Lake to the Red River.  These findings resulted in the installation of additional filters on the pump to contain the plants so they don't spread downstream into the Sand Hill River and to the Red River, where Eurasian watermilfoil has not been found.  Ecological and Water Resources personnel will continue to periodically monitor this outlet.  However, because of drier conditions in recent years, the pump has not been operating. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2017, the mean gill net catch rate of 8.9 Walleyes per net fell from the historical high set in 2012 for Union Lake, but remained above the lake mean.  Lengths of sampled Walleyes ranged from 9.7 to 28.3 inches with a mean of 18.8 inches.  Currently, Walleye fry are stocked into Union Lake, but some natural reproduction does occur.  Two of the three strongest year classes sampled in the 2012 survey came from non-stocked years.  Though not as dominant in 2017, Walleye from all non-stocked years were again captured.  Future water level fluctuations will undoubtedly impact the success of walleye spawning success and should be monitored in the future. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch rate nearly met the lake's historic high in 2017 at 10.7 fish per net.  The historic average is 6.1 fish per net.  Sampled pike ranged from 13.9 to 29.2 inches with a mean of 22.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 trap net catch of Bluegill doubled that of 2012, but remained below the historical average.  These fish averaged 5.6 inches in length and ranged from 3.0 to 8.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance appeared to be similar to past surveys, with trap nets capturing 2.9 crappie per net.  Black Crappie sampled in trap nets had an average size of 8 inches, but individuals almost 12 inches long were encountered.   <br> \n <br> \nNo Largemouth Bass were captured in trap nets, but gill nets caught 1.2 fish per net.  Bass had an average size of 11.6 inches long, with bass up to 16 inches long also measured.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates in gill nets was higher than the 2012 survey, but still below the historical average for Union Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance continues to remain low, with a total of nine carp caught in gill nets and two carp caught in trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species encountered were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and White Sucker. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Union Lake is an 887-acre lake located in south central Polk County.  The lake has a history of large fluctuations in water levels, which are influenced primarily by ground water.  The most recent water level rises in the late 1990's resulted in the formation of a lake improvement district (LID) made up of riparian owners on both Sarah and Union lakes.  The LID facilitated construction of a pumped outlet to the Sand Hill River watershed, following property damage along the lake's shoreline.  A standard fisheries survey was conducted in early August 2022 to assess the fish populations at Union Lake. <br> \n <br> \nFollowing a record high abundance of Walleye in 2012, Walleye gill net catch rates have declined in recent years.  However, the 2022 catch rate of 6.3 Walleye per gill net is only slightly below the lake's historical average of 6.8 per net.  Lengths of sampled Walleye ranged from 7.7 to 30.1 inches with an average of 19.0 inches.  The Northern Pike gill net catch rate set a record high in 2022 at 11.9 fish per net.  The historic average is 6.1 fish per net.  Sampled Northern Pike ranged from 15.1 to 32.0 inches with an average of 21.9 inches.  About 23% of the fish sampled were over 24 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch of Bluegill was well below average in 2022 with a catch rate of 8.3 Bluegills per net.  The historical average for the lake is 36.6 per net.  These fish averaged 6.0 inches in length and ranged from 3.3 to 8.4 inches.  Black Crappie abundance increased slightly from recent surveys with trap nets capturing 3.6 per net.  Black Crappie sampled in trap nets had an average size of 8.7 inches, but individuals up to 12.1 inches long were encountered.  Gill nets caught Largemouth Bass at 1.8 fish per net.  Largemouth Bass averaged 11.5 inches long, with Largemouth Bass up to 18.1 inches long measured.  Yellow Perch abundance was low in 2022, with fish having an average length of 6.3 inches.  Trap net catches of Common Carp were similar to past surveys, but gill nets captured a record number of fish in 2022.  Other fish species sampled in 2022 included Black and Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Union Lake continues to support a diverse fishery with several popular fish species including walleye, northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Most of these species naturally reproduce in Union Lake, despite water level fluctuations, shoreline development, aquatic vegetation removal, and fishing pressure.  Conversely, the lake's walleye population has required stocking to sustain a fishery. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2007, net catches of walleye (8.7 per set) were the highest ever recorded in this lake and above the lake's historic average of 5.4 per set.  These walleyes averaged 19.6 inches in length and 2.8 pounds in weight.  All the strongest year classes of walleyes were attributed to fry stocking years and fry stocking has now replaced more expensive fingerling stocking in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike, yellow perch, black crappie and bluegill net catches increased slightly from those reported in the 2002 assessment.  Northern pike averaged 25.0 inches (about 3.5 pounds) and pike over 30 inches in length were caught in test nets. <br> \n <br> \nAs a primary forage fish for the predator fish in Union Lake, yellow perch are an important part of the fish community.  The decline in net catches of perch in 2002 were of concern, but catches have turned around in 2007 and the average gill net catch rate was just below the lake's historic average. <br> \n <br> \nEurasian watermilfoil was found in the lake in 2007.  Initial testing, found no signs of Eurasian watermilfoil outside of Union Lake after a series of river inspections and spot checks of the watershed that meanders southwest of Union Lake to the Red River.  The primary concern will be to contain the plants so they don't spread to other lakes, or downstream into the Sand Hill River to the Red River and into Manitoba, where Eurasian watermilfoil has never been found.  More monitoring will occur.  A point of concern is a drainage pump on the southwest corner of the lake, where lake water passes into the local watershed. Because of drier conditions this year, the pump has not been operating; making it less likely that milfoil could have passed through its screens. <br> \n <br> \nClimate patterns, water levels, and fish communities are dynamic, but there are some things landowners, anglers, and the DNR can do to help sustain fish populations, property values, and water quality in Union Lake.  Some of the more important actions include leaving shoreline buffer zones of natural vegetation to slow down runoff, not using fertilizers on lawns (or using phosphorus free fertilizers), protecting aquatic vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail), using guides available from the DNR or Minnesota Bookstore for designing shoreline alterations, releasing medium to large fish, and obtaining DNR permits for aquatic plant removal and desired shoreline changes. <br> \n</p>",
