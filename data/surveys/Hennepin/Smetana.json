                "narrative": "<p>This is the first survey completed on Smetana Lake.  On August 1, 2005, Smetana Lake was sampled with 2 gill nets and 9 trap nets.  A myriad of species were sampled, including black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, brown bullhead, common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Northern pike was the most abundant predator fish in the lake.  Gill net catches exceeded the 75% quartile for class 40 lakes with 14.5 pike caught per gill net.  Although the pike population is abundant, the size was small.  Mean length and weight was 19.8 inches and 2 lbs., respectively.  Most of the pike sampled were from the 2001 and 2002 year classes (3 and 4 years old) and growth was average until age 4 when it began to slow.  The number of bluegill sampled in trap nets (6.2 per net) was less than the 50% quartile for class 40 lakes.  The average fish was 5.4 inches and 0.2 lb.  However, these numbers are deceiving.  Seventeen bluegill were sampled that were over 7.5 inches long, with the largest bluegill measuring 9.5 inches.  The proportion of bluegill greater than 6 inches (PSD) was 33 and the proportion of bluegill greater than 8 inches (RSD-P) was 23.  Several year classes of bluegill were sampled, but a large year class in 2003 (2 years old) dominated the sample.  Growth was above average.Only ten black crappie total were sampled in the trap nets (1.1 per trap net).  This is below the 25% quartile for class 40 lakes.  These fish averaged 5.7 inches long and 0.14 lb, but one fish over 10 inches long (10.4 inches) was sampled.  Most of the black crappie were from the 2003 and 2004 year classes (1 and 2 years old), but the 10.4 inch crappie was seven years old.  Growth appeared to be below average.Few yellow perch were sampled (4 in gill nets and 1 in trap nets).  The average length and weight of sampled fish in gill nets was 6.3 inches and 0.12 lb., respectively.  Most of the fish were two years old with average growth.  The black bullhead population appears to be small in Smetana Lake.  Trap net catches (1.6 per net) and gill net catches (3.5 per net) were below the 25% quartiles for class 40 lakes.  The average length of fish from both nets was 8.8 inches.  No common carp were sampled in gill nets, but 14 were caught in trap nets (1.6 per trap net).  Other species that were sampled in minimal abundance were brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead.</p>",
