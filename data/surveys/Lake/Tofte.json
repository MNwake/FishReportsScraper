                "narrative": "<p>Bone Lake is a scenic lake that is managed for stream trout.  It is located in a remote part of Lake County approximately 16 miles northwest of Tofte, Minnesota within the Superior National Forest.  The lake has a surface area of 43 acres and a maximum depth of 51 feet.  The lake can be accessed by continuing up the Whitefish Lake Road (FR 348) roughly 3.5 miles past the Whitefish Lake access.  This road is rough and minimally maintained beyond the Whitefish Lake access and a high clearance vehicle is strongly recommended to reach the lake.  There is a small back-down access off of this road on the east end of Bone Lake with a parking area and a user made campsite.  The lake can also be accessed from Lake County Road 7 by pulling off approximately 3 miles northeast of the Windy Lake access then taking a trail approximately 1 mile east to the west end of the lake; this is a common access route during the winter.  The lake shore is entirely in federal ownership and there is no development.  Since Bone Lake is a designated stream trout lake, anglers should check the current regulations booklet for all applicable rules and regulations.  <br> \n <br> \nSplake is the primary management species in Bone Lake.  During the 2016 survey, Splake catch in four gillnets was average relative to other area lakes.  The average length of Splake sampled was 12.2 inches with fish up to 18.1 inches long sampled; 17 percent of the catch was 14 inches long or longer.  The average weight of Splake sampled was 0.6 pounds, average relative to other area lakes.  We estimated that there were two year classes in the sample with the 2014 year class making up 91 percent of the catch.  Growth was average relative to other area lakes.      <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout is the secondary managed species in Bone Lake.  Rainbow Trout gillnet catch was average relative to other area lakes.  The average length of Rainbow Trout sampled in gillnets was 11.3 inches with fish up to 11.6 inches long sampled.  The average weight of Rainbow Trout in gillnets was 0.5 pounds, average relative to other area lakes.  Three Rainbow Trout between 11.0 and 11.5 inches long were also sampled in trap nets during the survey.  We estimated that only the 2015 year classes of Rainbow Trout was represented in the sample.  These fish were stocked as yearlings during May of 2016. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker gillnet catch was average relative to similar lakes; average weight from gillnets was 0.9 pounds.  Trap net catch was above average relative to similar lakes; average weight from trap nets was 0.3 pounds.  Golden Shiner were also sampled in trap nets.  Iowa Darter, Blacknose Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Stickleback, Finescale Dace, Golden Shiner, Northern Pearl Dace, Northern Redbelly Dace, and Sculpin were all sampled in quarter inch mesh trap nets.  Sixty eight young of the year Yellow Perch were sampled in the quarter inch mesh trap nets, no adult Yellow Perch were sampled in any gears.  This is the first time Yellow Perch have been sampled in Bone Lake since the lake was reclaimed in 1962.    <br> \n <br> \nBone Lake has average populations of Splake and Rainbow Trout relative to other area lakes although there are some larger Splake in the lake.  Access to the lake is somewhat difficult during the summer as the road to the lake access is rough and is very difficult during the winter.  As the Yellow Perch population grows, the quality of the trout fishery in Bone Lake may begin to decline. <br> \n</p>",

The lake will continue to be monitored regularly to determine if changes need to be made to stocking size or frequency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bone Lake is a 43 acre designated trout lake managed for Rainbow Trout and Splake in the Superior National Forest.  The maximum depth is 51 feet and it has brown bog stained water.  The lake is located 16 miles north northwest of Schroeder down the Timber-Frear Loop Road (USFS Rd. 348) about 3 miles past the Whitefish Lake Campground.  Access is a small earthen back-in suitable for small boats and canoes along the road on the east side of the lake.  A second access is available with a small parking area along Lake County Hwy 7, 3 miles past Windy Lake.  This 0.7 mile trail is mainly used in winter months, and leads to the west end of the lake.  Currently a beaver dam has been built on top of the rock filter barrier at the outlet and the lake water level is at an all-time high, approximately 2.5 feet higher than normal.  If the dam should breach, it very likely would wash out the road.  Bone Lake gets light to moderate fishing pressure in the summer and winter angling seasons.  A small amount of shoreline angling is available near the access along the road.  Consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for rules applicable to designated trout lakes.  Rainbow Trout yearlings are stocked annually, and Splake fingerlings every other year in Bone Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCold water temperatures and good dissolved oxygen levels are essential for trout growth and survival.  To assess these important criteria, four automatic temperature loggers were deployed at the deepest location in the lake, they were suspended at depths of 8, 16, 24 and 32 feet from May 22 to October 2, 2017.  Dissolved oxygen checks were conducted throughout the summer at the same location.  In October on three different occasions, attempts were made to retrieve the temperature logger chain using numerous tools and methods.  Unfortunately they were never found and it is suspected that they were tampered with, lost, or stolen.   <br> \n <br> \nThe results of the investigation indicate that in during the summer of 2017, Bone Lake maintained sufficient oxygen and thermal habitat for the survival of stream trout.  These parameters will continue to be carefully monitored in future investigations to check the suitability of Bone Lake for trout stocking. <br> \n</p>",

All the Splake sampled were Age I which corresponds with the 1989 stocking. Rainbow Trout densities (0.8/gillnet lift) were within the historical ranges which have traditionally been low. The Lake Trout gillnet catch of 2.0/lift is considered normal for this lake. Lake Trout stocking was discontinued after 1985. The Lake Trout sampled in this survey appear to be the result of natural reproduction. White Sucker densities have shown considerable fluctuation and appear high at this time.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bone Lake is a 46 acre designated stream trout lake that is stocked with splake, rainbow trout and brown trout. The lake is located approximately 16 miles northwest of Tofte, MN in the Superior National Forest. The maximum depth is 51 feet and the water is fairly clear with a secchi disc visible to a depth of 9.5 feet. Summer access is from a gravel road with the last 2.3 miles rough. High clearance vehicles are recommended for this trip. The road passes within 10 feet of the lake and small boats or canoes can be carried to the lake from that point. Winter snowmobile access is from Lake Co. Rd. #7 approximately 3/4 miles west of the lake. The lake is wild and undeveloped and usually receives light angling pressure in summer and winter. There are no developed campsites on the lake, although some people choose to camp in an undesignated site near the east end of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nA population assessment in 2007 collected splake, rainbow trout, brown trout, white suckers and golden shiner minnows. Splake were collected in average numbers although the number was lower than the long-term average. Mean size was 11.7 inches (0.61 pounds/fish) with fish up to 14.7 inches collected.  The majority of the splake collected in 2007 were between 12.0 and 14.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow trout were collected in low numbers; however, this species is difficult to capture with typical lake survey gear.  Rainbow trout in 2007 ranged from 9.8 to 13.0 inches with approximately 41% of the fish between 12 and 13 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBrown trout were introduced in 2005 to create additional opportunities for catching large trout. Brown trout were collected in average numbers in this assessment and a mean length of 11.8 inches (0.67 pounds/fish) with fish up to 13.7 inches present. Only the 2004 and 2006 year classes of brown trout were present in Bone Lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bone Lake is 46 acres with a maximum depth of 51 feet, located 16 miles northwest of Tofte, MN.  The preferred access route is to head north 5.9 miles on USFS Road #357, continue north (beyond Whitefish Lake) on a rough logging road 2.3 miles (parking for three vehicles).  This route is rarely plowed in winter and becomes an even longer trek if travel begins from Lake County Road #7, the last plowed road.  Another route begins approximately 3 miles northeast of the Windy Lake access road on Lake County Road #7. There is a parking area (four vehicles) for the access trail, then take trail 0.8 mile (east) through old logging site. This unmaintained trail leads to the far western tip of the lake.  Both routes are open to snowmobile travel.  Designated stream trout lake signs are posted at each access. <br> \n <br> \nBone Lake gets moderate fishing pressure in the summer although less in the winter.  Splake fingerlings are stocked every even year and rainbow trout yearlings are stocked annually in this designated stream trout lake.  The 2010 population assessment found splake in average numbers for the Finland area and similar to catches in previous investigations.  The average length of the catch was 11.0 inches (0.45 pound); the largest splake sampled was 17.6 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nThe 2010 brown trout numbers were below average for the Finland area; however, brown trout were meant to provide an opportunity for large fish.  The average weight of brown trout was 1.44 pound (14.2 inches); the largest brown trout was 21.1 inches (3.75 pounds).  Brown trout were only stocked in 2005, 2007 and 2009. <br> \n <br> \nThe rainbow trout sample in 2010 was about average for rainbow trout lakes sampled in the Finland area.  The mean weight was 0.34 pound (9.6 inches), with the largest rainbow trout 13.7 inches.  Rainbow trout populations are difficult to assess with standard sampling gear, many different methods have been tried in the Finland area without much success.  Angling for rainbow trout often produces better catches than what population assessment catch rates would indicate. <br> \n <br> \nBone Lake has a large population of small white suckers which compete with the stream trout population for forage and the anglers bait. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bone Lake is a designated trout lake located about 16 miles northwest of Tofte, Minnesota off of US Forest S Rd. #348 (Whitefish Lake Rd). The road past the Whitefish Lake campground is rough and minimally maintained for the 3.5 miles to the lake and a high clearance vehicle is recommended. A small earthen access suitable for a small boat and trailer is located on the east shore near the outlet, and there is parking for a couple vehicles. A second access is a nearly mile long trail through an old logging site to the western shore of the lake. This second access is mainly used in the winter.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Splake was below average, compared to similar lakes, with only four fish caught. The length of the Splake ranged from 11.1 to 13.5 inches and they had an average weight of 0.9 pounds. The fish were two years of age and from the stocking event in 2018. The population of Splake is maintained by the stocking of 3,500 fingerlings in the fall of even years. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one Rainbow Trout was caught during the 2020 survey. This trout was 11.4 inches long and from the 2020 spring stocking event. Bone Lake is stocked annually in the spring with 1,000 yearling Rainbow Trout to provide a fishery for anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 survey was the second consecutive survey to catch Yellow Perch in Bone Lake, but the first to sample adult perch. Four gill nets sampled 25 Yellow Perch and an additional 4 perch were caught in a single mini trap net. The average size of perch from gill nets was nearly 8 inches with some fish over 11 inches sampled. The Yellow Perch were estimated to be ages 3 and 4; indicating perch have re-established a population in the lake. Yellow Perch are an undesirable species to have in a stocked trout lake because they compete with trout for resources in the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker have been sampled in thirteen consecutive surveys dating back to 1967. The 2020 White Sucker gill net catch was average compared to similar lakes. The average length was 9.6 inches with fish up to 17 inches long sampled. White Sucker are also an undesirable species in a stocked trout lake.  </p>",

The lake is accessible via a maintained gravel road; then a rough logging road for the last 2.3 miles.  The access is suitable for launching canoes and small boats.  Snowmobiles can access the lake in the winter from Lake County Rd #7 on a trail 3/4 mile to the lake.The 2004 population assessment sampled splake in average numbers compared to other stream trout lakes.  Splake ranged from 9 to 17 inches with the largest fish weighing 1-3/4 pound.  Most of the fish were between 11 and 13 inches and averaged about 1/2 pound.Rainbow trout are difficult to sample with netting gear in this lake and none were collected in this assessment.  Rainbow trout are caught by anglers during the open-water and winter seasons; most of the fish are between 10 and 12 inches.Beginning in 2005 some changes in the fish stocking plan in Bone Lake will take place.  Rainbow trout yearlings will be stocked annually instead of every other year.  Brown trout will also be stocked in the lake for the first time and will be stocked every other year.</p>",
