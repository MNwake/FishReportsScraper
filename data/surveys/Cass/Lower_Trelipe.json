                "narrative": "<p>Better netting results were found with the trapnets than gillnets.  The larger game fish (walleye, northern) were caught in the shallower water.  There were approximately ten cars at the public landing (ricers) at the time of the survey.  Some local friction still exists concerning the man made channel from Laura Lake to Big Thunder that was put in a number of years ago.  Three groups of wild mallards were observed.  Wild rice crop looked very good especially in the southeast bay of the lake.  Mr. Bringham (local resident) stated that fishing had been good earlier in spring and the only fish being caught with any success was the jumbo yellow perch.The northern cisco, brown bullhead, yellow perch, dogfish populations are all above the state and local medians for this type of lake.  The black crappie population was even for #/set but above both medians for lbs/set.  Walleyes were found to be below the state medians but above the local one.  As found with many of the game fish, the northern pike population was greater in the trapthan in the gill.  Only populations that was even with the medians was the eelpout.Management Recommendations:  Discontinue walleye stocking for three years.  Check for natural reproduction in 1974-76.  Population check in 1976 for age classes.  Lake to remain open to fall netting.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Trelipe Lake (DOW # 110129) is a 602-acre lake located about six miles east of Longville, MN.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Lower Trelipe Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally hard-water lakes with regular shorelines (few bays and points).  Lower Trelipe Lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, and secondarily for black crappie, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Walleye abundance in the 2005 sampling in Lower Trelipe Lake was similar to the average of ecologically similar lakes.  Fish from 10 to 26 inches were sampled in MNDNR test nets. Though most northern pike sampled in 2005 test nets were relatively small, fish up to 31 inches were found. Black crappie, largemouth bass and bluegill are available for anglers in Lower Trelipe Lake.  Black bullhead, brown bullhead, and yellow bullhead are all abundant.  Other species sampled during the 2005 assessment were: bowfin (dogfish), cisco (tullibee), pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow perch.      Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Lower Trelipe Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Trilipe is a hard water lake of moderate chemical fertility.  Populations of northern pike and walleye are above state wide average abundance but are present in normal numbers for lakes of this type in north central Minnesota.  Populations of non-game species, white suckers, yellow perch, tullibee, and bullheads, are below normal abundance except for suckers which are present in normal numbers.Panfish, particularily crappies, are of good size and are present in fishable numbers.  There is a lack of young crappies in the population and fishing for this species may decline temporarily until a new year class is recruited to the population.Growth of northern pike and walleye is good.  Age and length frequency distribution of walleye and northern pike in the test net catches indicated good natural reprodution of these species during most years.  Good year classes of northern pike and walleye should enter the angler's catch in 1957.  Seine hauls during the survey also indicate successful reproduction of these species in 1956.The lake was closed to darkhouse spearing from the 1945-1946 season through the 1950-1951 season, and was closed to winter angling during the 1945-1946 and 1948-1949 seasons.</p>",

Fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Two sampling sites located in the southeast bay were not sampled due to exceptionally dense vegetation that made navigation to those sites impractical. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.  Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with data collected during a gill net and trap net survey conducted the week of September 3, 2019 to calculate a FIBI score for the lake. The FIBI Tool-4 was used for scoring and resulted in an FIBI score of 44, which is above the impairment threshold (38) and below the exceptional threshold (59) for this tool.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Trelipe Lake was assigned to lake class 32, according to selected physical and chemical parameters.  The parameters and their mean values for lake clas 32 are as follows: area - 647 acres, maximum depth = 34.9, 63% littoral area, total alkalinity = 146 ppm, secchi disc transparency = 4.33 feet, and Carlson's Trophic Status = 56.0.  Lake basins in this class are generally medium sized, fairly shallow with a large littoral area, contain hardwater, and develop moderate midsummer algal blooms.  Lakes associated with lake class 32 parameters are more commonly found in the cental part of the state; therefore, only two lakes, Dixon and Lower Treplipe, are located within the Grand Rapids jurisdiction.Gill net and trap net catches (CPUE'S) were compared to interquartiles for lake class 32.  Net catches within the interquartile should be viewed as normal while catches below the first quartile or above the third quartile should be viewed as unusual.  See table 1 for a quick evaluation of net catches for this assessment.Table 1.Ranking of gill net (G) or trap net (T) CPUE'S and mean weights according to interquartile ranges for lake class 32.\t\t\t\tCPUE\t\tPounds/NetSpecies\t    Net Type  Below  Within  Above  Below Within AboveBowfin\t\tT\t\t\tX\t\t    XTullibee\tG\t\t\tX\t     XNorthern Pike\tG\t\tX\t\t     XWhite Sucker\tG\t\tX\t\t     XBlack Bullhead\tG\t\t\tX\t\t    XYellow Bullhead\tG\t\tX\t\t     XBrown Bullhead\tG\t\t\tX\t\t    XPumpkinseed\tT\t\tX\t\t     XBluegill\tT\tX\t\t\t     XBlack Crappie\tG\t\tX\t\t     XYellow Perch\tG\tX\t\t\tXWalleye\t\tG\t\tX\t\t     XAbundance and Size Structure:  Black bullheads were most abundant in gill net catches (62.0/net) and a large portion of the catch ranged from 7.5 to 8.9 inches.  These fish are of ideal size for commercial fishing markets as the mean weight per fish was 0.35 lbs.  Tullibee catches consisted of fish ranging from 8.0-18.9 inches with a mode around 12.0-13.9 inches.  A large portion of tullibee in the net catches were too large to be suitable prey for small northern pike.  Most northern pike in the gill net catch were between 19.0-20.9 inches (the northern pike PSD index value was 28 for the gill net catch).  Bluegill abundance seems to be lower than normal but sizes are normal.  Trap net catches consisted of a good portion (PSD=70) of fish over 6 inches.  Black crappie abundance seems normal and net catches also consisted of quality sized fish (PSD of gill net sample = 50).  Walleye abundance was currently low but still within the interquatile range.  This catch rate coincides with a below normal yellow perch catch.  Most walleyes were quality sized, as 58% of the gill net sample (n=24) exceeded 15 inches (PSD=58).  Bowfin present in gill nets and trap nets and above normal catch rates but may be an important predator in maintaining a good bluegill size structure.Age and Growth:  Aging estimates and back calculations with Disbcal software provide the following interpretations regarding age structure and growth rates for selected species within the population.  The northern pike catch consisted of mostly age 2 (43%) and age 3 (43%) fish.  Some of the age 3 fish had attained 21 inches (minimum quality length) at the time of capture. This growth rate is consistent with the statewide average.  The bluegill catch consisted of 21% age 2, 21% age 3, 34% age 4, and 17% age 5 fish.  These age groups had growth rates that were consistent with statewide means.  Bluegills usually attained 6 inches (minimum quality length) late in their third growing season which is also similar to statewide growth.  The black crappie catch consisted of 50% age 1, 15% age 3, 29% age 4, and 6% age 5 fish.  Age 2 and fish older than age 5 were absent from the net catch.  Growth rates for sampled age groups were above average, as back calculated lengths exceeded the statewode means by 12% to 20%.  Black crappies usually attained 8 inches (minimum quality length) late in their second year of growth in the lake, while statewide, they attain this benchmark length during their third year of growth.  The walleye catch consisted of most age classes while about 50% were estimated to be age 4 (1988 year class) fish.  Growth was normal for age 4 fish.  Most of the age 4 fish had attained 15 inches (minimum quality length) before they formed their last annulus which is also similar to statewide growth rates.  Although all other classes had less than five representatives, they all tended to have back calculated means that exceeded these statewide means.Walley Stocking:  Walleye fry were stocked five times in the last eight previous years which correspond to 1990, 1988, 1986, 1985, and 1992 year classes.  Three stockings correspond to the age 2, 4, and 6 fish which are most selective to the gill net.  Age 4 fish were frequent in the gill net catch and may be assumed to originate from stocking origins.  This assumption may be in error though, as age 4 fish were also very prevalent in the gill net catch from Upper Trelipe Lake which corresponds to a nonstocked year.  Migration between lakes is suspected to be minimal due to a poorly defined channel through a sedge bog between the lakes. Therefore, the chance of stocked age 4 fish dispersing to Upper Trelipe and contributing to catch would be very unlikely.Shoreline Seining:  Three seine hauls were pulled perpendicular to shore which sampled 0.21 acres of shoal waters.  Yellow perch young-of-year and larger perch were most prevalent in these seine hauls.  Other gamefish included only three young-of-year largemouth bass and one young-of-year walleye.  Seining was conducted during the assessment fieldwork.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Trelipe Lake (DOW # 11-0129, Lake Class 31) is a 618-acre lake located about six miles east of Longville, MN.  The lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye, and secondarily for Tullibee (Cisco), Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch.  The DNR has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Lower Trelipe Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear and productive, with moderate depth. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers in Lower Trelipe Lake are similar to other lakes in this class.  The average length of Northern Pike sampled in this lake by DNR in 2014 was 20 inches, and fish up to 27 inches were present. Walleye had average abundance compared to other lakes in this class.  Sampled Walleye ranged from 10 to 23 inches, with an average length of 17 inches. Bluegill abundance was lower than in most lakes in this class, and Bluegill up to 10 inches were sampled.  Black Crappie numbers compared favorably to other waters in Lake Class 31 with a wide variety of sizes. Other fish species collected during the 2014 sampling include Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Lower Trelipe Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Trelipe Lake (DOW# 11-0129; lake class 31) is a 618-acre lake with 6.63 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 32 feet located East of Longville, MN. There is a MNDNR owned public access on the west shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Lower Trelipe Lake is in lake class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear, productive, and have moderate depth. Other class 31 lakes include; Bowen, Child, and Five Point Lakes. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. Black Crappie Bluegill, Tullibee (Cisco), and Yellow Perch are secondary management species.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass provide angling opportunities for both quantity and quality fish. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 11 to 20 inches with an average length of 14 inches. Northern Pike are very abundant and ranged in length from 15 to 32 inches with an average length of 20 inches. The Walleye population is generally moderate although the 2019 survey numbers were below the management goal of four fish per gillnet despite even-year stocking of fingerlings. Walleye ranged in length from 11 to 26 inches with an average length of 18 inches. Seven consecutive year-classes were represented in the age class distribution with the 2014 year-class comprising 36 percent of the catch. Black Crappie and Bluegill are abundant and offer quality sizes of both species. Black Crappie ranged in length from 5 to 12 inches and Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 10 inches. Other fish species sampled include, Hybrid Sunfish, Yellow Perch, and Rock Bass. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Lower Trelipe Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Trelipe Lake is a 618-acre lake with 6.63 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 32 feet located east of Longville, MN. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned public access is located on the east shore. The MNDNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Lower Trelipe Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are characterized as generally clear and productive. Other area lakes in this class include Bowen, Child, and Five Point Lakes. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye, and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Tullibee (Cisco), and Yellow Perch. A daily limit of five Sunfish went into effect on Lower Trelipe in 2022.  <br> \n <br> \nLower Trelipe Lake provides multi-species angling opportunity with the potential for both quantity and quality size fish. Largemouth Bass up to 17 inches were sampled. Northern Pike are abundant, exceeding the lake's maximum management goal. Sampled pike ranged from 11 to 33 inches and averaged 19 inches long. Walleye abundance in the lake is low and lengths ranged from 8 to 22 inches. Black Crappie catch rates exceeded lake management catch goals and crappie 4 to 13 inches were sampled. Bluegill catch rates fell within the target management range and exceeded size goals with roughly half of sampled fish measuring 6 inches or longer and fish up to 10 inches sampled. Tullibee (Cisco) and Yellow Perch abundance has remained low since the early 2000's.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter in Lower Trelipe Lake include Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Lower Trelipe Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

The walleye population has fluctuated and is presently lower than past years.  Walleye reproduction appeared adequate in 1956 but has now become sporadic.  Walleye fry stocking in recent years appears to have contributed to the specific year class in most cases.  The population of other fishes has remained fairly stable.Management Recommendations:  No northern pike stocking.  Annual walleye fry stocking at a rate of 1,000 fry per surface acre.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Trelipe Lake is a 618-acre lake located about six miles east of Longville, MN that has 6.6 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public access on the east end of the lake along Snowball Road NE.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Lower Trelipe Lake is in Lake Class 31.  Other local waters in this classification include Child, Widow, and Five Point Lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are moderately abundant in Lower Trelipe Lake.  Most of the northern pike found in DNR test nets during 2011were small, with an average length of 20 inches, however fish up to 27 inches were sampled.   <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye are relatively abundant in Lower Trelipe Lake compared to other lakes in this class. The common sizes of walleye found in the 2011 were in the 13- through 15-inch categories, , though a number of walleye in the 19- and 20-inch categories were collected. <br> \nBluegill were not as abundant in Lower Trelipe Lake as in most other lakes of this type, however a significant number of bluegill sampled were in the 7- and 8-inch categories.    <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that are available to anglers to catch are black bullhead, black crappie, cisco (tullibee), largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.        <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Selective harvest by anglers (harvest of smaller to medium-sized fish) promotes balanced fish communities and sustainable fishing quality.  Removal of shoreline vegetation on private lake lots and mowing grass to the water's edge can reduce water quality, which in turn can adversely affect fish populations.  Similarly, removal of woody debris and aquatic plants from near-shore areas reduces critical habitat needed to support quality fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Lower Trelipe Lake.  These species are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake-shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat away before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us/). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Trelipe Lake is a 602 acre lake with a maximum depth of 32 feet, and approximately 59% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less. The lake is located 6 miles east of Longville. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Lower Trelipe lake is in lake class 31. There is a DNR public access on the east side of the lake.Walleye abundance in 1998 was similar to previous assessments and typical for lakes of this type. Walleye sampled ranged from 5.1 to 23.8 inches, with a mean length of 14.9 inches. The 1996 (age 2) and 1997 (age 3) year classes were most abundant with 48% and 18% of the catch respectively. Growth rates for walleye were similar to statewide averages. Northern pike abundance in 1998 was at the second highest level observed since 1956. However, this level of abundance was within the expected range for lakes of this type. Northern pike sampled ranged from 15.9 to 31.5 inches, with a mean length of 19.6 inches.Black Crappie abundance was similar to previous assessments and typical for lakes of this type. Black crappie sampled ranged from 5.5 to 14.0 inches, with a mean length of 9.5 inches. Growth rates for crappie were similar to statewide averages through age 3, and exceeded statewide averages from age 4 through age 6. Bluegill abundance was at historic high levels in 1998. However, the observed level of abundance is within the expected range for lakes of this type. The size structure for bluegill has been decreasing over time. This may be due to overharvest of the largest individuals in the population. Selective harvest (releasing fish larger than 7.5 inches) may be beneficial for the bluegill population in Lower Trelipe Lake. Bluegill sampled ranged from 3.0 to 10.7 inches, with a mean length of 5.0 inches.Lower Trelipe Lake is a relatively fertile lake that experiences moderate summer algal blooms. Shoreline best management practices should be used to minimize impacts associated with habitation of shoreline areas.</p>",
