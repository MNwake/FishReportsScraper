                "narrative": "<p>Cloquet Lake is managed for walleye and stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd number years.  Other species present are northern pike, yellow perch and white sucker.  Fish populations were evaluated in this lake in 2005.Walleye were sampled in average numbers in 2005 but fewer were taken than in 2000, the last time a regular assessment was conducted.  Walleye up to 27.4 inches (6.9 lb) were collected but the average size was about 15.4 inches.Northern pike were sampled in average numbers which is normal for this lake.  They ranged from 13.0 inches to 29.8 inches (5.6 lb) but the overall size was relatively small averaging 1.25 lb.  Only two northern pike larger than 26 inches were sampled.  The size of northern pike collected in this assessment is typical of the sizes found in past assessments on this lake.Yellow perch were sampled in fairly high numbers although the catch was not as high as in past assessments.  Average size was 8.1 inches with fish up to 11.9 inches collected.  Cloquet Lake is one of the few lakes in the Finland area that consistently produces yellow perch larger than 10 inches, although fewer were taken in 2005 than in past assessments.Bluegill were introduced in Cloquet Lake in 2000 to increase angling opportunities for this species in the Finland area.  At this time it appears the introduction has failed.</p>",

Trap nets are the preferred equipment used to evaluate bluegill; however, this gear is not normally used to evaluate species such as walleye, northern pike and yellow perch, which are also found in Cloquet Lake.  Netting gear in the 2003 assessment failed to collect any bluegill, either stocked or naturally produced.  The 2000 stocking may have failed; however, the next planned population assessment (in 2005) should provide more information.  Catches of northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch in trap nets in 2003 were similar to catches observed in past assessments.  The northern pike catch included some larger fish (over 30 inches).  Most of the walleye collected were 12 to 19 inches in length.  Fair numbers of yellow perch (up to 12 inches) were present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cloquet Lake is a 182.6 acre body of water, located approximately 11.25 miles west-northwest of Finland, MN.   The public access is a back-down gravel ramp to the southeast end of the lake.  The lake is quite shallow at this location and wild rice is very thick between the access and open-water, there was parking for about five vehicles in an open grass area.  A camping area at the access/parking area has a latrine and fire-ring.   There are no special fishing regulations on Cloquet Lake; state-wide fishing regulations for inland waters apply. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake has a maximum depth of 7.0 feet, with a secchi disk visible on the bottom in the brown, bog stained water.  Water quality measurements indicated the lake has moderately soft and infertile water.  Muck and detritus were the most abundant substrates, sand was common; gravel, rubble and boulder are rare.  Spawning habitat was rated as excellent for northern pike and yellow perch but poor for walleye.  The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in the amount of wild rice in Cloquet Lake.  Wild rice was first identified in 2000, mostly in the protected bays.  By the 2010 lake survey, wild rice was estimated to cover eighty percent of the lake surface with about 40 acres of fairly open-water remaining.  Motorized travel over most of the lake was nearly impossible during the wild rice growing season.  Wild rice was dense enough for recreational harvest on Cloquet Lake in 2010. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish sampled in 2010 consisted of northern pike, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch.  Walleye were sampled in slightly above average numbers for northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics.  The average size of walleye was impressive at 2.3 pound (17.9 inches); the largest walleye was 28 inches.  The walleye catch in 2010 was slightly lower than catches in many of the previous investigations on Cloquet Lake; however the average size was the largest recorded.  Walleye growth was above average in Cloquet Lake when compared to fish sampled in other Finland area assessments.  Presently, walleye are stocked on a two consecutive years in a four year rotation to allow for assessment of natural reproduction.  Cloquet Lake was last stocked with walleye fingerlings in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers for the lake class and within the range seen in previous investigations.  The northern pike average size was 1.4 pounds (18.3 inches); the largest northern pike was 31.3 inches.  The northern pike numbers in 2010 were about average for Cloquet Lake; however, the average fish size was smaller than historically sampled. <br> \n   <br> \nYellow perch numbers were above average for this type of lake, with a very nice average size in the 2010 lake survey.  The average weight was 0.52 pound (9.9 inches); eighty percent of the sample was greater than 9 inches, the largest yellow perch was 13.1 inches.  Previous investigations have also recorded high numbers of good size yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cloquet Lake is located 11 miles west of Finland, MN in the Superior National Forest.  The lake is used by a variety of recreational users including: anglers, hunters, trappers, and wild rice harvesters.  Cloquet Lake is considered a moderately soft water lake with low fertility typical of northeast Minnesota.  Water clarity is about 5 feet with brown, bog stained water.  The shoreline is about half lowland bog with black spruce and half upland with a mixed forest of conifers, ash, birch and aspen.  About 40% of the Shoreline along the south and southwest part of the lake is in private ownership.  The rest of the shoreline is owned by US Forest Service.  One cabin is present on the south shore.  Bottom substrates are mainly muck and decaying organic matter with some sand and gravel and lesser amounts of rubble and boulder.  The aquatic vegetation is very diverse with over 32 species identified including large beds of wild rice, horsetail, and common algae.  Fish species present are Walleye, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, White Sucker, and some minnow species.  Walleye have been stocked routinely since the early 1980s.  Walleye fingerlings are currently stocked in two consecutive years out of every four at a rate of 136 pounds per stocking.  Bluegill were introduced in 2000 but have not been sampled in any surveys.  However, anglers have reported catching a few Bluegills.  The 2015 assessment was part of a regularly scheduled investigation to gauge Walleye stocking efforts, to determine contribution from natural reproduction, and to see if goals were being met for the managed species.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake has a back in access (gravel) on the southeast end.  The access is moderately sloped and the water off of the access is very shallow for a fair distance making it difficult to launch a larger boat.  Wild rice densities and occasional low water levels can make outboard motor use extremely difficult on Cloquet Lake.  However, during years of average to high water levels the lake can provide good angling, especially in the early spring and summer months.  There is one campsite at the access and room for 4 or 5 vehicles.  To get to the lake from Finland, drive 13 miles to the end of the Heffelfinger road then take a left onto USFS Rd. 102.  Continue on USFS Rd. 102 for 4.4 miles to the access.  The last 4.4 miles are rather narrow, bumpy and wet in spots.  While it is possible to get to the access with most highway legal vehicles it is best suited to higher clearance vehicles such as pickup trucks or SUVs. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 Walleye catch rate was by far the lowest on record.  However, the average weight of 3.7 pounds/fish was by far the highest on record.  The largest fish sampled in all gear types in 2015 was 25 inches long and weighed 5.5 pounds.   Growth appears fast by area standards. Based on age data, all fish captured came from stocked years.  However, 18 young-of-the-year Walleye were captured so there is some natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch in 2015 was the highest on record with an average weight of 1.0 pound/fish.  The largest fish sampled was 36.3 inches long and weighed 13.3 pounds.  A majority of Northern Pike captured were small (less than 21 inches long).  However, five Northern Pike were over 29 inches long. Natural reproduction is very consistent and fish up to age-11 were sampled.  Northern Pike growth is average for the Finland Area.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rate and average weight was way above average compared to similar lakes in the Finland Area.  Seventy percent of the catch was over nine inches long with the largest Yellow Perch measured 13.2 inches and weighed 1.1 pounds.  Natural reproduction is very consistent with all year classes being present to age 11 plus one individual that was aged to 14 years old.  Yellow Perch growth is faster than the Finland Area average. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker were sampled in low numbers with a mean weight of 1.8 pounds, which is average for lakes in the Finland Area.  Other species sampled in quarter inch mesh trap nets were Blacknose Shiner, Common Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Northern Redbelly Dace. <br> \n <br> \nWild rice is considered an important component to wildlife and migrating waterfowl.  Recently, Cloquet Lake has received more wild rice management attention in an effort to consistently produce an abundant crop for waterfowl.  It is unclear how new management strategies will affect fisheries within Cloquet Lake.  DNR fisheries will be closely monitoring fish populations within Cloquet Lake in an effort to try and determine any adverse or beneficial effects of this new emphasis on wild rice management.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cloquet lake is a 182,6 acre soft-water lake locaated immediately below Katherine Lake, the headwaters of the Cloquet River. The Cloquet River flows thru Cloquet Lake. The maximum depth is 7 feet. The lake has 3.2 miles of shoreline, and is surrounded by forested land and marshy bogs. There is a small campsite at the access. Shoal soils are mostly rocky gravel, and mud over sand.     Lake levels are relatively stable and large beds of bulrush are present along shallow shorelines.     Test netting indicates an abundance of northern pike, suckers, and perch to be present. it appears that the northern pike are overly abundant (10.0/gillnet lift) in relation to their food supply. Few small perch and no white sucker under 12.0 inches were found, indicating severe cropping off by the northern pike and older perch. The northern pike are mostly small size fish under 21.0 inches in length.     Spawning facilities are very good for northern pike and fair to poor for other species.     Cloquet lake has light fishing pressure at the present time. </p>",

Walleye up to 24 inches were sampled in test nets in 1994, with 40% of the fish exceeding 18 inches.     Northern pike are present in good numbers with approximately 50% of the fish sampled being in the 1 to 2 pound range. Northern pike up to 33 inches (7.6 pounds) were sampled, however few fish exceeded 25 inches (3.75 pounds).     Yellow perch abundance is high, and of quality size. Approximately 50% of the fish sampled exceeding 9 inches, with fish up to 12 inches present.</p>",

Recently, MnDNR Section of Wildlife has begun to manage the lake for wild rice by removing beaver dams and lowering water levels.  The Section of Fisheries has managed the lake for Walleye since 1961 through various stocking methods.  Currently, Cloquet Lake is being stocked with fingerlings on a two out of four year basis.   <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of this survey was to assess Walleye abundance using gill nets only.  In September, four gill nets were set throughout the lake and sampled 15 Walleye.  Five different year classes were sampled and nine of the fish were aged at 3 years old, which was not a stocked year.  Historically there has been evidence of some natural reproduction but it is uncertain if natural reproduction could support a fishery acceptable to the public.  The average size of Walleye sampled was 18.8 inches long and weighed 2.6 pounds.  The largest fish sampled was 26.8 inches long and weighed 6.5 pounds.  Similar to previous investigations, Walleye growth is much faster than average for Finland Area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike, Yellow Perch and White Sucker were also sampled.  Northern Pike numbers are high but average size is small, mostly 20 inches and under, but an occasional large fish is caught.  Yellow Perch numbers are high and average size is very nice with over half of the 2017 catch greater than 9 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cloquet Lake is located eleven miles west of Finland within the Superior National Forest. There is a small public access with an earthen ramp suitable for small boats and canoes on the southeast shore of the lake. Current management is for Walleye fingerlings to be stocked in the fall for two consecutive years followed by two non-stocked years. A standard fisheries survey was completed in June 2019 to monitor the fish community and evaluate stocking efforts.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate of 2.33 per gill net was on the low end of the normal range for similar lakes, but below average compared to previous surveys of Cloquet Lake. Size ranged from 7.5 to 26.0 inches with an average length of 19.1 inches and average weight of 3.04 pounds. Age analysis determined a little over half the Walleye sampled (8 of 15) were from the 2015 year class, a stocked year. The remaining fish came from two non-stocked year classes and were either age-1 or age-15. These results are similar to recent surveys of the lake which have found inconsistent recruitment from both stocked and non-stocked years.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch was within the normal range and consistent with previous surveys of the lake. Size structure continues to be poor as pike averaged just 18.02 inches and 1.21 pounds in 2019 with just one individual greater than 24 inches long sampled. Only a handful of Northern Pike longer than 24 inches have been captured in the thirteen surveys completed on the lake to date.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate of 17.83 per gill net was similar to previous surveys and near the high end of the normal range for similar lakes. Size ranged from 6.1 to 13.1 inches with 38% of perch longer than 10 inches. Age distribution included fish from age-1 to age-17 with fourteen year classes identified. The quality size structure is largely the result of a mature population of older fish that can be sensitive to increased harvest.  <br> \n</p>",

This was primarily due to a strong year class of Age III fish which comprised 70% of the WAE catch. Natural reproduction is contributing to the population, however this strong year class corresponds with the 1987 fingerling stocking.     The NOP densities remain near historical levels and are dominated by small fish averaging 1.1 pounds. YEP continue to flourish despite the high number of predators present. The WTS catch was higher than the two previous catches, however still within the historical range.</p>",

Recently, the MN DNR Section of Wildlife has begun to manage the lake for wild rice by removing beaver dams and lowering water levels.  The Section of Fisheries has managed the lake for Walleye since 1961 through various stocking methods.  Currently, Cloquet Lake is being stocked with fingerlings on a two out of four year basis.   <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of this targeted survey was to assess winter survival of Walleye using trap nets after low dissolved oxygen levels were recorded in March 2016.  This was the first year that an ice out trap net assessment was done on the lake.  This is a non-lethal method that usually results in high catches of adult fish that are cruising the shorelines looking for spawning sites.  In early May, fourteen trap nets were set throughout the lake and sampled zero Walleye.  Additional assessment are planned for 2017 to further evaluate the relationship between low water, dissolved oxygen levels, and the Walleye population.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Low water levels, abundance of wild rice, and decline of Walleye have become a major concern on Cloquet Lake in recent years.  Recently, the MN DNR Section of Wildlife has begun to manage the lake for wild rice by removing beaver dams and lowering water levels.  The Section of Fisheries has managed the lake for Walleye since 1961 through various stocking methods.  Currently, Cloquet Lake is being stocked with walleye fingerlings on a two out of four year basis.   <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of this targeted survey was to assess winter survival of Walleye using trap nets after low dissolved oxygen levels were recorded in March 2017.  This was the second consecutive year that an ice out trap net assessment was done on the lake.  This is a non-lethal method that usually results in high catches of adult fish that are cruising the shorelines looking for spawning sites.  In mid-May, sixteen trap nets were set throughout the lake and sampled zero Walleye, the same as 2016.  However, due to the water temperature during both assessments it is suspected that the Walleye spawning season had concluded.  The remote location of the lake and condition of the road may make future ice out assessments possible only under ideal conditions.  A gill net assessment is planned for September 2017 to further evaluate the Walleye population as part of a five year study after the 2015 assessment recorded an all-time low gill net catch of 0.5/net.  Prior to the water level manipulation Walleye gill net catch ranged from 5/net to 14/net. <br> \n</p>",
