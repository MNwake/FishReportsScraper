                "narrative": "<p>Little Bowstring is located about 12 miles north of Deer River, MN, within the Chippewa National Forest, and the Big Fork River watershed.  The lake is 319 acres, has 115 littoral acres, a maximum depth of 33 feet and a little more than three miles of shoreline.  The lake has three small inlets from Pike, Maki, and Grave lakes with one outlet to the Bowstring River.  Secchi disk transparency was 10 feet in 2021 and the lake has moderate fertility.  All of the shoreline is in private ownership and moderately developed.  There is one county owned public access on the south shore. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan was last updated in 2016.   Walleye and Bluegill were the primary management species because they are well suited for the lake, are popular with anglers, and actively managed.  Walleye fry are stocked every other year and a 5-fish daily limit for sunfish was implemented in 2021 to help maintain size quality.  Northern Pike and Black Crappie were considered secondary management species because they are well suited for the lake but do not require additional management efforts.  Summer surveys are conducted to monitor the fish community for changes in catch rates, size structure, and growth.  The 2021 survey used 6 gill-net sets and 8 trap-net sets.  Note that strong winds and unstable weather likely effected catch rates during the survey so information should be interpreted with caution. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Bowstring Lake has a history of high Walleye catches compared to lakes with similar habitats.  The Walleye population appeared to be healthy although the 2021 catch rate was lower than other recent surveys and below average for the lake.  Lengths were similar to past surveys and ranged from 11.7 to 25.7 inches and averaged 17.8 inches.  Forty-five percent of sampled Walleye exceeded 20 inches.  Given the observed numbers and size quality, good angling opportunities for large Walleye may exist. <br> \n <br> \nSummer surveys have typically sampled Bluegill in low numbers and may be a poor tool to evaluate sunfish in Little Bowstring Lake.  The catch rate was less than one per net in 2021.  The low summer catch appears to be due to poor trap netting conditions at the time of the survey.  A targeted survey in June of 2021 described a population characterized as having lower numbers but exceptional size quality, with fish over 9 inches present.  Data from that survey is in a separate report. <br> \n <br> \nHigh Northern Pike numbers are often associated with slow growth and poor size quality.  Like many Minnesota lakes, catch rates have shown an increasing trend since the early 1970s.  In 2021, pike catches were the highest ever for Little Bowstring and higher than expected from other lakes with similar habitats.  Size structure was poor as lengths ranged from 14.8 to 34.5 inches and averaged 20.9 inches.  Excellent fishing and harvest opportunities exist for smaller pike given the catch rate and size structure.  Little Bowstring Lake is in the North-central zone regulation for Northern Pike.  Anglers may keep up to 10 pike but all fish from 22-26 inches must be released, and only two pike exceeding 26 inches may be possessed.  Anglers may help improve size quality on Little Bowstring by only keeping pike under 22 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLike many northern Minnesota lakes, Black Crappie catches on Little Bowstring have varied dramatically due to inconsistent year class production, angler harvest, and fish location relative to the nets during the summer surveys.  Black Crappie catches in gill nets and trap nets were below average for Little Bowstring in 2021.  The eight fish sampled were larger, ranging from 9.3 to 12.1 inches.  The size distribution suggests poor recruitment in recent years.  Catch rate and size structure suggests moderate opportunities exist for catching large crappie, but overall numbers may be low until the next strong year-class is produced. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are an important prey species on Little Bowstring and occasionally grow large enough to interest anglers.  Perch catches have varied considerably and have been distinctly higher than expected when compared to other lakes with similar habitat.  The 2021 survey resulted in the highest perch catches ever for the lake.  Sampled fish ranged from 5.5 to 10.4 inches and averaged 7.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are an important prey species but have declined across much of Minnesota.  Tullibee catches have generally been low on Little Bowstring and the 2021 catch was low, even compared to other lakes with similar habitats.  The three sampled fish ranged from 8.5 to 16.7 inches, indicating multiple year-classes were present. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are difficult to sample using standard summer netting methods because they tend to avoid the nets.  Although night electrofishing is a more effective sampling tool for Largemouth Bass, it was not conducted in 2021 because the population does not warrant the additional effort on a regular basis.  Largemouth Bass appear to exist in low numbers on Little Bowstring. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Bowstring is located about twelve miles north of Deer River, MN, within the Chippewa National Forest and the Big Fork River watershed.  The 319 acre lake has a maximum depth of 33 feet and a little more than three miles of shoreline.  The lake has three small inlets from Pike, Maki and Graves lakes with one outlet to the Bowstring River.  Water clarity was 10 feet in 2021 and the lake is considered to have moderate fertility and hardness.  Nearly all the shoreline is in private ownership and moderately developed.  There is one county owned public access on the south shore. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Bowstring has produced a sunfish fishery characterized by low numbers and exceptional size quality, and Bluegill are considered a primary management species.  Two special spring surveys were previously conducted to establish baseline information and evaluate the potential for a reduced bag limit regulation.  A reduced bag limit of 5 sunfish daily was implemented in March of 2021 based on biological information and strong support from public comments.  The management goal for Bluegill includes catches with 40% of the fish exceeding 6 inches and 20% exceeding 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey using 26 trap net sets was conducted in June of 2021 to continue the assessment of the fishery and provide additional baseline information for future regulation evaluations.  Catch rates from spring surveys tend to be variable due to spring weather patterns and should be viewed cautiously as they may not correspond to any actual changes in abundance.  Spring trap net surveys are conducted to collect reliable information on size structure and growth statistics.  Detailed data for other species were not collected during the survey, although non-sunfish species were captured and noted.  An additional targeted survey using gill nets was conducted in August to determine the status of other gamefish, and a summary can be viewed in a separate report. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap nets sampled 179 Bluegill in 2021, again suggesting a population with lower numbers and exceptional size quality.  Bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 10.4 inches with an average length of 6.9 inches.  Size structure remained favorable and exceeded management goals as 65% of the fish exceeded 6 inches and 24% exceeded 8 inches, while fish over 10 inches were present.  Ages 2 through 11 were represented in the sample, with age 6 fish the most frequently sampled.  Growth was above average compared to similar lakes, but typical for Little Bowstring.  Bluegill averaged 7.6 inches after 6 years of growth.  It appears good angling opportunities continue to exist for quality sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Black Crappie, Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Bowstring Lake is a 319-acre lake in Itasca County within the Big Fork River watershed.  Little Bowstring is approximately 10 miles north of Deer River, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 33 ft and 115 littoral acres.  A public access is located on the south shore.  Secchi disk transparency was 4.1 ft, indicating poor water clarity due to bog stain.   Walleye gill-net catch was 11.4/net, which was more than twice the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye gill-net catch has varied from 0.9 to 6.6/net in previous assessments.  The catch rate in the 1971 assessment was higher, however, only two-gill nets were used in that assessment.  Size structure was excellent with a good percentage of fish between 15 and 20 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching quality length of 15 inches in 4 years.Little Bowstring was stocked with fry every third year.  The most recent stocking occurred in 1997 and 2000.  Two large year classes (1997 and 2000) accounted for 88% of all fish sampled.  Ninety-five percent of all fish aged corresponded to stocked year classes.Northern pike gill-net catch was 7.8/net, which was similar to the expected range for similar lakes.  Northern pike gill-net catch has varied from 2.7 to 9.7/net in previous assessments.  Size structure was very poor with few fish greater than 24 inches.  Growth was not evaluated in this assessment.  Bluegill trap-net catch was 3.2/net, which was lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Historically catch rates have been low and varied from 1.0 to 1.6/net.  Size structure was moderate with a few fish over 6 inches, but no fish over 8 inches.  Growth was similar to the lake class average with fish reaching 6 inches in 5 years.  Black crappie gill-net catch was 0.8/net, which was near the low end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Gill-net catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0 to 1.0/net in past assessments.  The trap-net catch rate was 1.1/net, which was similar to the expected range.  Trap-net catch rates in past assessments varied from 0 to 0.7/net.  Although abundance was low, size structure was good with fish up to 11 in inches sampled.  Yellow perch gill-net catch rate was 24.3/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 14.2 to 95.4/net.  Size structure was poor with few fish greater than 9 inches.  Gill nets do not sample tullibee efficiently, because they often suspend over deep water in the summer months.  This likely explains why tullibee were not sampled in this assessment.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0.6 to 2.5/net.  Other species sampled in past assessments include largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and bowfin.In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Little Bowstring Lake was conducted on July 18-20, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Bowfin comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bowfin comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Bowfin sampled per net was well above the 75% quartile for similar Lake Class 31 lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n  <br> \nData from this survey indicates Little Bowstring Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Big Fork River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

All of the shoreline is in private ownership and moderately developed.  There is one public access on the south shore.  Walleye and Bluegill are listed as primary management species in the 2016 lake management plan with goals near the average catches for the lake.  Bluegill also have size goals of maintaining a quality fishery.  Northern Pike and Black Crappie are secondary management species. <br> \n <br> \nThis was the third targeted Bluegill and Black Crappie survey conducted in the spring when they are most susceptible.  The first spring assessment (2000) only measured Bluegill.  Catches and composition from spring surveys tend to be variable due to spring weather patterns and the progression of spawning activity and should be viewed cautiously.  Growth statistics and the range of lengths collected during this period tend to be relatively reliable.  However, size structure indices can be biased by the variability in daily catches related to water temperature and seasonal timing. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap net catch rates for Bluegill exceeded previous survey catches, yet were lower than those from other area Bluegill lakes.  Summer survey catches have typically been lower than those from similar lakes.  Low population densities often exhibit quality size structure.  Lengths ranged from 2.6 to 9.7 inches with an average of 7.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMales and females were distributed fairly evenly in the sample.  Ages 2 to 10 were present and somewhat evenly distributed, including ages between males and females.  The even distribution suggests consistent natural reproduction.  Average length was comparable to lakes similar to Little Bowstring though older fish tended to have slightly better growth.  Both males and females averaged over 8 inches by age 7. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate above the previous spring surveys.  Summer catch rates have typically been lower than expected.  Size structure was decent and similar to previous surveys.  Lengths ranged from 4.8 to 12.2 inches and an average of 9.7 inches.  Ages 2 to 7 were present however age 5 comprising 61% of the sample.  Black Crappie growth was similar to statewide averages, though slightly slower than the previous survey.  Black Crappie averaged 8.9 inches by age 4 in 2019 but exceeded 10 inches by the same age in 2015. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Little Bowstring Lake was conducted on July 19th and 20th, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 9, 2021 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Little Bowstring Lake is in very good health as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Big Fork River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Bowstring is located about twelve miles north of Deer River, MN, within the Chippewa National Forest, and the Big Fork River watershed.  The 319 acre lake has 115 littoral acres, a maximum depth of 33 feet and a little more than three miles of shoreline.  The lake has three small inlets, from Pike Lake, Maki Lake, and Grave Lake with one outlet to the Bowstring River.  Secchi disk transparency was 4.5 feet in 2015 and the lake is considered to have moderate fertility and hardness.  All of the shoreline is in private ownership and moderately developed.  There is one county owned public access on the south shore.  Walleye and Bluegill are primary management species with a management goal of 7.0/net for Walleye and a Bluegill summer trap net catch of 5.0/net with PSD and RSD-8 values of 40 and 20.  Northern Pike and Black Crappie are secondary management species. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 standard survey is the most recent and one of nine summer assessments conducted since 1971.  Summer assessments are conducted to monitor the fish community for changes in catch rates, size structure, and growth rates.  Pike River strain Walleye fry are stocked biennially in odd years at a rate of 1,000/surface acres (319,000).  The lake management plan was last updated in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population appears to be healthy with the 2015 catch exceeding what was expected for lakes similar to Little Bowstring.  Similarly, higher than average catches had been observed in the past two assessments and above the management goal.  Lengths ranged from 9.7 to 27.1 inches and an average length of 17.6 inches.  Analysis of ageing structures indicated the majority of the sample correlated with stocked year classes.  Fry stocking appears to be successful and a significant contributor to the fishery.  Growth was average as Walleye were 16.3 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nSummer assessments have typically sampled Bluegill in low numbers with trap net catch rates below the probable range in all but the 2008 assessment which was only slightly within a projected range.  The catch rate was 3.0/trap net in 2015, near management goals.  Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 8.9 inches with an average length of 7.2 inches, similar to previous assessments.  A more comprehensive survey was conducted in the spring of 2015 specifically targeting Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in trap nets at an likely rate, and similar to previous assessments.  Black Crappie were also sampled in gill nets at a historically high rate, nearly triple of what was expected.  Lengths from the gill net sample ranged from 4.2 to 13.9 inches with fish less than five inches the most frequently sampled (73%).  Scale analysis identified ages 1-4, 7, and 8 present, with age-1 most common.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for age 1-4 fish.  Growth from fish caught in the spring (2015) exceeded statewide averages. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled near the high end of a predictable range and the previous assessment.  Past catch rates tended to be variable but had an increasing trend.  Size structure was poor with lengths from 14.2 to 25.8 inches and an average length of 19.8 inches.  Scale and cleithera analysis identified ages 1-6 present.  Ages 2 and 3 were the most common in the sample.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for all ages.  Northern Pike averaged 20.9 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were sampled at a rate of 1.3/gill net, within the anticipated range of catch rates.  Lengths ranged from 8.0 to 17.3 inches with an average length of 11.7 inches.  Triaenophorus, an internal parasitic worm, was not found in examinations of 12 Tullibee.  Yellow Perch were sampled within the range of expected catch rates, yet down from the previous assessment.  Lengths ranged from 5.2 to 12.8 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches, suggesting Yellow Perch may be of interest to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Bowstring is located about twelve miles north of Deer River, MN, within the Chippewa National Forest, and the Big Fork River watershed.  The 319 acre lake has 115 littoral acres, a maximum depth of 33 feet and a little more than three miles of shoreline.  The lake has three small inlets, from Pike Lake, Maki Lake, and Grave Lake with one outlet to the Bowstring River.  Secchi disk transparency was 4.5 feet in 2015 and the lake is considered to have moderate fertility and hardness.  All of the shoreline is in private ownership and moderately developed.  There is one public access on the south shore.  Walleye and Bluegill are primary management species with a management goal of 7.0/net for Walleye and a Bluegill summer trap net catch of 5.0/net with PSD and RSD-8 values of 40 and 20.  Northern Pike and Black Crappie are secondary management species. <br> \n <br> \nThis was the second targeted Bluegill and Black Crappie survey conducted in the spring when they are most susceptible.  The first spring assessment (2000) only measured Bluegill.  Catches and composition from spring surveys tend to be variable due to spring weather patterns and the progression of spawning activity and should be viewed cautiously.  Growth statistics and the range of lengths collected during this period tend to be relatively reliable.  However, size structure indices can be biased by the variability in daily catches related to water temperature and seasonal timing. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catch rates for Bluegill exceeded those from 2000, yet were lower than those from other area Bluegill lakes.  Summer assessments have typically sampled Bluegill in low numbers with catch rates below the expected range for similar lakes.  Low population densities often exhibit quality size structure.  Lengths ranged from 3.1 to 9.9 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches, which is similar to what was observed in summer assessments. <br> \n <br> \nSex determination identified a fairly even distribution between males and females.  Scale analysis identified ages 2 to 9 present with a somewhat even distribution of ages.  Ages between males and females were also fairly evenly distributed.  The even distribution suggests consistent natural reproduction.  Mean length was comparable to lakes similar to Little Bowstring at age 1, while length at age for age 2 and older individuals exceeded lake class averages.  Both males and females averaged over 8 inches by age 7. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 24 Black Crappie were sampled above the previous spring assessment.  Catch rates from summer assessments have typically been low, usually below the expected range.  Size structure was good with lengths from 7.7 to 13.2 inches and an average length of 9.3 inches, similar to summer assessments.  Scale analysis identified ages 3 to 6 present with age 3 comprising 80% of the sample.  The Black Crappie population is similar to that of other area lakes, and demonstrates a boom/bust nature.  Black Crappie growth was fast, exceeding statewide averages for all ages, with fish averaging 10.7 inches by age 4. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Bowstring lake has historically been managed as a walleye lake.  The walleye gill net catch rate exceeds the expected range for this type of lake suggesting that walleye abundance is high.  Walleye sampled in the gill nets ranged from 9.4 to 23.4 inches in length and had a mean of 14.6 inches.  Growth appears to be about average.     Northern pike abundance appears to be within the expected range.  The northern pike sampled in the gill nets had a mean length of 20.1 inches and a mean weight of 1.8 pounds.  Growth appears to be average.     The yellow perch gill net catch rate is well above the expected range.  Prior to the 1989 assessment, catch rates were much lower.  Yellow perch caught in the gill nets ranged from 4.8 to 11.2 inches in length and had a mean length of 7.9 inches.     Bluegill abundance in Little Bowstring Lake has always been low.  However, the mean size of the bluegill (7.2 inches) that were sampled in the trap nets is good.  Growth rates also appear to be good.     Black crappie abundance appears to be low.  Catch rates for both trap nets and gill nets were low.     Tullibee were sampled at the highest rate yet in this survey.  Catch rates have been within the expected range in all of the assessments conducted on the lake.       Although no largemouth bass were sampled in the gill and trap nets, some were captured while seining.  Other species sampled include; white sucker, bowfin, rock bass, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, brown and yellow bullhead, blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, golden shiner, spottail shiner, bluntnose minnow and Johnny darter.     Nutrient levels in Little Bowstring Lake appear to be slightly elevated leading to the blue-green algae bloom that was observed during this survey.  Although the exact sources of those nutrients is not clear, each lakeshore owner and user has the ability to reduce the impact they have on the lakes water quality by practicing wise use of the lakeshore.  Additionally, anglers can preserve this quality fishery by pacticing catch and release or selective harvest.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Bowstring Lake is a 319 acre lake located 16 miles northeast of Deer River, MN.  The lake has a county access on the south shore and low to moderate shoreline development.  The 2003 lake management plan indicated walleye were the primary species of management with bluegill and northern pike as secondary species. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie population has continued to be low to moderate density with good size structure.  In 2008, the gill-net catch rate (1.2/net) approached the lake class median while the trap-net catch rate (0.6/net) was near the 1st quartile.  The 16 fish sampled in the gill nets and trap nets ranged from 5.0 to 12.1 inches and had a mean length of 10.5 inches.  Four year-classes from age 1 to age 6 were sampled.  Age-5 and age-6 fish were the most prevalent, representing a combined 69% of the sample.  Based on mean back-calculated lengths, growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages and class 31 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net catch rates have been low (ranging from 0 to 7.5/net) in all assessments.  The catch in 2008 was the highest on record at 7.5 fish/net; which exceeded the 1st quartile of 6.1 fish/net for lake class 31.  Gill-net catch rates for bluegill were also higher than usual.  Gill nets sampled distinctly larger bluegill than trap nets.  The fish captured with gill nets ranged from 4.1 to 9.5 inches and had a mean length of 8.2 inches while trap net sampled fish ranged from 3.4 to 7.6 inches and had a mean length of 4.8 inches.  Although age and growth information was not collected in this assessment, growth was likely good in response to the lake fertility and low density population. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from 1.5 northern pike/net in 1971 to the high of 10.9 northern pike/net in 2008.  The four prior assessments captured northern pike from 6.1 to 7.8 fish/gill net.  The 2008 catch was near the 3rd quartile of 10.5 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 14.6 to 32.4 inches and had a mean length of 21.2 inches.  Eight year classes were sampled from age 1 to age 8.  Each of the age-classes from two to five represented roughly 20% of the sample, indicating consistent recruitment.  Growth was similar to the statewide averages for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill-net catch rate of 11.3 fish/net exceeded the 3rd quartile of 5.0 fish/net.  The catch in 2008 was the same as in 2002 and exceeded the management goal of 7.0 fish/gill net.  Walleye from 6.8 to 26.5 inches were sampled from gill nets with a mean length of 14.8 inches.  Ten year classes were determined by scales and bony structures.  The 2007 and 2005 year-classes represented 28 and 40% of the sample, respectively.  Based on age analysis, some natural reproduction exists but walleye fry stocking appears to be the primary source of fish driving the fishery.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages through age 10. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important prey for many predator species.  Yellow perch were sampled at a gill-net catch rate of 57.1 fish/net, which exceeded the 3rd quartile of 43.6 fish/net.  Historical gill-net catch rates have never been below the lake class median and have been above the 3rd quartile in three assessments.  The sample was dominated by small fish, but fish ranged from 5.1 to 10.4 inches with a mean length of 7.0 inches.  Age and growth information were not collected in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the population assessment included bowfin, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the edge of the water, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnesota DNR Fisheries IBI program staff conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on Little Bowstring Lake on June 09, 2022, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 34 survey sites evenly spaced 150 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 83 (+/- 3.0) out of 100 possible. Approximately 50 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 71.3 (+/- 4.4), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 94.5 (+/- 1.4).\n\nRiparian lakeshore habitat quality, as indicated by a MNDNR StS score of 83, is moderate within Little Bowstring Lake and above the statewide average score of 73. A moderate score indicates that a high percentage of habitat is unaltered but at least one zone has lower habitat quality than a high scoring site. Protection of undisturbed riparian and aquatic habitat should provide buffering capacity, shoreline stability, and future contributions of coarse woody habitat into the lake.</p>",
