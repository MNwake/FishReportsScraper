                "narrative": "<p>Oliver Lake is located in western Swift County, approximately 9 miles north of Appleton.  Original maps of the lake indicated a lake area of 513 acres, but a wet period during the mid-90s increased the lake area to over 600 acres, which is split into an east (455 acres) and west (211 acres) basin by Swift County Highway 5.  This special assessment consisted of fall electrofishing both basins to evaluate young-of-year (YOY) walleye abundance.  In the spring of 2008, over 200,000 walleye fry were stocked into Oliver Lake.  In addition, 20 adult and 9,390 yearling walleye were stocked into the west basin in the spring of 2008.  Prior to stocking, fry were marked with oxytetracycline (OTC).  Oliver Lake as a whole had a catch rate of 109.7 YOY walleye per hour electrofishing.  The YOY walleye had a mean length of 6.1 inches and were in good physical condition with a mean relative weight of 95.  Looking at just the east basin, 162 YOY walleye per hour electrofishing were caught.  The YOY walleye in the east basin had a mean length of 6.1 inches and were in good physical condition with a mean relative weight of 97.  The YOY walleye in west basin were less abundant (40 YOY walleye per hour electrofishing), had a similar mean length (6.1 inches), but were in fair condition with a mean relative weight of only 86.  Evaluation of the walleye fry for the OTC mark indicated that 100% of the 2008 year class in Oliver lake was due to stocking.  The large number of yearling walleye stocked in the west basin also appeared to have good survival as 196 yearling walleye per hour electrofishing were observed.  The population of walleye in both of these basins should provide good fishing in the future on Oliver Lake.   </p>",

Swift County Highway 5 splits the lake into east (455 acres) and west (210 acres) basins.  Although a culvert exists under the highway, limited fish migration apparently occurs as the basins typically have substantially different fish populations.  Both basins have maximum depths of approximately 30 feet. <br> \n     The east basin had high numbers of walleye and yellow perch in 2010.  Walleye primarily measured 9-16 inches, however fish up to 25 inches were present.  Yellow perch primarily measured 7-12 inches. <br> \n     The west basin had moderate numbers of black crappie, bluegill, and walleye.  Black crappie measured 7-12 inches, bluegill 7-9 inches, and walleye 9-13 inches.  Yellow perch were also sampled, but in low numbers.  <br> \n     Very limited walleye natural reproduction has occurred in Oliver Lake and the population has been primarily maintained by stocking.  Yellow perch, black crappie, and bluegill frequently have experienced very good natural reproduction and these species have been self-sustaining.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>ELEVEN FISH SPECIES WERE SAMPLED IN THE RESURVEY OF OLIVER LAKE.  MORE FISH SPECIES WERE SAMPLED IN 1992 THAN IN THE 1984 INITIAL LAKE SURVEY OR THE 1988 POPULATION ASSESSMENT.  WTS, BIB PMK AND HSF WERE SAMPLED FOR THE FIRST TIME.  CARP CATCH RATES DECREASED FROM THE 1988 ASSESSMENT LEVELS OF 25.8 FISH AND 36.2 POUNDS PER GILL NET SET TO 5.7 FISH AND 19.9 POUNDS PER SET IN THIS INVESTIGATION.  CURRENT GILL NET CATCH RATES REMAINED SUBSTATIALLY ABOVE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 33 BOTH BY NUMBER AND POUNDS.  THE DECREASE IN CARP ABUNDANCE MAY HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF A RESUMPTION OF COMMERCIAL FISHING OPERATIONS IN THE WINTERS OF 1989-90 AND 1990-91. THIS EFFORT REMOVED 142,300 POUNDS OF CARP FROM THE EAST BASIN OF OLIVER LAKE.  MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF CARP SAMPLED IN 1992 INCREASED FROM THE 1988 MEANS OF 15.1 INCHES AND 1.9 POUND TO 20.9 INCHES AND 4.5 POUNDS.  THIS INCREASE MAY BEEN IN RESPONSE TO THE DECREASE IN CARP NUMBERS.  TWO WTS WERE SAMPLED IN TRAP NETS IN THIS INVESTIGATION.  WHILE COMMERCIAL FISH REMOVAL DATA FROM 1959-60 REPORTED THE HARVEST OF WTS FROM OLIVER LAKE, THIS IS THE FIRST MDNR INVESTIGATION IN WHICH THEY WERE SAMPLED.  THIS SPECIES MAY HAVE MIGRATED FROM UPSTREAM SOURCES IN 1986 WHEN WATER LEVELS WERE 3.0 FT ABOVE PRESENT LEVELS, OR THEY MAY HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED BY ANGLERS USING THEM AS BAIT. SIZES OF THESE SUCKERS WOULD INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE PROBABLY BEEN PRESENT IN THE LAKE SYSTEM FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  TWO YEARLING BIB, 7.5 TO 8.4 INCHES LONG WERE SAMPLED IN GILL NETS IN THIS INVESTIGATION.  THE ORIGIN OF BIB IN OLIVER LAKE IS UNKNOWN.  LOCAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT LARGER ADULT FISH WERE PRESENT IN COMMERCIAL SEINING OPERATIONS CONDUCTED ON THE LAKE DURING THE WINTERS OF 1989-90 AND 1990-91.  BLB GILL AND TRAP NET CATCH RATES DECREASED SUBSTANTIALLY COMPARED TO THE 1988 ASSESSMENT.  CURRENT GILL NET CATCH RATES OF 11.1 FISH AND 4.3 POUNDS PER SET ARE WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGES FOR LAKE CLASS 33. TOTAL LENGTHS OF BLBS SAMPLED RANGED FROM 4.5 TO 11.4 INCHES.  MEAN INDIVIDUAL LENGTH AND WEIGHT INCREASED FROM 6.9 INCHES AND 0.2 POUNDS IN THE PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION TO 8.1 INCHES AND 0.4 POUNDS IN 1992.  THE DECREASE IN ABUNDANCE AND INCREASE IN AVERAGE SIZE OF BLB MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN IN RESPONSE TO COMMERCIAL FISHING OPERATIONS, WHICH REMOVED 4,700 POUNDS OF BLB FROM THE EAST BASIN IN THE WINTER OF 1989-90.  THE 1984 INITIAL LAKE SURVEY ALSO SAMPLED A LOW DENSITY BLB POPULATION WITH AN AVERAGE SIZE FISH OF 11.0 INCHES AND 1.3 POUNDS.  THAT INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED AFTER FOUR CONSECUTIVE WINTERS OF COMMERCIAL HARVEST WHICH REMOVED 3,200 POUNDS OF BLB.  A 1988 OPEN WATER CREEL SURVEY ON OLIVER LAKE ESTIMATED A CATCH RATE OF ONLY 0.005 BLB PER ANGLER HOUR, INDICATING THAT THEY PROBABLY PLAY AN INCIDENTAL ROLE IN THE ANGLERS CREEL AND MAY BE MORE ECONOMICALLY UTILIZED BY COMMERCIAL HARVESTERS WHEN FISH ARE OF A MARKETABLE SIZE. HSF, PMK, AND BLG WERE SAMPLED IN LOW NUMBERS IN THIS INVESTIGATION.  PMK GILL AND TRAP NET CATCH RATES WERE BELOW THE NORMAL RANGE FOR BOTH NUMBERS AND POUNDS FOR LAKE CLASS 33.  ONLY ONE ADULT BLG WAS CAPTURED IN 1992, DURING NATURAL REPRODUCTION SAMPLING.  DESPITE STOCKINGS OF ADULT BLG IN 1976 AND 1980, AND DOCUMENTED NATURAL REPRODUCTION IN 1977. '82,'84,'88 AND '90 THIS SPECIES HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A SELF SUSTAINING POPULATION.  NONE OF THESE SUNFISH SPECIES SEEM TO BE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE OLIVER LAKE FISHERY.  OSS CATCH RATES INCREASED FROM 0.6 FISH AND 0.1 POUNDS PER GILL NET SET IN 1988 TO 10.7 FISH AND 1.0 POUNDS PER SET IN THIS INVESTIGATION. TRAP NET CATCH RATES ALSO FROM 1.0 FISH AND 0.1 POUNDS PER SET TO 3.3 FISH AND 0.3 POUNDS PER SET. CURRENT CATCH RATES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THOSE SEEN FROM OTHER LAKES WITHIN THE ORTONVILLE MANAGEMENT AREA.  THIS SPECIES HAS THE ABILITY TO TOLERATE HIGHER LEVELS OF TURBIDITY, HIGHER PH LEVELS AND PROLONGED PERIODS OF LOW DISSOLVED OXYGEN. IT IS REPORTED TO READILY HYBRIDIZE AND OUT-COMPETE OTHER SUNFISH SPECIES FOR AVAILABLE HABITAT.  THESE FACTORS MAY HELP EXPLAIN THE INCREASED PRESENCE OF OSS AND THE ABSENCE OF A MORE DESIRABLE BLG FISHERY IN OLIVER LAKE.  BLC CATCH RATES ALSO SHOWED MARKED INCREASED, GOING FROM 1.9 FISH AND 1.0 POUNDS PER TRAP NET SET IN 1988 TO 6.5 FISH AND 3.8 POUNDS PER SET IN 1992.  GILL NET CATCH RATES ALSO INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY FOUR TIMES ABOVE PREVIOUS LEVELS.  THE CURRENT TRAP NET CATCH RATE IS NOW ABOVE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR NUMBERS PER SET AND SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE NORMAL FOR POUNDS PER SET FOR LAKE CLASS 33.  TOTAL LENGTH OF BLC SAMPLED RANGED FROM 3.7 TO 13.0 INCHES, WITH A MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF 7.7 INCHES AND 0.5 POUNDS.  WHILE THE MEAN LENGTH OF BLC DECREASED FROM 9.3 INCHES IN 1988, THE MEAN WEIGHT REMAINED ABOUT THE SAME. INCREASES IN THE ABUNDANCES OF OLDER, LARGER FISH AND IN SMALLER, YOUNGER FISH WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CHANGE.  SEVEN CONSECUTIVE YEAR CLASSES OF BLC, FROM 1992 (AGE 0+) THROUGH 1986 (AGE 6+) WERE SAMPLED IN THIS INVESTIGATION.  73% OF THE BLC WERE REPRESENTED BY AGE 1+ AND 2+ FISH.  THE STRENGTH OF THESE YOUNGER YEAR CLASSES INDICATES THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND RECRUITMENT OF BLC HAS IMPROVED SINCE 1988.  THIS MAY BE DUE TO HIGHER LAKE LEVELS WHICH INCREASED AVAILABLE SPAWNING HABITAT AND/OR THE RECENT REMOVAL OF CARP, WHOSE ACTIVITIES MAY HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BLC SPAWNING SUCCESS.  THE 1992 (AGE 0+) YEAR CLASS WAS REPRESENTED BY A SINGLE FISH, 1.5 INCHES LONG.  THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT YOY BLC HAVE BEEN SAMPLED FROM OLIVER LAKE.  THE ABSENCE OF LARGER NUMBERS OF YOY FISH IN THIS INVESTIGATION IS UNUSUAL IN VIEW OF STRENGTH OF NATURALLY REPRODUCED YEAR CLASSES IN 1989, AND '90 AND '91 .  DUE TO ABNORMALLY COOL SUMMER TEMPERATURES, YOY BLC MAY HAVE BEEN SMALLER AND THEREFORE NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO STANDARD SAMPLING GEARS IN 1992.  INCREASED EFFORTS WITH 1/4 TRAP NETS DURING THE FALL SEASON MAY IMPROVE QUANTITATIVE DATA ON THE STRENGTH OF YOY BLC YEAR CLASSES IN OLIVER LAKE.  GROWTH RATES OF ALL YEAR CLASSES IN 1992 EXCEEDED STATE AVERAGES FOR BLC GROWTH AND WERE COMPARABLE TO GROWTH RATES OBSERVED FROM OTHER LOCAL LAKES WITH BLC POPULATIONS.  BASED ON STANDARDIZED LENGTH CATEGORIES, 59% OF BLC WERE A QUALITY SIZE OF 8.0 INCHES OR GREATER, 23% WERE A PREFERRED SIZE OF 10.0 INCHES OR GREATER, AND APPROXIMATELY 1% WERE A MEMORABLE SIZE OF 12.0 OR LARGER.  THESE FISH SHOULD MAKE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE ANGLER'S CREEL AND INCREASE ANGLING OPPORTUNITIES DURING BOTH OPEN WATER AND WINTER SEASONS.  YEP FIRST APPEARED IN MDNR SAMPLING IN A 1988 POPULATION ASSESSMENT.  ONLY ONE FISH WAS CAPTURED IN THAT INVESTIGATION.  IN 1990, 4,870 ADULT YEP WERE STOCKED INTO THE EAST BASIN OF OLIVER LAKE. THE INTENT OF THIS STOCKING WAS TO BOLSTER A LIMITED FORAGE BASE AND POSSIBLY IMPROVE WAE GROWTH RATES.  YEP WOULD ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ANGLING OPPORTUNITIES IN A LAKE SYSTEM WHICH HAD FEW DIFFERENT GAME FISH SPECIES.  GILL NET CATCH RATES OF YEP IN 1992 (4.3 FISH AND 2.4 POUNDS PER SET) WERE NEAR THE LOW END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR NUMBER PER SET AND WERE WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR POUNDS PER SET FOR LAKE CLASS 33.  THIRTY YEP RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 7.8 TO 11.3 INCHES WERE SAMPLED IN GILL NETS.  MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT WERE 10.2 INCHES AND 0.6 POUNDS.  AN ADDITIONAL 14 YOY YEP WERE SAMPLED BY SHORELINE SEINING AND 1/4 TRAPNETTING.  THESE FISH RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 3.3 TO 3.8 INCHES.  FOUR YEAR CLASSES, 1992 (AGE 0+) AND 1989 (AGE 3+) THROUGH 1987 (AGE 5+) WERE SAMPLED IN THIS INVESTIGATION.  BASED ON THE 1992 AGE CLASS DISTRIBUTION IT APPEARS THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION OR RECRUITMENT OF YEP WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN 1990 AND 1991.  WHILE SOME REPRODUCTION WAS OBSERVED IN 1992, THE WEAKNESS OF THIS YEAR CLASS MAY INDICATE THAT PREDATORS ARE UTILIZING YOY PERCH AS FORAGE, OR THAT OTHER FACTORS ARE LIMITING THE YEP POPULATION.  97% OF THE YEP SAMPLED IN THIS INVESTIGATION WERE A QUALITY SIZE OF 8.0 INCHES OR GREATER IN LENGTH AND 63% WERE A PREFERRED SIZE OF 10.0 INCHES OR GREATER.  ALTHOUGH THE ABUNDANCE OF YEP IN OLIVER LAKE APPEARS LOW, THE SIZE OF FISH AVAILABLE TO ANGLERS IS DESIRABLE.  WAE GILL NET CATCH RATES INCREASED ALMOST THREE TIMES, FROM 10.8 FISH AND 13.9 POUNDS PER SET IN 1988 TO 29.6 FISH AND 47.6 POUNDS PER SET IN 1992.  CURRENT GILL NET CATCH RATES REMAINED SUBSTATIALLY ABOVE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR BOTH NUMBER AND POUNDS FOR LAKE CLASS 33. TOTAL LENGTHS OF WAE SAMPLED RANGED FROM 10.7 TO 25.0 INCHES WITH A MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF 16.1 POUNDS.  THESE MEANS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER THAN THOSE FROM PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS.  WAE WERE COLLECTED FROM 1989 (AGE 3+) 1988 (AGE 4+) AND 1985 (AGE 7+) YEAR CLASSES.  THE 1989 (AGE 3+) YEAR CLASS REPRESENTED 90% OF THE WAE SAMPLED. ALL WAE YEAR CLASSES CORRESPONDED TO YEAR OF WAE FRY STOCKING IN OLIVER LAKE.  WAE FROM THE MOST RECENT 1991 FRY STOCKING WERE NOT SAMPLED IN 1992. THIS MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM INCREASED PREDATION ON WAE FRY BY YEP OR BLC.  NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF WAE HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED BY SEINING IN 1974, '75, '76,'81 AND '84, AND ALL PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS HAVE CONTAINED NATURALLY REPRODUCED YEAR CLASSES. HOWEVER, SUCCESSFUL REPRODUCTION APPEARS TO HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE SPORADIC SINCE THE 1984 INITIAL LAKE SURVEY.  NO YOY WAE HAVE BEEN SAMPLED IN ANY GEAR TYPES SINCE THAT INVESTIGATION.  GROWTH RATES OF WAE IN 1992 WERE GENERALLY ABOVE AVERAGE WHEN COMPARED TO STATEWIDE AVERAGES FOR WAE GROWTH. AN UNUSUALLY WIDE RANGE OF GROWTH HAS BEEN NOTED IN THE YOUNGER WAE YEAR CLASSESIN THE LAST TWO INVESTIGATIONS.  IN 1992, AGE 3+ WAE RANGED FROM 10.7 TO 18.7 INCHES AT CAPTURE.  IN THE 1988 ASSESSMENT AGE 3+ WAE RANGED FROM 9.5 TO 19.5 INCHES AT CAPTURE.  POOR NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND POSSIBLY LOW SURVIVAL OF STOCKED WAE HAVE RESULTED IN PERIODIC WEAK YEAR CLASSES.  WHEN COUPLED WITH THE UNUSUAL GROWTH RATES AMONG YOUNGER FISH, THIS HAS RESULTED IN PERIODS WHEN FEW CATCHABLE SIZE WAE WERE AVAILABLE TO ANGLERS.  HOWEVER, THE CURRENT WAE FISHERY IS REPRESENTED BY NUMEROUS ANGLER ACCEPTABLE SIZE FISH AND SHOULD PROVIDE INCREASED ANGLING OPPORTUNITIES DURING THE UPCOMING OPEN WATER AND WINTER SEASON.  BASED ON STANDARDIZED LENGTH CATEGORIES, 79% OF THE WAE SAMPLED WERE A QUALITY SIZE OF 15.0 INCHES OR GREATER, AND LESS THAN 1% WERE A PREFERRED SIZE OF 20.0 INCHES OR GREATER IN LENGTH.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Oliver is a 513 acre lake located nine miles north of the City of Appleton.  With a maximum depth of over 30 feet, Oliver is one of the deepest lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Although the lake is divided into two basins by Swift County Highway #5, a culvert connects the two and allows for fish passage.  Oliver Lake has been primarily managed for walleye, with secondary emphasis on black crappie, bluegill and yellow perch.     Approximately 240,000 walleye fry are stocked into Oliver Lake every two of three years.  Adult, fingerling, and yearling walleye were also stocked in 2001 and 2004 to supplement weak or missing year classes.  According to test nets in 2004, adult walleye were moderately abundant in both basins of Oliver Lake.  Although walleye abundance was lower than observed during the mid-1990's, the quality of the fishery was excellent, with over 45 percent measuring 20 inches or longer.  Yearling walleye stocked in 2004 measured 7-9 inches.  With normal growth rates, many of these fish should measure 12-14 inches by the fall of 2005.     A considerable difference in black crappie abundance was noted between basins in 2004.  Low numbers were sampled in the east basin while high numbers were found in the west basin.  A survey in 2001 had documented much better reproduction in the east basin in that year, and most crappie sampled in the 2004 assessment belonged to this year class.  Either small crappie survived better on the west basin, or a high percentage migrated from the east to the west basin.  Better reproduction was again documented on the east basin in 2004.  Future assessments will further evaluate the population trends of black crappie in Oliver Lake.  Crappie sampled in 2004 mostly measured less than nine inches, although individuals up to 12 inches were also sampled.  Considering normal growth, a high number of black crappie will measure over 10 inches by the fall of 2005.     Yellow perch were abundant in 2004.  Perch ranged from 5-10 inches, with most measuring 8-9 inches.  Perch growth was fast and anglers can expect many perch measuring near 10 inches by the fall of 2005.  Good numbers of young-of-year yellow perch were also sampled in 2004, which should sustain the perch fishery for the next few years.     Adult bluegill were stocked into Oliver Lake in 2002 and 2003.  Good numbers of young-of-year bluegill were sampled in both 2003 and 2004.  Bluegill from these year classes will likely require three or four growing seasons to reach 6-7 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to practice catch and release on bluegill caught in the next few years to preserve broodstock.  The survival and sustainability of bluegill will be monitored over the next few years.     Northern pike were first sampled in 1995.  A low abundance of pike have been sampled in subsequent assessments, including 2004.  Sampled pike ranged from 27-34 inches and were growing quickly.  The 2002-2004 year classes of pike were weak or missing, indicating the pike population will remain in low abundance over the next few years.      Other species of note sampled in Oliver Lake include black bullhead and pumpkinseed sunfish.  Pumpkinseeds were moderately abundant and most measured less than seven inches and probably would not draw much angling interest.  Black bullhead were numerous and most measured over eight inches.     Fisheries management plans for Oliver Lake include annual fall night electrofishing to evaluate young-of-year walleye abundance, fish stocking as needed, annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen concentrations, and a fish population assessment in 2007.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Oliver Lake (both basins combined) was conducted on July 6, 2017 by Ortonville Area Fisheries staff.  Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations and a 15-foot seine was used at twelve stations.  At times submerged and emergent trees made sampling difficult, particularly on the south shore of the lake.  Nearshore sampling captured 15 native species of fish including two species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance in Iowa Darter and Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey was combined with data from a standard gill and trap net survey in June 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Oliver Lake, based on this survey, is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pomme de Terre Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Oliver Lake is located in western Swift County, approximately nine miles north of Appleton.  The lake is split into an east basin (455 acres) and west basin (211 acres) by Swift County Road 5.  Although a culvert exists under the highway, limited fish movement appears to occur as the basins typically have substantially different fish populations <br> \n <br> \nBoth basins are routinely stocked with Walleyes and at times provide very good Walleye fishing.  During recent years, the Walleyes have primarily been from the 2007-2009 year classes.  These fish averaged around 22 inches in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass have become well established in the east basin.  They were first noted to be present in 2010 and likely resulted from an illegal stocking.  Smallmouth Bass have developed an abundant naturally reproducing population.  Anglers frequently report catching numerous bass of all sizes up to 19 inches.  Several Smallmouth Bass were observed during special sampling on the west basin during 2016 and they will likely increase in abundance there also. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were present in moderate numbers in both basins with fish measuring up to 12 inches.  Lower numbers of Bluegills have typically been present.  They grow fast and can exceed seven inches after three summers.  Black Crappies were moderately abundant in the East Basin and most of them were smaller than desired by anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Oliver Lake is located in western Swift County, approximately 9 miles north of Appleton.  Original maps of the lake indicated a lake area of 513 acres, but a wet period during the mid-90s increased the lake area to over 600 acres, which is split into an east (455 acres) and west (211 acres) basin by Swift County Highway 5.  Primary management species include walleye, yellow perch, black crappie, and bluegill.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in gill nets almost doubled since 2004.  Gill nets captured 6.9 walleye per net in 2004 compared to 12.8 walleye per net during this survey.  This increase is likely due to the increase in fish from the 2003 year class, which made up 56% of the walleye sampled in gill nets during this survey.  Only one walleye from the 2003 year class was sampled in gill nets in 2004.  Walleye from gill nets averaged 15.5 inches long and 1.5 lbs whereas walleye in trap nets averaged 13.2 inches and 1.2 lbs.  Although the 2003 year class was abundant, walleye from the 2005 and 2006 year classes were also numerous.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry were not stocked into Oliver Lake in 2007, but 10,146 yearlings and 25 adult walleye were stocked into the west basin of Oliver Lake in April of 2007.  Fall electrofishing for young-of-year (YOY) walleye sampled 8.6 YOY walleye per hour of electrofishing.  This indicates a small naturally reproduced population of walleye in Oliver Lake.  All of the YOY were sampled in the east basin, but several yearling walleye were observed in the west basin.  Based on the current population of adult and yearling walleye present, anglers can expect good fishing for walleye in the future on Oliver Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance in gill nets (22 per net) was slightly lower than the 2004 survey (23.5 per net).  Nonetheless, the catch rate observed during this survey was higher than the average catch rate for lakes similar to Oliver.  The 2006 year class was most abundant, followed by the 2004 and 2001 year classes. Perch averaged 8 inches long and 0.3 lb, with growth being above average.  YOY perch were abundant in 1/4-inch trap nets (20.8 per net), indicating natural reproduction of perch in 2007.  Yellow perch up to 12 inches long were found during this survey, but anglers can expect the abundant 2006 year class of yellow perch to reach 10 inches in a few years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were the most abundant fish in 3/4-inch trap nets (21.2 per net), which was similar to the catch rate observed in 2004 (23.6 per net).  These catch rates are the highest observed in Oliver Lake since 1995, when ?-inch trap nets captured 38.4 crappie per net.  Average size was similar to 2004, with black crappie averaging 8.1 inches long in 2004 and 8.9 inches during this survey.  Crappie three-years-old (2004 year class) were the dominant year class, with the oldest crappie being five-years-old.  Black crappie were also the most abundant YOY fish in 1/4-inch trap nets, indicating an abundant 2007 year class.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2002, bluegill were introduced into Oliver Lake by stocking 1,635 adults.  Bluegill adults (2,780) were also stocked in 2003.  The introduction appears successful, as the bluegill population is maintaining itself.  Bluegill were captured at a record-high level (3.6 per net) in 3/4-inch trap nets, but still below the average catch rate for lakes similar to Oliver.  Only 0.8 per trap net were captured in 2004.  Several year classes were present, with average size being 6.9 inches and 0.4 lb.  Natural reproduction was observed in 2007, as 1/4-inch trap nets caught 17 YOY bluegill per net.  Although the bluegill population is not abundant, individuals over 9 inches long were sampled and may provide opportunities for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike first appeared in Oliver Lake in 1995, but its abundance has been small.  Only one northern pike was sampled during this survey, which was 28.6 inches long and 5.1 lbs.  Quarter-inch trap nets sampled no YOY pike, indicating a missing 2007 year class. <br> \n <br> \nThe abundance of non-game species appears to be low in Oliver Lake.  Black bullhead were sampled at their lowest levels on record, and only 0.4 common carp were caught per gill net.  Bigmouth buffalo and yellow bullhead were also sampled at low levels.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species present were green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, pumpkinseed, Johnny darter, and fathead minnow.  <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities planned for Oliver Lake include fall electrofishing for YOY walleye, fish stocking as needed, monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and fishing pressure, and a resurvey in 2010.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Oliver Lake is located in western Swift County, approximately nine miles north of the city of Appleton.  The lake is split into an east basin (455 acres) and west basin (211 acres) by Swift County Road 5.  Although a culvert exists under the highway, limited fish migration appears to occur as the basins typically have substantially different fish populations.   Accesses to each basin lie on the north side of each basin off of Highway 5.   <br> \n <br> \nTypically anglers fishing the east basin target walleye and yellow perch.  Abundances of both species were high in 2013.  Most walleye measured 15 - 20 inches and most perch 8 - 10 inches.  Black crappie and bluegill abundances were higher than the previous assessment in 2010.  Most crappie measured 8 - 9 inches and bluegill 5 - 7 inches.  With average growth many crappie should measure 9 - 11 inch crappie and bluegill 6 - 8 inch bluegill in 2014.  Smallmouth bass were first documented on the east basin in 2010.  The 2013 assessment indicated the population had grown substantially with a good number of 14 - 15 inch fish sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie, walleye and yellow perch were moderately abundant on the west basin.  Crappie mostly measured 8 - 9 inches, walleye 15 - 20 inches, and perch 8 - 10 inches.  Bluegill were more abundant on the west basin and a good number of them measured more than 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers wishing to pursue bullheads will find good number of 9 - 11 inch black and yellow bullheads in either basin.  <br> \n</p>",

Because the lake lacks an outlet, abundant precipitation during the past five years has increased the lake's depth about ten feet.     High populations of walleye and black crappie were noted in 1995.  Their numbers were much higher than normal for lakes like Oliver.  Although few large walleye were sampled, many were present from 7-17 inches.  Most black crappie were around 6 or 10 inches long.  Anglers had good success fishing crappies during the fall of 1995.  Yellow perch and black bullhead, although not overly abundant, were present in noticeable numbers.  The majority of the yellow perch were nice sized ranging primarily from 9-12 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Oliver Lake is located approximately nine miles north of Appleton.  It is one of west central Minnesota's deeper lakes with a maximum depth of 35 feet.  However, this is a recent phenomenon.  Oliver Lake lacks an outlet and abundant precipitation during the 1990's increased the lake's depth about fifteen feet.     DNR Fisheries manages Oliver Lake for walleye and black crappie, and high numbers of both species were present in 1998.  Their numbers were much higher than what is considered normal for lakes like Oliver.  Although few large walleye were sampled, many fish were present from 10-16 inches.  Walleye are stocked two of three years and stocking appears to be primarily responsible for maintaining the walleye population.  Most black crappie measured 8-10 inches and five ages of crappie were present.  Black crappie exhibit very successful natural reproduction in Oliver Lake, and numerous young-of-year fish were present in 1998.  Black bullhead were also abundant with many quality sized fish present from 8-11 inches.     The DNR public access was flooded in 1998 and no accessible boat ramp existed on the lake.  Anglers were managing to launch smaller boats from a flooded township road on the lake's southeast end.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Oliver is a 513 acre lake located 9 miles north of Appleton in west central Minnesota.  Above normal precipitation has increased the lake level of Oliver Lake by 14 feet since 1992.  Swift County Highway #5 separates the lake into two basins.  A culvert connects the two basins and allows for fish passage.     Walleye were moderately abundant in 2001.  Walleye ranged from 7-25 inches with most 15-19 inches.  Due to recent missing year classes, walleye fingerlings and yearlings were stocked during the fall of 2001.  Yearlings measured up to 16 inches and would contribute immediately to the walleye fishery.        Black crappie were also moderately abundant.  Most fish were from the 1998 year class and measured 7-9 inches.  Crappie reproduction was excellent in 2001 and many young-of-year fish were sampled.         Yellow perch were abundant.  Perch ranged from 5-10 inches with 8-9 inch fish most common.  Perch abundance has increased cosiderably over the past few years and has coinsided with decreased walleye abundance.  A increase in walleye abundance will likely decrease perch abundance, but should improve perch growth rates and size structure.     Carp were sampled in low abundance in 2001.  Carp experienced a die-off during the fall and winter of 2000 and again during the summer and fall of 2001.  Dead carp were sent to a pathology lab for tests, however the cause of death could not be determined.  No other fish specie was affected by the kill.     Other species sampled in low abundance include black bullhead, northern pike, orangespotted sunfish and white sucker.     A reintroduction of bluegill is planned for 2002.  Enhanced panfish spawning habitat created by increased water levels should allow a reproducing population of bluegill to develop.      Fisheries management activities planned for Oliver Lake include stocking adult bluegill and walleye fry in 2002, annual fall electrofishing to assess young-of-year walleye abundance, annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen concentrations and fishing pressure, and a fish population assessment in 2004.     DNR public accesses on the north shore of each basin off of Swift County Highway #5 were completed in 2000 and 2001 and are available for public use.</p>",
