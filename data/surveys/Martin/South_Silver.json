Local anglers have had good success fishing for walleye and panfish.  Walleye lengths ranged from 11 to 26 inches and weights averaged approximately 1.5 lbs.Bluegill numbers appear to be down according to our net catches in 1994.  Commercial seining reports, however, indicate a high number of bluegill.  Because of the complexity of vegetation and the time of year South Silver is sampled, more bluegill may be present than what is indicated by our nets.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 4.3 to 9.4 inches and weighed approximately 1/3 of a pound.Black crappie numbers were similar to those in 1990 according to our survey.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 8.2 to 9.5 inches and weighed almost 1/2 pound. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Silver Lake is a 245-acre lake located in Martin County and is one of the deeper lakes in the Windom management area with a maximum depth of 22 feet.  South Silver Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  A survey was conducted the week of August 15, 2016 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Walleye catch rate was 1.7 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 6.3 per gill net), but is below the long term average of 2.6 per gill net.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 11.1 to 25.5 inches and averaged 15.7 inches.  Growth was slow, as mean length at age-3 was 11.7 inches.  Walleye fry have been stocked 2 out of 3 years at 1000 per littoral acre since 2007, with limited results.  The opportunity exists to catch Walleye in South Silver Lake, however, the low numbers could make it a challenge.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo Northern Pike, both 29.5 inches, were sampled and were likely from a fingerling stocking in 2008, 2010, or 2011. Northern Pike have historically occurred at low abundances in South Silver Lake, less than 0.6 per gill net since surveys began.  Northern Pike fingerling production has been inconsistent; therefore, scheduled stockings have not occurred since 2011, likely accounting for the low catch rate.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Yellow Perch catch rate was 59.0 per gill net, which is the highest observed catch rate since 1990 and is much greater than expected catch rates in similar lakes (27.9 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.4 to 9.2 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  A fishable population of yellow perch is present, and should reach harvestable lengths in a year or two.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate was 7.7 per trap net, the second highest catch rate observed in South Silver Lake.  Lengths of Black Crappies ranged from 6.6 to 12.6 inches and averaged 8.3 inches.  White Bass have historically occurred in low numbers (less than 0.7 per trap net) in South Silver Lake but in 2016 the catch rate increased to 6.6 per trap net, which is much greater than what would be expected in similar lakes.  Lengths of White bass ranged from 8.4 to 17.4 inches and averaged 10.3 inches.  White Bass are aggressive fish and provide good table fare.   Black Bullhead catch rates in trap nets (4.9 per trap net) and gill nets (3.7 per gill net) were lower than expected catch rates in similar lakes.  The Freshwater Drum catch rate increased from 4.8 per gill net in 2010 to 14.0 per gill net in 2016.  Common Carp abundance has steadily declined since 2006 but was still above the long term average (3.0 per gill net) at 4.3 per gill net in 2016.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Silver is a 245 acre lake located south of Fairmont in Martin County.  The lake has 3.9 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 22.0 feet making South Silver one of the deepest lakes in the Windom Area.  The lake is presently managed for walleye as the primary species while bluegill, yellow perch, northern pike, and largemouth bass are managed secondarily.The walleye population is high when compared to lakes similar to South Silver.  Lengths of walleye sampled in our gill nets ranged from 7.8 to 21.7 inches and averaged 10.7 inches.  The majority of the fish were one year old.  We did not stock walleye in 2001 but the fish may have moved in from Iowa Lake where walleye fry and fingerlings were stocked in 2001.  The longest walleye sampled was caught in a trap net and measured 28.6 inches in length.The bluegill population appears to be low according to the results of the survey.  We have heard from some local residents that a fair number of bluegill are observed under their docks.  Even though the numbers caught in our nets were low, shoreline seining results indicated good natural reproduction of bluegill.The yellow perch population is similar to other lakes like South Silver.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5.7 to 9.5 inches and averaged 6.7 inches.  The majority of perch caught in our nets were only one and two years old.  These fish should be keepers next year.The black crappie population is similar to lakes typical to South Silver.  Lengths of crappie sampled in our trap nets ranged from 4.8 to 10.8 inches but only averaged 5.8 inches.  The majority of the crappie population was only one year old.  This means that it may take another year or two to get up in size where anglers will want to keep them.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not imoprove the current water quality of South Silver Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Silver is a 245-acre lake located seven miles south of Fairmont in Martin County.  The lake has 3.9 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 22 feet with a watershed-to-lake ratio of 3 to 1.  South Silver is only one of a handful of class 24 lakes in the Windom area.  Dawson campground is located on the northwest side of the lake with over 100 campsites.  South Silver is managed primarily for walleye.  Secondary management species include northern pike, and yellow perch.  A screen is in operation of the south side of the lake where water from Iowa lake flows in to prevent movement of unwanted species such as common carp and bullhead.  A lake survey was conducted on South Silver during the week of 08/16/2010. Four gill nets and nine trap nets were used to assess the fish population. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch rate was 3.0 fish/net, which was near the expected catch rate of 2.8 fish/net for this type of lake.  Lengths of walleye ranged from 11 to 18 inches with a mean length of 14 inches.  Several larger walleye were sampled in the trap nets with most of the fish between the 14 and 19 inch range.  The size structure of the walleye indicated a balanced population with the presence of 4 age groups.  Shoreline backpack electrofishing and seining indicated a decent abundance of age 0 walleye indicating a successful fry stocking in the spring of 2010.  As the current walleye population matures larger individuals will be present in the system given the evidence of good survival and a successful 2010 stocking event.  Walleye fishing on South Silver Lake should get better in the next year with the chance to catch a larger fish.  <br> \n <br> \nNo northern pike were caught in South Silver Lake.  The management plan calls for the presence of northern pike in the sample during lake surveys and population assessments.  The long-term catch rate of northern pike in gill nets is 0.2 fish/net,which is very low.  It is possible that the northern pike abundance in South Silver is low enough that they may be difficult to sample.  Larger northern pike (greater than 30 inches) have been caught on South Silver and anglers could catch a few northern pike.  <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill net catch rate was 22.3 fish/net, which was between the average and upper quartile (10.5 and 27.9 respectively) for lake class 24.  This was the greatest catch rate since 1998.  Lengths of yellow perch in the gill nets and trap nets ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a mean length near 6.5 inches.  The population is dominated by 5 to 8 inch yellow perch and the overall condition of yellow perch was good indicating fish are foraging successfully.  While the population is dominated by smaller individuals, it is apparent that several strong year classes of yellow perch will be present in South Silver Lake for the next several years.  Fishing for yellow perch appears to be getting better on South Silver as the abundance appears to be increasing. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trap net catch rate was 1.8 fish/net which was well below the interquartile range (7.5 to 62.5 fish/net) for lake class 24 but above the long-term trap net catch rate of 1.1 fish/net for South Silver Lake.  Lengths of bluegill in the sample ranged from 3 to 8 inches with a mean of 6 inches.  The size structure of the bluegill in the sample indicated a balanced population.  The overall condition of the bluegill in the sample was excellent indicating a relatively healthy population of bluegill.  Fishing for bluegill on South Silver may be slower compared to similar lakes, but the bluegill that are caught here are very healthy with some potential of a trophy being caught. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie trap net catch rate was 4.6 fish per net which was within the interquartile range (1.8 to 21.2 fish/net) for lake class 24.  The current catch rate exceeds the long-term trap net catch rate for South Silver Lake (3.4 fish/net) which indicated the population is doing well within the lake.  Lengths of black crappie ranged from 6 to 10 inches with a mean length of 8.5 inches.  The size structure of the population shows that there are plenty of fish greater than 8 inches indicating a population dominated by larger fish.  The overall condition was excellent indicating the black crappie are in very good shape.  Black crappie abundance, size structure, and health all appear to be good in South Silver Lake and the fishing should also be good. <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead catch rate in the gill nets was 11.0 fish/net which was in the expected interquartile range of 2.5 to 45.0 fish/net and below the long term average of 17.7 fish/net.  Black bullhead ranged in size from 7 to 8 inches with a mean of 7.5 inches indicating a very strong year class of bullhead dominated the catch.  The trap net catch rate was the highest ever observed at 147.2 fish/net and was nearly 6 times the upper quartile value of 25.7 fish/net for South Silver Lake.  The black bullhead ranged in length from 7 to 10 inches with a mean length of 7.5 inches with 96% of the total catch (n=1325) in the 6.5 to 8 inch range.  It appears that the black bullhead population is dominated by a single year class in South Silver Lake, the fish are relatively small now but in a year or two the black bullhead will be at a harvestable size for anglers.    <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled in gill nets and trap nets were bigmouth buffalo, channel catfish, common carp, freshwater drum, and yellow bullhead.  All of these species were within or lower than the expected catch rate quartiles.  An exception to that was bigmouth buffalo and common carp caught in gill nets, both species had catch rates that were greater than the upper quartiles and were dominated by larger individuals.  <br> \n   <br> \nShoreline sampling was conducted for South Silver Lake.   Some of the species sampled in the nets were also sampled by the shoreline sampling.  Some species that were sampled by shoreline sampling that were not caught in nets were Johnny darter, emerald shiner, fathead minnow, green sunfish, largemouth bass, and spot fin shiner.  It appears that the bluegill population in South Silver is reproducing successfully and a moderate to strong year class was produced in the summer of 2010.  Additionally, the walleye fry stocking in the spring of 2010 appears to be successful as a moderate abundance of age 0 walleye were observed in the shoreline sampling.  The green sunfish population is in high abundance as 110.1 fish/hour were caught by backpack electrofishing.  It appears by the shoreline catch rates that there is adequate reproduction and forage within the system to maintain a healthy fish community in South Silver Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality and clarity can be improved by implementing Best Management Practices (BMPs).  An example of BMPs is planting and restoring native grasses and forbs along shorelines and waterways to buffer the effects of erosion and nutrient loading.  For more examples and information on BMPs and what you can do, contact your local Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) office or DNR office.    <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Silver Lake is a 245-acre, deep lake, located in Martin County.  The maximum depth is 22 feet, making it one of the deeper lakes in the Windom management area.  A survey was conducted the week of August 8, 2022 to monitor the fish population using 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets.  Fourteen species of fish were caught during the survey.  Common Carp (27.4%), Black Crappie (24.4%), Freshwater Drum (15.7%), Black Bullhead (9.7%), and Bigmouth Buffalo (9.3%) were most abundant by percent of total biomass (pounds).  All other species (Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, White Bass, White Crappie, Yellow Bullhead, Yellow Perch, Bluegill, and Channel Catfish) each made up 3% or less of the total biomass.  South Silver Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  Walleye and Yellow Perch will continue to be actively stocked and managed.  Additionally, Black Crappie are a species of interest and will be closely monitored as they are popular among local anglers. <br> \n <br> \nTwo Walleye were caught in gill nets and 6 Walleye were caught in trap nets.  The gill net catch rate was 0.67 per gill net, less than the lower expected range for class 24 lakes (expected range is 1.2 to 6.3 per gill net) and less than the long term average of 2.4 per gill net.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from just under 10 inches to 16 inches and averaged nearly 13 inches.  Historical Walleye stocking on South Silver shows that fingerlings, yearlings, and adults work best to maintain a fishable population.  While our management goal was not met (catch rate of 2.5 per gill net was not attained), we are committed to stocking Walleye in South Silver and any surplus production may be stocked in South Silver to help boost the population. While South Silver is not necessarily considered a top destination in the area for Walleye, we do manage it so that anglers have the opportunity at times for Walleye.  Northern Pike should also be considered as a top predator to help thin out natural reproduction of Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, and Bigmouth Buffalo.  One Northern Pike, 28 inches, was sampled. Northern Pike have historically occurred at low abundances in South Silver Lake.  Occasional stocking of advanced fingerling fish now produced at Warren Lake near Windom may help add an important predator to the lake.    <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch relative abundance has fluctuated widely since sampling began in 1957.  Recently, since 2010, catch rates have fluctuated from 22.25 per net in 2010 to 59.0 per net in 2016 and back down to 4.0 per net in 2022.  The current gill net catch rate is the lowest since 2006 (2.25 per net) and the second lowest on record.  It appears the decline was due to an aging adult population that is now absent from the lake with most fish currently under 7 inches.  Only 1 Yellow Perch was larger than 8 inches (8.3 inches), most ranged from 5 to 7.5 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.  A fishable population of Yellow Perch is present, although smaller sized.  If needed, Yellow Perch will be stocked, but at this time it does not appear that is necessary as brood sized fish are present.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are the bright spot among all species in South Silver Lake. The trap net catch rate was 16.9 per trap net, the greatest catch rate ever observed in South Silver Lake.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 5.5 to 8.5 inches in the gill nets and 5.5 to 10.5 inches in the trap nets with an average of 8 inches.  Health of the Black Crappie in the sample was good with many plump fish.  Black Crappie angling could be very good with strong year classes approaching 9 to 10 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nAngling may be tough for Walleye and Yellow Perch over the next several years in South Silver Lake.  They will be present in the lake, but relative abundance was lower than desired during sampling in 2022 and may be difficult to target.  Stocking will continue in hopes to boost Walleye abundance and subsequent angling catch rates.  With that stated, Black Crappie relative abundance has never been greater.  Black Crappie are high on the preference list among Minnesota anglers and should provide an excellent angling and harvest opportunity over the next several years in South Silver.     <br> \n</p>",

THE 1985 SURVEY CATCH RATE OF 3.60 FISH PER GILL NET WAS ALSO BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  THE ONLY WAE COLLECTED FOR AGING PURPOSES WAS A ONE YEAR OLD FISH.  LITTLEK, IF ANY, NATURAL REPRODUCTION BY WAES OCCURS IN SOUTH SILVER LAKE, STOCKING DOES NOT APPEAR TO CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE FISHERY.  THE YEP GILL NET CATCH OF 50.60 WAS NEARLY THREE TIMES GREATER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN. YEP GROWTH WAS SLOW COMPARED TO OTHER LOCAL YEP POPULATIONS.  THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO GREAT DEAL OF INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION FOR RESOURCES AS WELL AS A REDUCTION IN PREDATION.  YEP DENSITIES HAVE EVIDENTLY DECREASED ONLY SLIGHTLY FROM 1985. THE BLG TRAP NET CATCH OF 6.75 FISH PER NET IS ABOUT THREE TIMES GREATER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN. GROWTH IS NEAR AVERAGE FOR BLGS IN WINDOM ARE LAKES.  NOP, CAP, BLB AND BLC CATCH RATES WERE ALL BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS.  FRD ARE VERY COMMON IN SOUTH SILVER LAKE, AND TRAP NET CATCHES OF DRUM BOTH EXCEEDED LOCAL MEDIANS.  SMALL NUMBERS OF WHB ARE PRESENT IN SOUTH SILVER LAKE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Silver Lake is a 245 acre lake of which 142 acres is 15 feet or less in depth.  The lake has a maximum depth of 22 feet and a average depth of 14 feet.  South Silver is presently managed for largemouth bass and walleye as the primary species while bluegill, channel catfish, yellow perch, and northern pike are managed secondarily.The walleye catch rates from our 1998 population assessment were low to average for lakes similar to South Silver.  Lengths of walleye sampled during the assessment ranged from 12 to just over 28 inches and averaged 19.5 inches.  The average weight of walleye sampled in South Silver was just over three pounds.  In order to reach our goal of five walleye per net we are going to increase are stocking frequency from once every three years to two out of every three years.Largemouth bass numbers are low in South Silver according to our electrofishing data.  Lengths of largemouth bass sampled by electrofishing ranged from 14 to 17 inches with an average length of 15 inches.  The average weight of largemouth bass during our sampling was two pounds.The bluegill population is also down in South Silver.  Lengths of bluegill ranged from 7.5 to 9.0 inches with and average length of 8.0 inches.  The average weight of bluegill sampled in trap nets was 0.4 pounds.  It appears that much of the vegetation observed during the 1994 survey had disappeared in 1998.  Vegetation is vital for good bluegill and largemouth bass populations.The black crappie population was low compared to lakes similar to South Silver.  Lengths of black crappie ranged from six to 12 inches and averaged a little over eight inches.The yellow perch population is high compared to lakes similar to South Silver.  There were good numbers of yellow perch observed from four consecutive years (1994 - 1997).  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from five to 10 inches and averaged just over seven inches.Only two northern pike were caught during our 1998 population assessment, however they were large pike.  One northern pike was 29 inches and weighed 5.5 pounds while the other northern pike was 35 inches and weighed over 10 pounds.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of South Silver Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Silver is a 245-acre lake located seven miles south of the city of Fairmont in Martin County. The lake has almost four miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 22 feet making South Silver one of the deepest lakes in the Windom management area. Dawson campground is located on the northwest side of the lake with over 100 campsites providing tenting and seasonal trailer camping. South Silver is managed primarily for walleye and stocked periodically with both fry and fingerling walleye. Secondary management species include bluegill, yellow perch, northern pike, and largemouth bass. A population assessment was conducted on South Silver during the week of 08/14/06. Four gill nets and nine trap nets were used to assess the fish population. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population is low when compared to lakes similar to South Silver. Lengths of walleyes sampled in our gill nets ranged from 12.5 to 27.6 inches and averaged 17.8 inches. Most of the walleye sampled were four years old, which corresponds to a DNR fry stocking in 2002. These walleye average 20 inches and weigh nearly three pounds. What South Silver may be lacking in quantity is made up with quality. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population is similar to other lakes like South Silver. Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5.5 to 8.5 inches and averaged 7 inches. Three year classes of yellow perch were identified from the survey sample. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish populations are typical to below average when compared to lakes similar to South Silver. Lengths of bluegill ranged from 3.8 to 8.1 inches and averaged 5.5 inches. Crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 5.7 to 9.3 inches and averaged 8.3. Multiple year classes were revealed through age analysis. This indicates habitat does exist for natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate was low, but the potential trophy fish may await the patient angler. Lengths of the two northern pike captured were 36.6 and 37.7 inches and each weighed over 14 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass have been found in South Silver since 1985 and offer a unique fish for anglers to pursue; South Silver is the only lake in the Windom Area where white bass have been sampled. The source of white bass introduction to South Silver is unknown and we remind anglers that transporting and stocking live fish by the public is illegal. The introduction of new or exotic fish species can have detrimental affects on established native fish populations. Always dispose of unused bait where it cannot reach a lake or river. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the assessment include bigmouth buffalo, largemouth bass, common carp, black bullhead, channel catfish and freshwater drum. <br> \n <br> \nMany of our shallow lakes in the prairie pothole region are impaired because of poor land use practices. Water quality and clarity can be improved by implementing Best Management Practices. An example of this would be planting and restoring native grasses and forbs along shorelines and waterways to buffer the effects of erosion and nutrient loading.

                "narrative": "<p>An assessment of lakeshore habitat on South Silver Lake was conducted on 7/7/2017.  The assessment consisted of 31 survey sites evenly spaced about 2 football field lengths including end zones apart around the lake.  The average lake wide habitat score was 72.2(+/- 4.1), indicating overall lakeshore habitat quality was moderate (66-84).  Sites with moderate habitat quality have a high percentage of unaltered habitat but at least one zone has lower habitat quality than a high scoring site.  Undeveloped sites may score moderate if they naturally lack a habitat component.  Developed sites that retain a high percentage of natural habitat areas may score in this range.  Approximately 70 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 62.7(+/- 4.3), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 95.2(+/- 1.7).  This habitat survey was designed to provide a means to quantify and compare lakeshore habitat between lakes.  The South Silver Lake shoreline habitat score is lower than the statewide lake score average of 73.6.</p>",

The seine hauls captured seven species of fish, including Bigmouth Buffalo (N=1), Black Crappie (N=18), Bluegill (N=25), Spotfin Shiner (N=3), Yellow Perch (N=9), Johnny Darter (N=2), and Freshwater Drum (N=1). Electrofishing captured nine species of fish, including Johnny Darter (N=12), Black Crappie (N=17), Bluegill (N=41), Common Carp (N=3), Green Sunfish (N=13), Hybrid Sunfish (N=1), Largemouth Bass (N=5), Yellow Bullhead (N=3), and Yellow Perch (N=3). Reproduction exists for many of the species in South Silver Lake as, as young-of-the-year (YOY) Black Crappie, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, and Freshwater Drum were sampled.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of South Silver Lake.  The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community.   <br> \n</p>",
