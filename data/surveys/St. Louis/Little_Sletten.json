                "narrative": "<p>Little Sletten Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 10, which consists of 76 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Little Sletten Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it is smaller than most.      Little Sletten Lake stratifies thermally in midsummer and has poor oxygen (less than 2 ppm) oxygen below 19 ft, where the temperature is 42 F.  The lake bottom along the shoreline is boulder, ledgerock, gravel, and rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 6 ft.  There are no inlets.  The outlet has a steep and rocky watercourse that limits upstream fish movement.    Only white sucker and one 9\" largemouth bass (age three) were caught in 1997.  The total catch of fish (all species) in 1997 of 2.6 fish/gillnet (5.1 lb/gillnet) was lower than normal for this lake class.  Previous total catches of fish were similarly low.  White sucker, three cisco, two 6\" largemouth bass, and one 11\" perch were caught in the 1965 survey.  White sucker, one 9\" largemouth bass, and two 6\" bluegill were caught in gillnets in 1982.  Lake Class 10 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of fish numbers and biomass in gillnet catches.</p>",
