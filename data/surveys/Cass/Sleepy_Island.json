                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike was the only principal predator in the lake.  They were captured at a rate of 5.5/gillnet lift, which was comparable to the median value for lake class 20.  These fish ranged in length from 13.0-31.9 inches, with no distinct modal length group.  The mean length northern pike was 22.6 inches long and weighted 3.5 pounds.  PSD and RSD-P values were 75 and 13 respectively.  Growth was good for all ages, with an age V fish growing to 23.3 inches.  Spawning habitat for northern pike would be considered excellent during normal water level periods.  If the water levels were at least a foot higher, northern pike would have access to three small marshes totaling approximatley 4 1/2 acres in size.White sucker (1.0), bluegill (6.0) and yellow perch (17.0) were the only other species caught in the gillnets.  Yellow perch CPUE (17.0) was comparable to the third quartile value for lake class 20.The most notable species caught in the trapnets was the bluegill.  This species was caught at a CPUE of 139.6 fish/lift and was more than 3 times the third quartile value for lake class 20.  These fish ranged in length from 3.0-9.4 inches, with a modal length group of 5.0-5.4 inches.  PSD and RSD(7) values were 24 and 8 respectively.  In spite of the high population of bluegill, growth was excellent, where an age V fish was 32% larger and age V fish from other area lakes in lake class 20.\t\t\tA1\tA2\tA3\tA4\tA5Sleepy Island\t\t1.55\t2.83\t4.06\t5.18\t6.09Area LC 20 lakes\t1.48\t2.26\t3.06\t3.86\t4.61% of difference\t\t4\t20\t33\t34\t32The only other species caught in the trapnets were northern pike (0.7) and yellow perch (20.2).</p>",
