At the present time fishing pressure on this lake is very light and natural reproduction of Smallmouth Bass seems adequate.</p>",

Test nets in 1996 found walleye abundance about average compared to similar lakes in this Lake Class (12). Walleye ranged in size from 13.1 inches to 21.3 inches, with fish in the range of 14 - 15 inches the most common.     Smallmouth bass abundance is average for this Lake Class (12), however fish are on the small side. Smallmouth bass sampled in the 1996 survey ranged from 7.5 to 14 inches, however 80% of the fish sampled were in the range of 7.5 - 10.5 inches. Smallmouth bass over 14 inches have rarely been sampled in test nets in Dunnigan Lake.     Test net results in 1996 are consistent with previous surveys indicating bluegill abundance is about average at best. Bluegill historically are small in this lake and this was the case in 1996 when the average size was only 5.4 inches, with no fish over 6 inches sampled.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish collected in DNR test nets in 1999 were: walleye, smallmouth bass, bluegill and rock bass.     Walleye numbers are about average compared to similar lakes of this type.  They ranged from 12.0 inches to 24.4 inches (4.5 pounds) and averaged just under 2 pounds which is above average for this type of lake.  The average size of walleye collected in this survey was a little larger than in most of the previous surveys.  The walleye population is maintained through natural reproduction, and like other small lakes, can be inconsistent.     The smallmouth bass population is above average for lakes of this type with more smallmouth bass caught in the 1999 survey than in any other survey.  They ranged from 5 inches to 15.7 inches (1.8 pounds) but most (97%) were smaller than 12 inches.  This size range is typical of smallmouth bass collected in previous surveys.     Bluegills are present but their numbers are low  which is normal for this lake.  Only one bluegill was collected in the survey and it was small, measuring 4.2 inches.  Bluegills over 7 inches are rarely seen in Dunnigan Lake.</p>",

The gillnet catch in 1987 was lower than historical catches, primarily because of weak year classes in 1984-85. The 1990 increase can be attributed to strong year classes of Age II and III Walleyes which comprised 96% of the catch. Recent fluctuations of Walleye densities are probably the result of sporadic natural reproduction, and the no stocking policy. The 1990 gillnet and trapnet catches of Smallmouth Bass was higher than any previous netting. The Bluegill population appears stable, as the trapnet catch was consistant with previous catches.</p>",

It is located in the south central portion of the Kawishiwi River Watershed.Most of the shoal water bottom is strewn with boulders, rubble, and gravel. About 30% of the shoal bottom consists of muck.Aquatic vegetation was scattered along the entire shoreline at the time of the survey. Needlerush and waterlilies were the most abundant plant species.A secchi disk reading of 10.5 feet indicated that the lake was quite clear. Temperature and dissolved oxygen testing indicated that the lake was unstratified, and that the dissolved oxygen content was high enough to fish support fish life throughout the lake.Walleye and Smallmouth Bass made up the bulk of the test net catch. White Sucker, Bluegill, and Rock Bass were taken in lower numbers.Shoal water seining indicated that Bluegill spawning success was good in 1961. Spawning conditions for Walleye and Smallmouth Bass appeared to be fair to good. The length-frequency distribution of these species from the test nets indicates that some natural reproduction had occurred in past years.Local residents reported that Walleye fishing had been good and Smallmouth Bass fishing had been fair in recent years.Walleye stomach analysis during the survey showed that about half of the stomachs examined contained young-of-the-year Bluegills. This may suggest that there is a lack of minnows for gamefish forage in the lake.Fish and water samples collected in October 1961, were tested by the Minnesota Department of Health, Division of Environmental Sanitation. The tests indicated the water had a total hardness of 6 pp.m, and alkalinity of 6 p.p.m., sulfate at 12 p.p.m., and calcium as CaCO3 at 2.5 p.p.m. Walleye flesh tested had 100 (+-3) micromicro curies of strontium 90 per gram of calcium.</p>",

There is limited space for maneuvering and parking for several vehicles is at the top of the hill. A single campsite located at the access.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are a popular species targeted by anglers and are stocked regularly in Dunnigan Lake. The survey results indicate abundance of Walleye is currently lower than previous surveys, but the size structure and growth are good. The average length for all Walleye was 17.7 inches and over 40% of the catch was longer than 19 inches. Stocked years accounted for majority, but not all, of the Walleye captured. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net and trap net catches for Smallmouth Bass were well above the normal range of the lake. Size was small with only 22% of the catch longer than 12 inches and only 4 Smallmouth Bass longer than 15 inches. Growth is average compared to other Finland Lakes and the population is maintained through natural reproduction with ten year classes present in the sample.  <br> \n <br> \nA single Bluegill measuring 3.9 inches was sampled from a gill net in 2021. Many small Bluegill were observed in the lake near the access, but were too small to be sampled with the standard fisheries assessment gear used during the survey. Bluegill have been sampled in low numbers during previous surveys of the lake, but the population has never had the size structure to be of interest to anglers.</p>",

There is a U.S. Forest Service maintained steep gravel back-in access suitable for small boats. Dunnigan Lake is a very soft water (low fertility) lake.  The secchi disk reading was 12.0 feet in the very clear water.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in below average numbers in 2011, compared to other northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics, although the average weight (1.90 pounds) exceeded the average for this lake class (1.21 pounds).  Walleyes exhibited above average growth compared to other lakes in the Finland Area.  The mean length of all walleye sampled was 17.6 inches; the largest was 20.3 inches (2.2 pounds). Dunnigan Lake is stocked with 1/lb per littoral acre of walleye fingerlings on 2 consecutive years out of every four years rotation. Walleye natural reproduction also contributes to the population in Dunnigan Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass net catches were above average for the lake class.  The mean length for all smallmouth bass was 8.11 inches; the largest measured 14.2 inches (1.2 pounds), which is similar to sizes sampled in previous assessments. The growth rate for smallmouth bass was average compared to other Finland Area Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish were sampled a rate that was below average for the lake class. The largest bluegill measured 5.6 inches and averaged 4.5 inches. Natural reproduction appears to be inconsistent with only two year classes of bluegill sampled. The number and length of bluegills were similar to past assessments in Dunnigan Lake. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass are also present in Dunnigan Lake in above average numbers for the lake class. The largest rock bass sampled measured was 8.2 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dunnigan Lake is located 12 miles west and six miles north of Isabella in the Superior National Forest.  The lake is 81 acres with a maximum depth of 14 feet.  On August 3, 2015 the lake had a water-clarity reading of 8.5 feet in very light green stained water.  The shoreline is in 100% public ownership (US Forest Service and a very small portion of State) and in a wild state with predominantly red, white and jack pine and occasional aspen and birch.  Bottom substrate is mostly rubble, boulder, muck, and decaying organic matter, with small occasional areas of gravel and sand.  Aquatic vegetation is sparse on the lake with white water lily being the most common species.  Fish species present are Walleye, Smallmouth Bass, Bluegill, and Rock Bass.  White Suckers and Iowa Darters have been sampled occasionally in the past but always in very low numbers.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked two consecutive years followed by two un-stocked years, a stocking regime that is used to better understand the contribution from natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is located just east of Hwy 1 a half mile south of the New Tomahawk road near the Slate Lake/Stony River crossing.  A \"Dunnigan Lake\" sign is present along Hwy 1 at the start of the 600 foot road that leads to USFS maintained gravel back in access.  The ramp to the lake is steep and there is little room to turn a trailer around.  The access is best suited to light carry in boats or canoes.  Boats on a trailer need to be light enough to disconnect and moved by hand to the water's edge, then reconnected to a vehicle.  A person choosing this method needs to be very mindful of the steepness of the ramp.  There is sufficient parking for two vehicles at the top of the hill. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate in 2015 was average compared similar lakes in the Finland area.  However, the average weight for sampled Walleyes was above average.  Stocking appears to be an important contributor to the population as 75% of the catch was from years that were stocked.  However, natural reproduction does occur as seven year classes were present in the catch from age-1 to age-7 with one additional very large fish (29 inches and 8.5 pounds) whose age was estimated at 13 years.  The 2012 year class, a stocked year was by far the strongest year class and represented about half of the catch.  Growth is faster than average compared to other Finland Area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass gill net catch was average in numbers but below average in weight compared to similar lakes in the area.  Population is maintained through natural reproduction and six year classes were present between age-1 and age-6 along with two fish over 16 inches long aged at 10 and 12 years.  The 2012 year class was the strongest year class representing a third of the total catch.  Growth is faster than average compared to other Finland Area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low and average size was small.  Based on a small sample, growth appears to be slower than average compared to other Finland Area lakes.  Rock Bass are present in average numbers and size for lakes in the Finland Area.  <br> \n</p>",

The trapnet catch was the highest in the last seven years, however no young of the year Smallmouth Bass were caught in 1/4\" mesh trapnets. Bluegill density continues to be low with the trapnet catch about 1/5 the historical average. Bluegill reproduction apparently was very good in 1987. The young of the year catch was highest on record. Walleye gillnet catch was 1/3 the historical average. There is natural reproduction of Walleye, but it is thought to be limited. The declining numbers of Walleye is likely the result of the no stocking policy.</p>",

The purpose of the survey was to determine if these two spring sampling techniques could be used to produce an accurate population estimate for either species. Night electrofishing was completed on May 17 and trap netting occurred the week of May 23, 2022.  <br> \n <br> \nBoth gears were effective at sampling a portion of the Smallmouth Bass population. Interestingly, a majority of the catch from electrofishing were bass greater than 10 inches long while most bass captured in trap nets were less than 10 inches long. A population estimate calculated from the data collected found the current Smallmouth Bass population has a density of about 4 fish longer than 10 inches per acre.  <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing occurred too long after ice-out to capture spawning adult Walleye, but spring trap netting captured some adult fish. Sample size was too low to generate a population estimate. Size structure from spring trap netting was similar to standard summer sampling gear and supports the belief that the lake currently has a low density Walleye population supported by regular fingerling stocking.  </p>",
