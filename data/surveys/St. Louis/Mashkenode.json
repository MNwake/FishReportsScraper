                "narrative": "<p>This special assessment was conducted to determine the effect of an apparent winterkill on Mashkenode Lake that was discovered about April 28, 2007 and reported on April 30.  In that report, accompanied by photos, a riparian landowner traveled around the perimeter of the lake and saw thousands of dead fish, including large northern pike, bass, bluegill, crappie, sucker and bullhead.  On May 1 wind was blowing into the landing.  A Fisheries employee walked 200 yards in each direction from the landing on Mashkenode Lake and saw no dead fish.  No birds were observed on the Lake.  A second conversation with the landowner who reported the fish kill indicated most of the dead fish were in the bay by the outlet. <br> \n <br> \nA fish kill was also reported by the local conservation officer in the spring of 1976 but could not be confirmed by Fisheries staff on March 31 after an undetermined period of time had lapsed since the report.  Winter oxygen checks have been conducted on Mashkenode Lake in mid-February or mid March during seven years from 1957 through 1988.  Low oxygen was found during two of these years, on 03/06/1984 (maximum of 1.5 ppm) and 03/12/1986 (no oxygen was detected). <br> \n <br> \nThree previous fisheries investigations have been done on Mashkenode Lake, on 07/09/1984, 07/12/1989, and on 06/18/2001.  Each of these investigations sampled fish using 2-3 gillnets and 4-8 standard trapnets.  The special assessment on 10/02/2007 sampled fish with 2 gillnets, 2 standard trapnets, and 2 small mesh (1/4\" bar) trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nResults of the 2007 assessment show changes in fish populations consistent with winterkill, although the late date of the 2007 assessment (in early October) may have been responsible for some of the observed changes (catches of most fish species are highest in the spring, then gradually decline over the summer).  In general, the assessment showed that populations of fish species tolerant of low oxygen conditions (bullheads and fathead minnows) increased in 2007, while populations of fish species less tolerant of low oxygen conditions (northern pike, yellow perch, bluegill sunfish) decreased. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers in 2007 (85/gillnet, 91/standard trapnet) were about three times higher than in previous investigations (average of 28/gillnet, 25/trapnet).  In addition, the small mesh trapnets captured extremely high numbers of young-of-year black bullhead (8,100/net) and fathead minnows (18,900/net). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2007 (1.0/gillnet) were much lower than the average catch of 8.1/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2007 (3.5/gillnet) were much lower than the average catch of 55.3/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish numbers in 2007 (1.0/trapnet) were much lower than the average catch of 28.2/trapnet in previous investigations on this lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie and white sucker populations did not appear to change between 2007 and previous investigations. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike, yellow perch, and bluegill sunfish all have high reproductive potential and should be able to recover on their own, although the extremely high numbers of bullhead and fathead minnows that are currently present may slow this process by preying on the young gamefish and competing with them for food.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mashkenode Lake is located three miles southwest of the city of Virginia with its access via a concrete ramp off County Road 7. The lake covers 128 acres, has a maximum depth of 14 feet, and has brown-colored water. The lake's major inlet and outlet is the East Two River. <br> \n <br> \nOn June 13, 2022 water temperatures ranged from 68 F at the surface to 59 F at the bottom.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 10.0 feet.  Shoreline substrates are made up of mostly sand, silt, and clay.  Aquatic vegetation growth can be quite substantial at times.   <br> \n <br> \nMashkenode was first stocked with walleye fry in 2013, and the lake has been annually stocked (except for 2020) ever since. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2022 the overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 45.0 fish/net, which was the second lowest on record for the lake.  Fish species sampled in gillnets were northern pike, white sucker, black crappie, yellow perch, walleye, and black bullhead.  The overall trapnet catch rate for all fish combined was 13.4 fish/net, which was the lowest catch on record for the lake. Some fish species that were sampled in trap nets and not in gill nets were bluegill, pumpkinseed, golden shiner, and brown bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population has shown promise over the two most recent surveys (2022 and 2017) since the introduction of walleye fry.  The 2017 catch rate was 4.3 fish/net and the 2022 survey sampled 6.0 fish/net.  The current gillnet catch rate is very good compared to other similar lakes in the state and the highest on record for Mashekenode Lake.  Lengths ranged from 8 to 21 inches, with an average of nearly 17 inches.  Growth rates were quite good with the average walleye reaching nearly 16 inches at 4 years old.  Ages ranged from 1 to 7 with all fish coming from stocked year classes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 9.8 fish/net which was better than most other similar lakes in the state and the highest on record for the lake.  Sizes ranged from 13 to 37 inches with an average of nearly 23 inches.  The largest fish in the sample was the new record for the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThirty black crappie were sampled in trap nets for a catch rate of 3.3 fish/net.  This was right at the average when compared to past surveys on the lake and better than average when compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 5 to 12 inches with an average of 8 inches.  Thirty-six additional fish were sampled in the gill nets.  Their lengths were similar to the trap netted fish. <br> \n <br> \nNine bluegill were sampled in trap nets for a catch rate of 1.0 fish/net.  This was tied for the lowest catch rated on record for the lake and low when compared to other similar lakes.  Sizes ranged from 4.5 to just over 9 inches with an average of nearly 7 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nThe yellow perch gillnet catch rate (7.3 fish/gill net) was the second lowest on record for the lake and below average compared to other similar lakes.  Sizes ranged from 5 to 7 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nOne rusty crayfish was captured in a trap net.  This was the first documentation of rusty crayfish in Mashkenode. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mashkenode Lake is in Ecological Lake 19, which consists of 66 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and shallow.  Mashkenode Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it has harder (more mineralized) water.Mashkenode Lake was thermally stratified on 06/18/2001 with a surface temperature of 67 F and a bottom temperature of 58 F, and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 11 ft, where the temperature was 64 F.  The inlet from Silver and Mud lakes has a beaver dam.  The outlet to the St. Louis River has a dam 25 ft wide with a 5 ft head.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are 34% clay, 25% sand, 24% muck, 11% rubble, and 6% gravel.  Aquatic plants are thick around the entire shoreline and grow to a depth of 8 ft; Canada waterweed, waterlilies, and flatstem pondweed were the most common rooted aquatic plants, but blue-green algae (microcystis) has been very thick at times.  Nutrients may enter this lake from eastern Mountain Iron.Fish sampling during the 06/18/2001 fish population assessment consisted of three standard gillnet sets and eight trapnet sets.  Two previous investigations (07/09/1984 and 07/12/1989)  used two gillnet sets and four trapnet sets.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2001 of 188 fish/net (81 lb/net) was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was higher than the total catches of 106 fish/net (61 lb/net) in 1984 and 91 fish/net (62 lb/net) in 1989.  Lake Class 19 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 2001 of 141 fish/net (29 lb/net) was higher than the catches of 62 fish/net (35 lb/net) in 1984 and 58 fish/net (26 lb/net) in 1989.  It is not known if the higher catch of fish in the gillnets and trapnets in 2001 is because the netting was done three weeks earlier than in earlier investigations.Fish populations in 2001 were dominated by black bullhead, yellow perch, northern pike, and bluegill, followed by white sucker, golden shiner, and black crappie.  Other species were present in low numbers.Black bullhead numbers in 2001 (46/gillnet, 49/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than in previous investigations on this lake.  Black bullhead sizes in both types of net in 2001 averaged 7.6\" (0.2 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class.  The largest black bullhead was 10.5\".Yellow perch numbers in 2001 (76/gillnet, 21/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than in previous investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in both types of net in 2001 averaged 6.4\" (0.1 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class.  The largest perch was 11.1\".  Perch scales were very difficult to read, but perch growth appeared to be somewhat slower than normal by area standards.Northern pike numbers in 2001 (8.7/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were similar to catches in previous investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2001 averaged 27.6\" (5.5 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  The largest pike was 36.4\".  Pike scales were very difficult to read, but pike growth appeared to be faster than normal by area standards.Bluegill numbers in 2001 (45/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than catches in previous investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2001 averaged 6.2\" (0.2 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class.  The largest bluegill was 8.3\".  Bluegill growth appeared to be somewhat faster than normal by area standards.White sucker numbers in 2001 (10/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were lower than in previous investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2001 averaged 12.5\" (0.9 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class.Golden shiner numbers in 2001 (32/gillnet, 12/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than in 1989.  Golden shiner were not captured in the 1984 investigation.  Golden shiner sizes in 2001 averaged 6.1\"; the largest was 8.6\".Black crappie numbers in 2001 (10.3/gillnet, 2.0/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile and at the median, respectively, for each type of net.  Crappie sizes in both types of net in 2001 averaged 7.9\" (0.3 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class.  The largest crappie was 13.4\".  Crappie growth was faster than normal by area standards.Many of the fish examined in 2001 were infected with neascus.  Neascus (black spot) is a common parasite that is native to the area.  It cannot infect humans, is often removed by filleting, and is killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

This shallow lake is highly productive with large amounts of aquatic vegetation present and algae blooms are common. Mashkenode has a history of periodic winterkills which can affect the current fish populations and associated species diversity. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a concrete ramp located near the SW shore for public access. The gravel access road is located off the W side of CR 7 south of Mt. Iron. The parking area is limited in space to 6 trucks/trailers or less. <br> \n <br> \nTen species of fish were sampled in 2017 using 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets. Black bullheads were the most common species sampled by far. Record numbers of white sucker and yellow perch were also recorded in 2017. Several other species of game fish are present in generally low numbers with walleye being represented in the catch from a successful fry stocking in 2105. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead were sampled in the gill nets (51%) and trap nets (86%). Bullhead average lengths were in the 6 inch range with the largest sampled around 12 inches. The 2017 bullhead catch was a record for both gear types used for sampling. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2017 (4.3/gill net) were above average compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average walleye sampled was 11.2 inches and the largest walleye was 15.4 inches long. Walleye fry were stocked in 2014, 2015 and 2016. All walleye aged in the 2017 sample came from the 2015 stocking. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2017 (2.2/gill net) were below the historic average for Mashkenode Lake (5.0/gill net) and below average (5.0/gill net) compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average pike sampled was 27.1 inches and the largest pike measured 33.5 inches long. Pike average weight (5.1 lbs.) was heavier than the average weight (1.8 lbs.) of pike from other similar area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of black crappie, bluegill and largemouth bass were also recorded in 2017. The average crappie sampled was 7.3 inches up to 8.5 inches. The average bluegill measured 6.5 inches up to 8.6 inches. Largemouth bass sampled in 2017 were on the small side with 5 fish measured under 12 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
