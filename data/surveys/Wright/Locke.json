Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with four sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations, a 15-foor seine was used at one station, and conditions prevented the use of seines at one sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including one species considered intolerant of habitat disturbance (Smallmouth Bass) and two tolerant species (Common Carp and Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in June 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of lake. The FIBI score for Locke Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and indicates a fish community stressed by human disturbance. Data from this survey will be included as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Mississippi River - Saint Cloud watershed. <br> \n</p>",

The watershed is large (32,365 acres) and the primary land uses are cultivated crops (43%), forest (16%), and hay/pasture (11%). A downstream barrier on Silver Creek isolates Locke Lake from the Mississippi River. A public access is located on the northeast side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye is a primary managed species in Locke Lake and have been sustained through fry stocking since 1999. Since 2009, fry have been stocked at a rate of 2,000 per littoral acre, augmented by surplus fry from the hatchery or fry stocked by the lake association. Fall night electrofishing catch rates have varied from zero to 103 young of the year (YOY) per hour (on time). In 2023, 30 YOY Walleye were sampled along with 6 Walleye age-1 or older. <br> \n <br> \nFall electrofishing results in 2023 (36.0/hr) were higher than 2021 (10.3/hr) and indicate successful fry stocking and survival (>25/hr). The catch rate of larger walleye in 2023 was 7.2/hr with lengths ranging from 15.6 to 21.8 inches with an average length of 17.9 inches. The gill net catch during the most recent survey in 2021 (2.5/gill net) was similar to the previous survey in 2016 (2.7/gill net). Based on gillnetting and electrofishing results, fry stocking at the current level should be continued. Fingerlings can also be stocked on a contingency basis when fry survival is poor (<25/hr) and fingerlings are available.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Locke Lake is a 156-acre general development lake located one mile southeast of Hasty in northern Wright County. There is a public access located on the northeast side of the lake. The water quality of Locke Lake is generally poor with a 10 year mean secchi reading of 3.3 feet; and adequate dissolved oxygen for fish life was observed to a depth of 12 feet during the third week of June, 2016. The watershed is large and agriculture comprises the majority of the watershed. A downstream barrier on Silver Creek isolates Locke Lake from the Mississippi River. A standard lake survey was conducted in 2016 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2008. In addition to the standard lake survey, an index of biotic integrity (IBI) survey was conducted in August. <br> \n <br> \nLocke Lake has a long history of Walleye stocking and rough fish removal. Current  Walleye management consists of fry stocking every other year which began in 1998. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch for Walleye in 2016 was higher than observed in 2008 and 1998 and is within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Walleye ranged in length from 8 to 27 inches with an average length of 16 inches. Four year classes were represented and 94% of the Walleye sampled were three years old or younger. Fry stocking appears to be successful as fall fingerling catches have ranged from 5-103 fingerlings/hour. However, gill net catches remained low. While the fry stocking hasn't been as successful as we have hoped, the 2016 gill net catch was the second highest on record only behind the 1992 survey (5.0/gill net). Still, stocking the lake with Walleye fry remains a less expensive option with results similar to stocking fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch for Northern Pike in 2016 was the highest ever reported for Locke Lake and is above the expected range for similar lakes. Pike ranged from 17 to 34 inches with an average length of 23 inches and 32% were longer than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike (under 22 inches) and release the larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and promote good growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also increase the survival of young Walleye and allow Yellow Perch numbers to increase. Higher perch populations are desirable as they are an important prey species for both Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and Smallmouth Bass were sampled by day-time electrofishing on May 19, 2008. Locke Lake is one of the few lakes in the area where anglers have a good chance at catching a Smallmouth Bass. Largemouth Bass were sampled at a higher rate than previous surveys and fish up to 22 inches were caught. Smallmouth Bass were sampled at a similar rate compared to previous surveys and fish up to 21 inches were caught. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect reasonable fishing for Black Crappie and Bluegill. The trap net catch of both Black Crappie and Bluegill were within the range of expected values for similar lakes with crappies up to 9.5 inches and Bluegill up to 9 inches being captured in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2016 survey included: Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

The Northern Pike catch (1.4/gill net) was below the range of expected values for lakes similar to Locke, as it has been in all previous surveys.  Average weight (2.1 pounds) was within expected values.  Fish from five year classes (age 0 through 4) were caught, with lengths up to 25.9 inches.  Growth was average compared with other Minnesota lakes.  The Walleye catch (5.0/gill net) was significantly higher than during any previous survey, and for the first time was within expected values.  Walleye average weight (0.9 pounds) was below the expected range for similar lakes because of young fish (age 2 through 4).  Walleye lengths ranged from 11.5 to 19.9 inches and growth was average.  Walleye fingerlings or yearlings have been stocked every year in the last ten years, with the exception of 1984 and 1985.  Yellow Perch numbers (1.8/gill net) were within expected values, while average weight (0.33 lb.) was above the expected range.  Yellow Perch from 7.5 to 9.9 inches long were caught, and 12 young-of-year were sampled with a shoreline seine on 8/31/92.  Yellow Perch numbers have been consistent over time.  \n\nPrincipal species sampled with trap nets were Black Crappie, White Crappie, and Bluegill.  Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, and Green Sunfish were also taken. The Black Crappie catch (19.5/trap net) was above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Locke, and has been historically.  Average weight (0.4 pounds) was also above the expected range.  Black Crappie from 3.5 to 11.9 inches in length were captured; average length was 7.5 inches.  White Crappie (1.3/trap net) were sampled at levels within the range of expected values and had an average weight (0.3 pounds) that was also within expected values.  Average length was 8.0 inches.  Bluegill (20.0/trap net) were caught in expected numbers and the 1992 catch was consistent with previous assessments.  Bluegill from 5.0 to 8.9 inches in length were caught; average length was 6.0 to 6.4 inches. Average weight (0.25 lb.) was above the expected range.  \n\nOver four hundred young-of-year Bluegill were caught in the seine.  Four juvenile and four young-of-year Smallmouth Bass were sampled with gill nets and with the shoreline seine.  Growth was average for a Minnesota lake. No adult or juvenile Largemouth Bass were caught, but one young-of-year was taken with the seine.  Other fish caught with the shoreline seine included: Brook Silversides, Johnny Darter, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Hybrid Sunfish.\n</p>",

Since 2009, fry have been stocked at a rate of 2,000 per littoral acre, augmented by surplus fry from the hatchery or fry stocked by the lake association. Fall night electrofishing catch rates have varied from zero to 103 young of the year (YOY) per hour (on time). In 2021, 12 YOY Walleye were sampled along with 21 Walleye age-1 or older.  <br> \n <br> \nBased on fall electrofishing results from around the Sauk Rapids Management Area, 2021 was a poor year for fry survival as a majority of lakes with either stocked or naturally reproduced Walleye populations had YOY catch rates that were below long term averages. This was also true in Locke Lake, as electrofishing results in 2021 (10.3/hour) were the lowest since 2011. The catch rate of larger Walleye in 2021 was 18.1/hour with Walleye ranging in length from 10.5 to 23.4 inches and an average length of 17.0 inches. The gill net catch during the most recent lake survey in 2021 (2.5/gill net) was similar to 2016 (2.7/gill net). Based on gillnetting and electrofishing results, fry stocking at the current level should be continued. However, fingerlings can be stocked on a contingency basis when fry survival is poor (<25/hour) and fingerlings are available. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Locke Lake is a 156-acre general development lake located 1 mile southeast of Hasty in northern Wright County. The lake has a maximum depth of 49 feet and generally has poor water clarity. The watershed is large with primary land use being cultivated crops, forest, and hay/pasture. The lake has a long history of rough fish removal and there is a downstream barrier on Silver Creek that attempts to isolate Locke Lake from the Mississippi River. A public access is located on the northeast side of the lake. A targeted survey using only gill nets was conducted in 2021 to update fisheries data last collected in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nLocke Lake has a long history of Walleye stocking with current management consisting of fry stocking during even numbered years which started in 1998. Fry stocking appears to be successful as seen in fall electrofishing surveys; however, gill net catches remain lower than desired. Overall, Walleye numbers are about average for the lake. Walleye sampled ranged in length from 13 to 26 inches with an average length of 19 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers have an opportunity to catch quality-sized Northern Pike in Locke Lake; however, they are still encouraged to harvest small pike (<22 inches) and release the medium-sized pike (>26 inches) to help produce a larger size structure. Northern Pike sampled ranged in length from 17 to 32 inches with a mean length of 24 inches. Thirty-five percent of the pike sampled were longer than 26 inches while 10% were longer than 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect reasonable fishing for panfish although some sorting may be warranted. Black Crappie ranged in length from 7 to 11 inches with an average length of 8 inches while Bluegill ranged in length from 5 to 7 inches and averaged 6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Smallmouth Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Fish harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS) can all adversely affect fish populations. Eurasian watermilfoil (2011) and zebra mussels (2021) have been identified in Locke Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Sauk Rapids Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Locke Lake is a 156 acre general development lake located one mile southeast of Hasty in northern Wright County.  The lake is at the lower end of a 25,000 acre agricultural watershed. A downstream barrier on Silver Creek isolates Locke Lake from the Mississippi River.  Water quality is poor.  In mid-June dissolved oxygen is adequate for fish life only to 17 feet.  Aquatic plants were sparse.  The exotic, curly leaf pondweed, was found growing at or near the surface on one quarter of an acre of the lake at the time of peak abundance.    <br> \n <br> \nLocke Lake has a long history of fish stocking and removal.  Recent management has consisted of alternate year walleye fry stocking which began in 1998.  This was the first full fisheries survey since 1998.   <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for northern pike, walleye and yellow perch were all below the expected range.   <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch for northern pike, 1.5/gill net, decreased significantly from 1998.  Northern pike ranged from 17 to 33 inches and averaged 26 inches and five pounds.  Northern pike growth was within statewide averages, but only eight fish were examined.    <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch for walleye, 1.0/lift was about the same as 1998.   Eleven walleye were also sampled by electrofishing.  Walleye from both sampling gears ranged from seven to 25 inches and averaged 16 inches.  Fingerlings have been collected after fry stockings at rates of 5-87 fingerlings/hour.  However, gill net catches remained low, so it appears that fry stocking has not been as successful as hoped.  Based on gill net catch data, stocking Locke Lake with walleye fry remains a less expensive option with results similar to stocking fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nBass were sampled by electrofishing at night on May 14, 2008.  Locke Lake is one of the few lakes in the area where anglers have a better chance to catch a smallmouth rather than largemouth.  Smallmouth were more prevalent because of the lakes\u0019 former connection to the Mississippi River.  Smallmouth bass up to 19 inches were captured in this survey.  Fish averaged 15 inches and two pounds.  Smallmouth grew to 12 inches between ages four and five. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect reasonable fishing for bluegill and black crappie.  The trap net catch for bluegill was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Bluegill up to 8.5 inches were captured in this survey.  Growth of bluegill was above average as fish reached six inches in three years. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch for black crappie was similar to 1998 and within the expected range for lake class 24.  Crappie averaged seven inches but some nine inchers were noted. Growth of black crappie was within statewide averages as fish reached seven inches by age three. <br> \n <br> \nNongame fish collected in 2008 were white sucker, bigmouth buffalo, hybrid and green sunfish, carp, and brook silverside.  Black bullhead were numerous.  Catch rates were much higher than 1998 and up to four times higher than the expected values. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike abundance dropped to 0.2/gill net from 2.7 in 1980 and is well below the range of expected values for lakes similar to Locke. The three fish caught were age 5 and had average growth. Some young-of-year Northern Pike were sampled by shoreline seine. Green Sunfish numbers were at the low end of the expected range, where they have been since 1975. Pumpkinseed were previously not sampled and are below the range of expected values for similar lakes. Bluegill abundance seems to be increasing since 1975. The present catch was 21.7/trap net, similar to 1980 and near the local average. Lengths ranged from 5.0-8.5 inches with a 7 inch average. Ages 2-5 and 8 were present. The 1981 and 1982 year classes contributed 86% of the sample. Also, young-of-year Bluegill were common in shoreline seine hauls, a change from previous surveys. \n\nSmallmouth Bass have been caught in shoreline seines in each netting since 1975. In 1986, they first appeared in gill nets, in low abundance compared to the state average of 0.5/gill net. Largemouth Bass, however, continue to show up only in shoreline seining, in spite of a 1980 stocking of 65 yearlings. White Crappie abundance is near its local average and similar to previous results. Ages 1-3 and 5 were caught and 50% were age 2. Average length was 7 inches and growth was average. Black Crappie have increased their abundance since 1980 and are well above the range of expected values. Ages 1-5 were present, strongly dominated by age 3 fish. Average length was 8 inches and growth was good. Walleye abundance continues to be low in spite of periodic fingerling stocking. Two of five Walleye aged were from years of stocking. Growth is average to below average after age 1. Yellow Perch abundance was similar to 1980 and below the local average. Yellow Perch were most abundant in shoreline seine hauls, with some young-of-year perch present. Other forage species present included Spottail Shiner and Logperch. \n\nRough fish species appear to be undergoing some population shifts in response to the 1978 installation of a drop spillway on the outlet, which has isolated the lake from the Mississippi River. Bigmouth Buffalo, Silver Redhorse, and Shorthead Redhorse were caught in 1980 but not in 1986. The Black Bullhead catch was again above the range of expected values, although lower than in previous surveys. Average length remains about 7 inches. Yellow Bullhead numbers remain below the expected range. Common Carp remain at the upper end of the expected range. White Sucker abundance is similar to 1980 and is above the local average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Relative abundance estimates of fish from 1998 gill net sets consisted of three target species: yellow perch (9.80/lift), northern pike (5.80/lift) and walleye (1.20/lift); and two non-targetspecies: black bullhead (22.60/lift) and black crappie (2.40/lift).  Northern pike abundance wasbetween mid and upper-range expected values, and yellow perch and walleye abundance werebetween low and mid-range expected values for lakes similar to Locke Lake. The gill net catch rate for yellow perch has significantly  increased from 1.80/lift in 1992, to9.80/lift in 1998.  Weight per set decreased from 3.00 lbs./lift in 1992 to 1.37 lbs./lift in 1998, andmean weight per fish decreased from 0.33 lbs. to 0.14 lbs., respectively.  Yellow perch reached6.99 inches by Age III and 7.56 inches by Age IV, which was within the statewide averagegrowth.The gill net catch rate for northern pike increased significantly from 1.40/lift in 1992 to 5.80/lift in1998.  Length range has changed from 13.0 to 25.9 inches in 1992 to 13.0 to 36.0 inches in 1998;however, mean length decreased from 22.4 to 20.5 inches, respectively.  Northern pike growthwas slightly above average for Age II and III individuals, and average for Age IV fish.   The gill net catch rate for walleye significantly decreased from 5.00/lift in 1992 to 1.20/lift in1998, and mean weight per fish decreased from 0.86 lbs. to 0.76 lbs., respectively.  Walleyefingerlings were stocked in 1992, 1994, 1996 and 1998, however,  the 1998 gill net survey onlyappeared to show survival from the 1994 year class. The gill net catch rate for black bullhead remained similar from 28.60/lift in 1992 to 22.60/lift in1998.  Weight increased from 10.38 lbs./lift in 1992 to 12.78 lbs./lift in 1998, and mean weightper fish has increased from 0.36 lbs. to 0.57 lbs.Relative abundance estimates of fish from trap nets in 1998 consisted of three major species:bluegill (83.50/set), black crappie (11.17/set), and yellow perch (4.50/set).  Bluegill and yellowperch abundance estimates were above upper-range expected values for lakes similar to LockeLake, while black crappie abundance was between low and mid-range expected values.  The trap net catch rate for bluegill has increased from 20.00/set in 1992 to 83.50/set in 1998;however, mean weight per fish decreased from 0.29 lbs. to 0.14 lbs.  Growth for Age I, II and IIIfish was above the statewide average with 3.17, 4.84, and 6.18 inches, respectively.The trap net catch rate for black crappie has appeared to decrease from 19.5/set in 1992 to11.17/set in 1998; however, both years abundance estimates were within expected levels forsimilar lakes.  Mean weight per fish declined from 0.36 lbs. in 1992 to 0.25 lbs. in 1998.  Growthwas slightly above the statewide average in 1998, as fish reached 4.39, 6.71, 7.79, and 9.11 inchesby Age I, II, III, and IV, respectively.Largemouth bass and smallmouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing during Spring.  Atotal of 4 largemouth bass and 18 smallmouth bass were sampled with a catch rate of 2.83/hourand 12.71/hour on-time, respectively.  Length of largemouth bass sampled ranged from 9.0 to10.0 inches, with a mean weight of 0.49 lbs.  Smallmouth bass length ranged from 7.5 to 18.0inches, with a mean length of 12.1 inches.  The mean weight for smallmouth bass sampled was1.17 lbs. Growth for smallmouth bass sampled in 1998 was average for Minnesota lakes as fishreached 7.87, 9.56, and 13.05, by Age II, III, and IV, respectively, and slightly below average forAge V fish.  Of the catchable smallmouth bass (larger than 7 inches), the proportion larger than11 inches was 61%, and those larger than 14 inches was 33%.   </p>",
