The 1994 survey revealed that 70% of the bluegills sampled were from the spring stocking. Therefore the bluegill population is largely a result of DNR stocking each year. Their population is considered of average abundance as is the size of the fish themselves. Nearly 60% of the fish sampled were larger than seven inches.Other species found were black bullheads, bowfin, carp, green sunfish, white sucker, and yellow perch. Carp were the most abundant species in the lake, but were of extremely small size. The average length was just 3.2 inches. All of the other species caught were sampled in low numbers with the exception of white suckers which were of average abundance.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Webber Lake is completely located within Webber Park in the city of Minneapolis.  Webber Lake was managed as a children's fishing pond beginning in1976, and in 2001 the DNR's new Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) Program began to oversee the management.  A third of a mile of shoreline provides shorefishing access for anglers.  In 2005, six fishing blocks will be added to the shoreline as fishing structures.  FiN will continue to stock Webber Lake with adult bluegill and work with park staff to promote and introduce the public to fishing and environmental stewardship.  In 2004, the Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Department planted native prairie plants and reduced shoreline erosion as part of a shoreline restoration project.Bluegills are stocked in the spring of each year, and park managers report moderate fishing pressure throughout the spring.  When Webber Lake was surveyed in August, bluegill abundance in trap nets was above average for the lake type, but fish averaged only 3.9 inches in length.  Two black crappies were sampled, averaging 11.0 inches.  Other fish species sampled included black and brown bullheads, common carp, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish.  All of the aforementioned were sampled in small numbers with the exception of carp, which were sampled at above average abundance.  In addition, five painted turtles and three snapping turtles were sampled during the survey.  Dissolved oxygen readings taken over several winters suggest that the lake experiences a partial or complete winterkill during most years.  Fish may enter or leave Webber Lake through an intermittent connection to Shingle Creek.Webber Park has many amenities in addition to Webber Lake.  The park is a great place to spend a day fishing for sunfish and picnicking.  More information about Webber Park can be found at: Minneapolis Park & Recreation Board (www.minneapolisparks.com).For more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at: Fishing in the Neighborhood: Minnesota DNR (www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Webber Pond is a 2-acre class 40 lake located within Webber Park in the city of Minneapolis.  Webber Pond has been managed as a Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) pond since 2001.  This lake is stocked annually with bluegill sunfish and adult channel catfish.  The last survey conducted on Webber Pond was in 2004. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the primary species captured during this survey.  Abundance was relatively high.  Bluegills ranged in size from 6.2 to 8.1 inches in length and averaged 7.1 inches. <br> \nOne channel catfish was captured during this survey.  It weighed 2.7 pounds and was 20.4 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included yellow perch, black bullhead, hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish.  Twenty-seven painted turtles were sampled during this survey. <br> \n <br> \nFishing blocks were added along the shoreline to improve access for anglers.  Also in 2004, native prairie plants were added to the shoreline to improve water quality and habitat for fish and wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at:  www.mndnr.gov/fishing/fin. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
