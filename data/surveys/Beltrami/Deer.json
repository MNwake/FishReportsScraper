A targeted survey was completed on Deer Lake by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during June of 2021 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 10 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community. Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted where possible. A total of seven sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites. A total of 15 species of fish were sampled, which included five species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from standard survey completed in 2021 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Deer Lake. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Tullibee (cisco), Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nResults of this survey indicate Deer Lake is in exceptional health with a FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute towards the assessment of the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed with biological information about the health of the fish community. <br> \n</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 16 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 18.8 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 16.2?C (61.2?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is located about 15 miles northwest of Bemidji off Minnesota Highway 89.  The public access is adequate for most smaller fishing boats.  Deer Lake is in lake class 31 which is a group of about 140 lakes with primary distribution in northern Minnesota.  Bemidji area lakes included in this class are Little Wolf, Black, Julia, Whitefish, and Upper LaSalle.  These lakes are typically rounded in shape with hard water.     Primary management is for walleye, but Deer Lake offers a variety of fish species for the angler.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked during alternate years and most walleye present are a result of this effort.  There is relatively low residential development on the lake with much of the shoreline not suitable for development.     Walleye have steadily increased in abundance since 1969 and are now at a higher level than most other lakes in this class.  At the time of this assessment most walleye were between 11-13 inches and 18-22 inches.  Even though a quality fishery is present some anglers still find it difficult to catch walleye.  This may be due to the quantity and variety of forage species available.    Northern pike abundance is near that of most comparable lakes and higher than during most prior surveys on Deer lake.  An average weight of 2.9 pounds is comparable with other lakes of this type.  Most pike are 18-22 inches in length with the largest sampled at 36 inches.  Thirty percent of the northern pike had some neascus, a common parasite of fish that is not harmful to humans.    Black crappie abundance is better than that of most lakes in this class and the highest recorded for Deer Lake.  Most crappies were about 8 inches long, but there is a strong 1996 year class, with fish about 4 inches long.  These fish should become acceptable to anglers in two to three years.  The largest crappie was 12 inches long.      Bluegill abundance is average for the lake class and is also comparable with most previous surveys.  Most bluegill are 6.5-8.5 inches long with the largest at 9 inches.  Poor natural reproduction in 1992 and 1993 affects the average weight since most fish sampled are six to eight years old.  With future successful reproduction, smaller fish will be expected and average size may decline.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish are present but less abundant than bluegill.  Average size tends to be smaller.  Rock bass are abundant.    Largemouth bass do not sample well in nets, and only three bass about 14 inches long were captured.  This low catch rate is probably not representative of actual population size.  Expansive unaltered bulrush stands present in Deer Lake offer good cover for largemouth bass and ensure their continued successful natural reproduction.    Yellow perch have increased from previous surveys, but at about 5.5-8.5 inches and 0.1 pound they are not sought by most anglers.  However, they do provide an excellent forage base to support good populations of walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.    Tullibee are common, and though they are not often caught by anglers, they are also an important food source for the larger predator fish.  Deer Lake is open to fall gill netting for whitefish/tullibee, but the extent of netting activity is unknown.     A few brown bullheads and dogfish (bowfin) were captured in trap nets, but they are not common.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is a 262-acre lake located 15 miles northwest of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County.  There is a moderate amount of development (lake homes and cabins) on the east shoreline of the lake, with much of the remaining shoreline consisting of bog and wetland fringe.  There is a public access located off of MN State HWY 89 on the southeast shore with a concrete log boat ramp and parking for approximately six trucks/trailers.  Deer Lake has a maximum depth of 42 feet, and is located near the headwaters of the Turtle River chain of lakes.  The MN DNR uses a lake classification system that groups lakes based on physical and biological characteristics.  Deer Lake is in class 31 with other area lakes such as Black, Julia, and Little Wolf.  These lakes typically have moderate depth, regularly shaped shorelines and hard water.  The fish community of Deer Lakes consists of northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, panfish (including black crappie), yellow perch, bullhead species, sucker species, and tullibee cisco.   <br> \nDeer Lake is managed with special regulations for northern pike (implemented in 2003) and largemouth bass (implemented in 2006).   The northern pike regulation consists of a 24 to 36-inch protected slot limit, while largemouth bass are protected by a no-kill regulation (all fish immediately released).  Both regulations were implemented to increase the average size of fish and improve the size structure of the populations.  Statewide regulations apply to all other species in Deer Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 catch rate for northern pike was 8.2/gill net, which is relativley high abundance for this lake class.  The 2011 population assessment showed an improvement in the average size of northern pike as well as the proportion of larger fish in the population.  The proportion of pike greater than 24 inches in length increased from 28% (2001) to 39% in 2011, and the proportion of pike greater than 30 inches in length increased from 2% (2001) to 10% in 2011.  Average size of northern pike increased from 2.5 to 3lbs/fish during this time frame as well.  Tullibee (cisco), which are an important forage species for large predators such as northern pike, were abundant in the 2011 assessment, which is a good sign for the continued improvement of the pike population in Deer Lake.  Deer Lake has quality northern pike habitat in the form of an extensive bulrush fringe, submerged vegetation and sharp shoreline drop offs. <br> \n <br> \nDeer Lake is a popular largemouth bass lake with a small contingent of local anglers.  An electrofishing survey conducted in 2011 showed good numbers of bass (28 fish/hour), consistent reproduction, and a good average size (14.5 inches in length) with fish up to 18.5 inches present in the sample.  Extensive weedlines provide excellent bass habitat in Deer Lake.  Although known for quality bass fishing, Deer Lake receives only light to moderate fishing pressure for bass, and bass anglers often have the lake to themselves. <br> \n <br> \nDeer Lake has a history of providing quality panfish angling.  The 2011 population assessment showed improvement in bluegill numbers, size structure of the population, and average size since the last assessment (2001).  The catch rate of 40/TN approaches the third quartile value for lake class (47/TN).  A large proportion of the bluegill captured (19%) were between 7.0 and 8.0 inches in length.  These fish will grow into the size range preferred by anglers (>8 inches in length) and provide good angling opportunity within the next few years.  Bluegill can be found in stands of emergent vegetation (bulrush) in early summer as they spawn when water temperatures reach 68 to 70 degrees.  During the remainder of the summer, bluegill can be found along the edges of weedbeds, particularly in the \"cabbage\" (various species of pondweed).  Black crappie numbers, on the other hand, have declined considerably from 2001 (10.5/gill net) and were documented near historic low numbers in 2011 (< 1/gill net).  Black crappie populations in northern Minnesota fluctuate considerably due to inconsistent natural reproduction and angler harvest.  Anglers are effective at reducing crappie populations, as the fish are very susceptible to harvest in the spring, fall, and winter.  Modern technologies such as cell phones and the internet can spread information on the \"hot bite\" in real-time.  Anglers targeting black crappie may want to give Deer Lake a pass until the population has rebounded from these low levels and pursue the species on one of the many other area lakes that contain good populations of black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were captured at 1.7/gill net, which is rather low for this lake class and compared to some previous assessments.  Walleye abundance in Deer Lake has been as high as 6.5/GN (1997).  The 2011 population assessment showed poor recruitment from recent walleye stockings, which were manipulated as part of a statewide research project on the effectivenesss of various walleye stocking methods.  Recently, however, the management plan for Deer Lake was revised to include a return to annual walleye fingerling stocking, which produced more consistent survival and recruitment of stocked walleye in the past.  Walleye sampled in 2011 had a mean length of 17.4 inches, with fish up to 22.5 inches present in the sample.  Walleye anglers will find classic structure in the form of shoreline points, inside turns and drop offs, but should not overlook the abundant weedlines which can hold walleye throughout the summer and early fall.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is a 298-acre, moderately developed lake located in southwestern Beltrami County, approximately 20 miles northwest of Bemidji, MN. Deer has an average water clarity of 9 feet and a maximum depth of 42 feet. Deer has an inlet located on the western shore from Lake Erick and an outlet located on the north shore, connecting to the Turtle River. A public access from highway 89 is located on the southeastern shore of the lake and has room for 5 to 7 vehicles. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed on Deer Lake in 2021 to assess the fish community. Gamefish species targeted by anglers in this lake include Bluegill, Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance increased slightly from 2016 (a historic low) and was within the normal range for this lake type. Bluegill lengths averaged 5 inches, with a few Bluegill over 8 inches captured. Bluegill growth was slow with fish averaging 4 inches at 4 years old. Nine year classes of Bluegill were sampled and ranged from 3 to 11 years old. In addition to the special regulation (daily limit of 5 sunfish), it is recommended that anglers keep smaller sunfish and release the larger fish to help improve the population's size structure. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye lengths ranged from 10 to 26 inches and averaged around 14 inches. Walleye abundance increased from 2016, was similar to the lake's historical average, and within the typical range for lakes with similar morphological characteristics. Walleye fingerlings are stocked on an alternate year rotation to account for inconsistent natural reproduction. A total of 5 year classes were captured, all originating from stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was similar to recent surveys, near average for the lake, and within the typical range for similar lakes in Minnesota. Northern Pike ranged from 15 to 35 inches and averaged 24 inches. Fifty-eight percent of the Northern Pike captured in gill nets were larger than 22 inches. Northern Pike ages ranged from 1 to 9 years old. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie lengths ranged from 6 to 12 inches and averaged 9 inches. Growth rates were normal with Black Crappie averaging 7 inches at 4 years old. The majority of the Black Crappie sample was 5 years old, indicating a prominent year class that is approaching sizes preferred by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nIn early June, Largemouth Bass were targeted by night electrofishing. Largemouth Bass abundance decreased from the 2016 survey and was below the lake's average. Total lengths ranged from 9 to 19 inches and averaged 15 inches, the highest average size recorded in the lake's history. A special regulation with a protected slot length of 14 to 20 inch remains in effect for bass. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was low and sizes were generally too small to interest anglers with lengths ranging from 5 to 9 inches. Yellow Perch are considered an important forage species for large predators like Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. Other species sampled during the survey included Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been found in Deer Lake. AIS can be transferred by anglers and boats from infested to non-infested waterbodies. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. Please follow the current AIS regulations to avoid spreading to other lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is a 262-acre lake with a maximum depth of 42 feet.  The lake is located nine miles north of Wilton in southwestern Beltrami County.  There is a public access in the southeast corner of the lake off of state hwy. 89.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Deer Lake is in lake class 31. Typically lakes in this class are medium sized, regularly shaped and with hard water.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Black, Julia, Sand, Whitefish and Little Wolf Lakes.  The lake is managed for  bluegill, black crappie,  largemouth bass, walleye and northern pike.  Walleye are usually stocked every other year.  Deer Lake was selected for a statewide research evaluation of stocking techniques, which resulted in a walleye fryling (1.5 inches) stocking in 2001. In 2001 walleye abundance was the lowest previously recorded.  Prior to 2001, there had been an upward trend in walleye abundance from 1969 to 1997.  One possible reason for this reduction in walleye abundance is the decline in yellow perch which is the walleye's primary forage food.  Yellow perch abundance in 2001 was also the lowest ever recorded.  Walleye sampled in 2001 ranged in length from 11 to 27 inches.  Northern pike abundance in 2001 was the highest recorded but the mean length and  weight have declined.   Northern pike ranged in length from 14 to 33 inches with a mean length and weight of 22 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Twenty-eight percent of northern pike sampled in 2001 were greater than 24 inches.  No northern pike sampled was older than age five.Bluegill abundance was lower than previous surveys on Deer Lake but was still comparable to other lake class 31 lakes.  There was a reduction in quality from 1997   with declines in average length and weight.  More than 80% of the bluegill sampled were three and four years old.  At four years old, bluegill were 5 inches long, which is  slightly above the state average, indicating good growth.Black crappie abundance was down slightly from 1997 but was comparable to other lake class 31 lakes.  Five different year classes were sampled with the 1997 and 1999 year classes making  up 87% of the sample.  Multiple age classes is a good indicator for this species, indicating consistent successful reproduction.A total of 25 largemouth bass were sampled that ranged in length from 4 to 17 inches.  Eight different year classes (1993 - 2000) were present in the sample indicating consistent natural reproduction. Tullibee (cisco) and white sucker were both sampled in Deer Lake and are utilized as forage by predator fish such as northern pike and walleye.  Some of the tullibee were of a size that would be acceptable to anglers.Pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish and rock bass were also sampled at sizes that would be acceptable to anglers.  The only species of bullhead sampled in the past four assessments was brown bullhead.Riparian development in the form of new lake homes continues to occur on Deer Lake.  Shoreline development can negatively affect water quality and can impact aquatic habitat necessary for fish at various life stages.  Undeveloped shoreline is some of the most sensitive and important shoreline for maintaining water quality and fish habitat.  Shorelines and shallow water areas with their aquatic plants, help protect the lake from erosion and absorb nutrients and pollutants as well as provide excellent places for wildlife and fish to feed, hide and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Deer Lake is also needed to maintain water quality.  Based on the increasing value of lakeshore in this area, there will be a demand to develop the remaining lakeshore on Deer Lake since most of the lakeshore is privately owned.  While future shoreline development may be inevitable, there are ways to minimize disturbances to sensitive aquatic habitats. More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.  The Turtle River Watershed Association is an active group f shoreland owners working to protect habitats and water quality in this watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is a 298 acre waterbody located about 15 miles northwest of Bemidji.  Of those 298 acres, 119 are littoral (less than 15 feet in depth) and the maximum depth is 42 feet.  Deer has one main inlet from Lake Erick and an outlet that immediately feeds into the Turtle River.  There is a public access on the east side adjacent to Minnesota Highway 89 with capacity for 5 vehicles.  About 1/3 of the shoreline is developed and the rest is mostly bog and wetland.  Deer Lake has special regulations for Northern Pike (24 to 36-inch protected slot) and Largemouth Bass (all must be released).  Popular gamefish include Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are surprisingly low in abundance but pursued by anglers, nonetheless.  A total of 8 were captured in the survey with lengths ranging from 11.1 to 20.4 inches and averaging 16.5 inches.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in the fall on odd numbered years at a rate of 1 lb/littoral-acre (~118 lbs total).  Generally, larger fingerlings are selected for Deer Lake to avoid early predation by Northern Pike or Largemouth Bass.  However, the main forage in the lake, Yellow Perch, has declined in recent years leaving predator fish few options in what they eat. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are moderate in abundance in Deer Lake with a potential for larger fish.  A total of 38 pike were captured and measured with lengths ranging from 11.8 to 32.1 inches. The average length of 23.2 inches is consistent with previous surveys, but the proportion of pike over 24 inches increased from 39% (2011) to 51% in 2016.  Both lower abundance and improved size are objectives of the special regulation for Northern pike. Tullibee (Cisco) are also present in Deer Lake and are a very important food source for Northern Pike and especially beneficial in helping pike achieve larger sizes.  There is no shortage of prime pike habitat in Deer including submerged vegetation and near-shore drop-offs. <br> \n <br> \nThe panfish in Deer Lake are also highly prized by local anglers.  Bluegills are abundant with 152 measured in the survey.  Lengths ranged from 3.4 to 9.3 inches and averaged 5.1 inches in trap nets.  Only 8 Black Crappie were captured in the survey but that species is rarely represented accurately because of timing and water temperatures during standard summer surveys.  Lengths ranged from 5.0 to 11.0 inches and averaged 8.3 inches.  Even though only a few were captured and measured, Deer Lake still draws a dedicated following of successful crappie anglers. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are abundant in the lake, and currently protected by the catch and release only regulation.  A targeted night electrofishing assessment captured 82 fish in roughly an hour and twenty minutes.  Lengths ranged from 8 inches to just over 18 inches and averaged 13.5 inches.  The bass population has been very stable over the last 10 years and growth has remained consistently average for this type of lake.  Plenty of bulrush and lily pads provide ample habitat for shallow bass searching for an easy meal. <br> \n</p>",
