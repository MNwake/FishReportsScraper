                "narrative": "<p>Gust is a small, shallow lake with a few cabins on its shore, and limited public access.  It has not been subject to much active fisheries management.  Sometime between 1996 and 2006 Smallmouth Bass found their way (or were introduced) into the lake; by 2006, when they first appeared in a lake survey, their numbers seemed to have been high.  This was the second of two surveys scheduled in the 2007 lake management plan (LMP) to determine what effects Smallmouth Bass have had on the fish community in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were fairly abundant in Gust Lake in 2016, and, while few large fish were present, many were available in the 14 to 20-inch size range.  The 2016 Walleye gill net catch was similar to catches seen in several surveys done prior to the entry of Smallmouth Bass.  The Walleye gill net catch, and the mean weight for Walleye taken in gill nets, were both about average for a lake of this type.  Long range goals for Walleye from the 2007 LMP were met in 2016; the gill net catch exceeded 5.0 fish/net, and some Walleye larger than 20 inches were sampled.  Although trap nets are usually not considered a targeting gear for Walleye, the trap net catch in 2016 was very high for a lake of this type, suggesting Walleye may have been more abundant than the gill net catch might have indicated.     Walleye taken (in all gears) in 2016 ranged in length from 8.9 to 22.2 inches, with most in the 14-20-inch range.  Many year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the 2016 catch, which included fish as old as 16 years.  The 2015 and 2013 year classes appeared to have been relatively strong.  Growth of young Walleye had been about average for the area; three-year-old fish reached an average length of 12.3 inches by the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 12.0 inches.  Growth of older fish had not been as good, but was still close to average for this area.  Seven-year-old fish reached an average  length of 17.6 inches by the end of their seventh year. <br> \n <br> \nGill net and trap net catches are not reliable indicators of Smallmouth Bass abundance.  In 2016 both catches in Gust Lake were above average for this type of lake, while the 2016 gill net catch was the lowest seen in the three surveys done since Smallmouth Bass appeared in the lake.  Smallmouth Bass collected in 2016 (in all gears) ranged in length from 6.3 to 20.0 inches.  Four year classes contributed to the 2016 catch, with none standing out as particularly strong. <br> \n <br> \nSurveys in 2006, 2011, and 2016 provided some weak indications of possible changes in the large-fish fish community in Gust Lake.  Northern Pike gill net catches in all three surveys were low compared to most pre-bass surveys, with just a single fish each taken in 2011 and 2016.  White Sucker gill net catches were also low for this lake historically, and for a lake of this type.  On the other hand, there appeared to have been little change in Walleye and Yellow Perch numbers.   <br> \n <br> \nChanges in the nearshore fish community were harder to identify, since we have little pre-bass data available.  Seining done at three sites in 1960, and sampling in 1996 using 0.25-in-mesh trap nets, collected about the same number of species, and the same species, as nearshore fish sampling done using seines, backpack electofishers, or 0.25-in-mesh trap nets in 2006, 2011, and 2016.   The limited data available suggests there's been no change in diversity of the nearshore fish community since Smallmouth Bass became established, and that no species seem to have been lost. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE APPEARS TO HAVE INCREASED SINCE 1983, BUT THE CHANGE IN CATCH PER NET MAY NOT BE SIGNIFICENT. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHANGES IN YELLOW PERCH AND NORTHERN PIKE ABUN- DANCE IS NOT CLEAR BECAUSE YELLOW PERCH ABUNDANCE APPEARED TO DROP BEFORE ANY INCREASE IN NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE.

All walleye taken in this lake in 2006 had been produced naturally; the lake had not been stocked since 1988.  The northern pike catch was low, and the fish taken were small.  Smallmouth bass were collected by DNR crews for the first time in this lake in 2006, although they had clearly been present for many years.  The catch included many fish larger than 12 inches.  Largemouth bass were also present, but in very low numbers.  The yellow perch catch in 2006 was not high; however, many of the perch taken were over 10 inches in length.\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2011 walleye gill net catch, while lower than catches observed in the previous four assessments of this lake, remained above average for the lake class, and was similar to catches seen in this lake in the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s.  Several year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the catch, with fairly strong year classes produced in 2008 and 2007.  No young-of-year (YOY) walleye were taken in quarter-inch mesh trap nets, suggesting that the 2011 year class may be weak.   Overall walleye growth appeared to have been average; three-year-old fish reached an average length of 12.2 inches by the end of their third year. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch in 2011 tied with the 1996 catch for the lowest seen in this lake.  Northern pike catches have been below average for this lake since 1996. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass remained abundant in 2011, with a gill net catch that exceeded the normal range for the lake class by a wide margin.  Smallmouth bass were first collected in this lake in 2006; however, they had clearly been well established for some time prior to that date.  Several year classes contributed to the 2011 catch, with the strongest apparently produced in 2007.  Growth rates had been fast, with four-year-old fish reaching an average length of 12.3 inches by the end of their fourth year. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough the 2011 yellow perch gill net catch was below the normal range for the lake class, it was similar to catches observed in this lake since 1991.    Many of the yellow perch collected would have been large enough to have contributed to the sport fishery, and they probably provided adequate forage for walleye and northern pike populations. <br> \n <br> \nSampling of the nearshore fish community was done using quarter-in-mesh trap nets, a 15-ft, eighth-in-mesh beach seine, and backpack electrofishing gear.   Prior to sampling done in 2011, Gust Lake was known to support yellow perch, white sucker, walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, blacknose shiner, and darters.  Sampling  in 2011 added northern redbelly dace, Iowa darter, and central mudminnow to that list. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The lake was last stocked in 1988, and all but two of the fish captured in 1996 had been produced since that time.  Northern pike abundance was low, both for lakes of this type, and for this lake historically.  The yellow perch catch was about average for this lake, with a few fish large enough to interest anglers.  Largemouth bass were found in the lake for the first time since they stocked in 1973.</p>",

SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES WERE REPRESENTED, WITH 1988 THE STRONGEST; HOWEVER, THE 1985 AND 1984 YEAR CLASSES WERE WEAK OR MISSING.  WAE GROWTH WAS ABOUT AVERAGE FOR COOK COUNTY.  THERE APPEARED TO BE GOOD NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF WAE, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR FISH COLLECTED FROM THE 1990, 1989, AND 1987 YEAR CLASSES.  ALTHOUGH FRY WERE STOCKED IN 1988, AND A STRONG YEAR CLASS WAS PRODUCED THAT YEAR, FRY STOCKING IN 1986 AND 1984 FAILED TO PRODUCE UNUSUALLY STRONG YEAR CLASSES. THE 1987 ASSESSMENT ALSO FOUND GOOD NATURAL REPRODUCTION, WITH A LIMITED CONTRIBUTION BY FRY STOCKING.  ENOUGH YEP ARE PRESENT TO PROVIDE A LIMITED FORAGE BASE FOR WAE AND NOP.  SOME OF THE YEP COLLECTED IN 1991 WERE LARGE ENOUGH TO BE OF INTEREST TO ANGLERS.  NOP ABUNDANCE WAS LOW, AND THE FISH COLLECTED WERE SMALL.  ONLY ONE FISH OVER 25 IN WAS COLLECTED.</p>",
