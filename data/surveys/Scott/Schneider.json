Growth rate characteristics for all species examined was found to be similar to fish sampled in the main basin of Thole Lake. Black bullhead was the most abundant species sampled with the average size being 7.5 inches long. Bluegill abundance was found to be good with the average size of fish captured being 6.7 inches. Almost one-third of the bluegill captured were 7.0 inches or longer. Pumpkinseed sunfish averaged 6.5 inches long and were found to be normal in abundance. Black crappie averaged 7.9 inches long but were captured in relatively low numbers. One small northern pike was also captured. All sampled fish likely migrated into this basin from Thole Lake after an apparent winterkill during 1992-1993.</p>",
