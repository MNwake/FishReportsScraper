                "narrative": "<p>Dunbar Lake is a class 34 lake located five miles west of Squaw Lake, MN.  The Dunbar River exits the lake and flows into Round Lake.  The lake has one earthen public access that is down a relatively steep hill on the west shore.  The 2002 lake management plan indicates black crappie and bluegill as the primary species of management with northern pike and walleye as secondary species.  The 2011 assessment also included additional sampling of near shore fish species in order to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled with trap nets at a rate of 3.1 fish/net while gill nets sampled them at a rate of 6.3 fish/net.  The catch rates were above average for the respective gears.  The trap net sampled fish ranged from 3.7 to 12.2 inches and averaged 6.1 inches.  The gill net sampled fish were smaller ranging from 4.2 to 5.4 inches.  Four age-classes from 1 to 6 years old were identified from scales.  The 2010 year class dominated the sample and may help to improve fishing in a few years.  Growth was good compared to statewide averages with fish averaging 10.4 inches after five years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nTrap-net catch rates for bluegill have been below the lake class first quartile value of 5.9 fish/net in all assessments.  The trap-net catch of 1.0 fish/net in 2011 was a little below average for this lake.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 5.5 to 9.8 inches and averaged 8.5 inches.  Four age-classes were identified from scales ranging from age 2 to age 6.  Growth rates were excellent compared to other similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net catch rates have ranged from 0.5 to 8.2 fish/net since 1973.  In 2011, northern pike gill-net catch was 3.8 fish/net which was below the lake class median of 5.1 fish/net.  The gill net sampled fish were small, ranging from 16.7 to 22.1 inches with an average length of 19.5 inches.   However, the trap nets sampled three fish from 27 to nearly 32 inches.  Six year-classes were identified from bony structures ranging from age 2 to 10.  Northern pike averaged 17.4 inches by age 4 which was less than the statewide average of 20.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in Dunbar Lake have generally been low and appear to be dependent upon migration from Round Lake.  Walleye catch rates have ranged from 1.7 to 3.0 since the July assessments began in 1978.  In 2011, the catch was 1.7 fish/gill net.  The catch rate was within the normal range for class 34 lakes.  The sampled fish ranged from 8.7 to 18.0 inches and averaged 14.3 inches.  Six age classes from age 1 to 7 were identified from bony structures.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages.  Walleye averaged 13.7 inches after four years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch rates have ranged from 4.6 to 31.0 fish/net since 1973.  In 2011, the catch was 8.0 fish/net and approached the lake class median.  The sampled fish ranged from 4.1 to 10.1 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.

These net catches indicate a high population of black bullheads within the lake.Net catch indices of all other species either fell within or below the appropriate quartile ranges.  Some important comparisons included low (below first quartile) gill net catches of northern pike and walleye, and low trap net catches of bluegills indicating low populations of these species.  The yellow perch net catches were within normal ranges for lake class #29.A tullibee and seven white suckers were sampled which indicated small populations of these species still exist within the lake.  A summerkill of white suckers in 1987 did not appear to be reflected by lower net catches in this survey.A survey dated 7/9-7/20/90 done by the Leech Lake Indian Reservation is in the file.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dunbar Lake is a relatively small, shallow lake in northwestern Itasca County.  This survey was part of a study of the Round Lake watershed, its fishery and water quality.  Walleye stocking was discontinued on both Round and Dunbar Lakes so that the extent of natural reproduction can be determined.     The gill net catch of walleye in this survey was the highest observed since the 1973 assessment, all from natural reproduction.  None of the past 11 years were stocked.  The walleye in this survey ranged in length from 6.3-29.0 inches.  They had a mean weight of 1.3 pounds.  It is evident from this survey that walleye stocking is unnecessary.  It is, however, very important to protect the spawning habitat present on Dunbar Lake and its inlet.  It is also very important to the walleye population of both lakes to maintain an open channel on the Dunbar River.  This was been done in the past years of the study by the USFS.  The walleye run that exists in this stream appears to be substantial and very important to both lakes.     Northern pike were sampled in higher numbers than have been seen in any of the past assessments.  They ranged in length from 15.2-28.0 inches and averaged 1.7 pounds.          Probably the most dramatic change occurring since the last assessment is the decline in black bullheads.  The gill net catch has dropped from 82.0 in 1991 to only 1 (0.2/gill net) sampled in this survey.     Black crappie and bluegill are also found in Dunbar Lake.  Crappies up to 11.3 inches and bluegill up to 9.0 inches were sampled in this survey.  Reports suggest that fishing can be good at times for both species.      *For the past several years an interagency group consisting of the DNR-Fisheries, US Forest Service, Itasca County SWCD and the Leech Lake Indian Reservation has been working on the Round and Dunbar Lake watershed.  Please refer to the 1997 lake management plans of Round and Dunbar Lakes for a complete discussion of the results of that study.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dunbar Lake is a relatively small, shallow lake within the Bigfork River watershed in northwestern Itasca County.  Dunbar Lake has relatively high productivity compared to other lakes in this region, and is subject to mid-summer algae blooms.  Dunbar Lake may also be susceptible to winterkill in severe winters.Historically, walleye abundance in Dunbar Lake has been rather low and appears to be dependent on migration of fish from Round Lake.  The walleye gill net catch showed a decrease in 2001, to 1.0/gill net.  Walleye in the 2001 sample ranged in length 8 to 21 inches and varied in age from 1 to 7.  Walleye have not been stocked in Dunbar Lake since 1985.  The population has been maintained through natural reproduction and/or migration from Round Lake.  Substantial numbers of walleye have been observed to run up the Dunbar River and Dunbar Creek.  The US Forest Service has helped maintain an unobstructed channel in the Dunbar River to facilitate walleye spawning.  It will remain very important for the walleye population in Round and Dunbar Lakes to protect the spawning habitat present in Dunbar Lake and the connecting streams. The northern pike gill net catch in the latest assessment was 8.2/net, and is the highest ever recorded for Dunbar Lake.  These fish ranged in length from 16 to 31 inches and had an average weight of 2.0 pounds.  The yellow perch net catch was within the normal range for a lake like Dunbar.  Yellow perch in Dunbar Lake are small in size, with an average length of 6.4 inches.  Only 4% of yellow perch sampled were longer than 8 inches. As in previous assessments, bluegills and black crappies were captured in relatively low numbers but had a good average size.  Bluegills sampled with trap nets had an average length of 8.2 inches, with 57% of the sample longer than 8 inches.  Black crappies captured in trap nets had an average length of 9.7 inches, with 38% of the sample measuring 10 inches or longer.Black bullheads numbers have declined substantially since 1991, when they were the most abundant fish species in test nets (82.0/gill net).  Only 3 black bullheads have been captured in the two assessments since that time.  The reason for the dramatic shift in bullhead numbers is unclear.  A likely explanation is that Dunbar Lake suffered a partial winterkill sometime in the late 1980's, which hurt gamefish populations but allowed the more tolerant black bullheads to survive and proliferate.  Gamefish populations have since recovered and reduced bullhead numbers to more normal levels. It is important that any unnecessary nutrient inputs to a shallow lake like Dunbar Lake be minimized so as not to increase the likelihood of future winterkills.  Lakeshore owners can help significantly in this regard by following shoreland best management practices, such as: (1) leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, (2) leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, (3) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus-free fertilizers, (4) ensuring compliance of septic systems, and (5) utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.   \t\t\t\t\t\t    </p>",
