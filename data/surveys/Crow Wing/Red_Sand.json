                "narrative": "<p>Red Sand is a 502 acre lake located on the north side of the City of Baxter and is part of a long-range study (SLICE) to monitor lake changes in a variety of lake types statewide.  As a result, an intensive four-year program of monitoring fish populations, aquatic vegetation, water chemistry and plankton took place and was completed in 2011.  Future monitoring schedules are yet to be determined.  Red Sand is shallow with most of the lake less than 15 ft deep.  These physical characteristics contribute to low oxygen levels in winters that have significant snowfall.  The last winterkill was the winter of 2007-2008.  Net catches and electrofishing in 2008 indicated that all species that were present before that winter survived in low to moderate numbers.  Walleyes were not sampled in 2008, but were sampled in spring netting in 2009.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing for largemouth bass resulted in a catch rate of 7.6/hr run-time (only 6 fish).  This was down from the 2010 catch of 17/hr run-time.  Three year classes were represented and all were before the last winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nThe most abundant fish in the early June trap nets was black crappies (5.6/net) followed by northern pike (4.2/net).  All other species were below 2.5/trap net.  Mean length of the crappies was 8.6\" and 64% were 8\" or larger.  Five year classes were represented, with 36% coming from the 2008 year class following the winterkill.  Another 46% were from the 2005 year class which survived the winterkill.  Mean length of the northern pike was 20.3\" and 13% were 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nVarious species were also captured during backpack electrofishing and seining for IBI.  The most abundant of these was yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

As a result, an intensive four-year program of monitoring fish populations, aquatic vegetation, water chemistry and plankton took place and was completed in 2011.  Future monitoring schedules are yet to be determined.  Red Sand is shallow with most of the lake less than 15 ft deep.  These physical characteristics contribute to low oxygen levels in winters that have significant snowfall.  The last winterkill was the winter of 2007-2008.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 573 northern pike were captured during ice-out trap netting in 2011 (23.9/trap net).  Past ice-out netting catches ranged from 1.5/trap net (2009) to 9.5/trap net (2010).  Mean length of northern pike in 2011 was 18.7\" and only 7% of the fish were 24\" or larger compared to a mean length of 17.5\" in 2010. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The southern tip of Red Sand Lake lies within the city limits of Baxter, MN.  Red Sand has been known to at least partially winterkill on regular basis, the last time being during the winter of 2013-2014.  This is often followed by a year or two of poor fishing, while the fish that remain tend to grow at an increased rate.  Within 3 to 4 years (if the lake hasn't winterkilled again), there are usually a fair amount of fish that are of catchable size.  That is where Red Sand is currently at now.  Unfortunately, another side effect of winterkill is that the hardier species tend to do much better; in this case that is black bullheads and they have taken over in high numbers (110.6/trap net).  All sizes were found, ranging from 4.2\" to 11.8\".   <br> \n <br> \nThree species that have rebounded are northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Northern pike were caught in average numbers for this type of lake (5.0/gill net), with an average length of 21.3\".  Not many large fish existed, with only 10% measuring 24\" or larger and only two fish over 26\".  Bluegill numbers were also average at 4.3/trap net.  Size was decent, with an average length of 7.4\".  Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing on the night of June 5th, 2017, resulting in a catch rate of 40.6/hr.  Mean length was 11.3\" and 45% were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough walleye fry are stocked occasionally, no walleye were captured in the 2017 netting.  Seven walleyes were observed and netted during bass electrofishing, with lengths ranging from 15.7\"-18.7\".  Though they are present in the lake, no black crappie were sampled, suggesting that the previous winterkill took more of a toll on them than other species. <br> \n</p>",

Average populations were indicated for pumpkinseed and bluegills.  Northern pike, black bullhead and brown bullhead indicated high populations since catch rates were above the third quartile. Red Sand Lake is an occasional winterkill lake and there was at least a partial kill during the winter of 1985-86. The lake is being managed for the boom or bust type fishing as it is being stocked with walleye fry after a winterkill. It was reported to have excellent walleye fishing during the summer of 1985. This survey showed the typical freeze-out lake population of numerous northern pike and bullheads. Northern pike aged (29 of 30) showed age classes 2, 3, and 5 with 79% (23 of 29) in the 2 year age class. All age groups showed fast growth rates when compared to statewide figures. The range in length was from 15 inches to 29.9 inches, with 25 of 30 fish between 15 and 20.9 inches. There was only 1 walleye and 1 perch taken in the nets, both 3-year old fish. Not a big enough sample to determine anything.  Bluegills ranged in size from 2.5 inches to 8.9 inches, with half of the fish that were measured between 3.0 and 3.9 inches. Age groups 3-8 were all represented with the 3 year class making up 45%, and the 6 year class 30% of the fish that were aged. All year classes exhibited slow growth rates when compared with statewide averages. Black, yellow and brown bullheads ranged between 5 to 13 inches with the majority between 5-8 inches.  Pumpkinseeds ranged from 3-6.9 inches with even distribution in the sizes.</p>",
