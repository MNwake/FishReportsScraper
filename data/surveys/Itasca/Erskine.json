                "narrative": "<p>Erskine Lake is a small 40-acre water body, located in northeastern Itasca County that has 40% of its surface area over water that is less than 15 feet deep and has a maximum depth of 56 feet. The lake has good water clarity as indicated by a 16 ft Secchi disk reading and low fertility. (Total Phosphorous = 0.010 ppm or 10 ppb). The morphology and suitable environmental conditions where good oxygen levels are present in a coldwater layer during the midsummer makes this lake an ideal \"designated trout lake\". <br> \n <br> \nTemperature and dissolved oxygen levels were measured during the most critical period in mid August (8/21/2008) when suitable levels for stream trout are at the most confining layer.   The lake had developed a thermocline during the summer months where a layer of water temperatures between 18 and 29 feet dropped rapidly from the low 70\u0018s to the mid-forties.  Water temperatures above the thermocline were about 74 degrees F that stream trout can tolerate for short periods while feeding.  After feeding they are able to rest in water layers with more suitable water temperatures that contained sufficient dissolved oxygen. Dissolved oxygen levels actually increased from 7.8 ppm above the thermocline to 12.5 ppm in the colder water within the thermocline and starting decreasing at the bottom of the thermocline and became insufficient (<5.0ppm) below 28 feet of water.  <br> \n <br> \nRainbow trout have been stocked on a biennial schedule since proposed in the 2000 management plan.  Since then rainbow trout have been stocked in the spring of 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007.  Although rainbow trout were most recently stocked in May of 2007, 17 months previously, none were captured, indicating that each stocking is likely harvested the first year. The long-range goal for rainbow trout to provide a fishery that yields a catch rate of at least 0.2 fish/trap net was not achieved during this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nFingerling splake also have been stocked biennially according to the 2000 lake management plan in the fall of 2002, 2004, and 2006.  Splake from the 2006 stocking, two years survival in the lake, dominated the catch as 67 of the 69 splake caught in trap nets were 13 to 18 inches in length.  The two larger splake that were between 22 and 23 inches in length and weighted approximately 4.5 lbs were determined to be survivors from the 2004 stocking,four years previously.  The long  term goal for splake of maintaining a catch rate of 1.0 fish/trap net where 25% are greater than 16 inches in length was achieved for this assessment.  The CPUE for trap nets was 3.5 fish/trap net and a total of 81 splake were captured from both gear types and 20 fish or 25% exceeded 16 inches in length. <br> \n  <br> \nConditions within the lake seem to support good growth for splake.  Splake from the net catches averaged about 15.0-16.0 inches and had attained a mean weight of 1.25 lbs. Although no statewide average are available for evaluating splake growth the splake from this assessment that were actually two and one/half year old fish (one-half year in the hatchery and two years in the lake) had exceeded the statewide average lengths for three- year-old rainbow trout, 12.8 inches, and three- year-old lake trout, 12.4 inches,  by approximately 20% to 25%.    <br> \n <br> \nTwo minnow traps were also set to check availability of prey species.  Species captured in order of their abundance included northern redbelly dace (45.0 /set), fathead minnow  (7.5 /set), finescale dace (6.0 /set)), and brook stickleback (4.0 /set).  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

All brook trout were captured in trap nets with a CPUE of 0.3.  Only 5 rainbow trout were sampled with 4 (80%) captured in trap nets and 1 (20%) in the gill net.  The trap net CPUE for rainbow trout is 0.1 and gill net CPUE is 1.0.  The CPUE could not be compared to the statewide or lake class median CPUE for stream trout because the designation does not exist.  Other fish species sampled included finescale dace, golden shiner, fathead minnow, and central mudminnow.Splake total length (TL) ranged from 8.2-14.3 inches with 79% (52) between 11.0-12.9 inches TL.  All splake sampled were stocked as fingerlings in the fall of 1991.  Scale analysis determined all splake sampled were age I.  No splake were found from the introductory stocking in 1989.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Erskine Lake is a small designated stream trout lake, primarily managed for Rainbow Trout and Splake.  The 2009 management plan goals were to provide a Rainbow Trout catch of at least 0.2/trap net and a Splake catch of at least 1.0/trap net with 25% of the fish larger than 16 inches.  To help attain these goals, 2,000 Arlee strain yearling Rainbows were spring stocked in odd years since 2001 and 2,000 fingerling Splake were fall stocked in even years since 2002.  The 2018 survey was one of three conducted to assess the alternate stocking strategy since the stocking plan changed.  Net locations and effort were similar to the previous survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe Splake trap net catch was comparable to catches from surveys since 2003, surpassing management goals.  The majority of Splake caught were within a relatively narrow range of lengths, 11.8 to 15.7 inches, similar to previous surveys.  These fish were age 2 and from the fall 2016 stocking.  One fish was 21.1 inches, age 4 and from the 2014 stocking.  Length frequency was below the management goal.  The gill net catch was similar to previous surveys, as well as length frequency.  The stocking rotation appears to give Splake an advantage.  Being stocked as fall fingerlings, they are essentially the same size as yearling Rainbows that are stocked the following spring.  They had the benefit of acclimation for approximately seven months during the winter prior to spring stocking.  These fish are then better suited in the spring with an added advantage of approximately 17 months of a prior fallow period with no stocking.  This extended period likely allows invertebrates to repopulate to a greater level, improving prey availability. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout catches have typically been low.  Trap nets captured three trout, with lengths from 14.2 to 15.5 inches.  These fish were age 2 but originating from the 2017 spring stocking.  Rainbow Trout should make up a higher proportion of the stream trout catch.  It is likely angler harvest is resulting in the lower than expected catches.  Arlee strain tends to be fast growing and aggressive but not long lived.  Their aggressive behavior is attractive to anglers, which ultimately limits how long these fish persist.  Erskine Lake is popular a fishery and angler harvest is assumed to be high at times. <br> \n <br> \nGolden Shiner were the most numerous species captured in trap nets.  The catch was within the range of past surveys.  Lengths were mostly between 3.5 to 6.5 inches, though a couple of 8 inch individuals were caught.  Brook Stickleback, Fathead Minnow and Northern Redbelly Dace were the only other species sampled. <br> \n</p>",

A county owned carry-in boat access and two carry-in campsites are located around the shoreline.  The current population assessment indicated that suitable stream trout habitat during the most limited period in late summer was confined to the upper 32 ft of the lake.  Dissolved oxygen levels below 32 ft were too low to sustain trout for extended periods.  Trap nets and gill nets sampled brook trout and splake.  All brook trout were between 9 to 14 inches and resulted from the spring stocking of yearling fish.  Their body weight increased 300% in the 6 months since the fish were stocked.  All splake captured were quality sized fish that averaged roughly 24 inches in length and the largest individual sampled was 32 inches.  All splake sampled were stocked either 5, 7, or 9 years prior to this assessment.  Although rainbow trout were stocked in the spring of 1997, none were sampled in this assessment indicating low winter survival or high angler harvest.  Other species sampled include golden shiner, central mudminnow, dace, and white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Erskine Lake is a 40 acre designated trout lake located in northeastern Itasca County.  It has been managed for rainbow, splake (a cross between brook and lake trout) and brook trout in recent years. Stream trout lakes are assessed in the fall using half inch trap nets set in shallow water and nets are re-set each night in the same location for up to 4 days.  Splake were the predominant species sampled (4.4/set).  They ranged from 7.0 to 14.8 inches and had a mean length of 11.6 inches.  Only four rainbow trout were sampled in the trap nets (0.1/set) but anglers on the lake at the time of the assessment reported catching rainbow trout throughout the summer.  Other species sampled in the trap nets include fathead minnows, golden shiners and white sucker.One 24 hour gill net set sampled 15 splake, and one each of rainbow and brook trout.  The splake sampled ranged from 9.5 to 30.7 inches and had a mean length of 12.3 inches.  Because of the high catch of trout in the 24 hour set, the other gill net set was for only three hours.  Three splake were captured in this net.  While no aging was done due to the difficulty of taking scales in the fall and of aging hatchery reared trout, it appears from the length frequencies combined with the fact that splake and rainbow trout are stocked in alternate years, that the majority of the trout were the result of the 2002 splake stocking.</p>",
