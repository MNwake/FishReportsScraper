Trygg Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it is smaller.Trygg Lake was thermally stratified on 07/13/2004 with a surface temperature of 73 F and a bottom temperature of 43 F.  Good oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) was retained to a depth of 24 ft, where the temperature was 48 F.  Trygg Lake has no inlets, and the outlet to Lac La Croix has a steep drop which prevents fish immigration.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Trygg Lake are mostly ledgerock and boulder, with some sand and muck.Trygg Lake originally contained rock bass and sunfish.  It was poisoned in 1967 and stocked with rainbow trout from 1968 through 1986.  Brook trout averaging 30/lb have been stocked annually since 1987 at the average rate of 81/surface acre.This stream trout assessment consisted of two gillnet sets.  Seven previous fisheries lake surveys and fish population assessments dating back to 1966 consisted of 1-3 gillnet sets, all of which have been done from mid-July through mid September.  Trapnets have not been used in Trygg Lake due to the difficult portage access.Brook trout were the only fish species captured in 2004.  Eleven brook trout were captured from two size classes.  Four trout 9-10\" long were from the fingerling stocking the previous fall and had grown from an average size of 4\" when stocked on October 1, 2003.  Seven trout 14-16\" long were age two or older.The catch of trout by weight in Trygg Lake of 7.9 lb/gillnet was lower than the average catch of 16.2 lb/gillnet in three investigations since brook trout stocking began in this lake, but was higher than the median catch of 2.5 lb/gillnet in recent investigations of 25 stream trout lakes in the Tower fisheries management area.Trout stomachs examined in 2004 were empty (45 percent), or contained fish (45 percent) or insects (10 percent).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Trygg (also known as Twigg) Lake is located within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) within the Superior National Forest and is a non-motorized lake.  It's accessed by a 180 yard portage from Takucmich Lake on the east side and a 170 yard portage from Lac La Croix on the west side.  It is a small (25 acres) soft-water lake with a maximum depth of 35 feet and the water color is slightly bog-stained.  \n\nTrygg Lake was thermally stratified on August 13, 2013 with a surface temperature of 70 F and a bottom temperature of 43 F.  Ample oxygen for trout was retained to a depth of 20 feet.  No defined inlets exist on Trygg and the only outlet exists on the west end and appears to be seasonal.  Shoreline substrates are mostly ledgerock and boulder with some areas of sand and muck.\n\nAn initial survey of Trygg was done in 1966 and showed large numbers of rock bass.  The lake was treated with rotenone in 1967 which killed the existing rock bass as well as sunfish that were evidently also in the lake.  From 1968 through 1986 rainbow trout were stocked and from 1987 to present, brook trout fingerlings have been stocked annually at an average rate of 81 fish/surface acre.\n\nThe catch of brook trout by weight in Trygg Lake is 10 lbs/gill-net.  This is slightly lower than the average catch of 13 lbs/gill-net based on the four previous investigations that have taken place since brook trout stocking began in 1987.  \n\nBrook trout were the only fish species captured in 2013 as well as the past three investigations from Trygg Lake.  Sixteen brook trout were captured and ranged in size from 8 to 21 inches with an average of 13 inches. Good size structure exists with 38% of the brook trout sampled being larger than 14 inches.\n\nTen brook trout stomachs were examined in 2013, four contained fish remains and six were empty.\n</p>",
