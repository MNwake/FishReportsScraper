                "narrative": "<p>Shagawa Lake is located just N of the city of Ely. This popular lake is highly developed and historically one of the best walleye lakes in the area where anglers pursue them nearly year round. Shagawa is highly productive compared to other lakes in the area and algae blooms are common in late summer. Spiny water fleas were identified in 2013 and as such Shagawa's waters are considered infested. Rusty crayfish were discovered in 1985 and their presence was still apparent in the net catches from 2017. <br> \n <br> \nThere are four public accesses located around the lake. The most commonly used of the four is located on the south side off the Pioneer Road. There are two concrete planked ramps with a dock and ample parking nearby. Ice roads are also common during most winters providing anglers with access options. <br> \n <br> \nEight species of fish were sampled during the 2017 survey of Shagawa Lake. White sucker (37%) and walleye (30%) were the most common species sampled in the gill nets. Large cisco or tullibee and northern pike were also sampled in 2017. There is an annual sport netting season in late autumn for cisco. Smallmouth bass and one 22 inch muskie were sampled by night electrofishing.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2017 were slightly lower than the historical average (16.4/gill net) for Shagawa Lake and much higher than average (6.2/gill net) when compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average walleye sampled was 12.3 inches and about 3 years old. The largest walleye measured 26 inches in length. Walleye fry are currently stocked every third year on Shagawa Lake. Age analysis from the 2017 catch indicated that only 17% of the walleye sampled were from years where fry stocking occurred. Seventy-three percent of the walleye sampled in 2017 were from the 2014 and 2015 year classes, both non-stocked. <br> \n <br> \nCisco numbers in 2017 were higher than the historical average of 4.8/gill net and above average compared to other similar lakes in the area with cisco. The average cisco sampled was 10.6 inches long which is smaller than the historic average length of 12.8 inches. The largest cisco sampled in 2017 measured 18.3 inches. Periodic summer-kills of cisco have been historically observed on Shagawa Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2017 (2.1/gill net) were identical to the historic average and identical to the average when compared to other similar pike lakes in the area. The average pike sampled measured 23.0 inches which is similar to the historic average length of 22.2 inches. Thirty-seven percent of the pike sampled in 2017 were 24 inches or greater with a maximum length of 35.5 inches observed. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers from electrofishing in 2017 (20.7/hour) were above the historic average (8.9/hr) for Shagawa Lake. The average smallmouth sampled was 11.9 inches and about 4 years old. Several year classes were represented in the catch. Fifty-two percent of the smallmouth in the sample were 12 inches or greater up to a maximum of 19.7 inches. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shagawa Lake is located on the north side of Ely.  There are two main accesses, one each on the north and south sides of the lake.  The access on the north side is basically a ramp immediately adjacent to Co Rd 88.  There is very little parking at this location.  The other access on south side consists of two concrete ramps and a decent sized parking lot.  This 2,345 acre lake contains one substantial inlet and one outlet.  The Burntside River comes in on the west end of the lake and the Shagawa River leaves out the east side of the lake.  Shagawa has a maximum depth of 48.0 feet and the water color at the time of the survey was light green. <br> \n <br> \nOn July 11, 2022, Shagawa Lake was weakly thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 71 F and a bottom temperature of 60 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 35.0 feet where the water temperature was 61 F.  Shoal-water substrates consist of mostly boulder with some areas gravel and sand.  <br> \n <br> \nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 72.2 fish/net which was higher than average for the lake.  Total yield was 55.4 lbs/net which was average for the lake.  Fish species sampled were yellow perch, tullibee, white sucker, walleye, northern pike, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, and black crappie.  The overall trapnet catch rate for all fish combined was 18.7 fish/net which was slightly better than average.  Total yield was 17.8 lbs/net which was also average for the lake.  Smallmouth bass and bluegill were the only additional species sampled in trap nets that weren't also sampled in gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nSixty-four walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 7.1 fish/net which was better than average compared to other similar lakes but the lowest catch rate on Shagawa Lake since 1987.  Sizes ranged from 8 to 23 inches with an average of 15 inches.  Growth rates were good compared to other lakes in the area with the average walleye reaching 14 inches at age-4.  Ages ranged from 2 to 16 years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch rate of 2.6 fish/net was above average for Shagawa and better than average when compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 19 to 34 inches with an average of 24 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gillnet catch rate was 33.9 fish/net which was very good compared to other similar lakes and the highest catch rate on Shagawa since 1999.  The average length was just over 6 inches which was the smallest on record for the lake.  Max length was nearly 13 inches which was on par with past surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nOne hundred forty-nine cisco were sampled for a catch rate of 16.6 fish/net.

Shorthead redhorse are also present. Whitefish, bluegill, burbot, and smallmouth bass have been captured in previous assessments; smallmouth bass are fairly numerous. Cisco and northern pike sizes are above average; walleye sizes are below average. Walleye growth is slow. From 1978 through 1987 walleye fry were stocked in 6 years and there were stocking blanks in 4 years for evaluation purposes. Aging from gillnet assessments indicates there were 3 strong year classes and 3 average year classes in the fry stocked years. Non-stocked years produced 3 weak year classes and 1 average year class. It appears that fry stocking is more successful in preventing year class failures than in insuring strong year classes.</p>",

Shorthead rednose, rock bass, smallmouth bass, and other centrarchidae are present, but were not captured in this gillnet assessment.  Yellow perch sizes are larger than average for the area, while walleye sizes are smaller than aversge. Walleye aging shows a weak 1988 year class, and only one fish over the age of 4. Walleye growth appreas to be slower than average for the area.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shagawa Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Shagawa Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it has water that is less clear than most.  Shagawa Lake typically gets blooms of blue-green algae in mid to late summer.Water levels were normal on 08/09/99.  The water column was thermally stratified on 08/09/99 with a surface temperature of 71 F and a bottom temperature of 60 F.  Adequate oxygen (2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 23 ft, where the temperature was 69 F.  Shagawa Lake ranked as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic according to Carlson's Trophic Status Index, using data from a water sample taken on 08/02/99.Inlets from Burgo Lake, Miner's Lake, Mitchell Lake, and Armstrong Creek all have barriers to fish movement.  The outlet to Fall Lake also has barriers to fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, rubble, gravel, and sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 7 ft.Riparian development in 1999 consisted of several municipal and government facilities, a swimming beach, 4 public accesses, 6 resorts, and 142 homes & cottages.  Previously, 91 homes & cottages were present in 1985 and 44 homes & cottages were present in 1966.  Despite this increase in development, most of the shoreline (70%) was undeveloped in 1999.Fish populations in 1999, as in most previous investigations, were dominated by walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1999 of 82 fish/net (60 lb/net) was higher than normal for this lake class and was fairly similar to the median catch of 52 fish/net (59 lb/net) in 16 previous gillnettings on this lake, dating back to 1948.  More yellow perch were caught in the gillnets in 1999 than in most previous gillnettings.  Lake Class 7 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1999 of 19 fish/net (17 lb/net) was similar to the median catch of 14 fish/net (20 lb/net) in six previous trapnettings on this lake, dating back to 1959.  The trapnetting in 1999 was conducted earlier in the summer than previous trapnettings.  Fewer walleye and more shorthead redhorse and rock bass were caught in the trapnets in 1999 than in most previous trapnettings.Walleye numbers in 1999 (18.8/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 15.8/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 1999 averaged 13.1\" (0.9 lb) which is at the median for this lake class and is near the long term average size of 13.3\" on this lake.  The largest walleye caught in 1999 was 26.6\" (6.7 lb).  Most walleye were from the 1995 year class (35% of captured walleye) and the 1998 year class (31%), both of which were stocked with walleye fry, and from the 1997 year class (23%) which was not stocked.    Walleye growth was normal for the area.White sucker numbers in 1999 (18.1/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 13.0/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  High numbers of young-of-year sucker were captured in shoreline seining in 1999.  Sucker sizes in 1999 averaged 14.2\", which is normal for this lake class and is similar to the long term average size of 14.9\" on this lake.Yellow perch numbers in 1999 (38.0/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 16.6/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  High numbers of young-of-year perch were captured in shoreline seining in 1999.  Perch sizes in 1999 averaged 7.7\" (0.3 lb), which is larger than normal for this lake class and is similar to the long term average sizes of 7.5\" on this lake.  The largest perch in 1999 was 12.5\" (1.1 lb).  Most perch (65%) were from the 1997 year class.  Perch growth was faster than normal for the area.Northern pike numbers in 1999 (1.5/gillnet) were in the normal range for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 1.9/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 1999 averaged 24.6\" (3.6 lb), which is larger than normal for this lake class and is larger than the long term average size of 21.6\" on this lake.  The largest pike in 1999 was 40.8\" (15.1 lb).  Pike growth was faster than normal for the area.Smallmouth bass numbers in 1999 (0.3/gillnet, 0.1/trapnet) were fairly low, but were similar to numbers in previous investigations on this lake.  Smallmouth numbers caught during spring night electrofishing (9.0/hour of on-time) and in shoreline seining (59 young-of-year) indicate a healthy population.  Sizes of smallmouth caught by electrofishing averaged 11.5\"; the largest was 19.4\" (3.6 lb).  Smallmouth growth was faster than normal for the area.Cisco numbers in 1999 (4.2/gillnet) were in the normal range for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 5.2/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes in 1999 averaged 11.6\" (0.7 lb), which is larger than normal for this lake class and is smaller than the long term average size of 12.8\" on this lake.  The largest cisco in 1999 was 16.9\".  Shorthead redhorse numbers in 1999 (6.3/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 1.8/trapnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Rock bass numbers in 1999 (7.7/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 1.9/trapnet in previous investigations on this lake.  The catches of shorthead redhorse and rock bass in the gillnets in 1999 was low and was similar to gillnet catches in previous investigations.  Trapnetting was done earlier in 1999 (mid June) than in previous investigations (early August), which may have influenced the catch of these species.High numbers of young-of-year black crappie were captured in shoreline seining in 1999, but few adult black crappie were caught in the gillnets and none were caught in the trapnets.Rusty crayfish numbers in 1999 (94/gillnet) were similar to the catch in 1995 (92/gillnet) and may represent a stabilization of their numbers after a gradual increase which began when they were first identified in the Shagawa River in 1984.  Catches of rusty crayfish in the gillnets and trapnets in 1999 show they are spread throughout the lake, although the lightest gillnet catches of crayfish occurred on the far west end of the lake.  Rusty crayfish have gradually migrated towards the west end of the lake from the east end, where they were first discovered.Low numbers of the fish examined in 1999 had diseases or parasites.  Some of the fish had neascus (black spot), and a few of the yellow perch had yellow grub.  Neascus and yellow grub are small parasites that are found in or just under the skin.  They are native to the area, cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used for cooking fish. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shagawa Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Shagawa Lake typically gets blooms of blue-green algae in mid-to-late summer.  Shagawa Lake ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic, according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.  <br> \n <br> \nShagawa Lake was thermally stratified on 8/6/2007 with a surface temperature of 75 F and a bottom temperature of 56 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 22 ft, where the temperature was 72 F.  The five major inlets to Shagawa Lake all have barriers to fish movement, as does the outlet to Fall Lake.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Shagawa Lake are mostly boulder, rubble, gravel, and sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 7 ft. <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling in 2007 consisted of nine gillnet sets, reduced from the scheduled 15 sets to reduce unnecessary mortality due to the high fish catches that were occurring.  The nine gillnets that were used in 2007 were spread throughout the lake.  Eighteen previous investigations on Shagawa Lake, dating back to 1948, used 2-15 gillnets.  Eight of these previous investigations used 4-25 trapnets.  Trapnets were not used in 2007 ddue to workload considerations, and because previous trapnet catches were low and caught the same species in the same proportion as the gillnets, the exception being that the trapnets caught more rock bass than the gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2007, as in previous investigations on this lake, were dominated by walleye, white sucker, yellow perch, and northern pike.  Other fish species were present in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry have been stocked periodically in Shagawa Lake for many decades, and have been stocked every third year since 1995.  Walleye numbers in 2007 (29.1/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 16.4/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2007 averaged 12.2\" (0.74 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 13.3\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2007 was 25.7\".  Most walleye captured in 2007 were age one (37 percent) from the non-stocked 2006 year-class, and age three (36 percent) from the fry-stocked 2004 year-class.  Growth of walleye captured in Shagawa Lake in 2007 was in the normal range by area standards (in the second or third quartile, depending on the age), and was faster than in most previous investigations on this lake. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker numbers in 2007 (9.0/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class, but were lower than the median catch of 13.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2007 averaged 15.8\" (2.0 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2007 (4.0/gillnet) were at the median value for this lake class, but were much lower than the median catch of 16.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2007 averaged 8.6\" (0.35 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 7.6\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch captured in 2007 was 10.8\".  Most of the perch captured in 2007 (53 percent) were age four. Perch growth was faster than normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2007 (2.1/gillnet) were near the median for this lake class and were identical to the median catch of 2.1/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2007 averaged 23.5\" (3.2 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 21.9\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike captured in 2007 was 38.2\".  Pike growth was normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nNeascus was present on a few of the game fish examined in 2007.  A few of the yellow perch were infected with yellow grub, and one of the smallmouth bass had bass tapeworm larvae in its viscera.  Neascus (black spot), yellow grub, and bass tapeworm are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish were first reported in Shagawa Lake in 1984.  They get entangled in fisheries gillnets and their numbers, as judged by gillnet catches, have gradually increased over time.  The 2007 rusty crayfish catch of 173/gillnet was the highest yet recorded for this lake.  Removing crayfish from gillnets is very tedious and time-consuming work.  Rusty crayfish are native to the Ohio River Valley and were probably brought to the area by anglers using them for bait.  They are large and aggressive, displace native crayfish, can become very abundant, and can destroy beds of aquatic vegetation and reduce panfish populations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shagawa Lake is a 2,370 acre lake with a maximum depth of 48 feet located just north of Ely, Minnesota.   Shagawa's bog-stained waters are relatively productive especially compared to other lakes in the area. Shagawa is a very popular lake and receives considerable fishing pressure and attention from other water recreationalist.  There were 142 houses/cabins counted on Shagawa Lake during the 1999 survey.  Shagawa is managed as a walleye lake.  It is stocked with 2.4 million fry every third year. <br> \n <br> \nA fisheries assessment was conducted on Shagawa Lake during the summer of 2012.  Nine gill nets were set to assess the fishery.  Standard survey trap nets were not set in 2012 because species typically sampled by this gear (bluegill and black crappie) are not common in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net abundance in 2012 (19.4/net) was above average for Shagawa Lake as well as other lakes in the same classification.  Assessments have consistently indicated high walleye abundance. Walleye caught in 2012 ranged from 7.4 to 24.5 inches with an average length of 13.0 inches. Three size groups of fish were common in the catch.  These groups averaged 9.0, 11.5 and 16 inches.  Only 2% of the catch was of fish over 20 inches.  Ten age groups, one through ten, were present in the catch but age-1, age-2 and age-4 made up 75% of the total.  Growth of Shagawa Lake walleye was below average for lakes in the Tower management area. <br> \n <br> \nBy using age data from a number of assessments, its possible to calculate an estimate of mortality rates for walleye in Shagawa Lake.  The number of walleye of each age from 1981 through 2012 was combined. Three year old walleye are the most common age group in our nets but numbers decline quickly after that. The rate of decline is an indication of mortality.  On average for Shagawa, 49% of each age group dies each year either due to either angling or natural causes.  This is high compared to other walleye populations in the area. <br> \n <br> \nAn evaluation of walleye fry stocking indicated that, since 1981, 62% of our assessment catch was from 17 years in which fry stocking occurred. The other 38% were from 21 years in which no stocking occurred. This indicates that fry stocked years appear to contribute twice the number of fish when compated to non-stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net abundance of northern pike in 2012 (0.8/net) was the lowest its been since 1993 and was the second lowest on record.  Abundance in 2012 was unusually low compared to other lakes in the same classifcation. Northern pike lengths ranged from 19.8 to 35.6 inches with an average of 26.1 inches. The seven northern pike caught during the assessment had a average weight of 4.2 pounds which was exceptionally high for lakes in the same classification as Shagawa.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass first appeared in Shagawa Lake during an assessment in 1967.  They were not present in the four previous investigations dating back to 1948.  Catches of bass have generally increased since introduction.  In 2012, gill-net abundance (0.4/net) was the third highest on record.  The average length from all assessments was 11.5 inches and the largest individual ever captured was 18.9 inches taken in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nThe cisco gill-net abundance in 2012 (1.0/net) was exceptionally low  compated to previous assessments of Shagawa Lake. Like many Area lakes, cisco abundance appears to be declining in this lake.  The average gill-net catch rate between 1948 and 1967 was 20.2/net.  From 1970-1999 the average was 5.0/net and since 2000 the average was 0.9/net. The summer of 2012 was very warm and we received many reports of a substantial cisco die-off. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net abundance has been highly variable in Shagawa Lake.  The long-term average (16.0/net) is exceptionally high compared to other lakes in the same classification.  In 2012, however, abundance was 4.6/net, very low compared to previous catches on Shagawa Lake.  Yellow perch is an important forage species in this lake for walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nOver 1,300 rusty crayfish were also captured during the 2012 assessment.  Rusty crayfish are an invasive species that out compete native crayfish and can cause negative impacts like the loss of aquatic vegetation in lakes where they are present. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Whitefish and burbot have been captured in previous surveys, but were not seen in this a survey. Smelt were captured only once in 1979. Northern pike and northern redhorse are larger sized than average, walleye numbers are more than twice the local average, but have apparently declined somewhat, possibly due to changes brought on by treatment plant. Walleye age class analysis shows natural reproduction occurring in non-stocked years, however, stocked year classes are much stronger than non-stocked year classes. Walleye growth is average for this area and has not changed since 1959. The length frequency distribution of ciscos shows a gap from 9 from a selective heat-kill of small cisco during the summer of 1983.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>TRAPNETS 06/23/2003:Shagawa Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Shagawa Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class.  Shagawa Lake typically gets blooms of blue-green algae in mid-to-late summer.Following an extended period of hot, sunny, and calm weather, Shagawa Lake was thermally stratified on 8/11/2003 with a very abrupt thermocline.  Surface temperatures were 75 F and adequate oxygen for fish (2 ppm) was retained only to a depth of 13 ft, where the temperature was 73 F.  Conditions were only slightly improved on 8/18/2003.The five major inlets to Shagawa Lake all have barriers to fish movement, as does the outlet to Fall Lake.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, rubble, gravel, and sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 7 ft.Fish sampling in 2003 consisted of 15 trapnet sets.  Trapnets (4-25 sets) were used in seven previous investigations dating back to 1959.  Gillnets were not used in 2003 because many of the standard sets extend into water deeper than 13 ft, where there was poor oxygen in 2003 due to the unusually warm and calm weather.  Gillnets will be set in the summer of 2004 to complete fish sampling for this investigation.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets in 2003 of 13.5 fish/net (13.2 lbs/net) was similar to the median catch of 15.0 fish/net (15.4 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  The trapnet catch in 2003 was dominated by rock bass and shorthead redhorse, followed by northern pike and yellow perch.Rock bass numbers in 2003 (6.7/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 2.0/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.Shorthead redhorse numbers in 2003 (3.9/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 3.4/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.Northern pike numbers in 2003 (1.0/trapnet) were similar to the median catch of 0.9/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2003 averaged 18.8\" (1.5 lb), the largest was 26.4\".Yellow perch numbers in 2003 (1.2/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 3.3/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2003 averaged 8.2\" (0.4 lb), the largest was 12.7\".Rusty crayfish were observed in the shallows and caught in the trapnets (4.3/net) in 2003.  They have been present in Shagawa Lake since the mid-1980's.GILLNETS 08/02/2004:Shagawa Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Shagawa Lake typically gets blooms of blue-green algae in mid-to-late summer.   Shagawa Lake was thermally stratified on 8/2/2004 with a surface temperature of 72 F and a bottom temperature of 58 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 26 ft, where the temperature was 68 F.  The five major inlets to Shagawa Lake all have barriers to fish movement, as does the outlet to Fall Lake.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Shagawa Lake are mostly boulder, rubble, gravel, and sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 7 ft.Fish sampling in 2004 consisted of 12 gillnet sets, reduced from the scheduled 15 sets to reduce unnecessary mortality due to the high fish catches which were occurring.  This gillnetting was originally scheduled for 2003 when trapnetting was done, but was postponed because hot, sunny, still weather during the summer caused a very abrupt shallow thermal stratification of Shagawa Lake, with little oxygen below 13 ft.  Seventeen previous investigations on Shagawa Lake, dating back to 1948, used 2-15 gillnets.  Seven of these previous investigations used 4-25 trapnets.Fish populations in 2004 were dominated by walleye, white sucker, yellow perch, and northern pike.  Other fish species were present in low numbers.Walleye fry have been stocked periodically in Shagawa Lake for many decades, and have been stocked every third year since 1995.  Walleye numbers in 2004 (19.7/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 16.6/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2004 averaged 14.5\" (1.2 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 13.4\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2004 was 29.5\" (9.6 lb).  Most walleye captured in 2004 (53 percent) were age three, from the fry-stocked 2001 year class.  The effect of the 2001 fry stocking in Shagawa Lake is uncertain, however, because many lakes not stocked with walleye in 2001 had strong walleye year classes formed that year.  Growth of walleye captured in Shagawa Lake in 2004 was faster than normal by area standards (in the third or fourth quartile, depending on the age), and was faster than in previous investigations on this lake.White sucker numbers in 2004 (16.4/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 14.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2004 averaged 14.9\" (1.6 lb), which was normal for this lake class.Yellow perch numbers in 2004 (28.9/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 18.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2004 averaged 7.8\" (0.25 lb), which was at the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 7.5\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch captured in 2004 was 12.5\".  Growth of perch captured in 2004 was faster than normal by area standards, particularly for perch age three or older.Northern pike numbers in 2004 (3.6/gillnet) were at the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 1.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2004 averaged 23.6\" (3.2 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 21.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike captured in 2004 was 30.9\".  Growth of pike captured in 2004 was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.Neascus was present on some of the northern pike (37 percent), walleye (8 percent), and yellow perch (3 percent) examined in 2004.  Half of the smallmouth bass examined had bass tapeworm larvae in their viscera, and 14 percent of the perch had yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot), bass tapeworm, and yellow grub are common parasites of fish that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed when filleting the fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.Rusty crayfish were first reported in Shagawa Lake in 1983.  They were entangled in the gillnets in 2004, and the average catch of 135/gillnet was the highest yet recorded in this lake.  Working with nets full of crayfish was very tedious and time-consuming.  Rusty crayfish are a large, aggressive species of crayfish which are native to the Ohio River Valley.  They were likely introduced to the area by anglers using them for bait.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shagawa Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Shagawa Lake typically gets blooms of blue-green algae in mid-to-late summer.   Shagawa Lake was thermally stratified on 8/2/2004 with a surface temperature of 72 F and a bottom temperature of 58 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 26 ft, where the temperature was 68 F.  The five major inlets to Shagawa Lake all have barriers to fish movement, as does the outlet to Fall Lake.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Shagawa Lake are mostly boulder, rubble, gravel, and sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 7 ft.Fish sampling in 2004 consisted of 12 gillnet sets, reduced from the scheduled 15 sets to reduce unnecessary mortality due to the high fish catches which were occurring.  This gillnetting was originally scheduled for 2003 when trapnetting was done, but was postponed because hot, sunny, still weather during the summer of 2003 caused a very abrupt shallow thermal stratification of Shagawa Lake, with little oxygen below 13 ft.  Seventeen previous investigations on Shagawa Lake, dating back to 1948, used 2-15 gillnets.  Seven of these previous investigations used 4-25 trapnets.Fish populations in 2004 were dominated by walleye, white sucker, yellow perch, and northern pike.  Other fish species were present in low numbers.Walleye fry have been stocked periodically in Shagawa Lake for many decades, and have been stocked every third year since 1995.  Walleye numbers in 2004 (19.7/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 16.6/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2004 averaged 14.5\" (1.2 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 13.4\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2004 was 29.5\" (9.6 lb).  Most walleye captured in 2004 (53 percent) were age three, from the fry-stocked 2001 year class.  The effect of the 2001 fry stocking in Shagawa Lake is uncertain, however, because many lakes not stocked with walleye in 2001 had strong walleye year classes formed that year.  Growth of walleye captured in Shagawa Lake in 2004 was faster than normal by area standards (in the third or fourth quartile, depending on the age), and was faster than in previous investigations on this lake.White sucker numbers in 2004 (16.4/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 14.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2004 averaged 14.9\" (1.6 lb), which was normal for this lake class.Yellow perch numbers in 2004 (28.9/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 18.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2004 averaged 7.8\" (0.25 lb), which was at the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 7.5\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch captured in 2004 was 12.5\".  Growth of perch captured in 2004 was faster than normal by area standards, particularly for perch age three or older.Northern pike numbers in 2004 (3.6/gillnet) were at the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 1.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2004 averaged 23.6\" (3.2 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 21.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike captured in 2004 was 30.9\".  Growth of pike captured in 2004 was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.Neascus was present on some of the northern pike (37 percent), walleye (8 percent), and yellow perch (3 percent) examined in 2004.  Half of the smallmouth bass examined had bass tapeworm larvae in their viscera, and 14 percent of the perch had yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot), bass tapeworm, and yellow grub are common parasites of fish that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed when filleting the fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.Rusty crayfish were first reported in Shagawa Lake in 1983.  They were entangled in the gillnets in 2004, and the average catch of 135/gillnet was the highest yet recorded in this lake.  Working with nets full of crayfish was very tedious and time-consuming.  Rusty crayfish are a large, aggressive species of crayfish which are native to the Ohio River Valley.  They were likely introduced to the area by anglers using them for bait.</p>",
