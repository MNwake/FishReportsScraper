This shallow 113acre lake is surrounded by federal and state land with access to the north shore of the main lake basin via a 0.5mile walk-in trail.  A lake map created in 1954 from 1935 soundings indicated a maximum depth of 5 ft.  Much of the bottom substrate is muck/detritus and aquatic vegetation is varied and abundant.  Wild rice can be found over much of the main lake basin.  Northern pike, yellow perch and white sucker were sampled in 2007, 1987 and 1976 assessments. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in higher numbers in the 2007 survey than in previous surveys.  The mean weight of northern pike in 2007 (1.39lbs) was lower than in 1987 (2.67lbs) and 1976 (1.66lbs), all samples included quality size northern pike greater than 34inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in average numbers in 2007.  The average length of perch sampled in 2007 was 8.3 inches.  A small number of quality size perch (9 to 12 inches) were sampled in each assessment.  White sucker were sampled in high numbers again in the 2007 lake survey.  The yellow perch and white sucker populations provide an important forage base for the northern pike in Hoist Lake.  All three fish species are maintained through natural reproduction.   <br> \n</p>",
