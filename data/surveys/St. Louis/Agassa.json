                "narrative": "<p>Agassa Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 17, which consists of 99 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, very shallow, and have bog stained and very soft (low mineral content) water.  Agassa Lake does not stratify during the summer and retains good oxygen to near the bottom.  A small inlet drains a swamp, and the outlet to Big Lake has beaver dams and flows through swamps which limit fish movement.  Shallow water lake bottom substrates are mostly ledgerock, boulder, and muck.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 8 feet. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 population assessment consisted of two gillnet sets.  Six previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1977, also consisted of two gillnets sets.  Trapnets have not been used in Agassa Lake due to the difficult portage access. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2009 consisted of walleye, yellow perch, and high numbers of white sucker.  The total catch of fish (all species combined) in 2009 of 40.5 fish/gillnet (42 lbs/gillnet) was lower than the median (45.5 fish/gillnet) of all investigations on this lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were absent in the initial survey in 1977, and walleye stocking began in 1982.  Agassa Lake has been stocked biennially with walleye fry since 1993 with the most recent stocking in 2009.  The walleye catch rate in 2009 was identical to the median (5.5/gillnet) of all investigations since walleye first appeared (1984-2009) and in the third quartile for Lake Class 17.  Walleye sizes averaged 13.3 inches in 2009, lower than the average from all previous investigations of 14.1 inches.  The largest walleye caught in the 2009 assessment was 16.5 inches.  The 2009 catch was distributed relatively evenly across 6 age classes (Age 2-8).  Growth varied widely by age class, due in part to small sample sizes. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 white sucker catch rate (28.5/gillnet) was above average for Lake Class 17 but at the median of all investigations on this lake.  Sucker numbers in Agassa have been high in all investigations, ranging from 22.5/gillnet to 40.0/gillnet.  The average white sucker size in 2009 was 14.3 inches; the largest was 19.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2009 (6.5/gillnet) were normal (in the second quartile) for this lake class and at the median of all Agassa Lake investigations.  Perch numbers have varied widely in previous assessments, ranging from 4.5/gillnet to 28.0/gillnet.  The largest yellow perch caught in 2009 was 10.5 inches, but perch size averaged 9.3 inches.  The 2009 catch was dominated by age 3 and 4 fish.  Growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.   <br> \n <br> \nNone of the fish examined in 2009 had signs of parasites or diseases. <br> \n</p>",

The surrounding forest is dominated by conifers. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a 0.8 mile portage from the Echo Trail (CR 116) for public access. The parking lot is located at the Angelworm Lake Trailhead. There is one designated campsite located on the lake for overnight use. <br> \n <br> \nThree species of fish were sampled during the 2019 survey of Agassa Lake. White sucker and yellow perch were sampled in above average numbers. Walleye numbers were near their respective long term averages. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2019 (5.5/gill net) were identical to the long term average for Agassa Lake and nearly identical when compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average walleye sampled was 17.6 inches. Walleye sizes ranged from 15.1 to 26.6 inches. Walleye fry are stocked during odd-numbered years in Agassa Lake and in 2019 most of the walleye sampled were from years when stocking occurred. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2019 (10.0/gill net) were  higher than the long term average (8.3/gill net) for this lake and above average (7.6/gill net) when compared to other similar area lakes. The average perch sampled was 6.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Agassa Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 17, which consists of 99 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, very shallow, and have bog stained and very soft (unmineralized) water.  There is a small inlet which drains a local swamp, and the outlet to Big Lake has beaver dams and flows through marshes which limit fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates in shallow water are mostly ledgerock, boulder, and muck.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 8 ft.  Agassa Lake does not thermally stratify in midsummer and retains good oxygen to near the bottom.Fish populations in 1999 consisted of walleye and high numbers of white sucker and yellow perch.  The total catch of fish (all species combined) in 1999 of 68 fish/gillnet (65 lb/gillnet) was higher than normal for this lake class and was higher than in most of the previous five assessments in this lake, dating back to 1977.Walleye were absent in the initial assessment in 1977 and walleye stocking began in 1982.  Walleye numbers in 1999 (5/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to previous catches in this lake after stocking began.  Walleye sizes in 1999 averaged 14\"; the largest was 20\".  Walleye growth (12\" at age four) was normal for area lakes.  Most walleye were from the fry-stocked 1995 year class; no walleye under age four were captured during this assessment.White sucker numbers in 1999 (40/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than in most previous assessments.  Sucker sizes averaged 14\"; the largest was 18\".  Yellow perch numbers in 1999 (22/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than in most previous assessments.  Perch sizes averaged 7\"; the largest was 11\".  Perch growth (6\" at age three) was faster than normal for area lakes.</p>",
