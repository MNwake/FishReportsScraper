Lake Louisa took a hard winterkill during the winter of 2013 -2014 and was used as a Walleye rearing pond the following year in 2014.  During the fall of 2014, nearly 7,300 pounds of Walleye fingerlings were harvested from Lake Louisa. In 2015, it was restocked with Yellow Perch and Northern Pike. During the winter of 2017-2018, anglers reported seeing dead Walleye on the bottom of the lake. While oxygen readings were not taken, it was suspected that a winterkill occurred.  A winterkill assessment using daytime electrofishing was conducted on May 16, 2018 to determine the extent of the winterkill that occurred.  <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing sampled 4 species of fish including Black Bullhead (72.0 per hour), Fathead Minnow (N=1150.0 per hour), Northern Pike (N=2.0 per hour), and Yellow Perch (N=114.0 per hour). Walleye were not sampled, indicating that a partial winterkill likely occurred.  During the spring of 2018, Walleye fry were stocked for fingerling production.  The Walleye fry stocking was evaluated in the fall using daytime electrofishing.  During fall electrofishing, less than 10 young-of the year (YOY) Walleye were sampled in an hour, indicating that the fry stocking was not very successful.  Hundreds of Yellow Perch and good numbers of YOY Northern Pike were observed during the survey.  The YOY Pike were likely the result of natural reproduction in the spring of 2018.  <br> \n</p>",
