Bluegill ranged in length from 3.9 to 7.9 inches, with an average length of 6.4 inches.  Black crappie were abundant (9.3/trapnet), but average size of sampled fish was small (7.3 inches).  Pumpkinseed, yellow perch, and hybrid sunfish catches were all high, but average size of each species was small.  Northern pike catches were low (1.5/gillnet), but average length and weight was good: 25.8 inches and 4.3 lbs, respectively.  Gillnet catches of walleye were moderate (3.5/net), with an average length of 12.7 inches.  One 23.7 inch walleye was sampled in the trapnets.  Walleye ages correspond to stockings of fingerling and yearling walleye.  Two hybrid muskellunge were sampled.  Lengths of the hybrid muskellunge were 33.7 and 36.3 inches.  Both hybrid muskellunge were four years old and from the 1989 stocking.  Nineteen largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing.  Size structure of the sampled largemouth bass was good.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 8.4 to 18.8 inches, with an average length of 11.6 inches.  Black bullhead and yellow bullhead catches were low, but, average size was large: 11.0 and 9.7 inches respectively.</p>",

Its popularity as a bathing beach for St. Paul residents has probably overshadowed its capability for providing good fishing although for its small size it has done well in both categories.The 1958 survey pointed out the good panfish population now present consisting of bluegills for the most part.  Moreover, in the sample of 105 bluegills taken, 30 percent were better than seven inches in length.Smallmouth bass, which is rather uncommon around the Twin Cities area, was found to be present.  Crayfish, its most preferred diet, is also prevalent in this lake.Northern pike and black crappies were found to be rather low in numbers while conversely large numbers of perch were taken.  The lack of young northern pike and the few adults present substantiate a lack of natural spawning facilities for this fish.</p>",

Bluegill are moderately abundant with a respectable size structure.  Lengths ranged from 3.7 to 7.6 inches with 6.0 inch average.  Three walleye were captured, which is a little below average for this lake class.  These were large - 21.4 to 25 inches.  One 27 inch northern pike was captured.  Electrofishing was not conducted so no largemouth bass were sampled, but are present in the lake.  No tiger muskies were captured either, but may still be present form stocking conducted in the 1980's.  Other species captured were pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, golden shiner, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake McCarron is a small eutrophic basin located in Roseville that is categorized in lake class 30.  Surface acreage is 73 acres with 25 acres being littoral (less than 15 feet deep).The maximum depth being 57 feet and there is a high abundance of aquatic vegetation. McCarron has a variety of habitat for various species of fish. Northern Pike have been the primary management species in the lake. The lake has a history of experiencing partial winterkills that tend to reduce the number of small Bluegills back to levels of abundance that the lake can support.  <br> \n <br> \nNet catches were slightly better than what was seen in previous years, with gill net catches of Northern Pike above average and trap net catches of Bluegill also above average in abundance. Northern Pike averaged 22 inches and Bluegills ranged from 2.7 to 8.1 inches in length with an average length of 5.2 inches. The largest Black Crappie captured was 11.4 inches in length. Yellow Perch were captured in low abundance for lakes similar to McCarron. Largemouth Bass are present in the lake however none were captured in the gill or trap nets in 2019. Largemouth Bass were sampled by night electrofishing with thirty-six Largemouth Bass and two Smallmouth Bass being sampled by electrofishing (36.6 bass/hr on time), which was conducted around the entire shoreline of McCarrons Lake. The Largemouth Bass population size structure on McCarrons Lake is good with some quality size fish present. The Smallmouth Bass present in the lake are most likely the result of illegal transport and stocking by overzealous anglers. Anglers are reminded that the practice of non-permitted fish stocking is prohibited by state law.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The present fish population of McCarrons Lake changed substantially from that sampled in 2003. A respectable population of above average sized bluegill was captured in the nets. Over 90 percent of the BLG captured measured 6.0 inches in length, or larger, with the average size being 6.9 inches and 0.26 pounds. Over 60 percent of all bluegill captured measured 7.0 inches or larger, and over 9 percent measured 8.0 inches or larger. Black crappie, while sampled in relatively low abundance, exhibited above average size (approximately 9.0 inches and 0.33 pounds). Largemouth in good numbers were observed in the shallows, but only 2 individuals were captured in sampling gear. Given the relatively uniform size of individuals observed, they may represent one or two strong year classes of Largemouth Bass recruiting into the population. Only one northern pike was captured, but it was a quality size fish measuring 33.46 inches and weighing 8.65 pounds. Carp were not captured in high abundance, but hundreds of fish were observed spawning in the shallow water near the inlet of the lake.</p>",

Modest bullhead numbers were seen in trapnets.  Sunfish were taken in numbers substantially above state and local medians.  Black crappie, walleye, and yellow perch were taken in trapnets in numbers near state and local medians.  Age structure of northern pike was predominated by age II with a few of ages III, IV, and VI; growth of pike was excellent.  Age II walleye were taken.  Walleye sampled were the result of fingerling stocking in 1986 and/or yearlings stocked in 1987.  They had grown at an average rate.  Reproduction of bluegill sunfish was good as seen in shoreline seining in late summer.  Bluegill PSD=22%.</p>",

Pumpkinseed Sunfish, although not as abundant, exhibited a similar size structure. Black Crappie averaged 6.24\" and 0.12 pounds, with less than 7% of the sample measuring 8.0\" or larger. All 3 of these species were sampled in above average abundance for the trap net catch. Yellow Perch were sampled in above average abundance for both gill and trap net catches. The average Yellow Perch was 6.1\" in length. Northern Pike averaging 28.6\" and 4.98 pounds were sampled. Walleye from recent stockings of fry (2000) and fingerlings (2001) were captured. These fish averaged 10.2\" and 0.34 pounds. Largemouth Bass are present, but were not targeted during this survey. </p>",

With the maximum depth being 57 feet and a high abundance of aquatic vegetation, McCarron has a variety of habitat for various species of fish. Northern Pike have been the primary management species in the lake. The lake has a history of experiencing partial winterkills that tend to reduce the number of small Bluegills back to levels of abundance that the lake can support. Net catches were similar to previous years, with gill net catches of Northern Pike slightly increasing and trap net catches of Bluegill decreasing. Northern Pike captured averaged 24.8 inches in length and 3.1 pounds. Bluegills ranged from 3.4 to 8.4 inches in length and 17% of Bluegills captured were 7 inches in length or larger. The largest Black Crappie captured was 11.2 inches in length. Yellow Perch were also captured in low abundance with an average length of 6.1 inches.</p>",
