                "narrative": "<p>Little Stanchfield lake, located 3 miles west of Grandy in Isanti County, is managed for northern pike.  Despite a small public access and few lake homes, the lake receives high angling pressure year-round.  Much of the open water angling is directed at northern pike and largemouth bass.  Ice anglers typically target crappies and sunfish.  Water levels flucuate with the level of the Rum River which is an avenue for fish migration through Lower Stanchfield Creek.  Little Stanchfield is grouped into lake class 39 with other small, shallow, turbid lakes.   Black crappie numbers remain high with most measuring between 7.5 and 10 inches.  Northern pike abundance is still good with a quality fishery.  Northern averaged more than 3.5 pounds and were well distributed between 20 and 36 inches.  Increasing dramatically since 1993, largemouth bass should also provide a quality fishery.  Bass averaged 2.2 pounds with most of the catch between 13 and 19 inches.   Bluegill also increased in abundance since the last sample, but few fish exceeded 7.5 inches.  Populations of both walleye and yellow perch remained low.  Black bullhead, common carp, and white sucker abundance was high with a typical size structure.  Shoreline seining found natural reproduction for all gamefish species except walleye.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Stanchfield Lake is a small, shallow, fertile lake that is connected with the Rum River through Lower Stanchfield Brook.  DNR Fisheries crews conducted a lake survey on Little Stanchfield Lake in August 1993.  Gill nets and trap nets were used to evaluate the fish population, and additional sampling was done by electrofishing and shoreline seining.  No stocking or other management activities have taken place on this lake since an initial survey was done in 1968.          Northern pike were relatively abundant for this lake type.  Most of the northerns seen during this survey were over 24 inches in length, and the largest was 36 inches.          Largemouth bass were present but not highly abundant during the survey.  This lake does not appear to have ideal bass habitat, although a small population is present and reproduction does occur, as evidenced by the young-of-year bass found in seine hauls.        Both black and white crappies were seen in nets, but the black crappie was definitely predominant.  Sizes of crappies were larger than what might be expected for this size lake; although the mean length was 8.5 inches, a good portion of the catch was over 10 inches, and one 15.7 inch, 2.6 pound crappie was measured.  Abundance of black crappies was normal for this lake type.        Bluegill abundance was somewhat low but still within the normal range.  The mean length was 6.8 inches, with a range of 5-8 inches.        Other species netted during the survey include bowfin (dogfish), bullhead, carp, white sucker, rock bass, silver redhorse (normally a river species), and pumpkinseed sunfish.  One walleye was netted; this lake has been known to provide occasional walleye fishing in the past due to the connection with the Rum River.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Stanchfield lake, located 3 miles west of Grandy in Isanti County, is managed for Northern Pike. Despite having a small public access and few lake homes, the lake receives high angling pressure year-round. Much of the open water angling is directed at Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. Ice anglers typically target crappies and sunfish. Water levels fluctuate with the level of the Rum River which is an avenue for fish migration through Lower Stanchfield Creek. Little Stanchfield is grouped into lake class 39 with other small, shallow, turbid lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find numerous pike in Little Stanchfield.  Northern Pike catch rates remain high and size is average when compared to similar lakes. Captured Northern Pike ranged from 13.8 to 34.6 inches.  Some Walleye are present in Little Stanchfield, but catch rates remain low.  With no natural reproduction, future Walleye abundance is dependent on fish migration in from Lower Stanchfield Creek.  Spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass was conducted, but high water hindered sampling efforts.  However, several larger Bass up to 21 inches in length were still observed.   <br> \n <br> \nThere are also plenty of quality sized panfish to target in Little Stanchfield.  Black Crappie abundance remains high and size is above average when compared to similar lakes.  The largest Black Crappie collected was 11.3 inches and 87% of the Black Crappie observed were 8 inches or larger. Bluegill abundance is also high when compared to similar lakes.  Bluegill up to 9.3 inches were observed and the average length was almost 7 inches.  Panfish growth rates are above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes.  An abundance of quality, harvestable sized panfish should allow for ample fishing opportunities.  Yellow Perch abundance increased slightly, but remains low. White Sucker abundance decreased, but still remains greater than the 75th percentile for lake class 39, while Black Bullhead catch rates decreased drastically to very low levels. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
