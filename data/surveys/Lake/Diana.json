                "narrative": "<p>Diana Lake is a 44.3 acre, soft-water lake of the Isabella River system in the Kawishiwi Watershed. The lake has a maximum depth of 13 feet, and there are two inlets and one outlet. Diana Lake lies within the roadless area and airspace reservation zone of the Superior National Forest. The lake is accessible either by difficult canoe trip from the Isabella River (not an established canoe route), or through a restricted logging road which crosses the lake's outlet. The lake is completely surrounded by forest, and limited amounts of swamp and marsh are present. Shoal soils are mostly sand or muck over sand, but slight amounts of boulder, gravel, rubble, and ledgerock also exist.     At the time of the survey, water levels appeared to have fluctuated less than two feet in past years. Dissolved oxygen was plentiful for fish life to depths of about 10 feet, and the water color was brown. Moderate amounts of aquatic vegetation were present to depths of five feet. Test netting indicated an abundance of Northern Pike and White Sucker, and low to moderate numbers of Yellow Perch, Walleye and Pumpkinseed. Three species of shiners and young-of-the-year and adult Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were taken in shoreline seining.     Spawning facilities were rated \"good\" for Northern Pike and \"fair\" for Walleye and Smallmouth Bass. Largemouth Bass and centrarchid panfish facilities were rated \"poor to fair\".     Diana Lake has very little fishing pressure due mainly to its generally inaccessible nature. Some residents of the area report occasional good Walleye and Northern Pike fishing in the lake.</p>",
