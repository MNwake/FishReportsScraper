                "narrative": "<p>     Buchanan Lake is a 929-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in east-central Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Ottertail, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 42 feet; however, 90% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disc reading in this assessment was 11.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.0 to 11.0 feet.   <br> \n     Shoreline development is considered to be moderate on Buchanan Lake.  A state owned public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand.  Mucky areas are confined to the bays.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattails are located in various locations around the lake.  They provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     Buchanan Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie are the dominant gamefish species.  Suitable spawning habitat for these species exists throughout the lake. <br> \n     Buchanan Lake boasts an abundant Northern Pike population. Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.4 to 28.0 inches with a mean length of 19.2 inches.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 20.6 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Bluegills are very abundant.  Twenty-one percent of the Bluegills measured 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.3 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Age data indicate that Black Crappie reproduction is consistently good.  Crappies ranged in length from 3.7 to 11.1 inches with an average length of 7.6 inches.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 8.5 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     A balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 9.7 to 18.6 inches with an average length and weight of 13.5 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain a mean length of 13.9 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Walleyes are moderately abundant.  Walleyes ranged in length from 14.3 to 26.3 inches with an average length and weight of 22.1 inches and 3.9 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.8 inches at four years of age. <br> \nAnglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Buchanan Lake is a 929-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in east-central Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Ottertail, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 42 feet; however, 90% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disc reading in this assessment was 11.8 feet.  Previous readings have ranged from 3.0 to 11.0 feet.  A state owned public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots. <br> \n     Shoreline development is considered to be moderate on Buchanan Lake.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand.  Mucky areas are confined to the bays.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattails are located in various locations around the lake.  They provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     Buchanan Lake provides good summer and winter angling opportunities for a variety of species.  Buchanan Lake has good populations of bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  These species thrive because of the quality habitat that exists.   <br> \n     The test-net catch rate indicates that bluegills are very abundant.  Ten percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.3 inches at six years of age.   <br> \n     A spring trap net assessment was conducted to analyze the black crappie population.  Age data indicate that black crappie reproduction is consistently good.  Crappies ranged in length from 7.6 to 12.7 inches with an average length of 10.3 inches.  Black crappies attain an average length of 9.8 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     The test-net catch rate indicates that largemouth bass are also abundant.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 7.8 to 15.7 inches with an average length of 12.8 inches.  Bass attain a mean length of 11.6 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Walleyes are moderately abundant.  Walleyes ranged in length from 17.8 to 27.9 inches with an average length and weight of 21.9 inches and 3.7 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.3 inches at three years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Located between Otter Tail and Rush Lakes in central Otter Tail County is Buchanan Lake.  A mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake covering 929 surface acres with many bays and points, Buchanan Lake offers anglers a place to fish on windy days.  The lake has a maximum depth of 42 feet; however, 90% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disc reading (a measurement of water clarity) in 2004 was 11.0 feet.  A state owned public access is located on the northwestern shoreline.     Shoreline development is considered to be moderate on Buchanan Lake.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand interspersed with some gravel and rubble.  Mucky areas are confined to the bays.  Areas of hardstem bulrush and cattails are present around the lake, primarily adjacent to undeveloped shoreline parcels.  These areas are important components of a lake.  They provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat during all stages of life and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Bulrush and cattail stands are natural shoreline stabilizers, reducing erosion caused from wave action and they can even absorb pollutants from the water.  Because of their ecological value, bulrush and cattails may not be removed without obtaining a DNR permit.     Buchanan Lake provides good summer and winter angling opportunities for a variety of species.  Because of the shoreline characteristics, bottoms substrates, and aquatic vegetation, the lake contains good populations of bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  These species thrive naturally because of the quality habitat that exists.  Six percent of the bluegill were > 7.0 inches in length.  Black crappie ranged in length from 5.0 to 10.1 inches with an average length of 7.6 inches.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 8.2 to 17.0 inches with an average length of 12.3 inches.      Northern pike although abundant in Buchanan Lake are somewhat on the smaller side with only 4% of the pike > 24.0inches in length.  The abundant northern pike can still be exciting to catch on days when other fish are reluctant tobite.       In the past, walleye fry stockings have provided Buchanan Lake with a viable walleye population.  An aggressive fry stocking plan of stocking two out of three years will be utilized in an attempt to increase walleye abundance to management goals.  Walleye ranged in length from 15.1 to 26.3 inches with an average length of 20.3 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Located between Otter Tail and Rush Lakes in central Otter Tail County is Buchanan Lake.  A mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake covering 929 surface acres with many bays and points, Buchanan Lake offers anglers a place to fish on windy days.  The lake has a maximum depth of 42 feet, however, 90% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disc reading (a measure of water clarity) in 1999 was 10 feet. A public access is located on the north shoreline.     Shoreline development is considered to be moderate on Buchanan Lake.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand interspersed with some gravel and rubble.  Mucky areas are confined to the bays.  Areas of bulrush and cattails are present around the lake, primarily adjacent to undeveloped shoreline parcels.  These areas are important components of a lake.  They provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat during all stages of life and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Bulrush and cattail beds are natural shoreline stabilizers, reducing erosion caused from wave action and they can even absorb pollutants from the water.  Because of their ecological value, bulrush and cattails may not be removed without obtaining a DNR permit.     Buchanan Lake provides good summer and winter angling opportunities for a variety of species.  Because of the shoreline characteristics, bottom substrates,  and aquatic vegetation, the lake contains good populations of bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  These species thrive naturally because of the quality habitat that exists.  Northern pike are also abundant in Buchanan Lake and size structure is good with 16% of the pike sampled in 1999 > 24 inches in length.  The walleye population is currently dominated by the 1996 year class, a year when walleye fry were stocked.  Although walleye natural reproduction occurs, stocking is needed in this lake to help maintain the walleye population.  The current management plan calls for stocking walleye fry two of three years in an attempt to increase the walleye population to management goals. </p>",

Other area lakes included in this class are: Block, Elbow, Sand and Round.   <br> \n     Northern pike abundance increased from 7.8 per gill net lift in the 1987 survey to 9.7 per net, which remains within the normal range for this lake class.  Age data indicate that the pike population is dominated by the 1989 year class, which composed 57% of the sample.  Northern pike growth rates appear exceptional in comparison to statewide averages.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance decreased from 146.6 per trap net lift in 1987 to 102.2, but remains well above the normal range.  The bluegill population appears to be dominated by the 1987 year class, which composed 70% of the sample.  Bluegill growth rates are below the statewide average and only two percent of the bluegills measured were greater than 7.0 inches in length.   <br> \n     Largemouth bass abundance increased from 0.5 per trap net lift in 1987 to 2.1 per net, which is three times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.  Bass recruitment appears to be consistent as the sample was composed of four consecutive age classes.  <br> \n     Black crappie abundance increased slightly from 1.9 per trap net lift in 1987 to 2.7, which is slightly above the lower limit of the normal range.  A strong 1989 year class composed 63% of the sample.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance decreased from 31.6 and 22.8 per gill net lift in 1987 and 1981, respectively, to 3.7 per net. <br> \n     Walleye abundance increased from 6.9 per gill net lift in 1987 to 8.0 per net, which is well above the normal range.  Average individual weight of walleye increased from 1.5 pounds in 1987 to 2.1 pounds.  Growth rates are slightly above the statewide average.  Walleye age data indicates that fry stocking is successful and that natural reproduction is limited as the only walleye sampled were from years when fry were stocked. <br> \n</p>",
