                "narrative": "<p>Lakes Christina and Anka were chemically rehabilitated with rotenone in the fall of 1987 for waterfowlmanagement purposes.  The main fisheries aspect of the project was to maintain a fish communitydominated by large predators to control biomass of planktivorous fish.  Lake Christina was restockedwith walleye and largemouth bass following the reclamation.  Lake Anka was not restocked, however adirect connection to Lake Christina provided for the re-establishment of fish populations.   Lake Ankais open to fishing, however there is no public access.  Boats must enter the lake through a channelfrom Lake Christina.  Annual population assessments have been completed on both lakes to monitor thedevelopment and changes in fish community structure following chemical reclamation.  Testnettingindicates that gamefish populations have declined and fish community structure is beginning to resemblepre-treatment conditions.  Low dissolved oxygen concentrations during winter months is likelyresponsible for the shift in community structure towards more tolerant species.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 2.0 fish/net in 1993.  Catch rates were consistently higher inprevious years, ranging from 7.0 - 8.0 fish/net in annual population assessments from 1989 to 1992. The average weight of fish captured was 2.0 pounds.  Electrofishing yielded 33 stock-size largemouthbass per hour in 1993 compared to  50 stock-size fish per hour in 1992.  A smaller size structure wasnoted in 1993 which suggests that largemouth bass are still reproducing in Lake Anka.  Bluegill catchrate decreased from 15.5 fish/trapnet in 1992 to 5.6 fish/trapnet in 1993.  Age-3 fish comprised 67%of the fish captured in 1993.  Northern pike were first captured following the reclamation in 1992 whencatches averaged 1.0 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches averaged 3.5 fish/net in 1993.  The average weightof fish captured was 1.3 pounds.  Yellow perch catch rates averaged 34.3 fish/gillnet in 1993.  Catcheshave ranged from 11.0 - 36.0 in annual assessments since 1989.  The average weight of fish captured was0.2 pounds. Black bullhead gillnet catch rate decreased from 175.0 fish/net in 1992 to 31.0 fish/netin 1993.  Trapnet catches showed an opposite trend increasing from 12.5 fish/net in 1992 to 36.2fish/net in 1993.  The average weight of fish captured was 0.4 in 1993.  Bigmouth buffalo were observedby the electrofishing crew in 1992 and were captured with electrofishing and trapnets in 1993.  </p>",

The abundance of prey have helped the Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass get off strong year-classes in 1986. Ten of the 15 northerns sampled and 12 of the 13 bass sampled were from the 1986 year-class. Bluegill numbers were excellent and have excellent size. Eighty-two percent of the bluegills taken in trapnets were larger than 7.0 inches. Mean weight of the bluegills was 0.33 pounds. Lake Anka was reclaimed in November 1987 and will be managed as part of the Lake Christina reclamation project.</p>",

Walleye catch rate has remained stable, averaging 7.0 fish/gillnet in 1991.  Catch rate averaged 7.0 fish/gillnet and 8.0 fish/gillnet in 1989 and 1990, respectively.  The mean weight of fish captured was 1.0 pounds.  Yellow Perch catch rate averaged 36.0 fish/gillnet in 1991.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.19 pounds and PSD was 17%.  Bluegill catch rate increased from 1.0 fish/trapnet in 1990 to 21.0 fish/trapnet in 1991.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.15 pounds and PSD was 12%.  This size structure is less desirable than the Bluegill size structure in Christina where PSD was 38%.  Black Bullhead are abundant.  Catch rate averaged 117.0 fish/ gillnet and 7.5 fish/trapnet.  The mean weight of fish captured in gillnets was 0.19 pounds.  Other fish species captured include Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed sunfish, and Largemouth Bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye catch rate has been consistent over the past four years.  The gillnet catch was 8 fish/net in 1992. This captured rate compares to catch rates of 7 fish/net, 8 fish/net and 7 fish/net in 1989, 1990, and 1991, respectively.  The mean weight of the eight fish captured was 2.6 pounds.  Total lengths ranged from 16.0 inches to 22.9 inches. The Largemouth Bass population was sampled with electrofishing for the first time since reclamation.  Daytime ac electrofishing yielded 50 stock-sized fish/hour. PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 72%, and 28%, respectively.  This density and size structure is indicative of a quality Largemouth Bass fishery.  Black Bullhead catch rate increased from 117 fish/net in 1991 to 175 fish/net in 1992.  Lake Christina exhibited a substantial decline in the catch rate of Black Bullheads from 1991 to 1992.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.6 pounds, which is a significant increase from 1991 when the mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.  Bluegill catch per unit effort averaged 15.5 fish/trapnet in 1992, compared to 21.0 fish/trapnet in 1991.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds and PSD was calculated at 45%.  Yellow Perch catch rates fell from 36 fish/gillnet in 1991 to 11 fish/gillnet in 1992. Concurrently, PSD increased from 17% to 45%.  The mean weight of fish captured averaged 0.2 pounds. The catch rate recorded on Lake Anka is considerably less than the catch rate of 68.9 fish/gillnet on Lake Christina.  One Northern Pike was captured in the gillnet and six were captured in the trapnets.  Pumpkinseed and Yellow Bullhead were also collected in survey nets.  The three new species that were collected from Lake Christina in 1992; Bigmouth Buffalo, Golden Shiner, and Brown Bullhead, were not found in Lake Anka.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lakes Christina and Anka were chemically rehabilitated with rotenone in the fall of 1987 for waterfowlmanagement purposes.  The main fisheries aspect of the project was to maintain a fish communitydominated by large predators to control biomass of planktivorous fish.  Lake Christina was restockedwith walleye and largemouth bass following the reclamation.  Lake Anka was not restocked, however adirect connection to Lake Christina provided for the re-establishment of fish populations.   Lake Ankais open to fishing, however there is no public access.  Boats must enter the lake through a channelfrom Lake Christina.  Annual population assessments were completed between 1988 and 1993 to monitor thedevelopment and changes in fish community structure following chemical reclamation.  A populationassessment was completed in 1997 to determine the composition of the existing fish community.  As withLake Christina, the fish community is dominated by northern pike, black bullhead, and yellow perch. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations during winter months are likely responsible for the shift incommunity structure towards more tolerant species.  Northern pike catches averaged 22.5 fish/gillnet which exceeds   the normal range of mean catch ratesfor lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics (1.1 - 8.0 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catchesaveraged 3.5 fish/net in 1993 and 1.0 fish/net in 1992.  Northern pike were not present in gillnetcatches in 1991 and 1990.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1997 was 1.8 pounds.  Fish ranged from 9.8to 27.2 inches in total length.  Yellow perch catches averaged 16.0 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catchesranged from 11.0 to 36.0 fish/net in annual surveys between 1990 and 1993.  The normal range of meancatch rates for similar lakes is 2.7 - 25.0 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1997 was 0.2pounds.  Black bullhead catches averaged 28.5 fish/gillnet and 23.0 fish/trapnet.  Gillnet catches werehighly variable in annual surveys between 1990 and 1993, ranging from 23.0/net to 175.0/net.  Trapnetcatches ranged from 4.0 to 36.2 fish/net during the same time period.  Mean weight of fish captured inboth gears was 0.2 pounds.  Common carp, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and pumpkinseed sunfish were alsocaptured in survey nets.</p>",
