                "narrative": "<p>Kenney is a small 15 acre lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet. It is located in eastern Pine County and is assigned to lake class 37. It is connected to McGowan Lake, another small lake, by a broad channel. The Kenney-McGowan Wildlife Management Area surrounds the lake but it is accessed by boat from McGowan Lake. No stocking of fish is conducted in this lake. In this August survey four trap nets were set and only one gill net was set due to the small size of the lake. The previous survey was conducted in 2003.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most numerous fish sampled in the lake. Two of them were the only fish sampled in the gill net. Trap nets caught them at a rate of 11.2 fish. This is a rate similar to the median for the lake class and was a substantial increase from the previous survey. Fish ranged from to 3.1 to 8 inches and averaged 6.6 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 3.2 fish per net which is within the interquartile range for the lake class and is also a substantial improvement over the previous survey. Fish ranged from 5.8 to 8.7 inches and averaged 7.6 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nOther gamefish sampled in trap nets included one Largemouth Bass and four Northern Pike. Two additional largemouth were also sampled by a small amount of open water angling that was conducted due to poor performance of net sampling. Additional species sampled include Bowfin, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",
