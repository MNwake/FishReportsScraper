Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 6 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 3 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 1 station.  Nearshore sampling captured 8 species of fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2013 survey to describe the fish community and better understand expectations for similar lakes.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Snaptail Lake is a 146 acre lake located 12 miles north of Bovey, MN.  Due to the small size of the lake, the fish community is much more susceptible to over-harvest.  There is a state administered public access on the south end of the lake.  The 1995 lake management plan indicates largemouth bass and northern pike as the primary species of management with black crappie and walleye as secondary species.  \t\tThe goal for the lake was to maintain a catch of at least 30 largemouth bass/hour of electrofishing; however, they were not sampled with spring electrofishing in the 2000.   A total of six fish were captured in gill nets and trap nets with fish from 5.3 to 15.2 inches.  No age structures were collected in this assessment.\t\tThe long range goal was to maintain a northern pike catch rate within the normal range of 2.0 to 8.0 fish/net.  The catch rate was 6.8 fish/net which is the highest ever recorded.  Northern pike ranged from 9.8 to 30.5 inches and averaged 20.3 inches.  Six year classes were sampled from one to six years old.  The 1998 year class respresented 44% of the catch.  After four years of growth, northern pike averaged 22.1 inches, which is better than the statewide average.\t\tBlack crappie gill-net and trap-net catch rates were 2.0 and 0.8 fish/net.  The gill-net catch was at the lake class average and the trap-net catch was low relative to other lakes.  The fish ranged from 4.7 to 9.3 inches and had an average length of 6.5 inches.  Only three year classes were sampled with fish from age 2 to age 5 represented.  Growth was below statewide averages for all ages.\t\tThe bluegill trap-net catch (55.3/net) in the 2000 assessment was higher than most lakes similar to Snaptail.  Bluegill numbers have remained above this level for the last three assessments.  Bluegill ranged from 2.6 to 7.3 inches with a mean length of 4.5 inches.  The PSD and RSD-P values were 12 and 0, respectively.   Scales were not collected during the 2000 assessment.\t\tWalleye have not been stocked since 1992.  Six walleye were captured that resulted in a gill-net catch rate of 1.0 fish/net which between the median and 3rd quartile of 0.5 and 2.0 fish/net.  All of the fish were aged from years in which stocking occurred or right next to it.  Due to the old age of the fish and aging error, it seems likely these fish were a result of stocking.\t\tOther species observed during the population assessment included bowfin, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow perch.  These species were generally low in abundance and similar to previous assessment levels.\t\tTo promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural, forestry or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these can be areas of concern, lakeshore property owners may also contribute to water quality problems.  Some examples include putting in sand beaches, removing shoreline trees and vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Proper land use practices by everyone will help insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Snaptail Lake is a 146-acre lake in Itasca County located 18 miles northeast of Grand Rapids, MN.  A small state owned public access is located on the south shore off County Highway 50.  The access has an earthen ramp with parking for two rigs.  Snaptail Lake has a maximum depth of 70 ft and 39% of the lake is 15 ft or less.  The lake has low fertility.  The water color is light brown, resulting in visibility to a depth of 13 feet in mid-summer.  The depth of water at which oxygen levels limit fish presence was 16 ft in mid-summer.  There is one outlet in the south (Snaptail Creek) that flows into Lawrence Lake.  Other area lakes with similar habitat include Issac, Mirror, Moonshine, Orange, and South Sturgeon.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 survey was the tenth survey of the fish community since 1963.  Surveys occur to monitor for changes in species composition, number, length distribution, and growth.  Gamefish species that are best suited for the lake are Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass.  No special regulations are present.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population had a moderate catch rate, with above average size distribution and growth.  Gill net catches were higher than average for the lake and lakes with similar habitat.  Higher catches are undesirable because they are usually associated with higher density populations having poor size structure and slow growth.  The sampled pike ranged from 16 to 35 inches and averaged 23 inches.  The length distribution was above average, as 61% of pike exceeded 21 inches and 11% exceeded 28 inches.  Pike that exceeded 28 inches were sampled in seven of ten surveys, including the last four.  The largest pike ever sampled was a 35-inch pike in 2020, indicating the potential exists for producing larger pike.  Pike ranged from age 2 to 11.  Growth rates were above average.  On average, pike took four years to exceed 21 inches.  The pike population may interest anglers and spearers due to its length distribution.  However, due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release pike over 26 inches and harvest up to 10 less than 22 inches to help maintain and improve size structure.  Spearers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike also. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population had above average catch rates, an average length distribution, and below average growth.  Spring nighttime electrofishing targeting bass has occurred in three years.  This method is the most appropriate way to evaluate a bass population.  The electrofishing catch rate in 2020 was similar to the two previous surveys and continued to be higher than the Grand Rapids Area average.  The sampled bass ranged from 5 to 18 inches and averaged 11 inches.  Bass over 15 inches were sampled in all three electrofishing surveys.  The largest bass ever sampled were 18-inch fish in 1993 and 2020.  Growth was below average.  Aged bass were 1 to 10 years old.  Recruitment appeared relatively consistent, as aged fish were from nine different year classes.  Bass took five years to exceed 12 inches.  Due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release bass exceeding 15 inches to help maintain or improve size structure.     <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie population had an average catch rate, with below average length distribution and growth.  Gill net catches were average for the lake, but lower than lakes with similar habitat.  The sampled crappie ranged from 4 to 7 inches and averaged 6 inches.  Length distribution was below average, as 10% of crappie exceeded 6 inches and 0% exceeded 8 inches.  Ten-inch fish were only sampled in two surveys, and the largest fish sampled was a 10.5-inch fish in 2010.  Aged crappie were 2 to 3 years old.  Crappie were aged the past four surveys, and growth rates have been consistently below average.  On average, crappie took five years to exceed eight inches.  The below average length distribution will likely not interest anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population has had above average catch rates, with below average length distribution and growth.  Trap nets were not used in 2020, which are the most appropriate sampling method.  Average trap net catches from previous surveys were higher than lakes with similar habitat.  However, higher catches are undesirable because they are usually associated with higher density populations having poor size structure and slow growth.    Only four Bluegill over 8 inches have ever been sampled.  Growth was assessed in two surveys and was below average.  Bluegill took seven years to exceed six inches.  The Bluegill population consistently has had below average size distribution and will likely not interest anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population had an average catch rate and length distribution, with below average growth.  Gill net catches were similar to average for the lake and for lakes with similar habitat.  Although Walleye were stocked in 13 years, catch rates have never exceeded 1.0/net.  Statewide Walleye stocking guidelines recommend discontinuing stocking if it fails to produce a viable fishery supporting a catch rate of 2.0/gill net.  Although Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2015 by the lake association, only one of the four fish sampled in 2020 was from that year class. This demonstrates that low levels of natural reproduction continue to occur.  Growth continued to be below average.  Lower Yellow Perch and Tullibee numbers can limit the number of Walleye the lake supports.  Angler expectations should be low, as the lake may only provide incidental Walleye catches.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population had a low catch rate and below average length distribution.  Gill net catches have declined in each of the past four surveys.  Declining perch numbers are consistent with statewide trends that have occurred since the 1970s.  Lower perch numbers limit the number of gamefish the lake can support.  Sampled perch ranged from 5 to 7 inches, with an average of 6.4 inches.  Eight inch perch have never been sampled.  Therefore, perch are more important as prey for gamefish and of little interest to anglers.  Age and growth has not been evaluated.   <br> \n <br> \nNo Tullibee (Cisco) were sampled the past four consecutive surveys, after being sampled in five of the initial six surveys.  Smaller Tullibee can provide an important prey source for larger gamefish and predation relief to the perch population.  No other species were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help slow the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body. <br> \n</p>",

The largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are abundant but grow slowly.  Northern pike are not abundant but grow well and have a large average size.  Walleye are stocked but do not appear to survive well; however, walleye are caught occasionally and could be considered a bonus fish. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Background <br> \n <br> \nSnaptail Lake is located 12 miles north of Bovey, Minnesota in the Mississippi River watershed.  Snaptail Lake has a total surface area of 146 acres and a maximum depth of 70 ft.  The lake is moderately clear with Secchi disk transparency from 8.0 to 13.0 ft.  The lake has soft water with low phosphorus fertility.  Lakes with soft water and low phosphorus fertility typically produce limited fisheries characterized by slow growing fish.  The lake has one inlet and one outlet, both are intermittent.  The lake supports a diverse aquatic plant community that provides valuable habitat for fish and wildlife.  There is considerable lakeshore development on Snaptail Lake and much of the available shoreline has been developed.  There is a state owned public access on the south shore.  <br> \n <br> \nThe fisheries lake management plan (LMP) for Snaptail Lake was last revised in 2002.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and black crappie were the primary management species identified in the plan.  The long range goals included  maintaining the largemouth bass night electro-fishing catch rate at >30 per hour with 40% exceeding 12 inches, maintaining the northern pike gill-net catch rate at 5 per net with 50% exceeding 21 inches and maintaining the black crappie gill-net catch rate at 2 per net.   <br> \n <br> \nAssessment Results <br> \n <br> \nA lake population assessment of Snaptail Lake was conducted in the summer of 2010.  Night-time boat electrofishing was conducted for largemouth bass in late May.  Test netting consisting of 6 gill net and 9 trap net sets was conducted in mid June.  Snaptail Lake was also included in near shore IBI sampling conducted in June and August. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured at a rate of 86 per hour during night electrofishing, exceeding the long range catch goal of the LMP.  The catch rate was high compared to other lakes in the area.  Size structure was moderate as lengths ranged from 4.3 to 16.9 inches with a mean length of 11.5 inches.  Few fish exceeded the angler preferred size of 15 inches, however.  Seven year classes were identified and recruitment appeared somewhat inconsistent.  Growth was slow and individuals typically exceeded 12 inches in 6 years.  The population was dominated by relatively old individuals as the average bass was 5.5 years old and 71% of the sampled fish were age-5 or older.  A high proportion of older fish may suggest low mortality of larger individuals, high recruitment in the past, or poor recruitment in recent years.  Young of the year (YOY) largemouth bass were the most common fish captured in the near shore IBI sampling suggesting good natural reproduction in 2010.  Good angling opportunities likely exist for small bass given the relative abundance and size structure.  The lack of individuals exceeding 15 inches may limit the popularity of the fishery.  Anglers should consider harvesting bass less than 13 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike was the most common fish in the gill net sample and the catch rate was near the LMP long range goal.  The catch rate was average compared to similar lakes, and average compared to past assessments on Snaptail Lake.  Lengths ranged from 17.3 to 31.9 inches and averaged 23.1 inches.  Few fish exceeded 28 inches.  Growth was near the statewide average with individuals exceeding 21 inches in 4 years and 28 inches in seven years.  Most pike were relatively young, averaging 2.7 years of age.  Only 12% of the sample exceeded age 5.  Low numbers of older individuals are often associated with high mortality of larger, older fish and may indicate relatively high angler harvest of quality sized fish.  Snaptail Lake has the potential to produce more large pike and quality size structures have been documented in some past assessments.  Anglers should be encouraged to release pike exceeding 24 inches to help improve the size structure. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie was the second most common species in the gill net sample and the catch rate was near the long range goal of the LMP.  Both gill net and trap net catch rates were within the expected range when compared to similar lakes and near average for Snaptail Lake.  It should be noted that similar lakes do not typically support large crappie populations.  Gill net caught crappie lengths ranged from 4.2 to 10.7 inches with an average length of 7.2 inches.  Trap net caught crappie lengths ranged from 6.8 to 10.1 inches with an average length of 8.5 inches.  Approximately 10% of the sampled crappie exceeded 10 inches.  Five year classes were present and recruitment appeared inconsistent as the 2006 year class comprised nearly half of the total sample.  Inconsistent recruitment of black crappie is a common life history trait for many populations, often resulting in \"boom and bust\" angling cycles.  Growth was relatively slow as individuals typically exceeded 8 inches by age 5.  The popularity of the crappie fishery may be somewhat limited by slow growth, relatively low abundance, and small average size. <br> \n <br> \nLakes with similar characteristics to Snaptial typically produce high density bluegill populations characterized by slow growth and undesirable size structures.  Bluegill was the most common species in the 2010 trap net sample and was typical for similar lakes.  Snaptail Lake has a history of very high bluegill catches and the 2010 catch was below average for the lake.  Size structure was undesirable as bluegill lengths ranged from 3.0 to 8.2 inches with a mean length of 5.2 inches.  Only 34% of the sampled individuals exceeded 6 inches.  Age analysis identified 8 year classes and recruitment appeared relatively consistent.  Growth was average for the lake class with individuals exceeding 6 inches in 7 years.  Good angling opportunities likely exist for high catches of small bluegill, but the lack of individuals exceeding 6 inches may limit the popularity of the fishery.  Although angler interest may be limited, bluegill appears to be an important prey species in Snaptail Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLakes with similar characteristics to Snaptial do not typically produce high walleye populations and Snaptail Lake is no exception.   Walleye were captured at a rate of 0.5 per gill net in 2010, near the Snaptail Lake average.  Walleye were generally large, ranging from 18.3 to 23.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nA shifting prey base may be a limiting factor for gamefish production in Snaptail Lake.  Prior to 1988, the lake supported a relatively robust population of tullibee.  Tullibee had not been sampled since that time.  Although the cause of the apparent tullibee extirpation is not clear, the decline coincided with a period of water quality issues that have since been addressed.  Yellow perch are often an important prey species for northern pike and walleye.  Perch catches have been extremely variable but have declined in the past 4 assessments. The catch rate in 2010 was well below the lake average.  Other prey species such as golden shiners and white sucker were captured in relatively low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nSnaptail Lake supports a diverse fish community.  Other species sampled included:  bowfin, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, yellow bullhead, Johnny darter, blackchin shiner, and bluntnose minnow.   <br> \n <br> \nPast assessments identified two exotic invasive species in Snaptail Lake.  Purple loosestrife is a wetland plant from Europe and Asia that was introduced into the east coast of North America in the 1800s. Purple loosestrife invades marshes and lakeshores, replacing cattails and other wetland plants. The plant can form dense, impenetrable stands which are unsuitable as cover, food, or nesting sites for a wide range of native wetland animals.  The Chinese mystery snail is native to Asia. It was brought to California in 1892 as a food source and found in Massachusetts in 1915, likely from an aquarium release. Chinese mystery snails can form dense aggregations and disrupt native populations.  Snail die off are often considered a nuisance by landowners as dead snails litter the lakeshore.  Chinese mystery snails were noted to be very abundant in the 2010 survey.  Anglers and boater are reminded to remove any plant material from their boat or trailer prior to leaving the lake.  All live wells and bilges must be drained of water.  It is unlawful to transport aquatic plants or water from Minnesota lakes and streams. <br> \n <br> \nThe protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
