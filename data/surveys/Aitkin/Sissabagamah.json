                "narrative": "<p>Sissabagamah Lake is located approximately five miles east of the City of Aitkin. There is a state owned public access with a concrete log ramp on the north shore of the lake.  Numerous emergent plant beds and relatively undeveloped shorelines provide good habitat for fish and wildlife and a picturesque backdrop for lake users.  Anglers will find opportunities to catch walleye, northern pike and largemouth bass as well as black crappie and bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a special regulation that protects northern pike from 20-30\", which has been in effect since 1991. Results from previous surveys have indicated some improvement in the size structure of the pike population.  While prior to the regulation there was only 1 pike over 30\" sampled in three surveys, large pike have been sampled in each survey since 1994, and the number of fish over 24\" appears to be about double the 1980-1989 average.  Sizes from the 2014 assessment averaged about 18\" and 1.3 pounds, with fish up to 35\" sampled and 13% of the catch within the protected range.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked at a variety of sizes and frequencies over the last century and the current strategy calls for annual fall fingerling stocking. The catch rate of 1.0 per gill net is within the expected range for this type of lake and similar to nine previous assessments of this lake.  Sizes averaged 19\" and 2.5 pounds, with fish up to about 25\" sampled.  <br> \nLargemouth bass continue to be captured in high numbers in survey gill nets compared to similar lakes.  Size is fairly good with an average of 11.8\" and 1.0 pound, with 38% greater than 12\". <br> \n <br> \nPanfish anglers should find quality opportunities for black crappie and bluegill.  The crappie population has rebounded since a historic low catch in 2009, and is currently on the high end of the expected range for this type of lake. Several year classes were identified, with a strong 2012 year class accounting for over half the catch.  Sizes averaged 7.6\", with fish up to 13\" observed. Results of the 2014 assessment indicate the current bluegill population also has favorable characteristics.  Bluegill abundance remained on the low end of the expected range for this type of lake.  Size was good and averaged 7\", with 16% greater than 8\". <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sissabagamah Lake is located in west central Aitkin County approximately five miles east of the City of Aitkin. The lake is 365 acres in size and has a maximum depth of 37 feet. The water is brownish in color with a secchi disc reading of 6.5 feet. Most of the shoreline is undeveloped and has extensive beds of emergent vegetation. The public access is located on the north side of the lake approximately three-fourths of a mile south of Highway 47. Anglers fishing Sissabagamah have several species to fish for including northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, bluegill and black crappie.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 1991, Sissabagamah was selected for an experimental northern pike regulation. The regulation was initially in effect until March 1, 2007 and was designed to enhance the size structure of the northern pike population by requiring anglers to immediately release all northern pike between 20 and 30 inches. Following an analysis of the regulation and a public comment period it was decided to keep the regulation as it was showing signs of success.  After an examination of gill net length frequency distributions for northern pike from surveys 1989, 1994, 1999, 2004 and now in 2009, it appears that the number of pike over 24 inches per net has increased in the last 20 years.  Anglers must release all pike between 20 - 30 inches, the bag limit is 3, and 1 over 30 inches is allowed in possession. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population in Sissabagamah is maintained through fingerling stocking and has remained fairly stable for the last 20 years. Gillnet catches in 2009 were within the normal range for this lake class at 2.3 per net. There were five year classes represented in the population with an average size of 16.6 inches.  The largest walleye in the sample was just over 21 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNet catches for the largemouth bass population in Sissabagamah are above average for this type of lake and have been so since 1999. The average bass sampled was 13.5 inches long, with individuals approaching 19 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe abundance of bluegills is on the low end for this lake type at 8.2 per net, which could have a positive effect on growth rates and the size structure of the population.  There was only one bluegill in the survey longer than 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe survey, in 2009, revealed a statistically significant decrease in black crappie numbers. This is the second survey in a row this has been documented and it appears a decline has been occurring over the last 10 years.  Black crappie populations tend to be cyclic in nature and are often dominated by a single year class of fish.  For a time it looked like the 2001 year class was at least of moderate strength; however, either the year class did not materialize due to environmental factors or they were harvested by anglers as no individuals from the 2001 year class were documented in 2009.  It's likely that when spawning conditions are favorable again the crappie population will rebuild. <br> \n</p>",

This survey was completed in addition to the standard population assessment conducted the week of August 18, 2014.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but three sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 50-foot seine was used at 1 station, a 15-foot seine was used at 4 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at five sites.  Nearshore sampling captured a few intolerant fish species including blackchin shiner, Iowa darter, and rock bass.  <br> \n <br> \nSissabagamah Lake falls within lake class 29 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 4 lakes for evaluating IBI data.  IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 38 (90% CI 30-46) and the potential exceptional quality level is set at 59.  The IBI score calculated from this survey, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2014 population assessment was 39. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike and Yellow Bullhead are above the third regional quartile in abundance. The catch indices for Bowfin, White Sucker, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie are between the first and third regional quartiles. The catch indices for Brown Bullhead, Rock Bass, Yellow Perch and Walleye are below the first regional quartiles. The indices for Yellow Bullhead and Black Crappie are above the third area quartile. The catch indices for Bowfin, Northern Pike, White Sucker, Brown Bullhead, Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill and Largemouth Bass are between the first and third area quartiles. The indices for Yellow Perch and Walleye are below the first area quartile. Northern Pike ranged from two to seven years of age. Age two age three fish, and age four were the most abundant age classes in the sample. Growth increments for all ages were within the normal growth range for fish found in Minnesota. Pumpkinseed ranged from three to six years of age. Forty-six percent of the sample was age four and thirty-five percent were age three. Growth increments for all ages were within the normal range for fish found in Minnesota. Bluegill ranged from two to seven years of age. Thirty-five percent of the sampled aged were age three, thirty-three percent were age four and twenty percent were age five. Growth the second increment was thirty percent slower than normal for Minnesota bluegills. All other growth increments were within the normal growth range for Minnesota Bluegills. Largemouth Bass ranged from two to five years of age. Fifty percent were age three and twenty-five percent were age four. Growth increments for the second and third years were forty percent faster than normal. Increments for the other years were normal for Minnesota. Black Crappie ranged from two to seven years of age. Twenty-two percent were age three. Twenty-nine percent were age four and twenty-seven percent were age five. Growth increments for all ages were within the norm found for Minnesota fish. Northern Pike have not changed significantly in abundance since 1980. The range of length frequencies changed as far as the minimum lengths seen in the samples. The abundance of fish over 25 inches in length in the samples, 4 of 60 fish in 1980 and 4 of 50 fish in 1986 has not changed the main changes between the 1980 and 1986 has not changed. The main changes between the 1980 and 1986 samples is length distributions seen between 12.0 and 23.9 inches. The mean length for fish less than 23.9 inches in the samples has decreased from 18.3 inches in 1980 to 16.8 inches in 1986. This change in mean length is the results of two factors the downward shift of the most abundant length groups from 18 and 19 inches in 1980 to 16 and 17 inches in 1986 and there were no fish sampled from 12.0 to 13.9 inches in 1980 while in 1986 ten percent of the sample was within this length group. Pumpkinseeds abundance indices did not change since 1980. The abundance of fish length groups seen in the sample has changed since 1980 with 11 of 62 fish less than 4.5 inches in 1986 and 1 of 17 in 1980. The maximum length group seen in both samples was 7.0 to 7.4 inches. The mean length decreased from 5.8 inches in 1980 to 5.6 inches in 1986, a decrease of four percent. The apparent increase in abundance of Bluegill from 1980 to 1986 may not be significant. The length groups seen in the samples increased with fourteen percent of the sample greater than 6.9 inches in 1986. In 1980 there were no bluegill greater than 6.9 inches captured. The mean length increased from 5.3 inches in 1980 to 5.7 inches in 1986. Largemouth Bass have not changed in abundance or in range of length groups seen since 1980 Black Crappie have not changed in abundance since 1980. The length groups observed in the two samples is basically the same but the mean length has increased from 7.4 inches in 1980 to 8.3 in 1986, a result of a shift in the abundance of fish seen within length groups. In 1980 twenty three percent of the fish were less than 6.5 in. And eighteen percent of the fish were greater than 8.4 inches. In 1986 only three percent of the fish were less than 6.5 inches while forty-nine percent were greater than 8.4 inches. The fish between 6.5 and 8.4 inches made up approximately fifty percent of each sample. Yellow Perch showed a significant decrease from 2.8 per gillnet in 1980 to 0.2 per gillnet in 1986. The length groups seen in 1986 indicate the possibility of the Yellow Perch population having a few senile individuals with limited recruitment success because of heavy predation by a large Northern Pike population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sissabagamah Lake is located in west central Aitkin County approximately five miles east of the town of Aitkin.  The lake is 365 acres in size and has a maximum depth of 37 feet. The water is brownish in color with a Secchi Disc reading of 6.5 feet.  Most of the shoreline is undeveloped and has extensive beds of emergent vegetation. The public access is located on the north side of the lake approximately three-fourths of a mile south of Highway 47.   Anglers fishing Sissabagamah have several species to fish for including northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, bluegill and black crappie.  In 1991 Sissabagamah was selected for an experimental regulation study.  The regulation will be in effect until March 1, 2007 and was designed to enhance the size structure of the northern pike population by requiring anglers to immediately release all northern pike between 20 and 30 inches.  Following examination of the gill net length frequency distribution for northern pike from the 1989, 1994, 1999, and 2004 surveys, it appears that the regulation may be working as designed.  In 1989 (pre regulation) northern pike sampled ranged up to 24 inches in length with only about 5 percent of the northern pike sampled greater than 20 inches in length. During the regulation period population assessments that were conducted in 1994, 1999, and 2004 showed that northern pike ranged up to 38 inches in length and 20 to 35 percent of the fish sampled were greater than 20 inches in length.Walleye abundance is within the normal range for this lake class.  Anglers fishing for walleye should find some decent fishing with three good year classes present.  Fish from the 2001-year class are 15 to 16 inches in length and fish from the 2000-year class are 17 to 18 inches in length. Walleye from the 1998-year class are now over 20 inches in length.The largemouth bass population in Sissabagamah appears sound. The average bass sampled was over 12 inches long, with one greater than 18 inches. Most of the bass were sampled in gill nets, which would indicate that at this time of the year bass inhabit deeper water. Panfish anglers have good populations of bluegill and black crappie to fish for.  Bluegill sampled in this survey averaged about six inches in length but several fish up to almost 8 inches were caught.  As late as the 1970'some sampled bluegill were greater than 8 inches in length, but have decreased in average and maximum size since then.  However, the average size in the 2004 survey increased slightly.  Since 1999 the bluegill population has been decreasing in abundance, which could have a positive effect on growth rates and the size structure of the population. Black crappie were also found in good numbers with several fish in the three-quarter pound size range.  These 11 to 12 inch fish are from the strong 1998 year class.  This year class is on its way out as the dominant year class, but a strong 2001 year class will soon take their place as the dominant year class in the fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sissabagamah Lake is located about five miles east of Aitkin just south of Highway. 47.  The lake totals 365 acres and is structurally diverse.  A shallow bay, islands of rush, and wooded shorelines provide excellent habitat for aquatic life as well as places for anglers to fish.  Several species of interest to anglers include walleye, northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill.       In 1991 Sissabagamah Lake was selected for an experimental regulation to enhance the sizes of northern pike.  The experimental regulation, which is in effect until March 1, 2007, requires anglers to immediately release northern pike between 20 and 30 inches.  The regulation may help maintain larger pike in the fish community, provided compliance with regulation is good.  Larger northern pike are susceptible to angling and often absent.  Large pike are beneficial to a lake by controlling the abundance of smaller pike.  In small lakes northern pike can reproduce beyond the ability of the prey-base to support good growth, leading to a population of stunted small pike sometimes referred to as hammer handles.  A desirable outcome of the experimental regulation would be a pike population in balance with the lakes prey base and increased catch rates of larger northern pike.       The survey in 1999 was conducted to monitor trends in the fish community prior to the final evaluation in 2007.  The abundance of northern pike was within the normal range for this lake.  Fishing for pike should be comparable to previous years as their numbers have remained stable.  The average northern pike was 17.2 inches long and weighed about one pound.  About 14% of the northern pike sampled were within the protected slot.  The largest fish sampled measured 35.8 inches long.  Walleye abundance was also about average for this lake type.  All walleyes sampled were from years fingerlings or yearlings were stocked.  Over half of the walleyes were from the 1993 and 1994 year-classes and these fish averaged 21 inches long.  Net catches also indicated a 1998 year-class that should provide anglers good fishing in the next couple of years.  A preferred prey species of northern pike and walleyes is yellow perch.  Their abundance was low and averaged less than one fish per gill net when catches in similar lakes average around eight fish.  A positive trend for anglers of all ages was an increase in both black crappie and sunfish abundance from the previous survey.  The increased abundance of black crappies was due to two strong year-classes in 1996 and 1997.  Black crappies were averaging about 8 inches with fish ranging in size from 4.2 to 11.75 inches long.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were averaging over 5.5 inches in length.  Bluegills surviving to age four and older were growing at average and above rates.  Though not overly abundant, a portion of the panfish were of respectable size measuring between seven and eight inches.  Largemouth bass abundance appears strong with recruitment occurring most years.  Fish ranged in size from 6.5 to 16.75 inches long.  Other species sampled from the fish community were bowfin, white sucker, black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and rock bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A gill net only assessment targeting walleye was conducted the week of 8/28/2017 to evaluate the current walleye stocking strategy that began in 2011, and calls for stocking walleye fingerlings annually at a rate of 1.0 pound per littoral acre for a total of 220 pounds. The walleye gill net catch rate in 2017(1.4/gill net) was similar to a 2014 evaluation (1.0/gill net) and below the goal for the lake of 3/gill net. The catch rate falls within the historic range for this lake (0.3-3.0/gill net) and within the interquartile range for lake class 29 (0.5-3.0/gill net). Sizes averaged 20 inches and 2.8 pounds, with fish up to 22.5 inches sampled.  Ages ranged from 3-13 years old, with the 2012 and 2014 years classes the most abundant. Seven year classes were represented satisfying the management requirement of four.  Annual walleye fingerling stocking of 220 total pounds (target rate of 1 pound/littoral acre) began in 2011. This was the second opportunity to evaluate the strategy and thus far it does not seem to be increasing walleye numbers. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to assessing the walleye population, this assessment allowed a look at northern pike, which have been managed with a 20-30 inch protected slot size regulation since 1991.  This survey did not add any different results to be considered as northern pike catch rates were similar to previous regulation evaluations with a gill net catch rate of 6.4/net and 10% over 24 inches long.  While there appeared to have been some subtle improvements to size structure since the regulation was implemented, it was apparent that the new zone regulations could benefit the fishery equally well or better and so beginning in spring of 2018 the 20-30 inch protection was removed in favor of the new central zone regulation - 10 fish limit, 22-26 inch protected slot, with no more than 2 over 26 inches allowed in possession.  This regulation will allow for greater harvest opportunities for anglers and spearers, while still protecting a large portion of medium sized pike. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sissabagamah Lake is located approximately five miles east of the City of Aitkin. There is a state owned public access with a concrete log ramp on the north shore of the lake. Numerous emergent plant beds and relatively undeveloped shorelines provide good habitat for fish and wildlife and a picturesque backdrop for lake users. Anglers will find opportunities to catch Walleye, Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass, as well as Black Crappie and Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch rate (5.9/gill net) decreased compared to 2017 but remained similar to historic catches of this lake. Northern Pike were managed with a 20-30 inch protected slot size regulation from 1991-2017. While there appeared to have been some subtle improvements to size structure during the regulation period, it was apparent that the new zone regulations could benefit the fishery equally well or better and so beginning in spring of 2018 the 20-30 inch protection was removed in favor of the new central zone regulation - 10 fish limit, 22-26 inch protected slot, with no more than 2 over 26 inches allowed in possession. This regulation will allow for greater harvest opportunities for anglers and spearers, while still protecting a large portion of medium sized pike. Sizes from gill nets averaged 18.2\" and 1.0 pounds, with only 4% greater than 24\" and one individual over 30\".  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked at a variety of sizes and frequencies over the last century and the current strategy calls for annual fall fingerling stocking. The catch rate of 1.6 per gill net is within the expected range for this type of lake and similar to the last several surveys of this lake. Sizes averaged 19.3\" and 2.6 pounds, with fish up to about 25\" sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass continue to be captured in high numbers in survey gill nets compared to similar lakes. Size is fairly good with an average of 12.0\" and 1.0 pound, with 33% greater than 12\". <br> \n <br> \nPanfish anglers should find quality opportunities for Black Crappie and Bluegill. The crappie population has rebounded and is currently on the high end of the expected range for this type of lake. A couple of stronger year classes were identified, which will contribute to the fishery in the next few years. Sizes averaged 9.4\", with fish up to 13\" observed. Results of the 2019 assessment indicate the current Bluegill population also has favorable characteristics. Bluegill abundance remained on the low end of the expected range for this type of lake. Size was reasonable and averaged 6.4\", with 7% greater than 8\". <br> \n</p>",
