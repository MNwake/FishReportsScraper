The lake is 249 acres in size of which 152 acres is littoral.  The lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet and has about 3 miles of shoreline.  There is a U.S. Forest Service carry-in access in the northeast corner. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate was near the expected range for lakes similar to Big Dick and similar to the previous assessment.  A moderate pike fishery exists with an average length of almost 24 inches being sampled in gill nets.  Lengths ranged from 17 to 32 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average except ages 3-5, which exceeded it.  Northern pike averaged 24 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch rate for black crappie was above the expected range, similar to the previous assessment.  Black crappie were sampled in trap nets at a rate within the lake class expected range.  Size structure appears good indicating a quality fishery exists.  Lengths ranged from 4.4-12.4 inches with an average length of 8.6 inches in the gill net sample.  Growth was slow early, but was near the statewide average by age 3.  Black crappie averaged over 10 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled at a rate exceeding the lake class expected range, while the trap net catch rate was within the expected range.  Size structure appears moderate with a gill net average length of almost 14 inches.  Lengths ranged from 9.6-18.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant fish sampled in trap nets, exceeding the expected range.  Size structure was poor, dominated by fish less than eight inches (98%).  Lengths ranged from 3.5-8.4 inches with an average length of 6.9 inches.  Growth was similar to the average for lake class 29. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were the most abundant fish sampled in gill nets, within the expected range.  Size structure was poor with the longest fish sampled being 9.5 inches.  Of the 96 perch sampled in gill nets, 95% were less than eight inches, and of little interest to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",
