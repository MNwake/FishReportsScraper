                "narrative": "<p>     North Turtle Lake is a 1,484-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County immediately northeast of Underwood, MN.  North Turtle Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no navigable inlets or outlets.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 19 feet; however, 98% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 5.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.3 to 12.1 feet.  The water clarity of North Turtle Lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton/algae blooms.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of North Turtle Lake remains undeveloped.  A state owned public water access was developed along the north shoreline in 2011.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and muck.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the majority of the shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     North Turtle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     A high-density Northern Pike population exists.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 15.9 to 30.4 inches with an average length and weight of 23.4 inches and 3.0 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 24.0 inches at four years of age. <br> \n      Seven percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.4 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Data from a recent spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Bass reproduction is also consistently good.   Bass ranged in length from 4.8 to 19.5 inches with an average length and weight of 15.6 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 14.3 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     A spring trapnetting assessment was conducted to analyze the Black Crappie population.  A high-density Black Crappie population is present.   Age data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.   Thirty-five percent of the crappies were 10.0 incher or greater in length.  The 2013 year class is strong and should provide good crappie angling in the future.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 11.2 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Special harvest regulations for Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie were implemented in 2006 and modified in 2016 after public comment.  All bass 14.0 inches and larger must be immediately released with the exception of one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  The Black Crappie regulation is a 10.0-inch minimum length limit.  These regulations were implemented in an attempt to maintain or improve the size structures of these species. <br> \n        Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in North Turtle Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     North Turtle Lake is a 1,484-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County located immediately northeast of Underwood, MN.  North Turtle Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no navigable inlets or outlets.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 19 feet; however, 98% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 2.7 to 12.1 feet.     <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of North Turtle Lake remains undeveloped.  A state owned public water access was developed along the north shoreline in 2011.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and muck.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the majority of the shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     A spring electrofishing survey was conducted to analyze the Largemouth Bass population.  Catch data indicate that North Turtle Lake has a moderate-density Largemouth Bass population.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.9 to 18.1 inches with an average length and weight of 13.2 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 15.3 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     A special harvest regulation for Largemouth Bass was implemented in 2006 and modified in 2016 after data analysis and public comment.  All bass 14.0 inches and larger must be immediately released with the exception of one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  This regulation was implemented in an attempt to maintain or improve the size structure of the bass population.  A long-term evaluation of the Largemouth Bass population indicates that the regulation has been successful. <br> \n    Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in North Turtle Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  <br> \n     North Turtle Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.   <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike reproduction appears excellent, as the sample was primarily composed of age classes 2+ through 5+.  <br> \n     Black bullheads are extremely abundant at 89.3 per gill net lift and 117.6 per trap net lift. Average size of black bullheads is small.  Average size of yellow bullhead was also small. Commercial harvest of bullheads has occurred in the past and should be encouraged.  <br> \n     Only one bluegill and five yellow perch were sampled in the test nets. <br> \n     Black crappie abundance is extremely high 16.3 per gill net lift and 28.0 per trap net lift. Reproduction appears excellent, as ages ranged from 1+ through 6+. Using expanded age data, it appears that 87% of the black crappie measured were aged 2+ through 4+.  Growth rates of black crappie do not appear as rapid as might be expected in a lake of this type.  <br> \n     No largemouth bass were sampled in test nets, but 17 young-of-the-year were sampled while seining. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Turtle Lake is a 1,484-acre eutrophic lake located in central Otter Tail County immediately northeast of Underwood, MN.  North Turtle Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no navigable inlets or outlets.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 19 feet; however, 98% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 9.6 feet.  The water clarity of North Turtle Lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton/algae blooms.  North Turtle Lake is included in lake class 41 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.     The majority of the shoreline of North Turtle Lake remains undeveloped.  The 1989 lake survey referenced only thirteen homes and cottages.  There is no public water access located on North Turtle Lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and muck.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the majority of the shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.       North Turtle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in North Turtle Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     A high-density northern pike population exists in North Turtle Lake.  The northern pike test-net catch rate was substantially higher than the upper limit of the normal range for class 41 lakes.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 15.3 to 33.5 inches with an average length and weight of 22.9 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 23.5 inches at five years of age.     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that North Turtle Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 6.7 to 20.8 inches with an average length and weight of 14.0 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 13.0 inches at four years of age.      Catch data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicated that black crappie are abundant in North Turtle Lake.  Crappies ranged in length from 8.4 to 14.1 inches with an average length and weight of 10.7 inches and 0.7 pound.  Seventy-seven percent of the crappies were at least 10.0 inches in length.  Black crappie attain an average length of 9.7 inches at five years of age.     The bluegill test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range.  The 1996 and 1997 year classes are strong and should provide good bluegill angling for several years.  Forty-three percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at five years of age.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in North Turtle Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Turtle Lake is a 1,484-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County immediately northeast of Underwood, MN.  North Turtle Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no navigable inlets or outlets.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 19 feet; however, 98% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading in this assessment was 12.1 feet.  The secchi disk reading during the 2001 assessment was 9.6 feet.  The water clarity of North Turtle Lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton/algae blooms.  North Turtle Lake is included in class 41 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.     The majority of the shoreline of North Turtle Lake remains undeveloped.  The 1989 lake survey referenced only thirteen homes and cottages.  There is no public water access located on North Turtle Lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and muck.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the majority of the shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.       North Turtle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in North Turtle Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     A high-density northern pike population exists in North Turtle Lake.  The northern pike test-net catch rate was substantially higher than the upper limit of the normal range for class 41 lakes.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 8.8 to 38.3 inches with an average length and weight of 21.9 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 22.4 inches at five years of age.     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that North Turtle Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 8.2 to 20.0 inches with an average length and weight of 14.8 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 13.7 inches at five years of age.      Catch data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicated that black crappie are abundant in North Turtle Lake.  Crappies ranged in length from 8.1 to 12.2 inches with an average length and weight of 10.3 inches and 0.7 pound.  Seventy percent of the crappies were at least 10.0 inches in length.  Black crappie attain an average length of 9.3 inches at five years of age.     The bluegill test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range.  Bluegill size structure is excellent; sixty-seven percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.8 inches at six years of age.     Size regulations for largemouth bass and black crappie will be implemented in 2006.  All bass 12.0 inches and larger must be immediately released with the exception of one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  The black crappie regulation is a 10.0 in minimum length limit.    Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in North Turtle Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     North Turtle Lake is a 1,484-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County immediately northeast of Underwood, MN.  North Turtle Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no navigable inlets or outlets.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 19 feet; however, 98% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2012 assessment was 6.3 feet.  The water clarity of North Turtle Lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton/algae blooms.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of North Turtle Lake remains undeveloped.  A state owned public water access was developed along the north shoreline in 2011.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and muck.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the majority of the shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     North Turtle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     A high-density northern pike population has historically existed.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 19.1 to 32.2 inches with an average length and weight of 25.3 inches and 3.8 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 23.6 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that a balanced largemouth bass population is present.  Bass ranged in length from 13.8 to 19.6 inches with an average length and weight of 16.9 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 14.9 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     Black crappies in a spring trapnetting assessment ranged in length from 3.5 to 14.1 inches with an average length and weight of 9.2 inches and 0.7 pounds.  Age data from the lake survey indicate that the 2010 and 2011 year classes are strong and should provide consistently good crappie angling in the future.  Black crappies attain an average length of 9.7 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Eighteen percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.5 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Experimental regulations for largemouth bass and black crappie were implemented in 2006.  All bass 12.0 inches and larger must be immediately released with the exception of one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  The black crappie regulation is a 10.0-inch minimum length limit.  These regulations were implemented in an attempt to maintain or improve the size structures of these species and will remain in effect through 2016. <br> \n    Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in North Turtle Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     North Turtle Lake is a 1,484-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County located immediately northeast of Underwood, MN.  North Turtle Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no navigable inlets or outlets.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 19 feet; however, 98% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2020 survey was 2.7 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.0 to 12.1 feet.  The water clarity of North Turtle Lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton/algae blooms.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of North Turtle Lake remains undeveloped.  A state owned public water access was developed along the north shoreline in 2011.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and muck.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the majority of the shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically been low.  Walleyes ranged in length from 21.7 to 27.6 inches with an average length and weight of 25.1 inches and 6.1 pounds. <br> \n     A moderate to high density Northern Pike population exists.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 17.7 to 30.2 inches with an average length and weight of 24.0 inches and 3.4 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 24.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Age and catch data also indicate that the 2019 year class of Black Crappie is very strong.  The 2019 year class should provide excellent crappie fishing in the future. <br> \n     Special harvest regulations for Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie were implemented in 2006 and modified in 2016 after public comment.  All Largemouth Bass 14.0 inches and larger must be immediately released with the exception of one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  The Black Crappie regulation is a 10.0-inch minimum length limit.  These regulations were implemented in an attempt to maintain or improve the size structures of these species. <br> \n    Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in North Turtle Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  <br> \n     North Turtle Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.   <br> \n</p>",
