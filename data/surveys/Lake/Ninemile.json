Walleye fingerlings had been stocked in alternate years, however it appears natural reproduction may be maintaining much of this population. Nearly 80% of the aged sample corresponds with unstocked years. Age III fish were naturally produced and comprised 54% of the catch.     The Northern Pike gillnet catch decreased from an all time high in 1988 (7/lift) to the lowest catch ever in 1991 (1.7/lift). Northern Pike appear to be at their lowest known levels.      Yellow Perch were sampled at record low levels, probably as result of the increasing Walleye and White Sucker populations.</p>",

The Bluegill was added to the species list in 1955. Along with an increase in number the Walleye have decreased in average size (slower growth), and Yellow Perch have increased in size and are faster growing.     During the past year (1955), a creel census was conducted on Ninemile Lake. Fishing success was considered as \"good\" (0.13 fish per man hour) in comparison with the other censused Walleye lakes. The average length of these fish was 15.3\", about 1.2 lbs in weight. The 1951 year-class composed 22.4% of the entire Walleye catch, and the 1949 year-class composed 2.1% of the anglers total harvest. The test net catches were composed of 14% and 0% for the 1951 and 1949 year-classes respectively. It was during those years (1949 and 1951) that no Walleye were stocked in Ninemile Lake.     Ninemile Lake is a soft-water lake of low fertility. It is primarily a Walleye lake with some Northern Pike and panfish. Spawning habitat is good for Walleye, but limited for the other two species.      Strong year-classes of Walleye during the years of no stocking shows natural reproduction is adequate at the present to maintain the population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ninemile Lake is managed primarily for walleye.  The population is maintained through natural reproduction, which can be sporadic but also very good in some years.  Other species present are northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker, bluegill and black crappie.In the 2004 assessment walleye were sampled in average numbers compared to other lakes in this class.  Average size was 15.3 inches (1.4 lb) with fish up to 26.2 inches (6.3 lb) sampled.Northern pike were sampled in above-average numbers, but as is typical of smaller lakes, high numbers coincided with small size.  The average size of northern pike in this assessment was 1.5 lb.  The largest northern pike sampled was 26.9 inches (4.8 lb) but most of the fish were between 18 and 22 inches.  Northern pike larger than 10 lb have occasionally been caught by anglers in this lake.Yellow perch were sampled in above-average numbers, and the catch included fish up to 11.6 inches.  Average size was 7.3 inches, but approximately one out of seven of the yellow perch in the sample were larger than 9 inches.Bluegill and black crappie were present in the lake; however, their numbers are believed to be quite low.  Black crappie were stocked several times in the 1970's and 1980's; however, the stocking did not result in a good population.Ninemile Lake is popular with anglers and campers.  There is a Federal Forest Service campground, one resort and several residential cabins on the lake. The public access has a concrete ramp, suitable for launching medium size boats.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ninemile Lake is a popular lake in the area and located approximately 16 miles northeast of Finland. There is a public access with concrete boat ramp and dock adjacent to a US Forest Service fee campground on the northeast side of the lake. The standard survey was conducted to monitor the fish community in Ninemile Lake and evaluate the Walleye fry stocking that has occurred following a partial winterkill in 2013.  <br> \n <br> \nThe number of Walleye caught was within the normal range for similar lakes and consistent with previous investigations completed before 2013. The average size of Walleye in 2019 was 16.1 inches and 1.7 pounds. Over 70% of the catch was at least 15 inches long. The largest Walleye sampled was 24.5 inches long and weighed 5.0 pounds. Growth of Walleye was fast for the area and year classes are consistently produced with only one missing in the last ten years. Fry stocked years only accounted for 36% of total catch, indicating natural reproduction is able to maintain a population in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was above average for similar lakes in the Finland area and comparable to the past three investigations. A total of 57 pike were caught in gill nets and had an average size of 19.2 inches and 1.8 pounds. Sixteen pike were over 22 inches in length for 25% of the catch and the largest fish sampled was 30 inches. The lake has been able to produce some big pike with past investigations getting fish close to 40 inches long. Growth of Northern Pike appeared to be normal, and natural reproduction appears to be able to sustain the population with eight different ages represented in the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled in high numbers relative to similar lakes in the area, yet the catch was the lowest in the four most recent investigations on the lake. The average length of perch was 6.9 inches. The largest Yellow Perch was 11.2 inches long and 12% of the catch was over 9 inches. Yellow Perch are an important forage fish in the lake, and anglers may catch an occasional keeper perch.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker were sampled in high numbers relative to similar lakes and size averaged 15.2 inches. There are opportunities in the spring to harvest suckers from Ninemile Creek.  <br> \n <br> \nSix Bluegill were sampled in the survey nets and ranged in length from 2.3 to 3.8 inches. Bluegill have been sampled in the previous two investigations at low numbers. The small size and low number of Bluegill are likely not of interest to anglers. In the Finland Area, Bluegill populations tend to consist of low densities with sporadic reproduction and recruitment. Pumpkinseed, Blacknose Shiner, and Bluntnose Minnow were also collected during the survey.</p>",

Black crappie were stocked at various times in the 1970's and 1980's, but have not become very abundant. None were sampled during the 1995 assessment.     Test nets in 1995 found walleye numbers were about average compared to similar lakes in its class although less abundant than in the 1991 assessment. Walleye ranged in size from 7.7 inches to 29.2 inches (9.5 pounds) and averaged 16 inches. Approximately 37% of the walleye sampled were 18 inches or larger.     Northern pike abundance is high compared to similar lakes in its class with the 1995 assessment sampling a higher number of northern pike than in any previous assessment. Northern pike up to 44.6 inches (22.2 pounds) were recorded however most are small, averaging about 1 pound, with two thirds of the northern pike sampled ranging between 16 inches and 20 inches (0.75 to 1.5 pounds).     Yellow perch are present in above average numbers with up to 13.1 inch fish sampled. Very few fish were larger than 11 inches however approximately one third were in the 8 inch to 10 inch range which is an acceptable size to most anglers.</p>",

Ninemile Lake is one of the more heavily used lakes within the Finland Fisheries Management Area.  There is a public boat ramp and dock on the northeast side of the lake.  This access is run by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and is adjacent to a 24 unit USFS campground.   <br> \n <br> \nThe spring 2016 targeted survey using nighttime boat electrofishing was conducted to gather more information on the Smallmouth Bass population in Ninemile Lake.  This survey was recommended after a partial winterkill in 2013 which documented Smallmouth Bass dead along the shoreline.  Prior to this winterkill Smallmouth Bass had not been previously documented in the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nNo Smallmouth Bass were sampled or observed during the nighttime electrofishing.  There were also no signs of Bluegill or Black Crappie spawning beds along the shore during the survey.  No Bluegill or Black Crappie were observed during the electrofishing.    <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to using the boat electrofishing to sample Smallmouth Bass, Walleye that were shocked during the runs were also collected.  A total of 13 Walleye were sampled with a catch rate of 8.69/hour.  The average length of Walleye was 9.39 inches with a maximum length of 14.76 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

Since an attempt has been started to establish Black Crappie in the lake, additional stocking of this species should be made if available. The 1978 stocking survival is questionable due to the poor condition of fish during transport from the southern part of the state. The 1980 and 1982 Black Crappie stockings were of fish from within the Finland Area. Additional information on the Black Crappie population will be available from netting in the spring of 1983 with trapnets.</p>",

Forest Service which is adjacent to the 24 unit forest service campground on the lake.  In the spring of 2013, a partial winterkill occurred and 500-1000 dead fish were observed, as well as dead crayfish.  Black crappie, bluegill, walleye, yellow perch, white sucker, northern pike, and smallmouth bass were the main species found deceased. <br> \n <br> \nNinemile Lake is managed primarily for walleye.  The walleye population is maintained through natural reproduction, which can be sporadic but also very good in some years.  In 2013, 150,000 walleye fry were stocked in the lake to account for the partial winterkill that occurred.  The walleye numbers in 2013 were below average for the lake class, this may be a result of the winterkill that occurred on the lake.  The average length of walleye in this assessment was 18.7 inches (2.1 pounds).  The largest walleye was 27.4 inches (7.25 pounds).  Even with the low numbers sampled, walleye reproduction was consistent with representation of ages 2-7 and fish at ages 9 and 12 present. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in above average numbers, but the high numbers coincided with small size of the pike.  The average size of northern pike in this assessment was 1.6 pounds.  The largest pike was 30.7 inches (6.6 pounds) but most of the pike were around 20 inches.  The reproduction of notherns in the lake is consistent with fish representing ages 1-10 in the population. <br> \n  <br> \nYellow perch numbers sampled in 2013 were above average, but the size tended to be small.  The average weight was 0.19 pounds and length of 7.2 inches.  The largest perch was 10.9 inches (0.6 pounds).  One small bluegill (4.3 inches) was sampled in 2013.  There appears to be a small population of bluegill in the lake.  No black crappies were sampled but the species was observed in the winterkill along with smallmouth bass which were also not sampled in the 2013 assessment.  High numbers of white suckers, averaging 2.2 pounds, were also collected in 2013.   <br> \n</p>",

Ninemile Lake is one of the more heavily used lakes within the Finland Fisheries Management Area.  There is a public boat ramp and dock on the northeast side of the lake.  This access is run by the U.S. Forest Service and is adjacent to the 24 unit forest service campground.   <br> \n <br> \nThe spring 2016 targeted survey using trap nets was conducted to gather more information on the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations in Ninemile Lake.  This survey was recommended after a partial winterkill in 2013, of the 500-1000 dead fish observed after the kill, the majority were Bluegill and Black Crappie.  <br> \n <br> \nDuring the 2016 survey, no Bluegill or Black Crappie were sampled in the ten trap nets.  There were no signs of Bluegill or Black Crappie spawning beds along the shore during the survey.  Along with no Bluegill and Black Crappie being sampled in the trap nets, no Walleye or Smallmouth Bass were sampled in the trap nets during the spring targeted survey.  <br> \n <br> \nEight Northern Pike were sampled in the trap nets.  The majority of the Northern Pike had a length between 18 and 21 inches.  The largest pike caught measured 42 inches in length.  Two Yellow Perch were caught and measured 5 and 5.5 inches in length.  Ten White Sucker were sampled during the spring trap net survey.  <br> \n</p>",
