                "narrative": "<p>Walkerbrook Lake is a 90-acre lake with a maximum depth of 45 feet located 7 miles southeast of Bagley in central Clearwater County.  There is a state public water access with an earthen ramp and parking for 5 vehicles/trailers located on the west side of the lake off of County Road 96.  The shoreline of the lake is mostly undeveloped with a small number of lakeside homes and cabins.  The lake basin drops sharply from the shoreline into deep water.  The lake stratifies at a shallow depth during summer, with little oxygen for fish below a depth of 15 feet found in the 2015 survey conducted in late June. <br> \n <br> \nWalkerbrook Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Black Crappie, with Northern Pike, Bluegill and Largemouth Bass managed secondarily.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical characteristics and the fish community present in the lake.  Walkerbrook Lake is in Lake Class 28.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Walkerbrook Lake and other class 28 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Little Buzzle, Lomond and Sandy (near Debs). <br> \n <br> \nWalkerbrook Lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings on alternate years.  Walleye catch rates have been low in most surveys (including 2015) but that may be due in part to the difficulty of setting the survey nets so that they fish effectively on such steep drop offs.  The 2015 Walleye catch rate of 0.33/gill net was below the normal range found in class 28 lakes.  The Walleye catch consisted of fish in the 14.0 to 15.0-inch length range and a few larger individuals up to 28.58 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers in Walkerbrook Lake have been consistent over the past few surveys.  The 2015 survey catch rates for both trap nets and gill nets (2.44/trap net and 1/gill net) were within the range normally found in class 28 lakes.  Black Crappie up to 10.71 inches in length were captured, with an average length of 9.1 inches.  Nine year classes of Black Crappie were identified in the catch, indicating consistent natural reproduction.  Black Crappie grow slowly in Walkerbrook Lake, which limits the maximum size they are able to achieve. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 Bluegill catch rate of 13/trap net was just below the median value for class 28 lakes.  Bluegill numbers were down from very high levels in the most recent survey in 2005 (85/trap net).  This decline has caused growth rates to increase considerably in the population, which may result in more quality-size Bluegill available to anglers in the near future. Most of the Bluegill captured were between 6.0 and 7.5 inches in length, with fish up to 9.41 inches in length present in the population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were abundant in the 2015 survey.  The catch rate of 9.33/gill net was above the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Some quality-size pike were found in the population, with 32% of the catch measuring greater than 24 inches in length.  The average size of Northern Pike captured in 2015 was 21.24 inches, with the largest Northern Pike measuring 35.83 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 survey documented a healthy population of Largemouth Bass, with an electrofishing catch rate of 41 Bass/hour which is a good catch rate for lakes in the Bemidji area.  Largemouth Bass from 6.81 inches to 20.43 inches in length were captured, with an impressive average size of 15.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in the 2015 survey were Hybrid Sunfish, Yellow Bullhead, White Sucker and Yellow Perch.  Yellow Perch up to 10.39 inches in length were captured, although the average length of 7.21 inches indicates few Perch of a size that would be of interest to anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walker Brook Lake, located about 5 miles southeast of Bagley is in lake class 28.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include, Lomond, Lone, Pickerel, Deep, Little Buzzle and Peterson.  They are typically small, deep lakes with regular shorelines and soft water.  Lakes of this class are often difficult to sample due to steep shoreline structure.    Walleye fingerlings are stocked during alternate years.  Gill nets used for the 1996 assessment found three walleye, near the low end of the normal range expected from class 28 lakes.  The mean weight of 2.5 pounds is average for the lake class.  The largest walleye sampled was 24.4 inches, with the mean length at 15.1 inches.    Northern pike were sampled below the normal range for class 28 lakes but the weight of pike sampled (n=4) at 3.9 pounds is above the normal range.  Abundance during previous assessments has fluctuated greatly.  Most northern pike have Neascus (black spot).  The largest pike sampled was about 25 inches long.    Largemouth bass are difficult to sample with standard survey gear.  The 1996 assessment found a total of 10 bass with a range of 7.1 - 13.7 inches in length.  Abundance appears to be good, though the size is small.    Bluegill abundance is above average for comparable lakes, but the mean weight of 0.1 pounds is below that of most lakes in class 28.  Pumpkinseed, green sunfish and hybrid sunfish were also noted.    Yellow perch were sampled at above average abundance for the lake class, but below the level found in most previous assessments.  The mean weight of 0.1 pounds, and an average length of 6.4 inches does not make them attractive to anglers.    Black crappie were sampled at the lowest recorded abundance in 1996.  This follows the highest recorded abundance in 1992.  Most crappies now in the lake appear to be from the 1993 year class.    There are a few brown bullheads in the lake, and black bullheads have been recorded in the past but abundance is low.</p>",
