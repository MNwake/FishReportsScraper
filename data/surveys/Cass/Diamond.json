THE NETTING ASSESSMENT INDICATES AN EXTREMELY LARGE POPULATION OF BLACK BULLHEADS, AN EXCELLENT POPULATION OF RAINBOW TROUT, AND SOME MUSKELLUNGE.  THE LENGTH FREQUENCY INDICATES THAT NUMEROUS STOCKINGS OF RAINBOW TROUT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.  THE BULLHEADS ARE SMALL, POSSIBLY STUNTED, AND DO POSE A PROBLEM FOR THE RAINBOW TROUT FISHERMEN.  THE POPULATION OF MUSKELLUNGE PROBABLY WAS CREATED BY FISH THAT HAD ESCAPED FROM GRASSY (BLUEBILL) REARING POND.  THE SMALLER OF THE TWO MUSKELLUNGE WAS DETERMINED TO BE 3+ YEARS OLD.  THIS INDICATES THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION HAS OCCURED SINCE GRASSY HAS NOT BEEN USED AS A REARING POND FOR MUSKELLUNGE IN OVER SIX YEARS.</p>",

Other stream-trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Hazel, Perch, Teepee, and Willard Lakes.  Diamond Lake was first used as a stream-trout lake in 1967.  The trout population in Diamond Lake depends upon stocking because rainbow trout do not naturally reproduce in this lake.  The lake was chemically treated in 1998 to remove competing fish species, so that rainbow trout stocking could be resumed.  However, black crappie were sampled in 2004.  Black crappie were not known to exist in the lake prior to the 1998 reclamation.  It appears someone introduced them after the reclamation.  Since the reclamation, seven year-classes of rainbow trout have been stocked and three  year-classes were sampled during 2005.  The average length of sampled rainbow trout was 11 inches, and fish up to 16 inches are present.    Since 1998, Fisheries personnel have been sampling zooplankton, the tiny animals on which Diamond Lake rainbow trout feed.  The quantity of zooplankton available in Diamond Lake is highest among the five designated stream-trout lakes.  Also, Diamond Lake has the best rainbow trout fishery among the five lakes.</p>",

A public access owned by the US Forest Service is located on the west shore. Diamond Lake offers excellent Rainbow Trout fishing in a remote, wilderness like setting. The lake is totally within the Chippewa National Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped. Diamond Lake is one of four designated stream trout lakes in the Walker Management Area. Other stream trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Hazel, Perch, and Teepee.  <br> \n <br> \nDiamond Lake was first used as a stream trout lake in 1967. Rainbow Trout do not reproduce in this lake and the population is instead supported entirely by stocking to provide unique angling opportunities. The average length of Rainbow Trout sampled in gill nets in 2013 was 12 inches and lengths ranged from 9 to19 inches. Historically, Rainbow Trout up to 17 inches in length have been sampled in several previous assessments, but the 19-inch Rainbow Trout sampled in 2013 was the largest ever. Anglers will have excellent opportunities to catch rainbows over 15 inches in length during the 2014 season. The lake was chemically treated in October of 2008 to remove competing fish species, specifically Black Crappie, presumed to have been illegally introduced by anglers. These fish eventually overpopulated and stunted, reducing the recreational value of the Rainbow Trout fishery and prompting a costly reclamation process. Yearling Rainbow Trout were stocked in May 2009 and annual stocking of fingerling Rainbow Trout was resumed in the fall of 2009. Excellent Rainbow Trout fishing followed the 2008 reclamation and should continue in future years, provided stocking is maintained. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently not aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Diamond Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Diamond Lake (DOW# 11-0396; Lake Class 29) is an 80-acre lake located near Hackensack, MN. There is a US Forest Service public access located on the west shore. Diamond Lake has a shoreline length of 1.86 miles and a maximum depth of 31 feet.  Diamond Lake offers excellent Rainbow Trout fishing in a remote, wilderness like setting. The lake is totally within the Chippewa National Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped. Diamond Lake is one of four designated stream trout lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area. Other stream trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Hazel, Perch, and Teepee.  <br> \n <br> \nDiamond Lake was first used as a stream trout lake in 1967. Rainbow Trout do not reproduce in this lake and the population is supported entirely by stocking to provide a unique angling opportunity. The average length of Rainbow Trout sampled in gill nets in 2014 was 10 inches and lengths ranged from 6 to 18 inches. Historically, Diamond has produced several fish larger than 15 inches, and the 2014 sample produced the highest observation to date. The lake was chemically treated in October of 2008 to remove competing fish species, specifically Black Crappie, presumed to have been illegally introduced by anglers. These fish eventually overpopulated and stunted, reducing the recreational value of the Rainbow Trout fishery and prompting a costly reclamation process. Excellent Rainbow Trout fishing followed the 2008 reclamation and should continue in future years, provided stocking is maintained and other species are not again introduced by anglers. In the spring of 2014, 7000 yearling Kamloops strain Rainbow Trout were stocked with 14,000 Arlee strain fingerlings stocked in the fall.  The Kamloops trout had an adipose fin clip for identification. In January 2015 Diamond Lake was opened to winter Trout fishing, providing increased opportunities for Trout anglers in the Walker area. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Diamond Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The average length of rainbow trout sampled in 2007 was 11inches, and fish up to 15 inches are present.</p>",

A public access owned by the US Forest Service is located on the west shore. Diamond Lake offers excellent rainbow trout fishing in a remote, wilderness-like setting. The lake is totally within the Chippewa National Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped.  Diamond Lake is one of four designated stream-trout lakes in the Walker Management Area. Other stream-trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Hazel, Perch, and Teepee.  Diamond Lake was first used as a stream-trout lake in 1967.  The trout population in Diamond Lake depends upon stocking because rainbow trout do not naturally reproduce in this lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe average length of rainbow trout sampled in 2010 was 11 inches and lengths ranged from 7 to 14 inches. Historically, rainbow trout up to 17 inches in length have been sampled in several previous assessments. Anglers will have excellent opportunities to catch rainbows over 15 inches in length during the 2011 season. The lake was chemically treated in October of 2008 to remove competing fish species, specifically black crappie, presumed to have been illegally stocked by anglers. These fish eventually overpopulated and stunted, reducing the recreational value of the rainbow trout fishery and prompting a costly reclamation process. Yearling rainbow trout were stocked in May 2009 and annual stocking of fingerling rainbow trout was resumed in the fall of 2009.  Excellent rainbow trout fishing followed this reclamation and should continue in future years. <br> \n <br> \nDiamond Lake is not currently known to be infested with any aquatic invasive species (AIS).  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat away from the landing prior to launching and again before leaving the access.  If you suspect you may have discovered a new infestation of an invasive species, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on AIS prevention and awareness, including the problems they cause, can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us). <br> \n</p>",

A public access owned by the US Forest Service is located on the west shore. Diamond Lake offers excellent rainbow trout fishing in a remote, wilderness like setting. The lake is totally within the Chippewa National Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped.  Diamond Lake is one of four designated stream trout lakes in the Walker Management Area. Other stream trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Hazel, Perch, and Teepee.  Diamond Lake was first used as a stream trout lake in 1967.  The trout population in Diamond Lake is entirely dependent on stocking; there is no rainbow trout natural reproduction in this lake.   <br> \nThe average length of rainbow trout sampled in gill nets in 2012 was 13 inches and lengths ranged from 9.5 to 16 inches. Historically, rainbow trout up to 17 inches in length have been sampled in several previous assessments. Anglers will have excellent opportunities to catch rainbows over 15 inches in length during the 2013 season. The lake was chemically treated in October of 2008 to remove competing fish species, specifically black crappie, presumed to have been illegally introduced by anglers. These fish eventually overpopulated and stunted, reducing the recreational value of the rainbow trout fishery and prompting a costly reclamation process. Yearling rainbow trout were stocked in May 2009 and annual stocking of fingerling rainbow trout was resumed in the fall of 2009.  Excellent rainbow trout fishing followed the 2008 reclamation and should continue in future years, provided stocking is maintained. <br> \nDiamond Lake is not currently known to be infested with any aquatic invasive species (AIS).  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat away from the landing prior to launching and again before leaving the access.  If you suspect you may have discovered a new infestation of an invasive species, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on AIS prevention and awareness, including the problems they cause, can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us). <br> \n</p>",

A public access owned by the US Forest Service is located on the west shore. Diamond Lake offers good rainbow trout fishing in a remote, wilderness-like setting. The lake is totally within the Chippewa National Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped.  Diamond Lake is one of five designated stream-trout lakes in the Walker Management Area. Other stream-trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Hazel, Perch, and Teepee.  Diamond Lake was first used as a stream-trout lake in 1967.  The trout population in Diamond Lake depends upon stocking because rainbow trout do not naturally reproduce in this lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe average length of rainbow trout sampled in 2008 was 8 inches, and fish up to 13 inches were present. Historically, rainbow trout up to 17 inches in length have been sampled in several previous assessments. The lake was chemically treated in 1998 to remove competing fish species, so that rainbow trout stocking could be resumed. Excellent fishing followed this reclamation.  However, black crappies were sampled in 2004.  Rainbow trout numbers and average size declined as black crappie numbers increased. Black crappies were not known to exist in the lake prior to the 1998 reclamation.  In order to restore the quality rainbow trout fishery, Diamond Lake was reclaimed again in October of 2008 using rotenone, a fish toxicant, to kill all fish present in the lake. Spring stocking of yearling rainbow trout is scheduled for May of 2009 to provide angling opportunities during the 2009 season. Fall rainbow trout fingerling stocking is scheduled to resume in the fall of 2009.  Anglers are asked to refrain from introducing fish into Diamond Lake.</p>",

There is a US Forest Service public access located on the west shore. Diamond Lake has a shoreline length of 1.86 miles and a maximum depth of 31 feet.  Diamond Lake offers excellent Rainbow Trout fishing in a remote, wilderness like setting. The lake is totally within the Chippewa National Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped. Diamond Lake is one of four designated stream trout lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area. Other stream trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Hazel, Perch, and Teepee.  <br> \n <br> \nDiamond Lake was first used as a stream trout lake in 1967. Rainbow Trout do not reproduce in this lake and the population is supported entirely by stocking to provide a unique angling opportunity. The average length of Rainbow Trout sampled in gill nets in 2014 was 10 inches and lengths ranged from 6 to 16 inches. Historically, Diamond has produced several fish larger than 15 inches, and the 2015 sample produced one of the highest observations to date. The lake was chemically treated in October of 2008 to remove competing fish species, specifically Black Crappie, presumed to have been illegally introduced by anglers. These fish eventually overpopulated and reduced the recreational value of the Rainbow Trout fishery which led to a costly reclamation process. Excellent Rainbow Trout fishing followed the 2008 reclamation and should continue in future years, provided stocking is maintained and other species are not again introduced by anglers. In the spring of 2015, 2,531 yearling Kamloops strain Rainbow Trout were stocked with 14,000 Arlee strain fingerlings stocked in the fall.  Kamloops strain Rainbow Trout had an adipose fin clip for identification. In January 2015 Diamond Lake was opened to winter Trout fishing for the first time and provided increased opportunities for Trout anglers in the Walker area. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Diamond Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.

                "narrative": "<p>Diamond Lake is a 77-acre lake with 1.86 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 31 feet located northeast of Hackensack, MN. There is a US Forest Service public access located on the west shore. Diamond Lake offers Rainbow Trout fishing in a remote, wilderness like setting. The lake is entirely within the Chippewa National Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped. Diamond Lake is one of four designated stream trout lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area. Other stream trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Hazel, Perch, and Teepee Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout were initially stocked in Diamond Lake in 1967. Rainbow Trout do not reproduce in the lake and the population is supported entirely by stocking to provide a unique angling opportunity. Rainbow Trout stocking success is dependent on the absence of introduced species. The average length of Rainbow Trout sampled in 2021 was 10 inches and lengths ranged from 8 to 17 inches. Black Bullhead were first sampled in 2013. In January 2015 Diamond Lake was opened to winter trout fishing for the first time and provided increased opportunities for ice anglers. Based on surveys following the opening of the winter season, there are no indications that ice fishing has had an effect on Rainbow Trout sizes or abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Diamond Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
