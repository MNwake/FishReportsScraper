                "narrative": "<p>Otrey is a highly productive, 562-acre lake located six miles northeast of Ortonville in Big Stone County.  No public boat access exists.  Otrey's maximum depth was eight feet during 2018, which has been typical for years with average to above average precipitation.  However, its maximum depth was only 3.5 feet in 1991 after several dry years.  Otrey Lake has been known to experience fish kills due to low oxygen levels.  This 2018 survey was conducted to collect fish data using gill nets, 0.75-inch trap nets and 0.25-inch trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Otrey Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads, Common Carp, Orangespotted Sunfish and White Suckers were the only fish caught.  These species are tolerant of low oxygen conditions.  Although Otrey Lake is upstream of Long Tom Lake which contains several desirable game fish species, it appears these species are failing to establish populations in Otrey Lake.  Barriers to upstream migration, including road crossing culverts and a spillway structure at the outlet of Bentsen Lake, are likely preventing these species from accessing Otrey Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nFisheries management activities at Otrey Lake have included fish surveys and dissolved oxygen monitoring.  If a public access can be obtained, routine game fish stocking would likely be conducted. Oxygen levels were low in winter 2018-2019 and some winterkill likely occurred. <br> \n</p>",

Frequent monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen has indicated that Otrey Lake is prone to winterkill.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations have declined to the point of winterkill in five of the past eight investigations.  A possible winterkill was indicated again during the winter of 2003/2004.       Black bullhead, common carp, orangespotted sunfish and white sucker, all species tolerant to low oxygen conditions, were the only fish species sampled during the 2003 assessment.  Individuals of all species tended to be small and would not be of much interest to anglers or commercial fishermen.     Fisheries management activies for Otrey Lake are limited by its winterkill prone nature and lack of public access.  Scheduled activities include annual winter dissolved oxygen monitoring, fisheries assessments as needed, investigating the feasibility of installing a public access, and stocking gamefish if warranted.</p>",
