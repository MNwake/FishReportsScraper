                "narrative": "<p>Loon is a 40 acre lake located about four miles south of Crosby.  It has moderately-hard water and low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is about average for the area.  About 80% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  Shallow water soils are either sand/gravel or muck.  The shoreline is undeveloped and a public access is present on the southwest shore.  The aquatic plant community is rather diverse.  Emergent species like bulrush often provide preferred spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submergent species, which grew to a depth of about 15 feet in 1994, provide important cover and feeding areas for a wide variety of fish species.Northern pike was the most abundant gamefish in the 1994 initial survey.  The catch rate was \"average\" when compared to similar type lakes.  Four age classes were sampled and growth was good.  Average length was 17 inches and average weight 1.2 lbs..  Largemouth bass were caught in \"average\" numbers.  Their size ranged from 10-13 inches.Bluegills were caught in \"average\" numbers, as well.  Five age classes were present and bluegill growth was slow until age six.  About 20% were 7.0 inches or more long.  Other sunfishes sampled included green sunfish, pumpkinseeds and hybrid sunfish.Other fish caught in 1994 included black, brown and yellow bullheads and bowfin (dogfish).</p>",
