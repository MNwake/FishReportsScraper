                "narrative": "<p>South Lake lies on the Minnesota-Ontario border. The Minnesota side is entirely inside the BWCAW and has been non-motorized since 1978. There are no restrictions on motorized use on the Ontario side of the lake. Access is provided by portage trails from North, Topper, and Rose (via Rat) Lakes. Public access is somewhat difficult, involving either steep portages or a long stretch of boat travel. Access from the public access on the west end of Gunflint Lake requires about 11.4 miles of motorized travel, plus the 0.25-mile portage from North Lake. South Lake is primarily managed for lake trout. The 2023 standard lake survey was conducted to monitor the fish community in South Lake, record current limnological conditions, and evaluate management goals currently in place on the lake trout population. <br> \n <br> \nLake trout abundance (deep and shallow sets combined) is well above average compared to local lake trout lakes and similar to previous surveys in South Lake. Captured lake trout ranged from 11.2 to 27.2 inches with an average length of 19.4 inches. Ageing results showed 17 different naturally reproduced year classes in the population. The oldest lake trout was aged at 33 years old. Growth rates appeared to be slower than similar area lakes with age 6 fish being 13.7 inches compared to an area average of 15.9 inches. Slow lake trout growth may be due to competition with other lake trout, and less likely due to lack of forage opportunities. Naturally reproducing lake trout populations are unique in Minnesota lakes, anglers targeting lake trout should consider catch and release practices with safe handling procedures.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass abundance was similar to previous surveys in South Lake and is below the median for similar area lakes. Smallmouth bass collected ranged from 10.4 to 16.0 inches with a mean length of 14.7 inches. Although not numerous in gill nets, smallmouth bass were commonly observed in shallow waters taking insects off the surface and can provide decent angling opportunities in South Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe cisco catch was much higher than historical survey results and is well above the median for similar area lakes. Cisco ranged between 8 and 10 inches in size and likely provide a high-quality forage for the relatively abundant lake trout population.  <br> \n <br> \nThe burbot catch rate was similar to historical surveys and is above the median for similar area lakes. Burbot ranged between 9.3 and 27.2 inches with a large average length of 17.1 inches. Burbot may provide a quality angling opportunity for anglers especially during the winter.  <br> \n <br> \nOne 11.6 inch brook trout was captured during the 2023 survey and is most likely a migrant from either Sock or Topper Lake, which are current stream trout management lakes with connection to South Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions. South Lakes is especially vulnerable due to multiple connections to other waterbodies. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health. Anglers should clean watercraft and fishing gear, drain all water, and dispose of unused bait in the trash to prevent accidental introductions.  <br> \n</p>",
