Access is from a 13 rod portage from Sawbill Lake or a 10 rod portage from Alton Lake. The lake has a maximum depth of 16 feet with bog stained water that has a secchi disc visible to a depth of 4.5 feet. The lake receives a fair amount of traffic from canoeists traveling through to other destinations in the wilderness but fishing pressure is light. The fish population in Kelso Lake consists of northern pike, yellow perch, smallmouth bass, white sucker and bluegill.. <br> \n <br> \nA lake survey in 2007 collected northern pike in average numbers compared to other lakes in this lake class. The size of northern pike collected in 2007 was below average with a mean weight of 1.14 pounds. There were no northern pike larger than 2.9 pounds collected in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were collected in average numbers with approximately one-third of the fish larger than 8.0 inches. Yellow perch up to 10.2 inches were collected in 2007.     <br> \n <br> \nOne smallmouth bass (14.5 inches) and one young-of-the-year bluegill sunfish (1.1 inches) were sampled for the first time in 2007. Access limitations restricted the type of survey gear used in this investigation so abundances for these two species were not assessed.   <br> \n</p>",
