                "narrative": "<p>Ge-Be-On-Equat Lake (Ge-Be) is located within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) within the Superior National Forest and is a non-motorized lake.  It is located approximately 29 miles northwest of Ely and is 660 acres.  It has a maximum depth of 55 feet and brown bog-stained water.  \n\nOn June 24, 2019 Ge-Be was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 68 F and a bottom temp of 45 F.  Oxygen levels for gamefish were adequate throughout the water column.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder with some areas of ledgerock, rubble, and sand.  Aquatic plants are very sparse and found mostly near the two small inlets.  There are two portage accesses, one on the north and one on the south side of the lake.  A 35 rod portage in the northeast bay bypasses rapids at the lake's only outlet, Ge-Be-On-Equat Creek, which intersects Pocket Creek on its way to Lac la Croix.  The southern access is a 120 rod portage that exists between the southeastern bay of Ge-Be and Green Lake.  BWCAW permits are required to visit Ge-Be through an official entry point and there are five U. S. Forest Service maintained campsites on the lake.  \n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 10.9 fish/net which was low compared to past surveys on the lake.  Total yield was 17.9 pounds/net which was average for the lake.  Fish species sampled were cisco, lake whitefish, walleye, smallmouth bass, and white sucker.\n\nGe-Be is currently stocked with walleye fry every third year.  Twelve walleye were caught in the 2019 assessment for a gillnet catch rate of 1.3 fish/net, which was low compared to other similar lakes in the state.  Sizes were generally large with lengths ranging from 19 to 28 inches and an average of nearly 24 inches.  The average weight was also very impressive at over 5 pounds.  Growth rates appeared to be very good.  Ages ranged from 4 to 17 years with a moderate number of fish coming from stocked years.    \n\nTwenty-eight whitefish were sampled for a catch rate of 3.1 fish/net.  This was high compared to past surveys on the lake and slightly better than average compared to other surveys of whitefish populations in the Tower area.  Lengths ranged from 13 to 25 inches with an average of nearly 19 inches.  Average weight was good at nearly 3 pounds.  Ages ranged from 4 to 22 years.  \n\nCisco are likely the most common source of forage for the lake's predatory species.  The cisco gillnet catch rate was 5.7 fish/net which was better than average compared to past surveys on the lake.  Sizes ranged from 6.5 to over 8 inches with an average of just over 7 inches.  \n\nFive smallmouth were sampled for a catch rate of 0.6 fish/net which was the highest on record for the lake.  Sizes ranged from 8 to 18 inches with an average of nearly 14 inches.  These sizes were larger than the fish observed in past surveys.  Ages ranged from 4 to 15 years.  \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ge-Be-On-Equat Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregularly shaped shorelines, and very soft (low mineral content) water.  Ge-Be-On-Equat Lake is smaller (607 acres) than the lake class average of 1,807 acres.   <br> \n   <br> \nGe-Be-On-Equat Lake was thermally stratified on 06/29/2009 with a surface temperature of 64.4 ?F and bottom temperature of 48.2 ?F.  Good oxygen (more than 5 ppm) was retained to within a few feet of the bottom.  There are inlets from Green Lake and Charm Lake, but it is unclear from survey reports if there are barriers to fish movement.  The outlet stream to Lac La Croix has rocky waterfalls which prevent upstream fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates are mostly boulder, sand, and ledgerock.  Aquatic plants are very sparse and are found mostly near the inlets. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 assessment consisted of 8 gillnet sets.  Four previous fish population assessments and surveys conducted between 1981 and 2009 consisted of 8 to 10 gillnet sets.  Trapnets have not been set in Ge-Be-On-Equat Lake due to the difficult access.  The initial survey in 1966 listed lengths of the northern pike, cisco, and white sucker that were captured, but did not list the number of nets used or catch/net information in the report.  Walleye were introduced by fry stocking starting in 1978.  Walleye fry were stocked annually from 1978 through 1980, every other year from 1982 through 1988, and every third year from 1994 through 2009.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 total catch of fish (all species combined) of 13.1/gillnet was in the first quartile for lake Class 7, but was identical to the median catch(13.1/gillnet) for all investigations on Ge-Be-On-Equat Lake and was similar to the 1999 catch rate of 13.0/gillnet.  Lake Class 7 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.   <br> \n <br> \nCisco, walleye, and lake whitefish made up the majority of the 2009 gillnet catch.  Northern pike, white sucker, and yellow perch were caught in lower numbers.  No smallmouth bass were caught in the gillnets in 2009 but several were caught by angling. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 walleye catch rate (1.5/gillnet) was lower than normal for Lake Class 7 and lower than the median (2.4/gillnet) for all investigations on Ge-Be-On-Equat Lake.  Walleye sizes in 2009 were larger than normal for this lake class, averaging 20.4 inches; the largest was 25.5 inches.  Walleye were foraging primarily on cisco in 2009, and growth was faster than normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nNo smallmouth bass were caught in the gillnets in 2009.  Past assessments caught only low numbers (range: 0.1-0.3/gillnet).  Angling catches in recent assessments indicate smallmouth numbers are likely much higher than gillnet data suggests.  Thirty smallmouth bass were caught by a 2-person assessment crew during a 3 hour time span in 2009.  Seventy-four smallmouth were caught by angling in the 1999 assessment.  Most of the smallmouth caught in 2009 were small (less than 10 inches), and the largest was 15.4 inches.  Growth rates varied by age class but were generally normal by area standards.      <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2009 (0.5/gillnet) were in the first quartile for Lake Class 7 and similar to the median catch (0.8/gillnet) for all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2009 averaged 21.8 inches; the largest was 25.9 inches.  Large pike have been caught in past assessments including a 46 inch fish in 1992.  Northern pike growth was faster than normal (in the third or fourth quartile) by area standards, depending on age. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 cisco catch rate (9.0/gillnet) was normal for Lake Class 7 and the highest observed in any investigation on Ge-Be-On-Equat Lake.  Cisco numbers have increased in recent assessments from an average of just 0.3/gillnet in 3 assessments between 1981 and 1992 to an average of 8.1/gillnet in assessments in 1999 and 2009.  Cisco sizes in 2009 averaged 8.1 inches; the largest was 10.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 lake whitefish catch rate of 1.0/gillnet was similar to the median catch (1.1/gillnet) for all investigations on this lake and normal for Lake Class 7.  Whitefish sizes averaged 22.1 inches and the largest was 25.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2009 (0.8/gillnet) were lower than normal for this lake class but similar to past investigations (range: 0.1-0.8/gillnet).  Field notes from past assessments suggest perch numbers may be higher than indicated by gillnetting based on angling catches and observations of many 3 to 4 inch perch by assessment crews. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 white sucker catch rate of 0.4/gillnet was identical to the median catch for all investigations on Ge-Be-On-Equat Lake and lower than normal for Lake Class 7.  Sucker sizes averaged 15.4 inches in 2009; the largest was 17.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThree fish caught in the 2009 assessment were infected with neascus (black spot).  Neascus is a common parasite that is native to the area, does not infect humans, and is killed at temperatures used to cook fish.    <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Ge-Be-On-Equat Lake is smaller (607 acres) than the lake class average of 1,807 acres.Ge-Be-On-Equat Lake was thermally stratified on 07/06/99 and retained good oxygen (2 ppm) to a depth of 46 ft, where the temperature was 42 F.  There are inlets from Green Lake and Charm Lake, but it is unclear from survey reports if there are barriers to fish movement to and from these lakes.  The outlet stream to Lac La Croix has a rocky waterfalls which prevents upstream fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates are mostly boulder, sand, and ledgerock.  Aquatic plants are very sparse and are found mostly near the inlets.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1999 of 13 fish/net (15 lb/net) was lower than normal for this lake class, but was similar to catches in three previous gillnettings in this lake dating back to 1981.  Lake Class 7 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.Fish populations in 1999 were dominated by walleye and smallmouth bass.  Walleye fry were introduced to Ge-Be-On-Equat Lake in 1978 and have been stocked periodically since then. Walleye numbers in 1999 (2.4/gillnet) were lower than normal for this lake class, but were similar to their numbers in previous gillnettings in this lake.  Walleye sizes in 1999 were larger than normal for this lake class, averaging 19.6\"; the largest was 26.4\".  Walleye growth (18\" at age four) was faster than normal for area lakes.Few smallmouth bass were captured in the gillnets in 1999 (0.3/gillnet), but many were observed along the shoreline or were captured by angling.  Smallmouth angling during the 1992 assessment was also quite good.  The largest smallmouth caught in 1999 was 17.8\".  Smallmouth growth (8\" at age four) was normal for area lakes.Northern pike numbers in 1999 (0.8/gillnet) were lower than normal for this lake class and continue a decline from a high of 3.4/gillnet in 1981.  Pike sizes in 1999 averaged 23.7\"; the largest was 28.9\".  Pike growth (25\" at age four) was faster than normal for area lakes.        </p>",
