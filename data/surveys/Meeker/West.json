Daytime and nighttime electrofishing (approximately nineteen hours) was used to capture Largemouth Bass. Fish were measured and all bass over 8 inches were given a left pelvic fin clip for the Schnabel mark/recapture population estimate. The entire shoreline was shocked most days. The bullrush beds on the northeast side consistently held the most fish. Netters were instructed to collect all fish eight inches and larger, with smaller bass being released.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 19.1 hours of electrofishing occurred, sampling 422 Largemouth Bass (including recaps). The total catch rate was 22.1 fish/hour. Measured Largemouth Bass were 7.9 to 21.3 inches long with a mean of 14.0. The proportional stock density and proportional stock density - preferred was 70 and 45, meaning 70 % of fish were over 12 inches and 45% of fish sampled were over 15 inches in total length.  The Population Estimate, for fish of all lengths, was 3,453 fish (95% Confidence Interval 2,398 - 5,926) or 5.6 fish/acre. The Population Estimate, for 12 inch and longer fish, was 1,657 fish (95% Confidence Interval 1,135 - 2,816) or 2.7 fish/acre.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Ripley, Meeker County, is a 558 acre lake with a maximum depth of 18 feet.  During the July 17, 2000, population assessement eleven species of fish were sampled.  The lake management plan lists northern pike and largemouth bass as primary management species.  Bluegill and black crappie are listed as secondary species.  A total of 39 northern pike were sampled by gill net for a catch rate of 4.3 per net.  Northern pike ranged in length from 11.6 to 34.6 inches and averaged 18.8 inches.  Northern pike averaged 1.6 pounds.  Northern pike were I to V years old with five year classes represented.  The catch rate was within the expected range for lakes of this type.  Growth was average compared to area lakes.A total of 21 largemouth bass were sampled by spring night-time electrofishing.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 11.4 to 17.7 inches and averaged 14.6 inches.  Largemouth bass were III to VIII years old with five year classes represented.  Growth was average.A total of 31 bluegill were sampled by trap nets for a catch rate of 3.4 per set.  Bluegill ranged in length from 2.7 to 8.7 inches and averaged 5.2 inches.  Bluegill were I to VI years old with six year classes represented.  Growth was fast.  Approximately 29% of the bluegill sampled by trapnet were eight inches or longer.A total of 41 black crappie were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 4.6 per set.  Black crappie ranged in length from 4.1 to 10.8 inches and averaged 9.3 inches.  Black crappie were I to V years old with four years classes represented.  Growth was average.A total of 14 walleye were sampled by gill net for a catch rate of 1.6 per net.  Walleye ranged in length from 19.4 to 25.6 inches and averaged 21.9 inches.  Walleye were IV to VII years old with three year classes represented.  Growth was average.  Walleye were last stocked in 1981 documenting that the current population is a result of natural reproduction.  A total of 14 yellow perch were sampled for a catch rate of 1.6 per net.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 5.3 to 5.8 inches and averaged 5.6 inches.  Yellow perch were I to V years old with four year classes represented.  Growth was average.  Lake Ripley is a popular summer and winter fishery with fishing contests held here each year.  The lake also offers ample shore fishing opportunities and a fishing pier in one of the parks.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nNet catches were compared to similar lakes (class 38 lakes) around the state to assess relative abundance.  Gamefish species sampled included northern pike, pumpkinseed, bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch and walleye.  Carp, black bullhead, yellow bullhead and white sucker were also sampled.  Northern pike were captured at a rate of 2.20/gillnet.  Historical netting data shows that catch rates of northern pike have generally been at or above the lake class median (6.58/gillnet).  Lower numbers of northern pike may be the result of poor natural reproduction during low water conditions from 1988 to 1990.  Fish from ages 1 to 5 were present in the sample, with 64% of the fish being age 1.  The abundance of age 1 northern pike in the sample may indicate a strong year class related to higher water levels in the spring of 1991.  Northern pike ranged in length from 15.0 to 28.0 inches.  Three walleye were captured during this survey.  The last recorded stocking of walleye was in 1981.  All walleye sampled were aged at 9 or 10 years.  Given the difficulty of ageing scales from older walleye, it is possible that these fish were from the 1981 stocking.  Trapnet catch rate of bluegill (8.83/trapnet) was well below the lake class median of 21.8/trapnet.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3.0 to 8.0 inches.  Ages 2 through 7 were represented in the sample, along with one age 10 individual.  The majority of the bluegill were either age 2 (53%) or age 3 (29%).  Back-calculated growth rates indicate that bluegill in Lake Ripley take four years to reach quality size (6 inches).  The catch rate of black bullhead (69.3/trapnet) was considerably higher than the lake class median of 13.3/trapnet.  This catch rate was higher than in any other survey since 1974.  The reason for this increase in abundance is not known, but it appears that the majority of the fish are from one or two year classes.  Although black bullhead were not aged, those sampled were in a relatively narrow size range, from 6.5 to 9.4 inches.  Only three adult largemouth bass were sampled during this survey.  However, substantial numbers of young-of-year largemouth bass were sampled in shoreline seining.  Future surveys should include electrofishing to assess the status of largemouth bass in Lake Ripley.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard fisheries survey (summer gill netting and trap netting) was conducted at Lake Ripley during the week of 7/13/2015, to monitor the fish population.  Water color was brown/green, however, clarity was high, with a secchi reading of 7.1 feet.  The lake was well mixed with a dissolved oxygen concentration of 5.3 ppm (parts per million) at 17 feet.  The exotic species Eurasian watermilfoil and curly-leaf pondweed have been documented in Lake Ripley.  Ripley is primarily managed for northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass, but also supports a self-sustaining walleye population.  A fishing pier was available to anglers on the west side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were stocked into Lake Ripley in 1979 and 1981. Since that time, walleye have been self-sustaining.  Gill nets sampled 38 walleye for a catch rate of 4.2/net, which was above the average expected for Lake Ripley.  Despite a higher catch rate, age analysis indicates inconsistent recruitment of walleye in Lake Ripley.  Four ages classes were present, composed of a strong year class (32 of 38 walleye) of age-1 fish averaging 11.1 inches.  The remainder were between 9 years and 13 years old and were 25 inches to 28 inches in length.  These older fish appear to be producing intermittent year classes frequently enough to sustain the walleye population.  The one-year old walleye are approaching catchable size and should increase angling opportunity in the coming year.  Walleye, in Lake Ripley, appear to be sustaining themselves with little outside influence. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch rates averaged 5.11/net, which is near the median (4.7/net) for lake class 38. Net catches for northern pike have remained relatively the same as the previous three surveys.  Age analysis indicates consistent recruitment of northern pike with no missing year classes.  Seven year classes of pike were identified with an average size of 20 inches, and a maximum length of 30 inches. Size structure and condition remain at levels expected for Lake Ripley.  Northern pike were last stocked in 1990.  Since then, pike appear to be sustaining themselves in; abundance, condition, and size structure. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catches were near the normal range expected for Lake Ripley.  Trap nets caught an average of 9.1/net in 2015.  Since 1995, bluegill numbers have ranged from a low of 3.4/net in 2000, to a high of 24.3/net in 2010.  During 2015 netting, bluegill averaged 5.6 inches with a maximum length of 8.7 inches.  Age analysis indicates consistent recruitment of bluegills.  Seven different year classes were present in 2015 sampling.  Overall, bluegill abundance appears to be slightly less than average, although the reduction in numbers may have allowed for faster growth and larger sizes. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in Lake Ripley with night time boat electrofishing in 2015. Approximately 16.8 bass were sampled per hour of electrofishing.  This was the highest catch rate of bass in Lake Ripley in the previous 20 years.  Largemouth bass averaged 14.1 inches, with a maximum length of 19.7 inches.  Abundance, size structure, and condition remain high for Lake Ripley. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie gill net catches (2.67/net) were less than the expected rate (6.8/net) for Lake Ripley. However, reduced numbers of crappie have contributed to an increased size structure in 2015.  Average size of crappie sampled, in gill nets, was 10.3 inches, with a maximum size of 13 inches.  With reduced numbers and good size structure, condition of these individuals was also above average.  Black crappie numbers appear to be below historic levels, but the tradeoff is increased size structure and condition of those fish present.  With nearly all fish sampled being over 8 inches and the potential to catch crappie over 12 inches, the black crappie fishery should provide good angling opportunity this year and into the future. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch in Lake Ripley were sampled with gill nets in 2015.  Catch rates of yellow perch were 33.4/net, the highest in 20 years, and well above what would be expected for Lake Ripley.  With high numbers of yellow perch, we would expect size structure to suffer due to increased competition. However, average size of yellow perch in gill nets was 6.7 inches, with a maximum length of 9.8 inches. This was the first year since 1995, that any fish were sampled greater than 8 inches.  While that number was only 18 of the 300 (17%) perch caught, it does provide anglers additional fishing opportunity that may not have been available to them previously.  Yellow perch in Lake Ripley should provide suitable forage for many sport fish, in addition to providing angling opportunity on some of the larger individuals. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead gill net catch rates averaged 16/net in 2015, which is below the rate expected for Lake Ripley.  Decreases in abundance occasionally cause an increase in size structure, which appears to be the case in Lake Ripley.  The average size of black bullhead was 12 inches with a maximum length of 13.5 inches, meaning that over half the bullheads sampled were greater than 12 inches.  Black bullhead numbers remain at a manageable level with consistent recruitment and sizes.  Bullheads, in Lake Ripley, are likely contributing to the forage base for some of the top predators such as walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  In addition, bullheads greater than 12 inches may contribute to a fishable population.</p>",

It has a maximum depth of 22 feet, a median depth of 13 feet, and 67 percent is shallower than 15 feet.  Because of the fertility and the shallowness abundant growths of emergent and submergent vegetation are found. <br> \n <br> \nThe gillnet catches were above average for northern pike and somewhat below average for perch and walleyes.  The trapnet catches were moderately high for black bullheads, about average for black crappies, and somewhat below average for bluegills.  <br> \n <br> \nThe growth rate is quite fast for bluegill, somewhat above average for northern pike and walleyes, and somewhat slow for black crappies. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is most suitable for management of northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ripley is a medium sized lake (614 acres) located next to the City of Litchfield in Meeker County. Ripley has four miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 18 feet. A city owned public access, with a cement boat ramp, and a large amount of parking is present on the east shore. A county owned public access, with a cement boat ramp, is present on the lake's western shore. A fishing pier is also available at the Ripley County Park on the west side of the lake. Spring trap netting, targeting Bluegill and Black Crappie, was completed at Ripley Lake on from May 1st to June 6th. Data was collected for size structure analysis. In addition to Bluegill and Black Crappie, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Hybrid Sunfish were also collected during this assessment. Spring panfish trap netting catches should not be compared to historical summer trap net catches because summer trap net catches sometimes do a poor job of sampling larger Bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nA new sunfish regulation (five fish bag limit) began on March 2022. The regulation was implemented to achieve a high quality sunfish population that includes more large fish exceeding 8 inches). Anglers can find sunfish scattered throughout Ripley's submergent vegetation beds. Bigger Bluegill are often found in deeper water during the mid-summer months and offshore vegetation can be fairly dense some years at Ripley - making those larger sunfish tough to locate. Try dragging a waxworm under a sinker in 8 to 10 feet of water in mid-summer if you cannot find the big sunnies up shallow. The scattered submergent vegetation beds along the north shore are popular with winter sunfish anglers. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie recruitment appeared to be inconsistent at Ripley Lake. Crappie can sometimes be found off the deep weed edges in the summer using a small minnow under a bobber. Winter fishing pressure can be substantial at Ripley Lake and crappie are often found along the deeper flats or breaks, and around the deep hole.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Ripley Lake has the AIS - Eurasian watermilfoil. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

Ripley has almost 4 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 18 feet. A fishing pier is present at the park on the western shore. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Ripley is a class 38 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Sleepy Eye Lake in Brown County and Clear Lake - Watkins in Meeker County.      <br> \n <br> \nRipley Lake is a classic bass/panfish type of lake, with good amounts of submergent vegetation providing excellent fish habitat. Anglers can expect decent action from Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike, along with an occasional Walleye. Northern Pike were abundant in 2021, with fish averaging 20 inches in length, and maxing out at 30 inches. Water clarity is often good enough for spearing pike during the winter at Ripley. Many methods (casting and trolling artificial lures to soaking a sucker minnow) will take this aggressive predator. Crappie numbers were similar to the previous assessment in 2015 and on the low side when compared to historical catches going back to 1958. In 2021, gill netted Black Crappie were 7 to 13 inches long, averaging 8 inches. Try the bulrush beds on the north side of the lake in the spring if you are seeking crappie or just off the deep weed edge in mid-summer. Bluegill are not typically evaluated using gill nets, but fish up to 9 inches in length were sampled this year. Spring trap netting targeting Bluegill was also conducted at Ripley in 2021 and results are contained in a separate report. A new sunfish regulation (reduced bag limit of 5 fish) was implemented at Ripley Lake in March of 2022. The goal of the regulation is to increase sunfish size and provide opportunities for large individual sunfish. Ripley is well known for producing some lunker Largemouth Bass and fish up to 19 inches in length were captured during this assessment. Fair numbers of Walleye were netted with fish averaging 16 inches in length and maxing out at 25 inches. Ripley's Walleye population is the result of natural reproduction and/or immigration from other lakes or the North Fork of the Crow River via Jewitt Creek.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter include Black Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Smallmouth Bass, and Yellow Bullhead. Of interest, this was the first year that Smallmouth Bass were gill netted at Ripley Lake and how they got there is unknown.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Eurasian watermilfoil is now present in Ripley Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Ripley is a popular recreational lake adjacent to the City of Litchfield.  Public parks are located on the east and west shores.  A heavily used swimming beach can be found on the east side.  The lake has a history of being an excellent fishing lake for largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill and black crappie.  The shoalwater substrates are predominantly firm in nature which provide excellent spawning habitat for bass, bluegills and crappies.  Access to marshy areas upstream of inlets provides excellent spawning habitat for northern pike.  Lake Ripley outlets into Jewitt Creek to the north and eventually into the North Fork Crow River.  The dam at the outlet of Lake Ripley prevents fish migration and may limit available fish habitat.  In 1995, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources - Section of Fisheries, conducted a lake survey to evaluate the present fish population.  Sampling equipment used in this survey included lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and shoreline seine.  Night electrofishing was also done in the spring to better evaluate the largemouth bass population.  Fifteen different fish species were sampled during the survey.  Fish species of particular interest included flathead catfish.   The black crappie trapnet catch rate of 2.9 fish per net was on the low end of the normal range for  this lake class.  Though there are black crappies over 9 inches, most are 4.0 to 5.5 inches in length.  The natural reproduction of black crappies appears to be good.  Bluegill natural reproduction appears to be good with ages 1-6 fish being present.  The trapnet catch rate of 6.2 per net was below the median catch (15.9 per net) for this lake class.  Of the bluegill sampled, 37.5 % were at least 7 inches in length with the largest bluegill being just over 8 inches.  During the survey, one flathead catfish was sampled.  The catfish was 38.6 inches in length and was estimated to be in excess of 17 years old.  This fish was likely one that survived from stocking in 1974 or 1975.  Channel catfish were stocked into Lake Ripley in 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1978, and again in 1982.  Though there are no present plans to stock catfish into Lake Ripley, anglers may still catch an occasional large fish.  Lake Ripley has a reputation of being a good lake for largemouth bass.  The catch rate of 1 fish per net is above the normal range for this lake class.  Largemouth bass reproduction is excellent with five different age classes sampled.  Many largemouth bass sampled were in the 12 to 18 inch range with an average length being 10.9 inches. The relatively sandy bottom and good stands of bullrushes provide valuable habitat for bass.        The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 17.6 per net was above the normal range for this lake class.  Age 1 and age 2 northerns comprised 89% of the sample.  Natural reproduction is evident as the last stocking of northern pike occurred in 1990.  Growth appears to be good with age 1 northerns being 12 inches in length and age 2 fish being 20.4 inches.  The largest northern pike sampled was 31 inches in length.  The walleye net catch rate of 4.1 per net was above the normal range.  Age classes represented included ages 2,3,4,7, and 8.  Age 3 walleyes comprised 62.9% of the sample.  Natural reproduction is evident as the only recorded walleye stocking consisted of fingerling stockings in 1979 and 1981.  Walleyes in the strong 1992 year class had an average length of 16.1 inches.  The yellow perch gillnet catch rate of 33.8 per net was well above the normal range; however most yellow perch were less than 7 inches in length.  The high numbers of yellow perch provide an excellent forage base for predators such as northern pike and walleye.  The black bullhead catch rate of 1.8 per net was considerably lower than the 1992 catch rate (69.3 per net).  Lengths of black bullheads ranged from 9.9 to 11.6 inches with an average length of 10.4 inches.  The carp trapnet catch rate of 1.1 per net was within the normal range (0.4 per net - 2.4 per net) for this lake class.  Carp lengths ranged from 20.2 to 24.2 inches with an average length of 21.8 inches.  The yellow bullhead trapnet catch rate of 4.3 per net fell within the normal range (1.0 per net - 7.1 per net) for this lake class.  Lengths of yellow bullheads ranged from 6.2 to 12.4 inches with an average length of 10.2 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ripley is a medium sized lake (614 acres) located next to the City of Litchfield in Meeker County. Ripley has four miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 18 feet. A city owned public access with a cement boat ramp and a large amount of parking is present on the east shore. A county-owned public access with a cement boat ramp is found on the lake's western shore. A fishing pier is also available at the Ripley County Park on the west side of the lake. Spring trap netting targeting Bluegill and Black Crappie was completed at Ripley Lake on May 16, 2022. Data was collected for size structure analysis. In addition to Bluegill and Black Crappie, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Hybrid Sunfish were also collected during this assessment. Spring panfish trap netting catches should not be compared to historical summer trap net catches because summer trap net catches do a poor job of representatively sampling Bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Bluegill were collected in 2022 and fish were 3 to 8 inches long, averaging a little over 6 inches. Approximately 19% of the sample was 7 inches or longer, showing that fair numbers of keeper-sized fish were present. A new Sunfish regulation (five fish bag limit) went into effect on March 1, 2022. Size structure of Bluegill is believed to have declined over the decades at Ripley Lake and the new regulation should limit harvest enough to improve sunfish sizes over time.  <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Black Crappie were collected in 2022, and fish were 8 to 11 inches long, averaging slightly over 8 inches. Crappie recruitment appeared to be inconsistent at Ripley Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Ripley Lake has the AIS - Eurasian watermilfoil. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Ripley Lake in 2010 to monitor the fish population. Near-shore seining and backpack electrofishing were also conducted.  The lake was well mixed with the dissolved oxygen concentration being 6.4 mg/l at 15 feet.  Water clarity was only 2' due to an algae bloom.  The exotic species, Eurasian watermilfoil and curly-leaf pondweed have been documented in Ripley Lake and anglers should check their boats and trailers carefully when leaving the lake.  Fishing pressure was moderate during netting week, and included pier anglers at the park.  Ripley is primarily managed for northern pike, bluegill, and largemouth bass. <br> \n  <br> \nGill nets sampled 24 walleye for a catch rate of 2.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 4.0/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2010 (n=10) were generally low ranging from 0.0 to 4.1/net averaging 1.9.  Walleye were last stocked in 1981.  In 2010, walleye were 19.7 to 25.4 inches long averaging 21.7 inches.  Walleye were 4 to 16 years old with 7 year-classes present and all were the result of natural reproduction.  The 2006 year-class was most abundant, making up 38% of the aged fish.  Growth was fast.     <br> \n  <br> \nGill nets sampled 57 northern pike for a catch rate of 6.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 3.3/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2010 (n=10) were highly variable ranging from 2.2 to 17.6/net averaging 7.4.  Northern pike were last stocked in 1990.  Catch rates from 1958 to 1992 (n=6) had an average of 7.1/net compared to catch rates from 1995 to 2010 (n=4) having an average of 7.9/net.  Northern pike were 17.1 to 30.3 inches long averaging 21.8 in 2010.  Northern pike were 1 to 6 years old with 6 year-classes present.  Most (70%) northern pike were 1 or 2 year olds.  Growth was moderate.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 96 yellow perch for a catch rate of 10.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 7.9/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2010 (n=6) were variable ranging from 0.3 to 35.9/net averaging 15.5.  Yellow perch were the most abundant fish sampled in both gill and trap nets in 2010.  Yellow perch were 3.7 to 7.8 inches long averaging 6.2.  Yellow perch are likely an important forage item at Ripley, but seldom reach an acceptable size for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 15 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 9.0/hr.  The catch rate in 2005 was 6.3/hr.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2010 (n=5) were fairly low and stable ranging from 5.7 to 13.3/hr averaging 8.1.  Largemouth bass were 8.1 to 16.9 inches long averaging 12.9.  Largemouth bass were 2 to 8 years old with 7 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate.  Electrofishing catch rates were likely underestimating the quality of the largemouth bass population at Ripley.  Offshore submergent vegetation provides excellent habitat for largemouth bass, but it's in too deep of water to be effectively sampled using electrofishing.       <br> \n  <br> \nGill nets sampled 88 black crappie for a catch rate of 9.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 1.0/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2010 (n=10) were variable ranging from 1.0 to 21.7/net averaging 9.5.  Black crappie were 4.1 to 11.5 inches long averaging 6.6 in 2010.  Approximately 13% of the gill net sample was 8 inches or longer, while 8% were 10.5 to 11.49 inches long.  Black crappie were 1 to 6 years old with 6 year-classes present.  Age 2 fish made up 69% of the gill net catch and 68% of the trap net catch, inidcating a strong year-class.  Growth was slow to moderate.  The trap net catch rate (7.6/net) was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 2.1/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2010 were variable ranging from 0.2 to 9.7/net averaging 3.9.  Trap netted black crappie were 3.7 to 10.7 inches long averaging 6.3.    Approximately 10% of the trap net sample was 8 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 219 bluegill for a catch rate of 24.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was the second highest ever recorded at Ripley Lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 16.1/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2010 (n=10) were variable ranging from 3.4 to 28.9/net averaging 12.8.  Assessments from 2000 to 2010 (n=3) showed an increasing trend in bluegill abundance at Ripley Lake.  Trap netted bluegill were 3.1 to 8.3 inches long averaging 5.4.  Approximately 8% of the trap net sample was 7 inches or longer.  Ripley is one of the few lakes in the Hutchinson Management Area where 8 inch long bluegill are consistently sampled.  Bluegill were 1 to 6 years old with 6 year-classes present.  Growth was fairly slow.   <br> \n    <br> \nTrap nets sampled 2 carp for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 0.1/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2010 were generally low ranging from 0.0 to 3.8/net averaging 0.8.  Gill nets sampled 0 carp in 2000, 2005, and 2010.  Gill net catch rates from 1958 to 2010 were generally low ranging from 0.0 to 27.3/net with an average of 3.2 and a median of 0.0.  Carp catch rates (n=4) from both gill and trap nets were low from 1995 to 2010.  Trap netted carp were 27.3 to 29.1 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 48 black bullhead for a catch rate of 5.3/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 27.9/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2010 were highly variable ranging from 5.3 to 167.8/net averaging 48.6.  Black bullhead were 4.4 to 14.7 inches long averaging 11.7 in 2010.  Trap nets (0.3/net) also sampled low numbers of black bullhead in 2010.  The 2005 catch rate was 0.6/net.  Trap net catch rates from 1958 to 2010 were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 69.3/net averaging 14.1. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Ripley to monitor the lakes physical, chemical and biological charecteristics.  The lakes watershed was dominated by row crop agriculture.  Much of the shoreline is city park and a campground on the east end of the lake is well used.  A fishing pier is present on the west side of the lake.  Moderate amounts of aquatic vegetation were present at Ripley Lake during late summer 2005.  Eurasian watermilfoil, an exotic plant species, was also sampled.Fair numbers of northern pike were gill netted, ranging from 18.5-37.2 inches in length.  Northern pike averaged 22.8 inches.  Moderate numbers of walleye were gill netted, for this type of lake, ranging in length from 10.0-25.9 inches.  Walleye averaged 20.0 inches.  The 2005 walleye catch rate (4.0/net) was almost identical to the all time high catch rate from 1995 (4.1/net).  Walleye were last stocked in 1981, indicating that natural reproduction is sustaining the fishery.  Moderate numbers of bluegill were trap netted and quality sized fish were present.  Bluegill were 0.6-8.5 inches long, averaging 5.0 inches.  Approximately 10% of the trap netted bluegill were 7 inches or longer and several of the fish surpassed 8 inches.  Fair numbers of black crappie were trap netted, but size was small.  The longest black crappie trap netted was 4.4 inches.  Spring night-time electrofishing was used to sample the largemouth bass population.  Fair numbers of largemouth bass were captured, ranging from 4.2-20.5 inches in length.  A lack a near shore vegetation may be responsible for the less than expected electrofishing catch rate at Ripley Lake.  Moderate numbers of yellow and black bullhead were sampled, including some fish over 12 inches.  Only 1 carp was captured in 2005.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nBlack bullhead catch rates are low in the trap nets, but gill net catch rates are well above past netting indices; and local, regional and state medians.  Northern pike, bluegill and black crappie growth rates are good.  Most year classes are present for major gamefish species.  Bluegill age group 4 appears to be missing, and age group 3 appears to be weak.  Walleye have not been stocked since 1981.  Since age groups 1-8 are present, except for age group 2, either minimal natural reproduction is occurring or persons outside the DNR are stocking the lake.  Migration into Lake Ripley may have occurred through Jewitt Creek, but was highly unlikely during the last two years because of low water.  No largemouth bass sampled in gill nets or trap nets, although locals report, they are commonly caught while fishing on Lake Ripley.  One reason that largemouth bass may not have been sampled is that the sampling gear (gill nets and trap nets) that we used is not effective for capturing this fish species.  Largemouth bass were observed while shoreline seining.  Channel catfish have been stocked in the past, the latest stocking being in 1982.  No channel catfish have been sampled in the netting since the 1974 survey, which showed a catch rate of 0.25/gill net.  In the past, there have been occasional reports of channel catfish being caught.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nTest netting shows northern pike to be abundant at 11/gillnet.  These are predominantly age 3 fish that average nearly two pounds each.  Yellow perch are also present in relatively high numbers (33/gillnet), but no walleyes were taken.  Bluegills were captured at a rate of 30/trapnet.  These were mostly 4-6 inches in length, and age 2 fish.  Fishing for large bluegills is considered excellent at Lake Ripley.  Trap net catches of black crappies equaled 5.5/pot.  This figure is well below the local catch rate of 21/pot.  The sample of black crappies was fairly evenly distributed between age 2, age 3, and age 4 individuals, and growth is average.  No catfish were taken during the survey, but a local commercial fisherman captured ten large fish during hoop-netting operations.  Black and yellow bullheads are present in relatively low numbers and no carp were taken during the survey.  Shoreline seining reveals that natural reproduction occurred for largemouth bass, bluegill, perch, bullheads and northern pike.</p>",
