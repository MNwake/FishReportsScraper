Public access is allowed but motorized equipment is not.  Shore fishing exists along the face of the highway 75 dam, in its tailwaters, and at a new handicapped-accessible shore fishing spot at no-bridge, just outside of Odessa.  Fishing opportunities also exist at the low flow structure in the northeast corner of the East Pool.  Ice fishing is also common during winter months.  This is the first resurvey of the refuge pool since 1988. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will not find walleye to be abundant in the East Pool, but average size was large.  Most of the walleye observed were 17-26 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were slightly more abundant than average for lakes similar to the East Pool.  Pike ranged in size from 17 inches to almost 35 inches.  All of the pike were less than 4 years old, with most being from the 2006 year class.  A total of three young-of-year pike were captured, indicating some natural reproduction in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were also a common game fish, with good size.  Average size was 9.5 inches long and 0.6 lb, but fish up to 13 inches were observed.  A large number of  YOY black crappie were also sampled, indicating a strong 2008 year class.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass abundance was low, with most fish being small and one-year-old.  The 2007 year class made up 83% of the white bass aged.  Average size was 10.4 inches long and 0.7 lb.   <br> \n <br> \nOther game fish that were sampled in low abundance were channel catfish, bluegill, rock bass, and yellow perch.  Non-game fish made up the majority of fish sampled, with the most abundant being common carp, shorthead redhorse, and white sucker.  Future management activities include fish stocking, dissolved oxygen monitoring, and fish surveys as needed. <br> \n</p>",

Public access is allowed but motorized equipment is not.  Shore fishing exists along the face of the highway 75 dam, in its tail waters, and at a handicapped-accessible shore fishing location at No-Bridge, just outside of Odessa.  Fishing opportunities also exist at the low flow structure (including handicap-accessible) in the northeast corner of the East Pool.  Ice fishing is also common during winter months.     <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-three fish species were sampled in 2013 compared to 30 in 2008.  Underutilized species such as black bullhead, white sucker, and shorthead redhorse were the most abundant species sampled.  Game fish species were sampled in low abundance.  Sampled black crappie ranged from 5 - 11 inches, channel catfish from 7 - 25 inches, northern pike from 21 - 32 inches, and walleye from 12 - 17 inches.    Although abundances were low, anglers have reported having moderate success for northern pike and walleye, particular during winter. <br> \n <br> \nFuture fish management activities include stocking 1.5 million walleye fry in 2014, and fish population assessment in 2018. <br> \n</p>",
