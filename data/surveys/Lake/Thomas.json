Access is by several portages which typically take at least one day of travel time. There are eighteen designated USFS campsites located around the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2012 (13.7/gill net) were higher than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. Walleye were from nine different year classes but were mostly 3 to 7 years old and between 15 to 22 inches long. The largest walleye sampled was 25.6 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nLake trout numbers in 2012 (1.9/gill net) were similar to the long term average for all assessments on this lake. The average lake trout sampled was 19.1 inches long which is larger than average for all assessments on this lake. The largest lake trout sampled was 35.0 inches long. Lake trout growth rates appear to be slow compared to other similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species present in 2012 include northern pike, yellow perch, rock bass, cisco and white sucker. Northern pike (1.3/gill net) are present in low numbers. Cisco are a key forage species and are relatively abundant in the deeper basins. <br> \n</p>",
