The near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from August 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish IBI for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but two sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing. A 15-foot seine was not used, a 50-foot seine was used at 7 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 3 sites. Nearshore sampling captured one intolerant fish species, banded killifish. <br> \n <br> \nSugar lake falls within lake class 29 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 4 lakes for evaluating IBI data. IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 38 (CI 30-46) and the potential exceptional quality level is set at 59. The IBI score, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2016 standard assessment, calculated from this survey was 63.8 and exceptionally high. <br> \n  <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Sugar Lake is located in the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sugar Lake is a 400-acre lake located east of Glen in south central Aitkin County, with a public access is on the south side of the lake. Most of the lake is less than 15 feet deep with a 25 foot hole in the east end of the lake and a 45 foot deep area in the south central part of the lake.  The water is moderately clear with a light algae bloom.  Anglers will find several species in Sugar Lake including walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill and rock bass.  The walleye population is supported by walleye stocking and there are several year classes present.  Walleye caught in the gill nets ranged from 12 to 20 inches in length with an average length of 17 inches and an average weight of one and three-quarter pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are moderately abundant with a wide range of sizes available to the angler.  Northern pike caught in this survey ranged from 10 to 36 inches in length.  The average northern caught was almost 20 inches long and weighed almost 2 pounds.  The majority of northern pike sampled were less than 25 inches long, however there were several fish sampled that would be considered memorable size.  Anglers fishing for black crappie should have some good fishing over the next few years.  Crappies were found in good numbers and recruitment appears to be consistent.  The fish sampled averaged about 3/4 of a pound in size, and included a couple fish over 12 inches.  Bluegill continued their pattern of slow growth.  While not overly abundant for this lake type their growth rates are slower than average with individuals rarely reaching 7 inches in length. Sugar Lake has both largemouth bass and smallmouth bass present.  The largemouth are far more abundant with only one smallmouth sampled in this survey, which were never sampled in previous surveys.  The largemouth sampled averaged almost 12 inches in length with two 17-inch fish being caught.  The mean length of rock bass was slightly over 8 inches. <br> \n</p>",

Fingerlings will be stocked at a rate of 1 lb/LA (267 lbs) in 2019, and 2022.  Night electrofishing in the fall will be used in 2 of the 4 fry stocked years to assess the survival of YOY Walleye.  Sampling was conducted on 9/05/2018.  No YOY Walleye were caught during a total sample time of 1 hour.  A total of 5 adult Walleye were caught resulting in a total Walleye catch rate of 5/hour (rate reported as run time).  Walleye ranged in length from 12.6 - 15.6 inches.  Standard assessments in 2020 and 2025, and an additional gill net only targeted assessment in 2023, will assist in evaluating the new program.  Prior to this change the lake was stocked with 2 lbs fgl/LA (534 lbs) in alternate years. The next fall electrofishing survey will be conducted in the fall of 2020 or 2021.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sugar Lake's diverse fishery targets northern pike, walleyes, black crappies, bluegills, largemouth bass and other fishes. The walleye population, which is composed mostly of fish from stocked year classes, is diverse in size and age structure. Walleyes ranged up to 31.0 inches in length and averaged 18.7 inches. The catch rate of 3.3 walleyes per survey net set is above average for this type of lake. The large mean length indicates that walleyes may be difficult to catch in Sugar Lake. The stocking program is successful at providing a quality walleye fishery in the lake.    Northern pike were caught at a normal rate for this lake type. Pike ranged up to 35.0 inches long and averaged 18.1 inches. A wide and consistent distribution of pike sizes indicates a stable population. Growth is a bit slow for smaller pike yet growth is normal for larger pike.    Black crappie abundance is relatively low for this lake type, yet some of the fish reach lengths preferred by anglers. Crappie abundance has not been high in any of the previous surveys. Bluegills, despite not being overly abundant, continue to grow slowly and few bluegills reach 7 inches long.    Few largemouth bass were caught in this survey. Production of new fish, or recruitment, was consistently low in the past few years. The forage for bass is adequate, resulting in normal growth rates for most age classes represented in this and past surveys.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sugar Lake is a 398-acre lake located east of Glen, in south central Aitkin County, and has a state owned public access on the south shore.  About 60 percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep with a 25 foot hole in the east end of the lake and a 45 foot deep area in the south central part of the lake.  The water is moderately clear with a green color from light algae blooms.  Anglers will find several species in Sugar Lake, including Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, Bluegill, Rock Bass and an occasional Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n\t <br> \nWalleye gill net catch rates increased from 0.33/net in 2016 to 2.9/net in 2021 and met the management goal of 2/net.  The majority of Walleye sampled came from good survival of the age 2 fish from the 2019 year class.  Mean length for Walleye was 14 inches, with individuals measuring up to 23 inches.  Walleye stocking efforts of high density fingerlings had proven to be unsuccessful over the past decade and was replaced with experimental fry stocking for two years, followed by fingerling stocking in case the fry were unsuccessful at producing year classes.  Evaluation by fall electrofishing and now by gill netting have shown no survival from fry stocking indicating fingerlings are probably the best option. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch rate for Northern Pike was 10.0/net and has been pretty stable over time.  It was also within the expected range for this lake type.  The size structure of the fishery was remained good for the area.  The catch rate of pike 24 inches and longer was similar to previous surveys and about 18 percent of the entire sample was greater than 26 inches, including 8 individuals greater than 30 inches.  There has been an increasing trend of larger pike in the assessment nets since 1970, when none were observed.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies are the primary management species for the lake and tend to have average growth rates and survival.  Currently there are several good year classes available to the angler, providing for good fishing opportunities.  Gill net catch rates for Black Crappie increased from 3.4/net in 2016 to 7.0/net in 2021.  This was the highest catch rate observed since 2006 (11.3/net), was above the normal range for this lake type, and helped meet the management goal of achieving over 5/net within a 20 year period.  Crappie had a mean length of 8.4 inches and a maximum length of 11.6 inches, meeting the remainder of the management goal of having fish over 11 inches in every assessment.  The abundance of Black Crappie over 10 inches in the gill net samples was the second highest observed in all surveys since 1980 indicating a quality fishery. <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has both Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass present.  Largemouth Bass are far more abundant than Smallmouth Bass, which were not observed in this year's standard survey gear.  They have been sampled in previous years' standard assessments and were observed as young-of-the-year in the 2016 IBI survey (Targeted Assessment July 19, 2016) and as far back as the 1990 survey seining sample.  Largemouth bass up to 18 inches were sampled, and 12.5 inches was the average length. <br> \n <br> \nWhile there is no overall trend in Perch abundance, this catch rate was the lowest observed since 1974 and it appears they have been declining in the gill net samples over the last 5 surveys. Perch are exceedingly important as food items for Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nDue to Sugar Lake's proximity to Mille Lacs, aquatic invasive species are of great concern.  Anglers are encouraged to take extra precautions to help stop the spread of invasive species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This targeted assessment was to assist with the evaluation of a new stocking strategy for Sugar Lake that was implemented in 2017. The new plan called for stocking 133,500 fry in 2017, 2018, 2020 (*not stocked due to Covid 19) and 2021. Fingerlings were stocked at a rate of 1 lb/LA (267 lbs) in 2019 and will be again in 2022.  Night electrofishing in the fall was to be used in 2 of the 4 fry stocked years to assess the survival of young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye. Sampling was conducted on 9/22/2021. No YOY or adult Walleye were caught during a total sample time of 1 hour, which equated to sampling the entire west basin of the lake.  Conditions were ideal for sampling with a calm wind, cool temperature and clear skies. Results from the 2018 electrofishing also yielded no YOY Walleye. Standard assessments in 2021 and 2025, and an additional gill net only targeted assessment in 2023, will assist in evaluating the new program. Prior to this change the lake was stocked with 2 lbs fgl/LA (534 lbs) in alternate years. </p>",

Northern pike sampled (46 of 46 aged) ranged from one to eight plus years of age with most of the fish sampled from the 1986, 1987 and 1988 year classes.  The growth rates for the third, fourth and fifth increments were slower than normal. Bluegill sampled (37 of 107 aged) ranged from three to eight plus years of age with strong year classes represented for 1984 and 1985.  Growth rates for the second through the seventh increments were slower than normal. Largemouth bass sampled (13 of 14 aged) ranged from one to four years of age.  Growth rates were normal for the first three increments. Black crappie sampled (19 of 28 aged) ranged from two to seven years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1988.  The growth rate for the first increment was slower than normal.  The growth rate for the third and fourth increments were faster than normal.  Length at formation of the fourth annulus was normal. Yellow perch sampled (14 of 14 aged) ranged from three to six years of age with a strong year c lass indicated for 1987.  The growth rates for the third and fourth increments were faster than normal.  Length at formation of the fifth annulus was normal. Walleye sampled (19 of 19 aged) ranged from two to eight plus years of age.  The growth rates for the first and second increments were slower than normal.  The growth rates for the fifth and sixth increments were faster than normal.  Overall growth rate through six years were normal.  From these data an increase in walleye abundance from stocking could not be determined.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sugar Lake is a 400-acre lake located east of Glen in south central Aitkin County, and has a state owned public access on the south shore.  About 60 percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep with a 25 foot hole in the east end of the lake and a 45 foot deep area in the south central part of the lake.  The water is moderately clear with a light algae bloom.  Anglers will find several species in Sugar Lake, including walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, bluegill, rock bass and an occasional smallmouth bass.   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population is supported by walleye fingerling stocking and, although numbers were not high, there were several year classes present.  Walleye caught in the gill nets ranged from 11 to 28 inches in length with an average length of 19 inches and an average weight of 2.8 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were abundant with a wide range of sizes available to the angler.  Northern pike caught in this survey ranged from 10 to 43 inches in length.  The average pike caught was on the smaller side at around 19 inches, yet approximately 20% of pike sampled were greater than 24 inches long.  Anglers are encouraged to protect and to maximize the benefit of this quality pike fishery by practicing catch and release on these larger individuals.  Recycling these exceptional fish is the best way to catch another in the future. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies are the primary management species for the lake and tend to have good growth rates and survival.  Currently there are several good year classes available to the angler, providing for good fishing opportunities. Gill net catch rates for black crappie have fluctuated over survey history, as is normal with crappie populations, and have shown a significant decrease from the historical high of 11.3/net in 2006. Gill net catch rates for black crappie in 2011 were 3.4/net, which was still within the normal range for this lake type. While total numbers of crappie have gone down somewhat, the quality size distribution continues to improve.  The percent of crappie over 10 inches has increased each survey year since 1990. Crappie had a mean length of 8.8 inches and a maximum length of 12.9 inches, meeting one of the lakes management goals of maintaining fish over 11 inches in the population.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough still within normal ranges, bluegill declined to the lowest catch ever recorded; however, despite their low abundance, bluegill growth rates continued to be slower than average, with no individuals reaching 8 inches. While preferred sized bluegills were absent, hybrid sunfish were nearly as abundant as bluegill and fish up to 8.4 inches were observed in the trap nets. These bluegill x pumpkinseed crosses likely account for a good share of the angler harvest of sunfish in Sugar Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has both largemouth bass and smallmouth bass present.  Largemouth bass are far more abundant and only two smallmouth were sampled in the standard survey gear, both of which were large fish (19-20 inches). Largemouth bass approaching 19 inches were caught, while 12-15 inch fish were most common.   <br> \n <br> \nDue to Sugar Lake's proximity to Mille Lacs, aquatic invasive species are of great concern.  Anglers are encouraged to take extra precautions to help stop the spread of invasive species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sugar Lake is a 398-acre lake located east of Glen, in south central Aitkin County, and has a state owned public access on the south shore. About 60 percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep with a 25 foot hole in the east end of the lake and a 45 foot deep area in the south central part of the lake. The water is moderately clear with a light algae bloom. Anglers will find several species in Sugar Lake, including walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, bluegill, rock bass and an occasional smallmouth bass. <br> \n\t <br> \nThe walleye population has been supported by walleye fingerling stocking and, although numbers were not high, there were several year classes present. Mean length for walleye was 17 inches with one individual longer than 26 inches in the sample. Growth rates were normal. Walleye stocking efforts of high density fingerlings has had poor success over the past decade and has been replaced with a fry and fingerling stocking plan. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were abundant with a wide range of sizes available to the angler. Northern pike caught in this survey ranged from 10 to 34 inches in length. The average pike caught was on the smaller side at around 19.5 inches, yet approximately 27% of pike sampled were greater than 24 inches long. Anglers are encouraged to protect and to maximize the benefit of this quality pike fishery by practicing catch and release on these larger individuals. Recycling these exceptional fish is the best way to catch another in the future. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies are the primary management species for the lake and tend to have average growth rates and survival. Currently there are several good year classes available to the angler, providing for good fishing opportunities. Gill net catch rates for black crappie were similar to what they were in the 2011 survey at 3.4/net, which was still within the normal range for this lake type. Crappie had a mean length of 8.3 inches and a maximum length of 13.5 inches, which met one of the lakes management goals of maintaining fish over 11 inches in the population. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill CPUE from the trap nets has increased since 2011 (11.3/net), to 19.9/net in 2016, which is just under the long term average (20.2/net). Bluegill growth rates have typically been slower than average, and no individuals were observed that had reached 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has both largemouth bass and smallmouth bass present. Largemouth bass are far more abundant than smallmouth bass, which were not observed in this year's standard survey gear.  They have been sampled in previous years' standard assessments and were observed as young-of-the-year in the 2016 IBI survey (Targeted Assessment July 19, 2016). Largemouth bass approaching 20 inches were sampled, and 12.5 inches was the average length. <br> \n <br> \nDue to Sugar Lake's proximity to Mille Lacs, aquatic invasive species are of great concern. Anglers are encouraged to take extra precautions to help stop the spread of invasive species. <br> \n <br> \nAs referred to earlier, in addition to the standard summer field work, IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) sampling was also conducted in 2016.  IBI sampling included backpack electrofishing and seining to more broadly sample the general fish community and develop a fish-based index of overall lake health (see Targeted Assessment 7/19/2016). <br> \n</p>",

IBI sampling included backpack electrofishing and seining to more broadly sample the general fish community and develop a fish-based index of overall lake health.  This survey is a repeat of IBI components completed during the regularly scheduled population assessment and is meant to provide a means to evaluate quality control of IBI sampling protocols.  The IBI score calculated from this assessment was 81.  See Sugar Lake 2011 PA (8/8/2011) for more information.</p>",
