                "narrative": "<p>Lizzard Lake is a 136-acre lake with a maximum depth of 48 feet.  It is located six miles east Hackensack.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Lizzard Lake is in lake class 32.  Approximately 67% of the lake is fifteen feet or less in depth. There is no public access on the lake.Northern pike abundance was the highest since the 1973 survey and was typical of other lake class 32 lakes.  Northern pike sampled ranged in length from 15 to 32 inches with an average an length and weight of 23.3 inches and 3.1 pounds.  Since there are no inlets or outlets for northern pike to use for spawning, all spawning occurs in the lake.  Because of this, it is important that all shoreline be left in its natural state.  Growth was good compared to other area class 32 lakes.  At five years old, northern pike were 25 inches long.Bluegill were sampled at a rate that was typical of previous surveys and of other lakes in class 32.  Fish ranged in length from 3.5 to 6.1 inches with an average length and weight of 5.0 inches and 0.1 pound.  There are few bluegill of the size that would be acceptable to anglers.  In 1973, bluegill showed good quality with many bluegill seven and eight inches long sampled.  Slow growth rate coupled with fishing pressure has impacted desirable-sized bluegill.  An age four bluegill was 3.7 inches long.  Sampled black crappie ranged in length from 4.7 to 9.4 inches with an average length and weight of 7.4 inches and 0.2 pounds.  There was reduction in size from the 1990 survey.Three walleye were sampled that ranged in length from 16 to 25 inches.  All fish were the result of natural reproduction.Yellow perch abundance has decreased since the first survey in 1973.  Yellow perch is the primary food fish for northern pike.  Other fish sampled were pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and white sucker.The number of lake homes increased from 34 in 1973 to 62 in 1997.   A large percentage of Lizzard Lake shoreline is privately owned.  There is approximately  ? mile of shoreline on the east side of the lake that is in public ownership.  As demand increases for lakeshore lots in the Hackensack-Longville area, increased development of Lizzard Lake shoreline appears very likely. To help maintain quality fish populations in Lizzard Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife.  They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff water.  They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Island Lake is also needed for maintaining water quality. Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the quality of the fishpopulation and provide anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

THE TRAPNET CATCH OF 99.8 IS HIGH.  MOST OF THE FISH A RE SMALL - 6 TO 7 INCHES LONG. THE BLUEGILL TRAPNET CATCH OF 157/NET IS HIGH .  THE SAMPLE MEASURED EXHIBITED VERY POOR QUALITY - NO FISH GREATER THAN 6 INCHES LONG.  THE SAMPLE MEASURED DURING THE 1973 ASSESSMENT EXHIBITED MUC H GREATER QUALITY.  THE GROWTH RATE FOR BLUEGILL I S VERY SLOW. CONSIDERING THE TYPES OF SAMPLING GEAR USED, A FAI R NUMBER OF LARGEMOUTH BASS AND BLACK CRAPPIES WER E SAMPLED.  THE LARGEMOUTH RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 5 TO 14 INCHES LOING.  THEIR GROWTH RATE IS SLOW. THE BLACK CRAPPIE COLLECTED RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 5 TO 12 INCHES.  THEIR GROWTH RATE IS SLOW.

                "narrative": "<p>Lizard Lake is a 136 acre lake located in northern Cass County  approximately six miles east of Hackensack. Lizardhas a maximum depth of 48 feet with 67 percent of the lake having a depth less than 15 feet.  The MinnesotaDepartment of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different types, based on physicaland chemical parameters. Lizard Lake is in lake class  32. Other area lakes in this class include: Moccasin (11-296), Barnum (11-281), Kego (11-182) and Stevens (11-116).  Species of fish angled for include northern pike,walleye, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. Northern pike were captured in relatively low numbers but had a quality average size.  The average northern pikesampled was 24.8 inches and 3.7 pounds. Individuals as large as 32.9 inches were also sampled. Northern pike inLizard Lake should provide ample opportunity for quality fishing. A few good sized walleye were sampled during this survey.  They averaged 24.2 inches and 5.1 pounds.  Poorspawning habitat along with a lack of adequate forage for small walleye likely limits the number present in thelake. Stocking of walleye could prove to reduce average size of northern pike because of the limited amount ofyellow perch available.Numbers of bluegill sampled declined from previous surveys but were captured at rates typical of other class 32lakes.  Bluegill were small with an average size of only 4.7 inches with few fish measuring over six inches.During the 1973 survey, many bluegill larger than 7 inches were sampled along with individuals nearly 10 incheslong. The decline in the quality of the bluegill fishery can be attributed to angler over-harvest of quality sizebluegill. Bluegill currently remaining in Lizard Lake would not be acceptable to the average angler. A veryrestrictive harvest regulation may be needed to improve the quality of the bluegill population in Lizard Lake.To maintain and promote a healthy fish population on Lizard, lake shore residents and other users of the lakeshould protect fish habitat by preserving natural habitat including aquatic vegetation.  Lake shore residents canalso help preserve Lizard Lake's water quality by such actions as having a properly built and maintained septicsystem; by avoiding the use of lawn or garden chemicals near the lake; and by establishing a buffer strip ofnatural vegetation along their shoreline.  Anglers can help maintain fishing quality by practicing catch andrelease of larger fish.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Trillium Lake, also known as Lizzard Lake, is a 136-acre lake located near Hackensack, MN with no public access.  With a maximum depth of 48 feet, approximately 67% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Trillium Lake is in Lake Class 32; lakes in this class are generally large, high littoral area, turbid and irregular shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike and largemouth bass and secondarily for bluegill and black crappie   Northern pike were abundant and the size structure consisted of larger fish.  Northern pike up to 33 inches were sampled and the mean length was 25 inches.  A fair number of largemouth bass were present, but they were small.  Bluegill were abundant, however most were small.  Other fish species available for anglers to catch include black crappie, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Trillium Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.  </p>",
