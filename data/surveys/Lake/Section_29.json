                "narrative": "<p>Section 29 Lake is located 10 miles north northeast of Isabella in the Superior National Forest.  From Hwy 1 in Isabella go east 0.8 mile on the Wanless Road (USFS Rd. #172), then 10 miles on the Trappers Lake Road (USFS Rd #369), then 1.5 miles on USFS Rd. #356 to the access road.  A USFS no fee campground is present with 4 sites and a gravel back in access to the lake.  The northeast portion of the lake was involved in the 2011 Pagami Creek fire.  It is also only a short drive to several other small lakes, most with carry down access.  Contact the USFS Tofte district or check the Superior NF website https://www.fs.usda.gov/superior for information on camping in the area and activities in the Superior NF.  The lake has an area of 100 acres and a maximum depth of 20 feet.  The fish community primarily consists of Walleye, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch and White Sucker.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year (in the fall of even numbered years).  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed in 2018 to update the status of the fish community, evaluate stocking, current management goals, and provide information to direct future management activities.  In this assessment Northern Pike met their management goals, and Walleye met the size but not the number goal.     <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill net catch in four sets of 4.3/net was slightly less than average when compared to other similar lakes, but still within the normal range.  Average weight and length was 1.6 pounds and 16.6 inches.  Nine trap nets sampled just one Walleye.  The largest fish sampled was 20.8 inches long and weighed 3.1 pounds.  All Walleye sampled were from stocked years, with six year classes in the sample and fish as old as 14 years.  Growth rate is a little above average by area standards.   <br> \n  <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch of 2.5/net was slightly lower than average when compared to other similar lakes, but again within the normal range.  Average weight and length was 1.4 pounds and 18.7 inches.  The largest fish sampled was 26.3 inches long and weighed 4.2 pounds.  Northern Pike recruitment was consistent with 7 year classes sampled and 2016 was the strongest year class.  Growth rate is a little above average by area standards.    <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch of 4.5/net was slightly low and the average size of 6.5 inches was somewhat small, but again within the normal range.  The largest fish sampled was 8.2 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker gill net catch of 7.5/net is average, while average weight of 2.4 pounds would be considered above average for similar lakes.  The largest fish sampled was 22.3 inches long.  Comfort Creek inlet crosses USFS Rd. #356 about 0.4 mile southwest of the access road and is occasionally used by locals in the spring to spear suckers.  Other species sampled were Blacknose Shiner, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed and Rock Bass in trap nets.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Section 29 Lake is 97 acre located within the U.S. Forest Service Superior National Forest with a maximum depth of 20 feet and 74% littoral area (15 feet or less).  There is a gravel ramp at the small U.S. Forest Service campground on the east shore of the northeast basin, very limited parking is available for vehicle/trailer combinations after launch.  The north shore of Section 29 Lake was touched by the Pagami Creek Fire, which burned a large portion of the Boundary Water Canoe Area Wilderness in September 2011.  Evidence of the fire can still be seen, although forest regeneration was already apparent in 2012.  The fire did not impact the camping or boat launch areas on Section 29 Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSection 29 Lake drops quickly around most of the boulder/rubble shoreline; a shallow mucky bay on the north end of the western basin contains abundant aquatic vegetation and leads to the outlet (Comfort Creek).  The aquatic vegetation around the remainder of the lake is limited to protected bays and a narrow fringe around the shoreline.  A mixed forest of aspen/jack pine on gradually sloping ridges surrounds most of the lake with bog on the north end.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 walleye sample in 2012 was average for the lake class and within the range observed in previous investigations.  The average weight of walleye sampled in 2012 was 1.1 pound (14 inches); the largest walleye sampled was 20 inches (2.9 pounds).  The walleye population appears to be maintained through stocking as scale analysis found no reproduction during non-stocked years.  The walleye stocking in Section 29 Lake began in 1955 and has continued sporadically with various numbers, rates, and sizes stocked.  Section 29 Lake has a history of stratifying in early summer with low dissolved oxygen levels found at depths of 7 to10 feet and deeper.  Fishing below the thermocline in these stratified conditions will most likely be unproductive during the summer months.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike numbers were above average for the lake class in 2012 and higher than recorded in previous investigations.  The mean weight of northern pike was 1.6 pounds (18.5 inches) the largest northern pike measured 28 inches (5.1 pounds).  Eight year classes of northern pike were identified in the 2012 sample, growth was about average compared to aged northern pike samples from Finland area lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch was below average for the lake class, in 2012.  The average length from gill nets was 6.3 inches; the largest fish was 8.6 inches (0.3 pound).  The 2012 yellow perch sample was typical of the catch recorded in previous investigations on Section 29 Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe white sucker numbers were above average for lake class in 2012, the mean weight was 1.6 pounds.  The white sucker catch has historically been high in Section 29 Lake.  White suckers have been harvested from the inlet on the south end of the southwest basin, just below the crossing at USFS Road 356, in high water during the spring spawning run.  <br> \n</p>",

The primary management species is Walleye which have been stocked in even-numbered years since the 1980's with varying success.  <br> \n <br> \nThe standard fisheries survey completed in 2023 sampled just three Walleye for a catch rate of 0.75 per gill net, which was below the normal range for similar lakes. Catches from historic surveys have been below the normal range in five surveys and within the normal range in six surveys dating back to 1961. Results suggest fingerling stocking has not been particularly successful at consistently producing catches within the normal range for this type of lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate of 3.25 per gill net was within the normal range for similar lakes and near the long-term average from ten historic surveys of the lake. While most pike captured are small, some grow to quality size. Results confirm that natural reproduction continues to be sufficient to maintain the population and provide opportunities for anglers. </p>",

Walleye up to 18.7 inches (2.1 pounds) were sampled in the test nets in 1994, however 25% of the fish taken ranged between 14 inches and 16 inches. The walleye population is maintained primarily thru stocking, which is scheduled for alternate years.     Northern pike are also present in average numbers compared to similar lakes, however most of the fish sampled in test nets were small, averaging less than 1.5 pounds. Northern pike up to 30 inches (6.4 pounds) were observed during the 1994 survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Section 29 Lake is a moderately soft-water lake with a total area of 88.8 acres, a maximum depth of 20 feet, and a median depth of 9 feet. It is located in the east central region of the Kawishiwi River Watershed, and is part of the Island river System.     An inlet from lowland drainage is present on the south shore, and an outlet to the Island River via Comfort Lake is present on the northwest shore.     Shoal soils consist of about 50% sand, 20% sand/gravel, 10% sandy muck, 10% mixed sand/gravel/boulder, 5% boulder and sand, 5% boulder.     Submerged aquatic vegetation was scattered in the shoal area to a depth of 4.5 feet, and emergent aquatic vegetation was present in sparse fringes along the shoreline.     The lake water was found to be dark brown and moderately turbid at the time of the survey. This condition was due primarily to bog stain.     Five species of fish were taken in the test nets. WhiteSucker and Rock Bass were taken in number below the regional average, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were taken in about average numbers.     Shoal water seining indicated that some natural reproduction of Northern Pike and Yellow Perch had occurred in 1961. Gamefish spawning conditions were considered to be fair.     Local residents reported that the lake has seldom been fished in recent years, and that in past years predominantly Northern Pike were caught.</p>",
