Bluegill and black crappie continue to dominate the fish community.  The most abundant predator in the lake is largemouth bass, which has developed a quality size-structure.  The white sucker population is also very stable.  Carp were found for the first time in the lake, but only a single individual was captured.</p>",

Black crappie abundance is down compared to the previous assessment; average size however has increased slightly.  Bluegill abundance however has more than doubled since 2000; average size also increased slightly since the previous assessment.  Abundance of both species remains very good compared to other lakes of similar type. <br> \n <br> \n     Largemouth bass catch per effort (CPE) has declined slightly in 2008 with the average size of the fish sampled remaining relatively unchanged.  The two channel catfish sampled during the electrofishing assessment are the first catfish sampled in South Fork Lake since the 1990 assessment; even though local fisherman report catching channel catfish on a regular basis.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

FIVE GOOD YEAR CLASSES OF BLACK CRAPPIES HAVE DEVEOPLED SINCE ADULT CRAPPIES WERE PLANTED IN 1982. THESE FISH ARE JUST BEGIN- NING TO REACH THE ACCEPTABLE SIZE OF NINE INCHES AND SHOULD PROVIDE SOME EXCELLENT FISHING SOON. A SUCCESSFUL PLANTING OF CHANNEL CATFISH IN 1983 SHOWED UP IN THE GILLNET CATCHES AT THREE TIMES THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE AND GROWTH WAS GOOD. LARGE CARP AND LARGE SUCKERS WERE ABUNDANT. THE RAPID EXPANSION OF THE CARP POPULATION HAS BEEN CHECKED SINCE THE LAKE SURVEY.</p>",

The lake was sampled with trap nets in early July and with a boat-mounted electrofishing unit in September.  The purpose of this survey was to collect information needed to update the DNR management plan for South Fork Lake (also known as R3).Black crappie were the most abundant species captured in the trap-nets.  Black crappie numbers are considered high, but average size is small for this type of lake in Minnesota.  This survey showed that the population of black crappie in South Fork Lake has remained relatively stable over the last ten years.Bluegills were the second most common speices found in the trap nets.  Their numbers area considered high and average size is about what we would expect for this kind of lake in Minnesota.  The population of bluegills in South Fork Lake has been increasing over the last decade.The electrofishing survey was designed to sample the largemouth bass population.  Although the numbers of bass have decreased, relative to previous surveys, the size structure of the bass population is stable and individuals reaching memorable sizes are present in the population.  Although no channel catfish were sampled in this survey, they have been sampled in previous surveys.  Channel catfish were most recently planted in South Fork Lake in 1996 (after the survey was completed) and in 1992.</p>",
