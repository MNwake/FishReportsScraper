Although outboard motors use is not allowed on Hayes Lake, anglers are welcome to bring a canoe, or to use an electric motor on their boat.  There are plenty of good places to fish from shore, and there is a fishing pier that is in a good fishing area.\tAfter many of the game fish in the lake died during a winterkill in 1989-1990, we have stocked largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch into Hayes Lake.  All of these species, as well as northern pike and brown bullhead, now have fishable populations in the lake.  \tAlthough the largemouth bass that we sampled were all two years old or younger, there is already a good post-winterkill bass fishery in Hayes Lake.  The two-year old bass that we sampled averaged over 12 inches long, and anglers were catching bass from the fishing pier, and from boats during the summer of 1996.\tThe northern pike are doing great on Hayes Lake.  Although most of the fish that anglers catch are in the two to three pound range, there are pike in the lake that are longer than 30 inches.  \tCrappie fishing in Hayes Lake is not as hot as it was in the mid to late 1980's, previous to the winter kill, but there is a fishable population in the lake.  Crappie anglers had good luck on Hayes Lake during the fall of 1996, and while ice fishing in the early part of the winter of 1996-1997.\tAlthough there are a lot of bluegill in Hayes Lake, most of them are less than 8 inches long.  This is a young population of fish, and it is likely that as the population matures, there will be more large individuals.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tLocated entirely within Hayes Lake State Park, Hayes Lake is a 180-acre impoundment on the south branch of the Roseau River. The lake is located 18 miles southeast of the Roseau. The undeveloped shoreline of Hayes Lake provides visitors plenty of shoreline angling opportunity in many of the small bays and points. The lake has numerous amenities including a swimming beach, fishing cleaning shack, camping,  two fishing piers, a single-lane concrete boat ramp, and canoe rentals. Canoe access is available as carry-in located near the campground and rental can be arranged through the park. No outboard motors are allowed on Hayes Lake and boaters must utilize a paddle or electric trolling motor. A Minnesota state park pass is needed to access Hayes Lake. A fishing license is no longer needed to fish Hayes Lake. All other statewide fishing regulations for inland waters apply.  <br> \n <br> \n\tHayes Lake has a maximum depth of 28 feet and stratifies during warm summer months. Primary fisheries management is for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill is managed as a secondary species. Installation of a hypolimnetic draw-down tube in the 1980s has reduced winterkill events in Hayes Lake and since 1993, the fish community in Hayes Lake has maintained itself by natural reproduction. In addition, a quality fishery exists below Hayes Lake in the Roseau River. <br> \n <br> \n\tLargemouth Bass night electrofishing catch rates have varied from 9 fish/hour to 19 fish/hour since 1996. In 2014, catch rates were just above 11 fish/hour with fish ranging from 6.7 inches to 22 inches with an average length of 13 inches. Average weight of Largemouth Bass is just below two pounds (1.74 pounds). Seventy percent of the population sampled in 2014 during night electrofishing were longer than 12 inches, relative to the number of fish greater than or equal to 8 inches. The Largemouth Bass population in Hayes Lake is healthy and has individuals weighing over 6 pounds. Hayes Lake provides anglers the opportunity to catch memorable-sized Largemouth Bass (over 20 inches). To protect the quality size structure of Largemouth Bass in Hayes Lake, catch and release is strongly encouraged.\t <br> \n <br> \n\tBluegill in Hayes Lake is characterized as having low to moderate abundance with good growth rates. Based on spring trap netting, size distribution of Bluegill is made up of larger individuals (up to 10 inches). To protect the quality size structure of Bluegill in Hayes Lake, selective harvest is encouraged.\t <br> \n <br> \n\tNorthern Pike are also a popular game fish in Hayes Lake. Northern Pike are abundant in Hayes Lake and the average length is between 20-24 inches weighing 2-3 pounds. A 37 inch pike was sampled in 2014, suggesting 40 inch fish may inhabit the lake. Overall, Hayes Lake contains a healthy Northern Pike population and should provide anglers a great fishing opportunity. <br> \n <br> \n\tOther panfish inhabiting Hayes Lake includes Black Crappie, Pumkinseed, and Yellow Perch. Black Crappie abundance in Hayes Lake is low; however, trap net catch rates were higher than in the previous two surveys. Black Crappie length ranged from 5 inches to 12 inches in the 2014 survey. The average length of Black Crappie sampled with trap nets was between 6  to 7 inches for both trap nets and gill nets. Pumkinseed abundance is also low, but the average size has increased from 4 inches in 2009 to 6 inches in 2014. The largest Pumkinseed sampled was just below 8 inches in length. Yellow Perch gill net catches and average length decreased from 2009. Average length of Yellow Perch sampled with gill nets and trap nets was between 6 to 7 inches. The largest Yellow Perch sampled in 2014 was just below10 inches.  Black Crappie, Pumkinseed, and Yellow Perch are in low abundance in Hayes Lake, but quality-sized fish inhabit the lake and should provide anglers plenty of fishing opportunity. \t</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hayes Lake is a scenic 180-acre impoundment on the south branch of the Roseau River, located within Hayes Lake State Park.  A Minnesota state park pass or day use pass is needed to access Hayes Lake.  The lake has a maximum depth of 28 feet, and stratifies during warm summer months.  The undeveloped shoreline of Hayes Lake presents many shore fishing opportunities in small bays and off numerous main lake points that are accessible from trails around the beach and campground areas.  There is also a handicap accessible public fishing pier near the boat ramp on the northwest portion of the lake.  The boat ramp is single lane concrete access.  Canoe access to the lake is available as a carry-in access located near the main campground.  Outboard motors are prohibited on Hayes Lake, so boaters must utilize a paddle or electric trolling motor while on the lake.  Hayes Lake is a popular place to canoe and kayak; canoe rental is available through the state park office.  As of 2009, a fishing license is no longer needed to fish on Hayes Lake during the open water season.  However, during the ice fishing season a license is needed.  All other statewide fishing regulations apply for inland waters.  <br> \n <br> \nHayes Lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass.  Secondary species for management include bluegill and black crappie.  Hayes Lake historically experienced annual winterkills until January 1985 when a hypolimnetic discharge tube was installed.  Since then, only one major winterkill has been reported, during the winter of 1989-1990.  Since 1990, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and walleye have all been reintroduced by stocking.  Since 1993, the fish community in Hayes Lake has maintained itself through natural reproduction and appears healthy.  One exception is walleye, due to a lack of spawning habitat for walleye within the reservoir no walleye have been sampled in the reservoir since 1993, and no additional stocking has been done.  While walleye can not exist in the reservoir, a fishable population exists in the Roseau River directly downstream of the dam for Hayes Lake and fishing below the dam can be very productive for walleye in the spring months. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass have recovered well since 1990, and a healthy naturally-reproducing population exists in Hayes Lake.  Electrofishing samples from 2008 and a full netting survey in 2009 indicate that ten year-classes are present and fish older than 9 years are present in the lake.  The average size of largemouth bass caught in the samples was 15 inches, and ranged from 7 inches to 20 inches.  Largemouth bass in Hayes Lake are healthy and large fish, up to 5 pounds, can be caught.  <br> \n <br> \nThe recent fish netting survey conducted during the summer of 2009 indicated that the average size of bluegill is 5 inches, and fish up to 9 inches were caught in the nets.  Natural reproduction is occurring in the lake and adult bluegill are abundant.  A quality bluegill population exists in Hayes Lake that will provide a great fishing opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were also collected in the 2009 survey and during electrofishing in 2008.  Black crappie ranged in size from 6 inches to 12 inches with an average size between 7 and 8 inches.  Black crappie abundance in Hayes Lake is currently low, but good size fish are still found and will provide a fishable population.  When conditions are suitable, one good year of natural reproduction should help to increase abundance of black crappie within the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are also present in Hayes Lake. Yellow perch, as of 2009, were mostly represented by individuals in the 6 to 7 inch size range with some perch up to 10 inches.  The yellow perch population is at a sustainable level and within the typical range when compared to similar lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant in Hayes Lake.  The average size of northern pike is between 22 and 23 inches, and the population contains northern pike approaching 40 inches.  During the 2009 survey a 39 inch northern pike was caught and released.  Fishing reports from Hayes Lake indicate that large northern pike are commonly caught and a 15 to 20 pound fish is not impossible to find in the reservoir.  Overall, the northern pike population appears healthy and will provide a great fishing opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, Hayes Lake provides a unique fishing opportunity near the city of Roseau.  A quality fish community, undisturbed scenery, and new fishing regulations (fishing in a state park without a Minnesota fishing license during open water) may increase angling use.  A campground awaits you at Hayes Lake State Park so come out and enjoy the sights, sounds, and quality fishing at Hayes Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hayes Lake presents the opportunity to fish surrounded by an undeveloped shoreline, listening to the splash of a paddle or the hum of an electric motor.  Located within Hayes Lake State Park, this 180 acre reservoir presents the opportunity to catch largemouth bass, panfish, and northern pike.  Outboard motors use is not allowed on the lake, so bring a canoe or boat with an electric motor.  If you don't have a boat, you can use the fishing pier or pick a place on the bank near one of the picnic areas or campground.      Largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, and bluegill sunfish have all become reestablished since fish were stocked following a winterkill in 1989-90.  Stocking and the addition of a pipe that draws off water in the lake at a depth where it typically lacks oxygen, has lead to sustainable populations of these species.  All these species are now successfully reproducing in the lake.      Largemouth bass from the 1994 and 1995 year classes now average over 15\" in length.  These fish have the potential to become much larger as they age, so you might consider practicing catch and release on the lake.  Reproduction was also good in the following year classes, so the abundance of large fish is probably still increasing as this population reestablishes itself.       The occasional 8 year-old bluegill caught averages 8\" while the most abundant fish surveyed were 4 to 5 years old.  These fish from the 1994 and 1995 year classes were 25% of our 1999 survey catch and are between 7-8\".  As these fish mature, the opportunity to catch an 8 inch or longer bluegill will increase.     Northern pike of good size and numbers are also present.  A 40\" northern pike was captured while electrofishing in 1999 and local reports support the presence of other big pike.     Black crappie and yellow perch are also present.  Most crappie are from the 1994 year class or younger so most of survey catch was under 9\" in length.  Although some larger fish are present now, the opportunity to catch a large crappie will increase as the population ages.  Yellow perch are also available and time should show increasing average sizes.  Brown bullheads survived the winterkill event and are present as well.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Located entirely within Hayes Lake State Park, Hayes Lake is a 180-acre impoundment on the south branch of the Roseau River. The lake is located 18 miles southeast of the Roseau. The undeveloped shoreline of Hayes Lake provides visitors plenty of shoreline angling opportunity in many of the small bays and points. The lake has numerous amenities including a swimming beach, fishing cleaning shack, camping, two fishing piers, a single-lane concrete boat ramp, and canoe rentals. Canoe access is available as carry-in located near the campground and rental can be arranged through the park. No outboard motors are allowed on Hayes Lake and boaters must utilize a paddle or electric trolling motor. A Minnesota state park pass is needed to access Hayes Lake. A fishing license is no longer needed to fish Hayes Lake. All other statewide fishing regulations for inland waters apply. Hayes Lake has a maximum depth of 28 feet and stratifies during warm summer months. Primary fisheries management is for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill is managed as a secondary species. Installation of a hypolimnetic draw-down tube in the 1980s has reduced winterkill events in Hayes Lake and since 1993, the fish community in Hayes Lake has maintained itself by natural reproduction. In addition, a quality fishery exists below Hayes Lake in the Roseau River. Largemouth Bass night electrofishing catch rates have varied from 9 fish/hour to 19 fish/hour since 1996. In 2019, catch rates were 12.9 fish/hour with fish ranging from 3.1 inches to 17.5 inches with an average length of 9.2 inches. Average weight of Largemouth Bass is just below one pound (0.9 pounds). Sixty percent of the population sampled in 2019 during night electrofishing were longer than 12 inches, relative to the number of fish greater than or equal to 8 inches. The Largemouth Bass population in Hayes Lake is healthy and has individuals weighing over 4 pounds. To protect the quality size structure of Largemouth Bass in Hayes Lake, catch and release is strongly encouraged. Bluegill in Hayes Lake is characterized as having low to moderate abundance. Based on spring trap netting, size distribution of Bluegill is made up of larger individuals (up to 10 inches). To protect the quality size structure of Bluegill in Hayes Lake, selective harvest is encouraged. Northern Pike are also a popular game fish in Hayes Lake. Northern Pike are abundant in Hayes Lake and the average length is between 18-22 inches weighing approximately 2 pounds. Overall, Hayes Lake contains a healthy Northern Pike population and should provide anglers a great fishing opportunity. Other panfish inhabiting Hayes Lake includes Black Crappie, Pumkinseed, and Yellow Perch. Black Crappie abundance in Hayes Lake is increasing, trap net catch rates were higher than in the previous three surveys. Black Crappie length ranged from 5 inches to 12 inches in the 2019 survey. The average length of Black Crappie sampled with trap nets was between 7 to 8 inches for trap nets. Pumkinseed abundance is also low, but the average size in 2019 was 5.3 inches. The largest Pumkinseed sampled was 7.2 inches in length. Yellow Perch gill net catches and average length increased from 2014. Average length of Yellow Perch sampled with gill nets and trap nets was between 6 to 7 inches. Black Crappie, Pumkinseed, and Yellow Perch are in low abundance in Hayes Lake, but quality-sized fish inhabit the lake and should provide anglers plenty of fishing opportunity.</p>",
