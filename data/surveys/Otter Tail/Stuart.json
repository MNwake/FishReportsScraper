The average weight of northern pike sampled also increased from 0.7 lbs. to 1.0 lbs.  The age-class distribution indicates that northern pike age-classes I+ to VIII+ were represented in the sample. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance decreased, but remains above the area median at 49.2 per trap net lift. The bluegill population is presently dominated by large numbers of small fish which exhibit slow growth rates.  <br> \n     Age data for largemouth bass and black crappie shows adequate reproductive success as fish aged II+ to VI+ were represented in the sample for both species.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance, as measured by number per gill net lift, was 17.1 per net, which is similar to the 1981 and 1985 surveys.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance and average weight were 3.1 per gill net lift and 2.4 lbs., respectively. This is similar to the 1985 survey.  Age data for walleye indicates that natural reproduction is limited. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Stuart Lake is a 699-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately two miles east of Clitherall, MN.  Stuart Lake is connected to East Battle Lake via a non-navigable outlet along the north shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 49 feet; however, 58% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2006 lake survey was 13.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.8 to 24.0 feet.  The MN DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Stuart Lake is included in lake class 25; other area lakes in this same classification include Beers, Jolly Ann, Leek, West Olaf, and Sewell .\n     A majority of the shoreline of Stuart Lake is developed with homes and cabins.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the north shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are scattered throughout the lake.  Emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish. They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.\n     Stuart Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.\n     Catch data indicate that a high-density northern pike population exists.  Age and length data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike size structure is poor with an anverage length and weight of 15.9 inches and 0.9 pounds.\n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 3.4 to 19.5 inches with an average length and weight of 10.2 inches and 0.7 pounds.\n       Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that black crappies are very abundant.  Age and length data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Twenty-four percent of the black crappie sample was 10.0 inches or greater in length.\n     A 10-inch minimum size limit for black crappies was implemented in 2005.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the black crappie population.\n     Catch data indicate that bluegill are also very abundant.  The test-net catch rate has consistently exceeded the expectedl range for similar lakes.  Age and length data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Fifty-seven percent of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.\n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Stuart Lake was conducted on July 3 and 6, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at fourteen sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at six stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured eighteen species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner and Pugnose Shiner) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Stuart Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that is well above the impairment threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Stuart Lake is fully supporting for aquatic life use. The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stuart Lake is a 699-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County, approximately two miles east of the town of Clitherall, MN.  The maximum depth is 49 feet and 58% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 7.6 miles and the shoal water areas consist primarily of sand and gravel.  The secchi disk reading, which is a standard measure of water quality, was 24.0 feet, which is exceptional for this area.  Secchi disk readings in previous surveys ranged from 7.8 to 14.5 feet.       Approximately 50% of the shoreline is developed.  The development is distributed around the entire lake.  There were 104 homes counted on the shoreline during the 1998 lake survey.  With recent high water levels, shoreline erosion has become an increasing concern for lakeshore owners.  By using shoreline best management practices (BMP's) and  \"lakescaping\" concepts, impacts of development and shoreline erosion can be minimized.  Contact any County Extension Office for information on BMP's and the local DNR Fisheries Office for information on lakescaping techniques.       There are stands of hardstem bulrush, cattail, and wild rice at various locations around the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.       Purple loosestrife, an invasive exotic plant, was observed at two sites on the lake in 1998.  Loosestrife out-competes native wet ground species, such as cattail and sedge, and will eventually displace them.  Because of this, and its limited value to wildlife, loosestrife has been declared a noxious weed and must be controlled.          A portion of a bay on the south side of the lake is closed to fishing annually, from shortly after ice out until June 30.  This closure is intended to protect largemouth bass and black crappie during the spawning season when they are vulnerable to angling.       Stuart Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Stuart Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       Catch data indicate that a high-density northern pike population exists.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike size structure is poor with an average length and weight of 16.6 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Pike growth is slow with an average length of 17.3 inches at four years of age.         Catch data indicate that bluegill are also very abundant.  The test-net catch rate has consistently exceeded the upper limit of the expected range for lakes of this type.  Age data indicate that bluegill abundance is consistently good.  Bluegill size structure is excellent with sixty-two percent of the bluegill sample measuring at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 6.8 inches at seven years of age.       The test-net catch rate for largemouth bass also exceeded the upper limit of the expected range suggesting that bass are abundant.  Age data indicate that the 2000 year class is strong and should provide good bass angling for several years.  Bass attain an average length of 9.8 inches at three years of age.         The walleye test-net catch rate was 2.6 per net, which is within the expected range for lakes of this type.  The average length and weight of walleye was 16.1 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked on a biennial basis and age data indicate that stocking is supplementing limited natural reproduction.  Walleye growth is good with an average length of 15.4 inches at four years of age.       Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Stuart Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      </p>",

Other area lakes included in this class are:  Beers, Franklin, Heilberger, and South Lida. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance decreased from 12.1 per gill net lift in the 1988 survey to 7.4per net, which is within the normal range for this lake class.  Five consecutive year classes of pike were represented in the age-class distribution indicating consistent recruitment.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased from 49.2 per trap net lift in 1988 to 82.6 per net, exceeding the normal range.  Bluegill size structure appears to have improved as 38% of the bluegills measured exceeded 7.0 inches in length compared to 15% in 1988.  This apparent shift in size structure may be related to a strong 1985 year class, which composed 38% of the sample.  <br> \n     Largemouth bass growth rates improved from 1988 to 1991 and surpassed the statewide average.  Consistent reproduction of bass is evident as five consecutive year classes were represented in the sample.   <br> \n     Black crappie reproduction also appears consistent as the sample was composed of four consecutive year classes.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance declined from 17.1 per gill net lift in 1988 to 7.9 per net, but remained within the normal range.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance declined slightly from 3.1 per gill net lift in 1988 to 2.3 per net, but remained within the normal range. Average individual weight of walleye decreased from 2.2 pounds in 1988 to 1.4 pounds.  Walleye natural reproduction cannot be accurately assessed due to the recent history of stocking mixed ages of walleyes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Stuart Lake is a 699-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County, approximately two miles east of Clitherall, MN.  Stuart Lake is connected to East Battle Lake via a non-navigable outlet along the north shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 49 feet; however, 58% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2011 lake survey was 14.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.8 to 24.0 feet. <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline of Stuart Lake is developed with homes and cabins.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the north shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are scattered throughout the lake.  Emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish. They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Stuart Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     Catch data indicates that a high-density northern pike population exists.  Age and length data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike size structure is poor with an average length and weight of 16.0 inches and 0.9 pounds. <br> \n     Catch data from the recent test-netting assessments indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 8.3 to 17.7 inches with an average length and weight of 12.7 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 13.8 inches at five years of age. <br> \n       Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that black crappies are abundant and the size structure is good.  Black crappies ranged in length from 8.6 to 12.1 inches with a mean length of 10.2 inches.  Age data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Fifty-three percent of the black crappie sample was 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black crappies attain an average length of 10.1 inches at five years of age.  In 2005, a 10-inch minimum size limit for black crappies was implemented.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the black crappie population, which it appears to be accomplishing. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance declined significantly compared to previous assessments.  Bluegills ranged in length from 2.4 to 8.5 inches with a mean length and weight of 6.4 inches and 0.2 pounds.  Thirty-nine percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Past age data indicated that bluegill reproduction was consistently good, but data from this past assessment indicates that reproduction has recently been poor.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.4 inches at six years of age.   <br> \n     The walleye test-net catch rate declined for the fourth consecutive survey.  Walleyes ranged in length from 11.2 to 28.7 inches with an average length and weight of 16.2 inches and 1.7 pounds.  The 2008 year class represents a majority of the sample.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.1 inches at four years of age.     <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Stuart Lake is a 699-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County, approximately two miles east of Clitherall, MN.  Stuart Lake is connected to East Battle Lake via a non-navigable outlet along the north shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 49 feet; however, 58% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2015 lake survey was 15.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.8 to 24.0 feet. <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline of Stuart Lake is developed with homes and cabins.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the north shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are scattered throughout the lake.  Emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish. They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Stuart Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     Catch data indicates that a high-density Northern Pike population exists.  Age and length data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike size structure is poor with an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Only eight percent the Northern Pike in the gill net sample were 24.0 inches or greater in length. <br> \n     Catch data indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 8.0 to 17.7 inches with an average length and weight of 11.2 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 12.6 inches at four years of age. <br> \n       Data from a spring trap netting assessment indicate that Black Crappies are abundant and the size structure is good.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 6.6 to 12.8 inches with a mean length of 9.1 inches.  Age data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Fourteen percent of the Black Crappie sample was 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 9.9 inches at four years of age.  In 2005, a 10-inch minimum size limit for Black Crappies was implemented.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the Black Crappie population, which it appears to be accomplishing. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance remains low compared to previous assessments.  Bluegills ranged in length from 2.2 to 8.9 inches with a mean length and weight of 6.9 inches and 0.3 pounds.  Sixty-four percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.8 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 14.9 to 24.0 inches with an average length and weight of 20.4 inches and 3.0 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.6 inches at four years of age.     <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Stuart Lake is a 699-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County, one mile west of Vining, MN.  Stuart Lake is connected to East Battle Lake via a non-navigable outlet along the north shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 49 feet; however, 58% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2019 lake survey was 13.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.8 to 24.0 feet. <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline of Stuart Lake is developed with homes and cabins.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the north shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are scattered throughout the lake.  Emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish. They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     A high-density Northern Pike population exists.  Age and length data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 10.0 to 34.0 inches with an average length and weight of 17.6 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 20.3 inches at four years of age.    <br> \n     In 2005, a 10-inch minimum size limit for Black Crappies was implemented.  The objective of the regulation was to maintain or improve the size structure of the Black Crappie population.  Data collected in Black Crappie assessments since 2005 indicate that the regulation has been successful.  <br> \n     Black Crappies are abundant and the size structure is good.  Age data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 6.3 to 12.4 inches with an average length of 10.3 inches.  Sixty-eight percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 11.1 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Bluegill size structure is excellent. Seventy-nine percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length and 36% were 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is also consistently good.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.1 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 15.6 to 22.5 inches with an average length and weight of 18.7 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.3 inches at four years of age.     <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Stuart Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
