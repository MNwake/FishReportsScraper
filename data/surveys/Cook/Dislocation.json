                "narrative": "<p>Dislocation Lake lies within the Lake Superior North watershed, draining to Lake Superior via Fiddle Creek and the Brule River.  It was managed for stream trout from at least 1951 through 1989, when brook trout were last stocked in the lake.  Stream trout management was discontinued after 1989 because of poor survival of several stocked year classes.  Competition from large populations of yellow perch and white sucker was thought to have caused the decline of trout survival in this lake.  We were surprised when a 2010 survey, intended to determine whether abundance of those species remained excessive, instead found relatively high numbers of naturally produced brook trout.  The 2019 survey was scheduled in the 2017 lake management plan to determine whether brook trout were still present, and if so (and if possible) to determine where they might be spawning and establish a long range goal for the species in this lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe brook trout gill net catch in 2019 fell within the normal range (2.67-13.83 fish/set) for catches in spring surveys of stream trout lakes in this area.  The mean weight for those fish also fell within the normal range (0.41-1.17 lb/fish).  Three year classes contributed to the catch, all apparently produced naturally.  Although the sample size was low, growth appeared to have been average for a stream trout lake in this area. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker and yellow perch were still present in Dislocation Lake in 2019.  Their numbers appeared to have been about average for a stream trout lake in this area holding those species.  Both species compete with brook trout for invertebrate forage, and both have been associated with reduced growth of stocked brook trout.  Of the two, yellow perch have generally been considered the greatest threat to successful stream trout management.   <br> \n <br> \nThe source of brook trout now found in Dislocation Lake remains uncertain.  Observations made in 2019 suggest some spawning habitat may have been available in the inlet from Weasel (Sled) Lake, and in the outlet stream between Dislocation Lake and Fiddle Creek.  As of 2019 brook trout had not been stocked in any connected lake since 2001.  Brook trout were stocked in Weasel Lake from 1987 through 2001 (it was stocked with rainbow trout through 2019), but small numbers of naturally-produced brook trout have also been seen in that lake.  The outlet from Dislocation Lake flows to Fiddle Creek, which supports a robust naturally reproducing brook trout population.  Movement upstream from Fiddle Creek to Dislocation Lake seems possible when flow is adequate. <br> \n <br> \nBased on these survey results, the management plan for Dislocation Lake will be reviewed and revised in March 2021.  Among the options that may be considered would be a shift to a catch-and-release only regulation in this lake, to help maintain this unusual self-sustained brook trout population.  Comments on the management of this lake will be welcomed. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Brook trout were last stocked in Dislocation Lake in 1989.  Survival from that and previous stockings had been poor, so stream trout management was discontinued.  Competition from large numbers of yellow perch and white sucker was thought to have been the likely cause of poor trout survival.  The presence of brook trout in 2010 was unexpected.  They might have been naturally produced in the lake inlets or outlet.  Or, they might have migrated into the lake from Fiddle Creek, which has a natural brook trout population and which receives the outlet flow from Dislocation Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe brook trout catch matched the median catch for May-June gill net assessments of stocked stream trout lakes in the Grand Marais Area.  Mean weight exceeded the area median of 0.63 lb/fish.  Growth rates of the five two-year-old and one four-year-old fish matched averages for the area.  Growth of the eight three-year-old brook trout collected had been slightly slower than the average for the area. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch has fluctuated widely in assessments.  The 2010 catch was in the mid-range for the lake class, and was much lower than the catch had been in some years.   <br> \nWhite sucker catches have also fluctuated considerably, but have always been above average for the lake class. <br> \n <br> \nThere are currently no plans to resume trout stocking, and in any case, stocking is not needed at this time.   Future stocking would likely fail again if the yellow perch population increased greatly.  It is not feasible to exterminate the yellow perch and white sucker in this lake and reclaim it for trout management. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
