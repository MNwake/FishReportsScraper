Yellow perch numbers were much lower than 10 years ago.  Black bullhead numbers have also dropped.  White bass were sampled for the first time and a channel catfish was captured, the second time this species has been taken.  </p>",

All angling is done from shore on the west side of the lake where there is an abundance of aquatic vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes and Northern Pike were abundant in this survey. Walleyes averaged 17 inches in total length and over 2 pounds for average weight. The average size of Northern Pike was over 22 inches.  Other sought after species present were Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie and Bluegill.  Bluegills were small in size and Black Crappies were captured in low abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species present were Rock Bass, White Bass, Yellow Bullhead, Yellow Perch, Black Bullhead and Bowfin.  <br> \n</p>",

Trap net catches of these same 4 species and yellow bullhead, green sunfish, white sucker, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, and hybrid sunfish were caught at levels exceeding local medians.  While northern pike, black crappie, and carp were found low in numbers, but large in average size.When compared to the 1976 survey the relative abundance of white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, bluegill, white crappie and yellow bullhead seems to be the same.  There appears to be a reduction in the numbers of black bullheads, yellow perch, and possibly black crappie and carp.  Species, whose numbers are increasing would include the walleye (through fingerling stocking 79-86), green sunfish and possibly northern pike.  Largemouth bass and brown bullhead were captured in low numbers in 1976 but not in this survey.</p>",

The water has good chemical fertility and is moderately hard.  The lake is stratified in the summer, and lacks oxygen in the deeper water.  Despite the light fishing pressure imposed by the restricted angler access permitted by the St. Paul Water Department this fish population is very similar in size and structure to other more heavily fished lakes in the district.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Yellow perch, white sucker (taken in trap nets only), black bullheads, white crappie and black crappie are present in number and pounds per set above the statewide median.  Yellow perch are exceptionally abundant.  The most numerous fish were III annulus fish.  Growth fast at II annulus and older and good otherwise.  Only I and II annulus fish were found when aging white crappie.  Length at formation of the second(II) annulus was 8.7 inches.  Black crappie are less abundant than white crappie but still higher than the medians.  I and III annulus fish were most numerous of the scales read.  III annulus growth was slow but growth for the older year classes was good.  Black bullhead are very abundant with most fish being 7.5 inches or longer.  It would seem that although they are exceptionally numerous they are still growing well.  Golden shiners (taken in trap nets only) were average in numbers but below the median pounds per set.  Hybrid sunfish are more numerous than the median but are below the median pounds per set.  Carp are present below average number but above average weight.  The fish aged were mostly III to V annulus fish all showing good growht rates.  The carp population is apparently dominated by older fish and are not overabundant.  Northern pike, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed and bluegill are all present in numbers and weights per set below the statewide median.  The only northern pike taken was a I annulus fish with fast growth as was the case with the only largemouth bass aged.  Pumpkinseed were all III+ annulus fish or younger all exhibiting fast growth.  I annulus bluegill were most abundant and showed good growth.  Fast growth was the case with II and III annulus fish and good thereafter.  For both of these species young fish were most numerous and growth was good to fast probably due to their low numbers.  A creel census to obtain data concerning fishing pressure and catch rates should be done.  This information and this lake survey should provide the data necessary to design a comprehensive plan for the management of Vadnais Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The range of the local net catch median which includes the middle fifty percent of the values found is used to compare relative fish population levels.  Catches in this range represent average sized populations of the particular species involved for local lakes.  Catches above or below this range indicate relatively higher or lower populations respectively.Based on the above local medians, high populations of white sucker, yellow perch, walleye, pumpkinseed and probably hybrid sunfish are present in Vadnais Lake.  Average sized populations exist for northern pike, carp, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, bluegill, white crappie and black crappie.  Low populatons of golden shiners and brown bullhead are also present.Two of the four gillnet sets were identical to the 1976 netting, as were all of the trapnet sets.  Netting was done at the same time of the year.  By comparing the catches of northern pike and yellow perch in the same sets for both years, no significant change in the populatons has occured.  No walleyes were taken in the 1976 netting.  Stocking of this species has been conducted in 1979 and 1980.  The scales, fin rays and cleithra collected from the walleyes are presently being aged as a part of a research project and are not available here.  The length frequency distribution is fairly distinct, with the fish 12.0 inches and larger belonging to the 1979 stocking and the smallest fish (9.0 - 9.4\") to the 1980 stocking.  The two fish from 10.0 - 10.9 inches are also probably of the 1980 stocking.Black bullhead catches in 1981 indicate a drastic reduction in numbers from 1976.  Fewer smaller fish are present and the average size has increased.  Pumkinseed numbers, while higher in 1981 than in 1976, probably reflect only variations in net catches from similar sized populations.  The 1981 catch rate of bluegills is slightly over four times as high as the 1976 catch.  Although the modal length group is larger no other drastic differences are noted.  Without further information, it is difficult to determine if there has been a major increase in the population or simply a wide variation in net catches with no major change.  The black crappie catch is lower in 1981 and may reflect a true reduction since no fish smaller than 6.4 inches were taken, as opposed to 1976.  White crappie populaton levels show a similar change with far fewer small fishes being taken in 1981.  No discernable changes in the populatons of other species are apparent.</p>",

There is no surface use permitted on East Vadnais Lake and the hours of use are also restricted.  All angling is done from shore on the west side of the lake.Walleye and northern pike dominated the catch.  The majority of walleye in the sample ranged in size from 12-20\" and the northern pike were of a smaller relative size averaging 20\".  Other gamefish present were smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill and black crappie.  Bluegill were present in good numbers with the majority in the 5.5-7.0\" length group.  Black crappie, smallmouth bass and largemouth bass were sampled in fairly low numbers.Other fish species present were:  yellow perch, white bass, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and carp.

All angling is done from shore on the west side of the lake where there is an abundance of aquatic vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye and northern pike were abundant in this survey. The majority of the walleye were larger than 15 inches in length. The average size northern pike caught was over 22 inches. Other sought after species present were smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill. Bluegill up to 9 inches and black crappie exceeding 10 inches were sampled during this investigation. <br> \n <br> \nOther species present were white bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, white sucker, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and black bullhead.      <br> \n</p>",
