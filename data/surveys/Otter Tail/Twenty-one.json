The netting was very misleading in this survey.  Visual observation during the survey revealed many fish in the clear water (23 foot secchi disk reading). The water's clarity may have been one factor in the poor sampling ability of the nets. Another factor may have been the shoreline, which drops off very rapidly and makes it difficult to accomplish efficient trap net sets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Twenty-One is a 122-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwest Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Erhard, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of mixed hardwood forest and grassland.  The maximum depth is 47 feet and 41% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2004 lake survey was 14.5 feet which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 9.0 to 23.0 feet.  Lake Twenty-One is included in lake class 28 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.       Lake Twenty-One is located within Maplewood State Park.  The lakeshore remains entirely undeveloped except for one small cabin.  An undeveloped, carry-in public water access is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along the entire shoreline of the lake.     Experimental fishing regulations are in effect on Lake Twenty-One.  The daily bag limit for sunfish is ten.  All largemouth bass and northern pike must be immediately released.  The purpose of this regulation is to improve the bluegill size structure.       Lake Twenty-One can be ecologically classified as bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       An abundant northern pike population exists.  The northern pike test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 14.5 to 35.0 inches with an average length and weight of 20.6 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 21.5 inches at five years of age.  Growth rate estimates are slower than average pike growth rates for class 28 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.  The slow growth rates for pike may be attributed to the low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish.       The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Bluegill reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Sixty-two percent of the bluegill sample was at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 6.8 inches at six years of age.       Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a moderate density largemouth bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 6.7 to 16.3 inches with a mean length and weight of 14.9 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Bass exhibit fast growth with an average length of 12.2 inches at four years of age.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Lake Twenty-One is a 122-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwest Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Erhard, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of mixed hardwood forest and grassland.  Shoreline length is 3.8 miles.  The maximum depth is 47 feet and 41% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2010 lake survey was 18.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 9.0 to 23.0 feet.   <br> \n     Lake Twenty-One is located within Maplewood State Park.  The lakeshore remains entirely undeveloped except for one small private cabin.  An undeveloped, carry-in public water access is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along the entire shoreline of the lake. <br> \n     Special fishing regulations are in effect on Lake Twenty-One.  The daily bag limit for sunfish is ten and the daily bag limit for black crappies is five.  All largemouth bass and northern pike must be immediately released.  The objective of these regulations is to improve the size structure of these species.   <br> \n     Lake Twenty-One can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     A high-density northern pike population exists.  The northern pike test-net catch rate was the highest recorded for this lake.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 11.7 to 32.7 inches with an average length and weight of 18.7 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 23.2 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n      The bluegill population is moderately abundant.  Bluegill size structure is very good with 68% of the bluegills in the trap net sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.6 inches at six years of age.   <br> \n      Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that the black crappie population is abundant and it exhibits a very good size structure.  Seventy-two percent of the black crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 10.1 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n      Data from recent assessments indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 8.3 to 17.2 inches.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 13.2 inches at five years of age. <br> \n      Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Lake Twenty-One is a 122-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwest Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Erhard, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of mixed hardwood forest and grassland.  The maximum depth is 47 feet; however, 41% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2018 lake survey was 15.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 9.0 to 23.0 feet.   <br> \n     Lake Twenty-One is located within Maplewood State Park.  The lakeshore remains entirely undeveloped except for one small private cabin.  An undeveloped, carry-in public water access is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along the entire shoreline of the lake. <br> \n     Special fishing regulations are in effect on Lake Twenty-One.  The daily bag limit for sunfish is ten and the daily bag limit for Black Crappies is five.  All Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike must be immediately released.  The objective of these regulations is to improve the size structure of these species.   <br> \n     Lake Twenty-One can be classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.  The abundance of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     A moderate-density Northern Pike population exists.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 15.8 to 34.7 inches with an average length and weight of 21.4 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 25.8 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n      The Bluegill population is moderately abundant.  Bluegill size structure is very good with 78% of the Bluegills in the trap net sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 8.0 inches at six years of age.   <br> \n      Data indicates that the Black Crappie population is moderately abundant and it exhibits a very good size structure.  Ninety-three percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 10.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n      Data from recent surveys indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 4.3 to 16.9 inches.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 13.6 inches at five years of age. <br> \n      Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n      Lake Twenty-One is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Twenty-One is a 122-acre mesotrophic lake located in northwest Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Erhard, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of mixed hardwood forest and grassland.  The maximum depth is 47 feet and 41% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2001 lake survey was 16.2 feet which indicates excellent water clarity.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 9.0 to 23.0 feet in previous surveys.  Lake Twenty-One is included in lake class 28 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.       Lake Twenty-One is located within Maplewood State Park.  The lakeshore remains entirely undeveloped except for one small cabin.  An undeveloped, carry-in public water access is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along the entire shoreline of the lake.     Experimental fishing regulations are in effect on Lake Twenty-One.  The regulation is a limit of ten sunfish, and all largemouth bass and northern pike must be released.  The purpose of this regulation is to improve the bluegill size structure.  The regulation will be in effect until the year of 2006.       Lake Twenty-One can be ecologically classified as bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       An abundant northern pike population exists.  The northern pike test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 13.6 to 33.5 inches with an average length and weight of 22.7 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 21.7 inches at five years of age.  Growth rate estimates are slower than average pike growth rates for class 28 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.  The slow growth rates for pike may be attributed to the low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish.       The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Bluegill reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Twenty-nine percent of the bluegill sample was at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 6.5 inches at four years of age.       Summer test-net indices are not reliable indicators of largemouth bass abundance; however, angler reports on this specie have been positive.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  </p>",

Average individual weight of northern pike increased from 1.1 pounds in 1983 to 2.0 pounds. Pike recruitment is consistent as five year classes were represented in the sample.    \n     Yellow bullhead abundance increased from 14.0 per trap net 1983 to 52.0, which is 5.2 times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.  \n     Bluegill abundance increased from 15.2 and 1.2 per trap net in 1968 and 1983, respectively, to 43.0 per net, which slightly exceeds the upper limit of the normal range. Twenty-seven percent of the bluegills measured were greater than 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegill growth rates appear to be slow compared to statewide means.  \n     Seven largemouth bass were sampled, representing two year classes. \n     Black crappie abundance increased from 0.6 per trap net in 1983 to 3.0 per net, which is within the normal range.  Eighty-six percent of the black crappie sample correlated to the 1987 year class.  \n     Yellow perch, which were present in the 1968 and 1983 surveys, were not sampled.</p>",
