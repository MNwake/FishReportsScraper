                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Bertha Lake was conducted on June 25-26, 2018 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with one site sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations and one sampling station had conditions that prevented the use of seine. Nearshore sampling captured 22 native species of fish including 9 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Longnose Dace, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) as well as two tolerant species (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Bertha Lake based on this survey is exceptionally high, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Bertha Lake was conducted on July 25, 2022, by DNR Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at nine sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 20 species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose, Logperch, Longnose Dace, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data will be combined with trap net and gill net data from survey planned in 2024 to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Logperch, and Longnose Dace), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Bertha Lake is healthy. Data from these surveys will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nA temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Bertha Lake on July 26th, 2022, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Lake Whitefish and Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 20 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 31.0 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 9.5?C (49.1?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 17.2?C for Lake Whitefish or 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for both species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Lake Whitefish and Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2022. Data collected in 1993-2002 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2002. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Lake Whitefish or Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

Development is heavy on the lake, with 113 homes/cabins being counted during the 1995 survey along 2.4 miles of shoreline.Walleyes are not stocked directly into Bertha, but fry and fingerlings are stocked into connected Whitefish Lake.  The walleye catch rate (1.3/gill net) was average in 2004 when compared to similar lakes.  Average size was 22.0\" and 4.3 lbs.  All of the fish were over 12\".The northern pike catch rate was high (11.1/gill net).  Size averaged 21.8\" and 2.4 lbs., with 27% of the fish being 24\" or larger.Largemouth bass were caught in average numbers in both gill nets (0.6/net) and trap nets (0.6/net).  Average length was 10.9\" in gill nets and 6.6\" in trap nets.  Only one fish was 12\" or larger.The black crappie catch rate was average in gill nets (0.6/net), with an average length of 8.3\".  The trap net catch rate of 0.3/net was low.  These fish had an average length of 9.6\".  When both net types were combined, 88% of the fish were 8\" or larger.The bluegill catch rate was average compared to similar lakes (28.2/trap net).  Average length was 6.1\" and 20% of the fish were 7\" or larger.The lake whitefish catch rate was also in the average category.  Size averaged 15.0\" and 1.5 lbs.Other fish species captured included black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, greater redhorse, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, tullibee (cisco), white sucker, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

The maximum depth is 64 feet, with 43% of the lake 15' or less.  Water clarity is good with a secchi depth of 19.0 ft. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers, when compared to similar lakes, at 7.9/gill net.  Average length was 21.2\", with 24% measuring at least 24\" in length.  Fish up to 35.9\" were sampled.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are not stocked into Bertha, but are stocked annually as fry and every other year as fingerlings into the Whitefish Chain.  Walleyes can move through the chain and into Bertha.  Walleye numbers were average at 1.7/gill net.  The walleyes sampled were nice size, with an average length of 24.2\".  Walleyes ranged from 15.0\" to 29.8\".   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in average numbers in gill nets at 0.8/net.  Average length was 13.5\".  Largemouth bass electrofishing was conducted at various stations across the Whitefish Chain of Lakes, resulting in a combined catch rate of 68.8/hr run-time.  Average length was 13.5\".  Five smallmouth bass were also netted while electrofishing.  All but one were over 17\". <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in low numbers in gill nets at 0.4/net.  Average length was 5.1\".  The trap net catch was average at 0.8/net, with an average length of 8.5\".  For both gears combined 40% measured at least 8\" in length.  Bluegills were also sampled in average numbers at 30.6/trap net.  Average length was 5.9\", with 36% at least 7\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nBertha Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 17 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 37.1 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 6.7?C (44.1?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 17.2?C for Lake Whitefish or 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for these species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for these species was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. Data collected in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2002, and 2022 also indicated suitable oxythermal habitat. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Lake Whitefish or Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bertha Lake is 334 acres in size and is part of the Whitefish chain of lakes in northern Crow Wing County.  While there is no public access on Bertha, access may be gained via channel from Clamshell Lake or Whitefish Lake.  Bertha Lake has a maximum depth of 64 feet with 43% of the lake 15 feet or less.  The lakeshore is heavily developed with 147 homes/cabins along nearly 3.9 miles of shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nEven though walleyes aren't stocked directly in Bertha, a walleye fishery exists due to the connection with Whitefish Lake which is stocked with fry and fingerlings.  The walleye catch rate of 2.9/gill net is average when compared to similar lakes.  The size of walleyes was impressive, with a 22.3\" and 4.2 lb average.  Fish up to 29.9\" were caught with nearly 97% of the fish 14\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers are well above average compared to similar lakes with a catch rate of 14.4/gill net.  The average length of these fish was 20.3\" with a weight of 2.0 lbs.  There were fish up to 35.2\" sampled with the potential for larger fish to exist due to an abundance of tullibee (cisco), which are an important forage fish.  Tullibee (cisco) catch rates were also above average at 23.8/gill net. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were caught at a rate of 0.7/gill net.  The average size of these fish was 12.6\" and 1.1 lbs.  Only one smallmouth bass was caught which was 16.7\" and 2.6 lbs.  Although standard survey nets don't sample largemouth bass effectively, electrofishing was conducted on other lakes on the Whitefish chain where the catch rate was 112.5/hr.  The average size was similar to Bertha with fish up to 18.7\" sampled during electrofishing.  Given the connection of the lakes it can be assumed that there is fish movement among basins. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 29.9/trap net in 2011.  Their average length was 6.8\". Overall, 52% of bluegill were 7\" or larger.  Black crappie abundance was relatively low, with a catch rate of 0.6/trap net and only 0.3/gill net.  The black crappies in the gill nets had a decent average size of 11.1\".  The average size for black crappies in trap nets was slightly smaller at 8.8\". <br> \n <br> \nLake whitefish represent another species that anglers may target.  They were sampled at a rate of 0.9/gill net.  Their size was decent, with an average length of 20.1\" and 3.0 lbs.  Fish up to 23.8\" were caught during the survey.   <br> \n <br> \nSome other fish species sampled during the survey included bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, greater redhorse, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  While conducting seining and backpack electrofishing, various other species were sampled including johnny darter, banded killifish, blackchin shiner, bluntnose minnow, and green sunfish.   <br> \n</p>",
