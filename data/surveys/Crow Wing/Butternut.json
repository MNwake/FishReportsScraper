Yellow bullhead show smaller than average size fish for lake class 29 with sizes being less than the first quartile. Largemouth bass net catches indicate above average population levels with fish in the average range. Northern pike and yellow perch net catches indicate average population levels with both species having larger than average sized fish. In comparing the survey data from 1973 to the survey in 1989, bluegill population has done up with average size fish going down. There were no yellow perch or yellow bullheads caught during the 1973 survey, yet both species show substantial fish populations in 1989.</p>",
