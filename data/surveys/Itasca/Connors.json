Connors Lake is in ecological lake class #20.  Other area lakes in this class include Bustic, Brush Shanty and Noma Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch rate in the 2007 assessment was 3.3/net.  This is similar to the lake class median (4.5/net) and up from the two previous assessments.  Northern pike size structure was good.  Sampled pike ranged from 16.9 to 33.6 inches, with an average length of 24.4 inches and an average weight of 3.4 pounds.  Ages 2-7 were represented in the sample; growth was above 115% of the statewide average for ages 3-6, and similar to the statewide average for all other ages.  <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for walleye was within the lake class normal range at 1.3/net.  Sampled fish ranged from 13.5 to 22.0 inches, with an average length of 16.4 inches.  Ages 3, 4, 9 and 11 were represented in the sample and growth was similar to the statewide average for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch rate for bluegill in 2007 was 4.7/net.  This is below the lake class normal range and down from previous assessments.  Size structure was modest; sampled bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 7.5 inches, with an average length of 5.9 inches.  Growth was similar to the lake class average for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at 7.5/gill net, well above the lake class normal range and the highest catch on record.  Size structure was relatively poor; sampled crappie ranged from 4.3 to 9.8 inches, with an average length of 6.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled at 1.0/trap net and 1.0/gill net in 2007.  These catch rates are within the lake class expected ranges and similar to previous assessments.  Trap-net sampled bass ranged from 5.0 to 19.3 inches with an average length of 13.2 inches.  Ages 1, 2, 5-7, 10 and 13 were represented in the sample.  Growth was below 85% of the statewide average for ages 1-3, and similar to the statewide average for all other ages. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one yellow perch was sampled in the gill nets for a catch rate of 0.2/net.  This catch rate is below the lake class normal range and much lower than in previous assessments.  Gill-net catches for yellow bullhead were above the lake class normal range at 9.2/net.  Other species sampled included brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n</p>",
