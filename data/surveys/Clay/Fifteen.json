The abnormally high numbers caught in 1983 were undoubtedly the result of pike stocking in 1980.  Bluegill numbers have returned to 24/net after an extreme low in 1983.  Growth is good with several consecutive well-represented age groups.  Largemouth bass and black crappies are present-since 1983.  Walleye population is composed equally of age group III and IV fish.  Growth is good; abundance is less than average; and natural reproduction is sporadic at best.  Yellow perch numbers are about half the local median.  Bullheads were not caught in 1964, but both black and brown species have increased dramatically since 1977 and are presently much more abundant than average area lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Since Minnesota DNR began documenting winter dissolved oxygen levels in Lake Fifteen, the lake has experienced a partial winterkill about every ten or fifteen years.  The most recent occurred in 1980.  A \"partial\" winterkill generally means that desirable gamefish and panfish succumb to the oxygen deficit and less desirable bullheads and other species tolerant of low oxygen levels survive and thrive.  The Cormorant Lakes Sportsmen's Club has seasonally operated a small aeration system off the north shore of the lake for the past seven years.  No low oxygen events have occurred on the lake during the past fourteen years, so the effectiveness of the aeration system has not yet been tested.  However, it is doubtful that the system would sustain gamefish populations during a winterkill like that of 1980.     Besides being vulnerable to occasional winterkill, the lake's fish populations are currently subject to increased fishing pressure and habitat loss due to shoreline development, as are most Minnesota lakes.  During the past thirty years, the number of homes or cottages on Lake Fifteen has increased from one to twenty seven.  Fortunately, several significant stands of bulrush, cattail, broadleaf pondweeds, and other beneficial plants remain in the lake.  That aquatic vegetation, in addition to the other natural fish habitat in the lake has allowed fish populations in Lake Fifteen to rebound following the 1980 winterkill.  Vegetation in a lake provides spawning, feeding and growing cover for many fish species as well as shoreline protection and water quality benefits.     Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie were reintroduced following the 1980 winterkill.  Northern pike, bluegill, yellow perch and white sucker populations are currently more abundant than \"normal\" for similarly classed lakes.  Walleye and black and brown bullhead are present in \"normal\" numbers.  Largemouth bass, black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, and hybrid sunfish are also found in the lake.  The pike in Lake Fifteen average 2.3 pounds and 20.3 inches.  Natural reproduction of this species, as well as bluegill and yellow perch, is very good.  Walleye, which are eating well due to the abundance of yellow perch, average 1.8 pounds and 16.9 inches.  Bullheads, which were extremely plentiful three years following winterkill, have largely been replaced by more desirable panfish and gamefish.     In summary, populations of common, desirable fish species have rebounded well from the 1980 winterkill.  Reintroduction of some fish species, recent winters with good dissolved oxygen levels, and natural fish habitat present in Lake Fifteen have led to that recovery.  The natural habitat in the lake requires protection in order to sustain the current fishery and to facilitate quick recovery of fish populations following winterkills which will inevitably occur at Lake Fifteen in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Despite the tendency to winterkill periodically, Lake Fifteen's fishery is relatively diverse and productive.  The most recent partial winterkill in 1980 resulted in rapid expansions in bullhead numbers (bullheads are tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels).  Conversely, gamefish populations were decimated and required reintroduction into the lake.  Since then, northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass populations have recovered while bullhead populations have decreased to more normal levels. <br> \n <br> \nPopulations of most fish species are self-sustaining under normal conditions in this lake.  Spawning habitat is available for all present species except walleye, which are stocked every other year as fry.  In 2009, test net catches of northern pike were within the normal range for this type of lake.  These pike averaged 22.1 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Walleyes were not abundant but were large with a mean length of 25 inches.  Recent natural reproduction of bluegills continues to be successful as indicated by trap net catches over 40 fish per net.  The majority of these bluegills were rather small with a mean length of 5.1 inches.  Very few bluegills over eight inches were found.  Modest populations of black crappie were also found in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nThe Cormorant Lakes Sportsmen's Club has seasonally operated a small aeration system off the north shore since 1987.  No extremely low dissolved oxygen events have occurred on the lake during the past 24 years, so the effectiveness of the aeration system has not been rigorously tested. However, it is doubtful that the system would sustain gamefish populations during a winterkill similar to that of 1980.  A very light winterkill occurred during 2004 with the aerator operating.  Also, dissolved oxygen dropped to critical levels in 2006 and 2008, but no serious winterkill is believed to have occurred.  It is not known whether the aerator may have prevented further mortality of gamefish. <br> \n <br> \nGood land stewardship is important throughout the watershed to maintain water quality.  It is particularly critical near Lake Fifteen which is already a borderline winterkill lake.  Lakeshore and watershed dwellers can help protect water quality, fish populations, and property values by (1) leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along shorelines, (2) leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail, (3) not fertilizing or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4) ensuring compliance of septic systems, (5) participating in the lake association and in the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake-Monitoring Program, and (6) utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Despite the tendency to winterkill periodically, Lake Fifteen's fishery is relatively diverse and productive.  The most recent partial winterkill in 1980 resulted in rapid expansions in bullhead numbers (bullheads are tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels).  Conversely, gamefish populations were decimated and required reintroduction into the lake.  Since then, Northern Pike, Walleye, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Largemouth Bass populations have recovered while bullhead populations have decreased to more normal levels. <br> \n <br> \nPopulations of most fish species are self-sustaining under normal conditions in this lake.  Spawning habitat is available for all present species except Walleye, which are stocked annually as fry.  In 2014, test net catches of Northern Pike were above the normal range for this type of lake.  These pike averaged 22.9 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Walleyes were not abundant but were relatively large with a mean length of 21.4 inches.  Recent natural reproduction of Bluegills continues to be successful as indicated by trap net catches over 40 fish per net.  The majority of these Bluegills were rather small and slow growing with a mean length of 5.7 inches.  Very few Bluegills over eight inches were found.  Modest populations of Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were also found in 2014.  Crappies were mostly small and young with two fairly strong year classes on the verge of becoming large enough for anglers to keep. <br> \n <br> \nThe Cormorant Lakes Sportsmen's Club has seasonally operated a small aeration system off the north shore since 1988.  Low dissolved oxygen events such as what was experienced in 1980 have not occurred, so the effectiveness of the aeration system has not been rigorously tested. A very light winterkill occurred during 2004 with the aerator operating.  Also, dissolved oxygen dropped to critical levels in 2006 and 2008, but no serious winterkill is believed to have occurred.  It is not known whether the aerator was the primary reason further mortality of gamefish was not observed during these years. <br> \n <br> \nGood land stewardship is important throughout the watershed to maintain water quality.  It is particularly critical near Lake Fifteen which is already a borderline winterkill lake.  Lakeshore and watershed dwellers can help protect water quality, fish populations, and property values by (1) leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along shorelines, (2) leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail, (3) not fertilizing or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4) ensuring compliance of septic systems, (5) participating in the lake association and in the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake-Monitoring Program, and (6) utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Despite the tendency to winterkill every ten to twenty years, Lake Fifteen's fishery is relatively diverse and productive.  The most recent partial winterkill in 1980 resulted in rapid expansions in bullhead numbers (bullheads are tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels).  Conversely, gamefish populations were decimated and required reintroduction into the lake.  Since then, northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass populations have recovered while bullhead populations have decreased to more normal levels.Populations of most fish species are self sustaining under normal conditions in this lake.  Spawning habitat is available for all species but walleye, which are stocked every other year as fry.  In 2004, test net catches of northern pike remained high at 12.0 pike per net.  These pike averaged 22.1 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Walleyes were not abundant but averaged a relatively large 21.2 inches and 3.8 pounds.  Recent natural reproduction of bluegills has been very successful as indicated by trap net catches over 100 fish per net.  The majority of these bluegills were rather small with a mean length of 5.8 inches.  Since growth rates are slow for this species in Lake Fifteen, it will likely take another two or three years for the most abundant year classes to reach the desired eight inch lengths.  Modest populations of black crappie and largemouth bass were also found in 2004.The Cormorant Lakes Sportsmen's Club has seasonally operated a small aeration system off the north shore since 1987.  No extremely low dissolved oxygen events have occurred on the lake during the past 24 years, so the effectiveness of the aeration system has not been rigorously tested. However, it is doubtful that the system would sustain gamefish populations during a winterkill similar to that of 1980.  A very light winterkill occurred during 2004 with the aerator operating.  It is not known whether the aerator may have prevented further mortality of gamefish.Good land stewardship is important throughout the watershed to maintain water quality.  It is particularly critical near Lake Fifteen which is already a borderline winterkill lake.  Lakeshore and watershed dwellers can help protect water quality, fish populations, and property values by (1)leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along shorelines, (2)leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail, (3)not fertilizing or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4)ensuring compliance of septic systems, (5)participating in the lake association and in the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake-Monitoring Program, and (6)utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Despite the tendency to partially winterkill every ten to twenty years, Lake Fifteen's current fish community was quite diverse and productive in 1999.  The most recent partial winterkill in 1980 resulted in rapid expansions in bullhead numbers (bullheads are tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels).  Conversely, gamefish and panfish populations were decimated and required reintroduction into the lake.  Since then, northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass populations have each recovered to normal or above normal abundances while bullhead populations have decreased to more normal numbers.Test net catches of northern pike and walleye were above the normal range for similar lakes.  Sampled pike averaged two pounds while walleyes averaged nearly two and one half pounds each.  Most of the walleye were analyzed as three year olds which were stocked as fry in spring of 1996.  While walleye require stocking in order to sustain the population in Lake Fifteen, northern pike, bass, and panfish only need restocking if winterkill occurs.  Spawning habitat and cover is readily available for these species in Lake Fifteen.The Cormorant Lakes Sportsmen's Club has seasonally operated a small aeration system off the north shore since 1987.  No extremely low dissolved oxygen events have occurred on the lake during the past 19 years, so the effectiveness of the aeration system has not been rigorously tested.  However, it is doubtful that the system would sustain gamefish populations during a winterkill like that of 1980.While future periods of winterkill are probably inevitable, lakeshore owners can help reduce their frequency by protecting water quality, as well as fish populations and property values.  Some methods in which lakeshore dwellers can help include: (1)leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, (2)leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail, (3)not fertilizing or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4)ensuring compliance of septic systems, (5)participating in the lake association and in the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake-Monitoring Program, and (6)utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.</p>",

This data will be analyzed in conjunction with the standard survey that will be completed in 2019 to provide a complete assessment of the fish community that will be used to evaluate the biological condition of Lake Fifteen, and contribute to the assessment of the watershed. <br> \n <br> \nTen sites within Lake Fifteen were sampled during this survey, using a backpack electrofishing unit and seines.  Dense vegetation, soft substrate, and woody habitat resulted in difficult sampling conditions at some stations.   <br> \n  <br> \nSpecies sampled during this assessment were Banded Killifish, Black Bullhead, Blacknose Shiner, Blackchin Shiner, Bluegill, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch.  Some species intolerant of poor habitat conditions were found.  The results of this survey suggest that the fish population in Lake Fifteen meets expectations for lakes of similar characteristics, and the lake is likely not biologically impaired.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Fifteen is a 133-acre, class 34 lake in southeastern Clay County.  It is within the Buffalo River Watershed District.  The lake's maximum depth is approximately 24 feet, and has a history of infrequent winterkills.  There is a DNR maintained public access on the north shore.  The fish community was assessed in June 2019 using six gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern Pike have been historically abundant in Lake Fifteen, and this was also the case in 2019.  Pike size was respectable, with the average length of measured fish found to be just over 24 inches.      <br> \n <br> \nUnlike Northern Pike, Walleye abundance in Lake Fifteen has been historically low.  Only five Walleyes were caught during the survey in 2019.  Those sampled had an average length of 21.8 inches, and a maximum length of 25.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was similar to past surveys, with fish averaging 5.9 inches long.  Although fish up to 8.5 inches were measured, most Bluegill were less than 7.5 inches long. Compared to previous surveys, crappies and bass were relatively abundant in 2019.  The average length of Largemouth Bass sampled was 8.8 inches.  Crappies ranged in size from 7.1 to 11.3 inches long, and had an average length of 8.7 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was low, with the largest fish measuring only 7.3 inches long.  Bullhead abundance was low, with both Black and Brown Bullheads present.  Other species sampled included Golden Shiner, hybird sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.  Snapping and painted turtles were also observed.  </p>",
