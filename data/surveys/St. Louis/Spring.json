                "narrative": "<p>Spring is a 97 acre lake located 15 miles north of Duluth, MN off highway #44.  Spring Lake has a gravel back-in access on the north shore, a maximum depth of 25 feet and 96% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  Fish population investigations have been conducted in 1964, 1974, 1979, 1984, 1996 and 1998.  The 1996 investigation was a special assessment with night, fall electrofishing.     Abundance of northern pike indexed with assessment nets was 5.5 per lift in 1998.  This index value is typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size structure for northern pike was poor, with only 12% of sampled fish longer than 21 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were slow compared to other populations in Duluth Area.     Black bullhead abundance indexed with assessment nets was 177.0 per lift in 1998.  This index value was high compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of sampled black bullhead was 6.7 inches.     Yellow perch index netting abundance of 7.0 per lift was typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size structure was poor, with only 14% of sampled yellow perch longer than eight inches.  Growth rates for yellow perch sampled in 1998 were typical compared to other populations in Duluth Area.     Black crappie, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were all sampled during the 1998 survey.  Black crappie and pumpkinseed abundance index values were typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type, while bluegill abundance was low.  Black crappie size structure was good with 81% of sampled fish longer than 8 inches.  Black crappie growth rates were fast compared to other populations sampled in Duluth Area.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring is a 97 acre lake with 93 (96%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The lake is located 15 miles northeast of Duluth off highway #44 and has a concrete, back-in access.  Parking at the access is very limited.  Walleye fingerlings, yearlings or adults have been stocked in odd years since 1999.  The lake is currently being managed for walleye and against black bullhead.     Only one walleye was captured during the investigation.  Gillnet catch rate may have been negatively impacted by very high numbers of black bullheads in the nets.     Northern pike abundance of 6.5 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 18.3 inches was small and growth was slow.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2002 year-class and no fish older than age four.     Yellow perch abundance of 0.5 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Yellow perch abundance had declined from 7.0 per gillnet lift in 1998.     Black crappie abundance of 1.2 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 10.2 inches was large and growth was fast.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2001 year-class and no fish older than age six.     Other fish species sampled include bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.     The intent of stocking walleye was to diminish the abundance of black bullhead.  After stocking four walleye year-classses, the goal has not been achieved.  Factors limiting the survival of stocked walleye are not currently understood.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring is a 97-acre lake with 93 acres (96%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The lake is located 15 miles northeast of Duluth off highway #44 and has a concrete, back-in access. Parking at the access is very limited. Walleye fingerlings, yearlings or adults have been stocked in odd years since 1999. The lake is currently being managed for walleye and against black bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nA single walleye was captured in a trapnet and measured 19.5 inches in length.  Only one walleye was sampled in 2005 as well.  The intent of stocking walleye was to diminish the abundance of black bullhead by predation.  After stocking five walleye year-classses, the goal has not been achieved.  Factors limiting the survival of stocked walleye are not currently understood. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 4.5 per gillnet lift was down from 2005 (6.5) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 18.1 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2006 were represented, except the 2003 year-class.  Eighty percent of the sample was from the 2005 year-class.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 0.9 per trapnet lift was down from 2005 (1.2) and average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 8.7 inches.  Not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2005 were represented in the sample. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 0.4 per trapnet lift was up from 2005 (0.1) but remained below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 5.9 inches.    Not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2006 were represented, except the 2003 year-class.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 2.0 per gillnet lift was up from 2005 (0.5) but still below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 9.5 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2005 were represented, except the 2004 year-class.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance of 53.5 per gillnet lift was down from 2005 (255.5) but still well above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black bullhead mean length was 6.0 inches and ranged from 4.7 to 8.7 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

Walleye are scarce and northern pike are numerous enough to provide good fishing.  Two largemouth bass were taken and appear to be from the 1961 stocking.Spring lake receives light to moderate fishing pressure, mostly for northern pike and crappies.  Winter fishing is limited by lake of snowplowing on the access road.</p>",
