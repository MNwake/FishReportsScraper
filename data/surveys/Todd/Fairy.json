                "narrative": "<p>Fairy Lake is a medium-sized basin with a maximum depth of 35 feet.    Water clarity often exceeds 12 feet and nutrient levels are low when compared to other lakes in central Minnesota.  Fairy is a popular recreational lake featuring a large, well maintained public beach and boat access area.   <br> \n     The lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Walleye but much of the fishing pressure appears to be directed at sunfish.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every odd numbered year, though this practice has shown limited recent success.  Walleye numbers have remained below management goals over the last decade most likely due to the high abundance of Northern Pike.  The lake's consistently high pike population exerts considerable predation pressure on Walleye and Yellow Perch.  Most pike are small, averaging about 19 inches.  A few pike reach 30 inches or more but they are the exception.    A reduction in the population of small pike through angler harvest would potentially benefit the lake's fish community. <br> \n     Bluegills are present in good numbers and draw many anglers during winter and the open water season.  \"Eating size\"  fish in the 7-8 inch range are fairly common but fish over 9 inches are rare.  Few crappies were sampled during DNR surveys,  which is not uncommon.  Low samples sizes do not necessarily indicate low abundance as crappie are often hard to catch in nets.  Nearly all of the crappies observed in recent efforts were in the 9-11 inch range.  Fairy contains a significant Largemouth Bass population.  Many sizes of bass are present with a decent portion of the population exceeding 15 inches.  Average size is about 1 pound.  Yellow Bullheads are one of the most abundant species in DNR sampling in Fairy Lake.  Although considered a rough fish, Yellow Bullheads are often numerous in clearer lakes such as Fairy.  Common Carp have been observed in the lake, usually during electrofishing surveys.  Carp numbers appear low and most individuals are large. <br> \n     Northern Cisco (Tullibee) continue to reside in Fairy Lake.   Cisco are sensitive to degradation of water quality and their continued presence is a positive indicator of lake health.  Also residing in the lake are at least three additional pollution intolerant species including the Iowa Darter, Banded Killifish, and Blackchin Shiner.  The presence of these intolerant species is further evidence that the lake provides desirable water quality and habitat conditions.   Proper land use practices in the watershed and along the shoreline are encouraged to maintain the lake's water quality.  Minimizing vegetation removal and other habitat disruption along the lakeshore will help ensure Fairy Lake continues to provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fairy Lake supports many different fish species and provides plenty of angling opportunities.  One of the most abundant fish species in the lake is northern pike.  Pike numbers have been high since the early eighties and the lake would be called a \"hammerhandle\" lake by most fishermen.  Average size of the pike seen in the summer survey was 17 inches, however, an occasional larger fish can be found.  The lake has a history of walleye stocking since 1945 and stocking continues today on a every other year schedule.  Walleye abundance appears moderate with a wide variety of sizes available for anglers.  Both largemouth and smallmouth bass are present in Fairy Lake.  Trophy size fish have been documented by both species.  Yellow perch continue to show low abundance which may be a result of the high predator fish populations.  Perch can be an important food species for northern pike and walleye, thus higher numbers of perch would be desirable.  Perch have also been found to help maintain a well-balanced bluegill population.      Panfish species in Fairy Lake include black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseeds, and hybrid sunfish.  Crappies up to 10 inches in length were seen in the survey along with bluegills up to 8 inches.  Bluegill are popular with anglers even though most of the fish caught are small.  Tullibee or cisco are present, but numbers appear to be low. Yellow bullheads are abundant and numbers have increased significantly since the last survey in 1997.  Despite the high numbers, size structure of the population looks good.  The majority of the bullheads were more than 10 inches in length and several of the fish were over 14 inches.  Bowfin are common and while not an eating fish, they can provide a good fight.  Another roughfish species present is white sucker, although numbers appear low.    Northern pike have been removed from Fairy Lake several times in an attempt to provide broodstock for other areas and to reduce numbers in the population and improve growth.  Those removals appear to have had little impact on the population.  Anglers are encouraged to aid in this effort by keeping pike under 20\" inches and release all larger fish.  This could also help reduce pressure on the perch population and reduce competition with and predation on walleye fingerlings.  Releasing larger individuals in most populations will help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.</p>",

NORTHERN PIKE EXIBITED A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN NUMBERS GOING FROM 26.4/GILLNET IN 1981 TO 9.8/GILLNET IN 1986. EVEN WITH THE DE- CREASE IN NUMBERS, THE POPULATION IS STILL WELL ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE INDICATING A HIGH POPULATION. LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS OF 13.0-31.9 COMPARED TO 12.0-30.9 IN 1981 SUGGEST NO DIFFER- ENCE IN SIZE STRUCTURE. AVG WT PER FISH INCREASED SLIGHTLY TO ALMOST 2 PDS. SCALE AGING SHOWS A GOOD RATE OF GROWTH. THE LAST STOCKING OF NORTHERN PIKE OCCURRED IN 1973. FAIRY LAKE HAS A HISTORY OF WALLEYE MANAGMENT, EVIDENCED BY STOCKING IN 22 OF THE LAST 40 YEARS. THE CATCH OF WALLEYES WAS STATISTICALLY HIGHER (4.5/GILLNET) THAN IN 1981 (2.0/GILLNET). GILLNET QUARTILES INDICATE AND AVG SIZE POPULATION. SIZES RANGED FROM 11.0-23.9 INCHES WITH 68% 16 INCHRS OR LARGER IN 1981, ONLY 20% WERE 16 INCHES OR LARGER WHILE 60% WERE BETWEEN 7.5-9.9 IN. YELLOW PERCH WERE FOUND IN AVERAGE NUMBERS (17.0/ GILLNET) IN 1956. NETTING IN 1981 AND 1986 FAILED TO PRODUCE A SINGLE FISH. BOTH ADULT AND YOUNG-0F-THE-YEAR WERE FOUND DURING NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS IN 1981 AND 1986 THOUGH THE NUMBERS WERE SMALL. BOWFIN BROWN BULLHEAD, PUMPKINSEED, LARGEMOUTH BASS, BLACK CRAPPIE AND GREEN SUNFISH CATCHES INDICATED AVERAGE SIZE POPULATIONS. BLACK BULL- HEAD CATCHES WERE SLIGHTLY BELOW AVG. NOTICABLY HIGH POPULATIONS WERE NOTED FOR YELLOW BULLHEAD AND BLUEGILL. THE YELLOW BULLHEAD APPEARS TO BE THE DOMINATE OF THE THREE. CATCH RATES AND LENGTH FREQUENCIES REMAIN CONSISTANT. ALMOST 4,000 PDS OF BULLHEADS WERE HARVESTED BY APPARENTLY THIS REMOVAL HAD NO IMPACT ON THE POPULATION. BLUEGILL AND BLACK CRAPPIES EXIBITED A WIDE RANGE IN LENGTHS. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE CAUGHT IN TOO FEW NUMBERS TO MAKE COMPARISONS NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS SHOWED ADEQUATE REPRODUCTION.</p>",

MEAN WEIGHT DECLINED FROM 2.0 LBS/FISH IN 1986 TO 1.6 LBS/FISH IN 1991.  AGES I-VII WERE SAMPLED.  AGES I AND II SHOWED FAST GROWTH, WHILE OTHER AGES DISPLAYED NORMAL GROWTH. AGE II WAS THE DOMINANT YEAR CLASS COMPRISING 49% OF THE CATCH.  A TOTAL OF 835 NOP (1490 LBS) UNDER 24 TTING DURING 1990 AND 1991.  THE WAE GILLNET CATCH SHOWED A REAL DECLINE FROM 1986 (4.50/SET) TO 1991 (1.67/SET).  HIGH NUMBERS OF NOP HAVE LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO A LOWERED WAE POPULATION, DESPITE WAE FINGERLING AND YEARLING STOCKING EVERY OTHER YEAR 1980-1988 AND 1991.  WAE AVERAGED NEARLY 3 POUNDS, REFLECTING ON THE 2 AGE CLASSES SAMPLED (V AND VII).  GROWTH WAS NORMAL, YEP HAVE NOT BEEN CAUGHT IN STANDARD LAKE SURVEY NETS SINCE 1956. HOWEVER, BOTH ADULT AND YOUNG-OF-YEAR PERCH HAVE BEEN FOUND IN NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS DURING EACH OF THE LAST 3 SURVEYS BASED ON SPRING TRAP- NETTING DURING 1990 AND 1991 AND LAKE SURVEY NETTING IT APPEARS THAT A GOOD LMB POPULATION EXISTS IN THE LAKE.  GROWTH OF AGES I-IV LMB WAS NORMAL.  TWO SMB, 16 GILLNETS.  THIS WAS THE FIRST RECORDED OCCURRENCE OF SMB IN THE LAKE.  THE BLG POPULATION (58.50/ SET) REMAINS AT HIGH LEVELS AND SIMILAR TO THE LAST 3 NETTINGS.  94% OF TRAPNET CAUGHT BLG WERE LESS THAN 7 INCHES.  AGES III-VI AND VIII WERE SAMPLED AND GROWTH WAS SLOW.  BLC WERE PRESENT IN LOW NUMBERS (0.50/SET) COMPARED TO 1986 (2.00/SET) ONLY 5 FISH, AGES II AND III, WERE SAMPLED.  YEB NUMBERS REMAINED HIGH (12.50/SET) AND ARE MOST ABUNDANT BULLHEAD SPECIES.  THE MEDIAN LENGTH INCREMENT WAS 9-10 INCHES.  DURING 1989, 2500 LBS OF BULLHEADS WERE REMOVED UNDER TLC WERE SAMPLED IN STANDARD LAKE SURVEY GEAR, HOWEVER, DIRECTED ASSESSMENT WILL LIKELY BE CONDUCTED AS PER MOST RECENT LAKE MANAGEMENT PLAN. A SINGLE CAP WAS CAPTURED IN A TRAPNET INDICATING THE PRESENCE OF THE SPECIES FOR THE FIRST TIME.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fairy Lake is the last lake in the Fairy Lake chain north of Sauk Centre andis a popular largemouth bass, bluegill, and northern pike fishery.  Supportingmoderate development around the shoreline, water clarity has remained good for alake in this area of the state.  A county park is located on the southeast sidewith an excellent swimming beach and picnic area.      Fairy Lake supports many different fish species and provides plenty of anglingopportunities.  Largemouth bass are one of the primary management species in thelake.  Sampling efforts from spring electrofishing and summer netting suggest anormal population level.  Average size of the bass was about ten inches, however,fish up to eighteen inches were observed.  Northern pike continue to be abundantdespite three years of pike removal in 1989, 1991, and 1997.  While most of thepike remain under 24 inches, an occasional larger fish can be found.  Walleyenumbers have increased since the 1991 survey and the present population appears tobe dominated by larger fish.  The lake has a history of walleye stocking since 1945and stocking continues today on a every other year schedule.  Natural reproductionappears to add little if any to the population.  The 1997 catch rate for bluegillswas below those seen in previous surveys, but remains normal for the lake type. Fish over six inches were common, but the average size was about five inches.  Someeight-inch bluegills have been observed indicating the lake has the potential toproduce large bluegills.  Yellow perch continue to show low abundance which may bea result of the high predator fish populations.  A high perch population isdesirable as they are a principal prey species for northern pike and walleye andhave also been shown to help maintain a well-balanced bluegill population.  FairyLake appears to have a stable black crappie population.  Average size was small atsix inches, but larger crappies up to eleven inches were observed during the springelectrofishing.  Yellow bullheads continue to be abundant in the lake, but numberswere below those observed in 1991.  Average size was ten inches with some bullheadsmeasuring up to thirteen inches.  Pumpkinseed, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, and greensunfish were also sampled.       Good land use practices are encouraged in the watershed and by lakeshoreowners to protect the water quality in Fairy Lake.  Anglers are encouraged to keepnorthern pike under 21 inches and release all larger fish.  This could help reducepressure on the perch population and also reduce competition with and predation onwalleye fingerlings.  Releasing larger northern pike and walleye and voluntarilylimiting harvest of large panfish will also help sustain the quality and balanceof the fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      A panfish assessment was conducted in early June on Fairy Lake to evaluate the bluegill and black crappie populations.  Bluegill provide an important fishery in the Sauk Centre area.  Six lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice for a total of 12 net lifts.  A similar trap net assessment was also done in mid-June of 2004.  All the bluegill and gamefish were measured in the 2010 assessment while other fish species were identified and counted.  Scales were taken from bluegill for age data.   <br> \n      The 2010 assessment sampled a total of 134 bluegill (11.2/TN) which was a small sample size.  A larger sample would have been more desirable to better evaluate the population.  The fish measured from 2.7 to 8.9 inches in length with a mean length of 5.2 inches.  There were two modal length groups, 4.5 - 5 and 5 - 5.5 inches, in the sample.   Fish larger than seven inches accounted for 11% (n=15) of the catch.  Ages 3 through 11 were represented in the 2010 bluegill sample.   A strong 2005 year class accounted for 35% of the catch.  All of the age groups displayed normal growth when compared to an area mean back- calculated length table. <br> \n      The 2004 panfish assessment had a much higher bluegill catch, n= 1041 (94.6/TN).   Despite the larger sample, size structure of the catch was more desirable than that displayed in 2010.  The fish ranged from three to nine inches length with a mean length of six inches.   Modal length for the sample was 6 - 6.5 inches.  Although the proportion of bluegill that exceeded seven inches was lower (9%) than in 2010, the number (n=98) of larger fish appeared more impressive. <br> \n      A lake survey was also conducted on Fairy Lake in mid-July of 2004. The trap nets in that survey captured 648 bluegill measuring from 3.7 to 9.3 inches in length.  The catch rate of 72/trap net exceeded the 75% quartile of 46.6/TN for lake class 31, suggesting an abundant population.  Both the mean length and modal length of the sample were the same as that in the earlier 2004 panfish assessment.  As with most summer trap net catches, the bluegill sample was dominated by smaller fish as only 7% (n=46) of the fish exceeded seven inches in length.   <br> \n      No black crappie were netted in the 2010 panfish assessment while the 2004 panfish assessment captured 19 crappie (1.7/TN).  Crappie in the 2004 assessment ranged from 6.1 to 10.4 inches in length with a mean length of 8.8 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 8.5 - 9 inches and 37% (n=7) of the fish were more than 9 inches in length.    <br> \n      The 2004 lake survey trap nets captured 12 crappies for a catch rate of 1.3/trap net which was within the normal interquartile range of 0.7 - 3.4/TN for lake class 31.  The crappies were between 6.8 and 9.7 inches in length with a mean length of 8.6 inches.  Modal length was the same as in the earlier 2004 panfish assessment, however, the proportion of fish exceeding nine inches was lower, 25% (n=3).    <br> \n      One five-inch largemouth bass along with six northern pike were also captured in the 2010 panfish assessment.  The pike ranged from 12 to 18 inches in length.  Other fish species netted included bowfin, brown bullhead, common carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.   <br> \n      Panfish assessments appeared to be a valuable method for evaluating the bluegill population in Fairy Lake but have not always  worked for black crappie.  Timing of the panfish assessments may have to be adjusted to better target the black crappie.  We may also consider sampling crappie while spring electrofishing for largemouth bass.  The summer lake survey trap nets have produced good bluegill catches, but the samples have been dominated by smaller fish. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fairy Lake is a medium-sized basin located near Sauk Centre, MN with a maximum depth of 35 feet.  Water clarity often exceeds 12 feet and nutrient levels are low when compared to other lakes in central Minnesota.  Fairy is a popular recreational lake featuring a large, well maintained public beach and boat access area along the east side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are present in good numbers and draw many anglers during winter and the open water season.  The 2019 panfish trapnet assessment captured 232 Bluegill and was on the lower end of the range seen in previous assessments (134 to 1,041).  Fish captured in 2019 ranged from 4.3 to 9.8 inches and averaged 7.1 inches in total length.  Bluegills in the 7-8 inch range were common and fish over 9 inches were present but rare.  Fish exceeding seven inches comprised approximately 58% (n=135) of the sample and nearly 24% (n=55) were more than eight inches.  Just over 2% of the catch was greater than 9 inches in total length.    These percentages were the highest observed when compared to previous surveys.  Percent of Bluegills over 7 inches ranged from 9% (2004) to 24% (2015) in previous assessments.  Anglers can help maintain quality Bluegill populations by limiting harvest of fish greater than 8 inches in length and even releasing all fish exceeding 9 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 108 Black Crappies were sampled during the survey.  Previous surveys sampled fewer Black Crappies which is not uncommon.  Spring crappie catches can be highly variable and susceptible to weather patterns or timing of the survey.  Low sample sizes do not necessarily indicate low abundance as crappie are often hard to catch in nets.  Crappies captured ranged from 6.8 to 12.2 inches and averaged 9.6 inches.  Approximately 41% of Black Crappies sampled exceeded 10 inches in total length. <br> \n <br> \nProper land use practices in the watershed and along the shoreline are encouraged to maintain the lake's water quality.  Minimizing vegetation removal and other habitat disruption along the lakeshore will help ensure Fairy Lake continues to provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This standard survey report is the latest for Fairy Lake and is a summary of data collected the week of July 6, 2021. Survey gear used included gill nets and electrofishing with locations and times replicated from the ?Targeted Survey' last completed in 2015 and found in ?LakeFinder dated 2015-07-13'. <br> \n <br> \nFairy Lake can be considered mainly a Northern Pike lake, with good Largemouth Bass and Bluegill fishing as well. Black Crappies are also present but are not as abundant as Bluegills. There are very few Walleyes in the lake despite efforts to establish a fishery through stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled a total of 60 pike ranging from 12-34 inches. Close to 20% of the sample was 24 inches or greater, which doesn't sound too impressive but compared to other lakes in the area it's decent. We consistently find a few pike in Fairy Lake exceeding 30 inches. Because large pike are relatively rare, it's important for anglers and spearers to refrain from harvesting them. Pike fisheries where large fish are protected (either voluntarily or through special harvest regulations) can shift to higher numbers of large fish which can be beneficial to the entire fish community. The opposite is true for lakes that have no large pike and many small ones.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass up to 20 inches and Bluegill up to nine inches were sampled during this survey. Fairy Lake supports good Largemouth Bass and Bluegill fisheries mainly because there is still good remaining habitat around the lake's shallow-water areas. It's important for lakeshore property owners to recognize this and help to maintain native vegetation and resist the impulse to convert natural shoreline features into artificially engineered blights of riprap, lawns and retaining walls.  <br> \n <br> \nOne of the more noteworthy findings in this survey was the capture of a Cisco, which is an indication that Fairy Lake still holds sufficient cold-water habitat during the summer to support this species. As an indicator species of good water quality, Cisco are in decline across central Minnesota. It's likely that they're declining in Fairy Lake as well. A lone Cisco could serve as a call-out for better land stewardship along the shoreline and in the immediate watershed. As the climate warms, such cold-water habitat may disappear altogether unless immediate steps are taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   A special gillnet assessment was conducted on Fairy Lake by Research personnel from the Glenwood Office to gather data for a walleye research study.  Stocking regimes are being studied to determine the most effective stocking rates in moderate-sized Minnesota lake classes 23, 24, 25, and 31.  Lakes have been stocked with OTC marked fingerlings and gillnetting used as the recapture method three years after each stocking to assess the stocking contribution to the population.  Marked fingerlings were first stocked in 2001 followed by additional stockings in 2003 and 2005.  The standard lake survey gillnet locations were used for comparing population abundance and changes.  <br> \n     Walleye gillnet catches have shown significant decreases in the last three assessments with the 2008 walleye gillnet catch of 0.2/lift (n=1) also being the lowest catch to date.  The catch rate was 1.5/gillnet in 2006 and 2.5/gillnet in 2004.   In 2001 the walleye gillnet catch was 3.8/set.  The initial survey in 1956 had the highest catch rate at 9.5/gillnet while catches from 1981 to 1997 ranged from 1.7/lift to 4.5/lift.  The 2008 walleye catch fell below the 25% quartile for lake class 31 as well as the management goal of 4 - 6 walleye per gillnet.  Since the lake management plan was written, only the 1986 gillnet catch of 4.5/lift has met the management goal.   Except for the 2008 catch, all of the other catches have fallen within the normal range for the lake class (interquartile range = 1.3 - 5).  Refer to the Research report for an analysis of walleye stocking.   <br> \n    Northern pike numbers appear to have increased significantly since 2006 after showing a significant decrease in abundance from 2004.  Gillnet catches were 17.5/gillnet in 2008, 9.2/gillnet in 2006, and 16.2/gillnet in 2004.  Fairy Lake has a history of supporting an abundant northern pike population dominated by small fish.  Four of the five surveys from 1981 to 2001 have recorded pike catches above the 75% quartile of 10.5/gillnet.  While the 1986 survey had a gillnet catch of 9.8/lift, the lowest catch rate was 3/gillnet in 1956.  None of the gillnet catches other than the 1956 catch have met the management goal of less than 7 pike per lift.  Northern pike in the 2008 survey measured from 11 to 35 inches with a mean length of 19 inches, a modal length of 17 - 18 inches, and 10% (n=11) exceeding 24 inches in length.  The lake has shown that it can produce quality size fish with pike up to 36 inches being caught in the 2004 survey, however, only small portions of the catches have actually exceeded 24 inches in length.  In 1956 when the pike population was at its lowest, 50% of the pike in the sample were more than 24 inches in length.  Since then the proportion of pike over 24 inches has ranged from 1% in 1997 to 16% in 2004.  Pike over 24 inches comprised 10% of the 2008 catch.  The management goal for Fairy Lake is to have a pike catch where at least 30% of the fish are over 24 inches in length. <br> \n    Along with the walleye, yellow perch have also shown a significant decrease in abundance, which presumably was due to the higher than desired pike numbers.  The 1956 survey was the only report to have a perch catch (17/gillnet) within the normal range for the lake class (interquartile range = 3.4 - 43.6).  Five of the eight surveys since then, including the 2008 survey, failed to sample any yellow perch.  The 2006 catch of 1.3/gillnet was likely due to the stocking of adult perch in April of the survey year.  Catches of 0.2/gillnet and 0.3/gillnet were reported in 1997 and 2004, respectively. <br> \n     The 2008 survey produced a largemouth bass gillnet catch of 0.5/lift which was not a significant change from the 2/gillnet catch of 2006.  Catch rates from 1981 to 2004 ranged from 0.2/gillnet to 1.8/gillnet.  Most of the catch rates have fallen within the interquartile range of 0.3 - 1.7/gillnet for the lake class.  Bass in the 2008 survey measured from 6 to 11 inches in length.  Electrofishing efforts in 1997 and 1992 produced catch rates of 59/hour and 95/hour, respectively, suggesting that electrofishing has been a more effective method of evaluating the bass population.  Bass up to 19 inches have been netted in the electrofishing efforts showing that the lake can produce trophy size bass.  The presence of smallmouth bass in Fairy Lake was documented in both the 1991 and 2001 surveys, which recorded gillnet catches of 0.3/set and 0.2/set, respectively (interquartile range = 0.2 - 1.4). <br> \n     Tullibee were caught in the 2008 gillnet survey after being absent in the 2006 survey.  Abundance appeared to be low in both the 2004 and 2001 surveys while again no tullibee were caught in the surveys from 1986 to 1997.  The highest tullibee catch was 2/gillnet in 1981 with none being reported in the 1956 survey.  The 0.5/gillnet catch in 2008 fell within the interquartile range of 0.5 - 4.8/gillnet for the lake class.  The fish (n=3) were between 13 and 16.5 inches in length.   <br> \n     Population densities appear low for black crappie and bowfin as their gillnet catches in 2008 were below their respective 25% quartiles for the lake class.  Catch rates for both brown and yellow bullhead were within the normal range for both species.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey to collect trap net data of Fairy Lake beginning on August 14, 2018 was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Bluegill dominated the trap net catch and accounted for 70% of the individuals. Of the 197 Bluegill sampled, 47% were between 5 and 7 inches, 23% were over 7 inches, and 5% were over 8 inches in total length. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net survey data collected in this survey is combined with data from a July 2015 gill net survey and a July 2015 survey of nearshore fishes to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Fairy Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes. For additional information of the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Sauk River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fairy Lake is a clear water lake that supports many different fish species and can provide plenty of angling opportunity.  Much of the shoreline around the lake was sand and a secchi disk reading of 16 feet was seen in mid-July.  A county park with a swimming beach, picnic shelter, and tables is located on the south shore of the lake.  The lake has an abundance of fishing structure with an underwater hump, steep drop-offs, several points, bays, and weedlines.  Some of the more common aquatic plants were muskgrass, coontail, whitestem pondweed, flatstem pondweed, and native watermilfoil.      One of the most abundant fish species in the lake is northern pike.  Pike numbers have been high since the early eighties and the lake would be called a \"hammerhandle\" lake by most fishermen.  Average size of the pike caught in the summer survey was 20 inches, however, more fish over 24 inches were seen in this survey than any other since 1959.  Fairy Lake has a history of walleye stocking since 1945 and stocking continues today in odd numbered years.  Walleye numbers did show a decline from 2001 and most of the fish seen in the survey were over 20 inches in length.  The lack of smaller walleye may be from a combination of the high pike numbers and the low yellow perch numbers.  Perch numbers have been low in Fairy Lake since 1981.  Higher numbers of perch are desirable as they can be an important food species for both northern pike and walleye.  Perch have also been found to help maintain a well-balanced bluegill population.    Both largemouth and smallmouth bass are present in Fairy Lake.  Trophy size fish have been documented in both species.  Panfish species in the lake include black crappies, bluegills, and pumpkinseeds.  While abundance appears normal for the crappies, the population is dominated by small fish.  Few crappies over 11 inches have been seen in any of the surveys with most in the 8 - 9 inch range.  Bluegill numbers showed an increase in abundance but fish in the 6 - 7 inch range were common with some 9 inch fish documented.  The pumpkinseed are much less common and smaller in size than the bluegills.  Tullibee are present but could be hard to locate as their numbers appear to be low.    Other species in the fish community include bowfin or dogfish, brown bullheads, and yellow bullheads.  The yellow bullheads were the most numerous of the two species and are available in a wide range of sizes.  Average size for the yellow bullheads was 10 - 11 inches while most of the brown bullheads in the survey were over 12 inches in length.      Northern pike have been removed from Fairy Lake several times to provide broodstock for other areas of the state and to reduce numbers in Fairy Lake and improve growth.  Those removals appear to have had little impact on the population.  Anglers are encouraged to aid in this effort by keeping pike under 20\" and releasing all larger fish.  This could also help reduce pressure on the perch population and reduce competition with and predation on walleye fingerlings.  Releasing larger individuals in most populations will help sustain the quality and balance of the fish commmunity.    Protecting and improving the water quality in Fairy Lake should be a priority of the lake association and landowners on the lake and surrounding watershed.  Preservation of emergent vegetation beds can improve water quality and protect shorelines as well as valuable fish habitat.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the water.  Maintaining adequate septics, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and use of zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer will also help reduce nutrients entering the lake thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.  The Todd County Planning and Zoning office in Long Prairie has a good website which provides information for shoreland property owners.  (www.co.todd.mn.us/PlanningZoning/planning.htm)</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   A special gillnet assessment was conducted on Fairy Lake by Research personnel from Glenwood to gather data for a walleye research study.  Stocking regimes are being studied to determine the most effective stocking rates in moderate-sized Minnesota lake classes 23, 24, 25, and 31.  Lakes were stocked with OTC marked fish and gillnetting has been used as the recapture method three years afer each stocking.  Marked fingerlings were first stocked in 2001 followed by additional stockings in 2003 and 2005.  The standard lake survey gillnet locations were used for comparing population abundance and changes.  Scales and otoliths were taken only from walleye by Research for age data.  A full oxygen - temperature profile and field measurements of water quality were not done.  No aging data was provided for the report. <br> \n    The walleye gillnet catch of 1.5/set (n=9) in 2006 was the lowest catch to date for the lake and a significant decrease from the 2.5/gillnet catch of 2004.  The catch rate fell within the normal range for lake class 31 but remained below the management goal of 4 - 6 walleye per gillnet (interquartile range = 1.3 - 5).   The 1986 gillnet catch of 4.5/set, while being the highest walleye catch for Fairy, was also the only catch rate to meet the management goal. Look to the Research report for an analysis of the walleye stocking.   Walleye in the 2006 sample ranged from 16.7 to 25 inches with a mean length of 19.9 inches and 44% (n=4) of the fish exceeding 20 inches.  The fifteen walleye caught in the 2004 survey measured between 13.7 and 25 inches with a mean length of 19.5 inches.  Larger walleye dominated the sample as 60% (n=9) were more than 20 inches in length.  Mean weight in both the 2006 and 2004 was 2.8 pounds which exceeded the management goal of an average weight in the gillnet catch between 1.5 and 2.5 pounds.   <br> \n    The northern pike gillnet catch also showed a significant decrease in abundance since the last survey.  The gillnet catch went from 16.2/set (n=97) in 2004 to 9.2/set (n=55) in 2006.  The 2006 gillnet catch was also the lowest catch recorded for the lake while the record high was 26.4/gillnet in 1981.  Fairy Lake has a history of supporting an abundant population of small fish.   Five of the seven surveys have produced gillnet catches which have exceeded the 75% quartile of 10.5/gillnet.  The only gillnet catch beside the 2006 catch to fall within the normal range was 9.8/gillnet in 1986 and none of the catch rates have met the management goal of less than 7 pike per gillnet.  The pike in the 2006 assessment ranged from 13 ato 32 inches in length with a mean length of 18.6 and modal length of 17- 18 inches.  While at least one northern pike over 30 inches has been caught in the last three surveys, few in the samples have been over 24 inches.  The 2004 survey produced the highest proportion of pike exceeding 24 inches with 16% (n=15) while the remaining surveys have been between 0 and 8%.  Only 5% (n=3) of the pike in the 2006 were over 24 inches inches.  The management goal has been to obtain a population size strucure where at least 30% of the gillnet catch is more than 24 inches in length. <br> \n     The 2006 largemouth  bass catch of 2/gillnet was the highest gillnet catch for the lake and also above the 75% quartile of 1.7/gillnet.  The last two surveys, 2004 and 2001, showed catches of 0.2/gillnet which fell below the 25% quartile of 0.3/gillnet.  Bass in the 2006 survey ranged from 4.5 to 16 inches in length with a mean length of 12.2 inches and modal length of 14 - 15 inches.  The PSD for the sample was 64 with a RSD of 9.   <br> \n      More yellow perch were sampled in the 2006 survey (1.3/gillnet) than in the 2004 survey (0.2/gillnet) but the catch rate still remained below the 25% quartile of 3.4/gillnet.  Perch have historically been low in Fairy Lake with the 2006 catch rate being the highest catch recorded for the lake.  A bait dealer from Sauk Centre stocked adult perch in Fairy Lake in April of 2006 which may account for some of the captured fish as they were all over 8.8 inches in length.   <br> \n     Catch rates were within the normal range for bowfin and brown bullheads when compared to their respective interquartile ranges while yellow bullheads appear to be above normal abundance.  The 2006 catch of 19/gillnet exceeded the 75% quartile of 10.5/ gillnet and was more than the 2004 catch of 14.7/gillnet.  While most of the yellow bullhead catches have been high, the highest catch was 30.8/gillnet in 1991 with only the 1981 catch of 10.2/gillnet falling within the normal range (interquartile range = 1 - 10.50.  The panfish species sampled in the gillnets included black crappies, bluegills, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseeds.</p>",

Water clarity often exceeds 12 feet and nutrient levels are low when compared to other lakes in central Minnesota.  Fairy is a popular recreational lake featuring a large, well maintained public beach and boat access area.   <br> \n Bluegills are present in good numbers and draw many anglers during winter and the open water season.    The 2015 panfish trap net assessment captured 838 Bluegill .  \"Eating size\"  fish in the 7-8 inch range are fairly common but fish over 9 inches are rare.  Fish exceeding seven inches comprised approximately 24% (n=205) of the sample with approximately 3% (n=24) more than eight inches.   Few crappies were sampled during DNR surveys,  which is not uncommon.  Low samples sizes do not necessarily indicate low abundance as crappie are often hard to catch in nets.  Nearly all of the crappies observed in recent efforts were in the 9-11 inch range <br> \n        Proper land use practices in the watershed and along the shoreline are encouraged to maintain the lake's water quality.  Minimizing vegetation removal and other habitat disruption along the lakeshore will help ensure Fairy Lake continues to provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat. <br> \n</p>",
