                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted in 1998 to evaluate the effectiveness of channel catfish stocking and to examine overall fish abundance.  A total of nine trapnets were fished in similar locations to previous surveys.  Overall the fish population was similar to past investigations.  Black bullhead and black crappie catch rates declined from 1992 levels.  However, black crappie abundance was within the goal of 3 to 20 fish/net established in the lake management plan.     Channel catfish were stocked as fingerlings in 1980, 1983, and 1992.  The lake management plan was rewritten in 1993 and required annual stocking of 660 yearling channel catfish.  Yearlings are significantly larger than fingerlings and typically exhibit increased survival.  Unfortunatley channel catfish were not collected in trapnets or by electrofishing in 1998.  However a single catfish estimated at 4 to 5 lbs in weight was observed during electrofishing but could not be netted.  Channel catfish habe proven to be difficult to sample in area lakes.  Anglers commonly catch catfish in waters where trapnets and electrofishing catch few if any individuals.  In future evaluations, different sampling gears will be utilized.     The goal of establishing a self-sustainging channel catfish population in Ramsey Mill Pond is unlikely to be achieved due to a lack of suitable spawning habitat.  Therefore continued stocking will be necessary to maintian the population if further sampling shows adequate survival of stocked yearlings.</p>",

Black crappie were the most abundant gamefish sampled in 2007 and averaged 6.5 per trapnet.  Black crappie were evenly distibuted from 6-11 inches.  Bluegill were represented by small 3.5 - 5 inch fish and averaged 6 per trapnet.  A few larger (22-24 inch) channel catfish were captured.  Other species present include black bullhead, carp, golden redhorse, green sunfish, quillback, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ramsey Mill Pond is a small, 53 acre impoundment of the Cedar River located in the Town of Austin in Mower County. A private boat ramp is located near the dam and is primarily suited for carry-in watercraft. Ramsey Mill Pond is a class 42 lake reaching a maximum depth of 18 feet and having turbid brown/green water likely cause by algae and runoff. A dissolved oxygen profile was taken and dissolved oxygen ranged from 8.5 ppm at the surface to 0.3 ppm at 9.0 feet. Thermal stratification of the water column occurred between 6.0 and 8.0 feet as temperature dropped from 70.5 to 68.7 degrees Fahrenheit.  Although typically not stocked, Ramsey Mill Pond was stocked with adult walleye in 2007. The sport fish community was comprised of northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill. A population assessment was conducted on 9-4-2012 to monitor the fish community using one gill net and 4 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured at a rate of 1.0/gill which is low when compared to similar lakes. Pike were also captured at a rate of 1.0/trap net and ranged in length from 20.1 to 26.6 inches and averaged 23.9 inches. Northern pike abundance has historically been low in this system with catch rates not exceeding 2.0/gill net in any survey.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie tended to be small and were captured at a rate of 5.3/trap net which is about average compared to similar lakes. Ninety-five percent of the crappies captured were less than 8.5 inches long. Black crappie catch rates have steadily decreased over the last 4 surveys, decreasing from 15.2, to 7.3, to 6.5, to 5.3/trap net in 1992, 1998, 2007, and 2012, respectively. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills occurred in low numbers (3.3/trap net) and were small as 92% were less than 5.0 inches in length. Historic catch rates indicate that bluegills have occurred in low numbers since the onset of surveys (minimum = 0.1/trap net; maximum = 6.0/trap net).  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads were the most abundant species captured at 57.0/gill net and 10.5/trap net. The black bullhead gill net catch rate was the highest observed catch rate for this water body. Black bullheads ranged in length from 5.7 to 10.9 inches and averaged 7.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp, golden redhorse, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch were also present, but occurred in low numbers. All of the species listed have been sampled in previous surveys. <br> \n</p>",

NOP WAS THE ONLY SPECIES CAPTURED DURING NETTING THAT WAS LARGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS.  LMB CAPTURED DURING ELECTROFISHING WERE LARGE; 61% WERE LARGER THAN 12 INCHES.  COMPARED TO THE 1981 SURVEY, BLB HAVE DECREASED BY ONE-THIRD.  BLC NUMBERS HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED PER NET SET FROM 1981 TO 1992. OTHER SPECIES NUMBERS HAVE REMAINED STABLE. EXCEPT FOR BLC, REPRODUCTION OF GAMEFISHES AND PANFISHES APPEARS TO BE LOW AND VARIABLE.  NOP AND BLG ESPECIALLY SHOWED EVIDENCE OF WEAK OR MISSING YEAR-CLASSES.  SIX YEAR-CLASSES OF LMB WERE SAMPLED WITH AGE 7 BEING THE OLDEST.</p>",
