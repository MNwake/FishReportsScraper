Although it is primarily a waterfowl lake, it produces occasional large populations of certain gamefish such as northern pike and crappie.  In 1993 DNR fisheries crews used gillnets and trapnets to assess the fish population in Cedar Lake.       Gamefish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass, yellow perch, black crappie and bluegill were present in Cedar Lake.  Although these species were present in low numbers, other fish species such as black bullhead and common carp dominate the fish population in Cedar Lake.       Information from this years survey will be used to evaluate the potential contribution of Cedar Lake as spawning habitat for gamefish populations in Belle Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Cedar in 2008 to monitor the lake's physical, chemical, and biological characteristics.  A total of 15 different species of fish were sampled.  Crappie fishing was significant during the 2007-2008 winter.  Cedar has a history of partial winterkills and was opened to Liberalized fishing as recently as 2001.  Cedar was used as a source for brood stock northern pike around 2001 and black crappie were removed to meet kid's fishing pond quotas in 2008.  Many of the islands on the lake are now state owned and managed as Aquatic Management Areas. <br> \n <br> \nCedar's lakeshed (12,141 acres) was dominated by row crop agriculture.  The lakeshed to lake ratio was 6:1.  Much of the shoreline remained undeveloped, with forest, at least a thin fringe, and marshland accounting for the majority of it.  Cattail, filamentous algae and curly-leaf pondweed were ranked as common aquatic plants, while all other varieties (15) were classified as rare.  Curly-leaf pondweed was abundant in May and June, with surface mats on the south, east, and north sides of the lake.  Silt and detritus were ranked as abundant shoalwater substrates.  Water clarity was poor (1.6' secchi) in early June.  Water chemistry results further indicated a degraded lake.  The maximum depth encountered during the survey was 7.5 feet. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 0 walleye for a catch rate of 0.0/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 1998 catch rate was 0.1/net.  Past and present gill net catch rates indicated that there was little movement of walleye from Belle Lake into Cedar Lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 78 northern pike for a catch rate of 5.2/net, which was withing the normal range for lakes of this type.  The 1998 catch rate was 6.9/net.  Northern pike were 16.4 to 34.8 inches long averaging 25.6 inches.  Northern pike were 1 to 4 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.      <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 20 yellow perch for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 1998 catch rate was 82.9/net.  Yellow perch were 5.4 to 8.0 inches long averaging 7.0 inches.  Yellow perch were 2 to 4 years old with 3 year-classes present.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 28 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 10.5/hr of electrofisher on-time.  The catch rate in 1998 was 55.1/hr.  Largemouth bass were 5.6 to 18.1 inches long averaging 11.7 inches.  Largemouth bass were 1 to 5 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Growth was fast. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 71 carp for a catch rate of 4.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 1998 catch rate was 0.1/net.  Carp were 20.5 to 29.3 inches long averaging 24.3 inches.  The trap net catch rate was also high (6.6/net).  Carp likely make up a substantial portion of the fish biomass at Cedar Lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 137 black bullhead for a catch rate of 9.1/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was the lowest ever recorded at Cedar Lake.  The 1998 catch rate was 80.7/net.  Black bullhead were 5.8 to 13.2 inches long averaging 10.9 inches.  Trap nets sampled 220 black bullhead, for a catch rate of 15.7/net.  A total of 33 yellow bullhead were trap netted for a catch rate of 2.4/net.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 275 black crappie for a catch rate of 19.6/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 trap net catch rate was the second highest on record at Cedar Lake.  The 1998 catch rate was 11.5/net.  Black crappie were 3.2 to 13.2 inches long averaging 8.7 inches.  Approximately 26% of the trap net catch was 9 inches or longer.  Gill nets sampled 91 black crappie for a catch rate of 6.1/net.  Black crappie were 1 to 6 years old with 6 year-classes present.  Growth was fairly fast.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 26 bluegill for a catch rate of 1.9/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 1998 catch rate was 8.9/net.  Bluegill were 3.7 to 7.2 inches long averaging 5.5 inches.  Only 1 fish was over 7 inches in length.  Bluegill were 2 to 5 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Growth was fairly fast. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining captured young-of-the-year; yellow perch (98), orange spotted sunfish (3), largemouth bass (106), bluegill (603), black crappie (79), and black bullhead (1).  Fathead minnow (1) and spottail shiner (9) were also seined.</p>",

The spawning areas for northern pike are fair to good.  About the only fishing done on Cedar is for the northern.  There are small populations of panfish, but these are subject to winterkill.

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Cedar, beginning on 6/04/18, to monitor the lake's fish population.   Cedar was a class 41 lake and net catches were compared to similar lakes around the state.  The 2009 lake management plan (LMP) listed Black Crappie and Northern Pike as primary management species, while Bluegill and Largemouth Bass were ranked as secondary species at Cedar.  In 2018, a total of 16 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets (GN) and trap nets (TN).  Spring night-time electrofishing (EF) was conducted to sample Cedar's Largemouth Bass population.  The dissolved oxygen concentration was 7.7 mg/l just off the bottom (8.0 feet), indicating that the lake was well mixed during netting week.  Water clarity was fair with a secchi disk reading of 4.5 feet, due to an algae bloom.  Cedar, being a shallow lake, has experienced partial winterkills in the past.  Significant winterkills were documented in 2001 and 2014.  Due to the lake's infrequent winterkills, in recent years anyways, quality fisheries have developed.  Northern Pike and Black Crappie particularly, and Largemouth Bass occasionally.  Fish populations, on Cedar, would be expected to fluctuate widely based on the frequency and severity of winterkill.  Eurasian watermilfoil (EWM), an aquatic invasive species (AIS), was discovered in 2012.  Curlyleaf pondweed, a non-native invasive aquatic plant, has been in Cedar for much longer that EWM, and was typically abundant in May and June, forming surface mats over large sections of the shallow lake.  Low development and multiple islands make for an enjoyable fishing experience at Cedar, but anglers need to be aware of the lake's numerous shallow rock hazards.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets failed to sample any Walleye (0.0/net).  The catch rate was below the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates from 1975 to 2018 (n=8) were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 0.1/net with an average of 0.0.  In 2018, TN's sampled one Walleye that was 26.0 inches in length.  The Walleye was aged using scales and was estimated to be age-12.  The fish was most likely an immigrant from Belle Lake.  Past Cedar Lake GN catch rates indicated that few Walleye move out of Belle and into Cedar.       <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Northern Pike (61) for a catch rate of 6.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake and was tied for the second highest catch ever recorded at Cedar.  The 2009 LMP's long range goal (> 1.2 and <7.8/net) was met.  The 2008 catch rate was similar at 5.2/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2018 (n=8) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 6.9/net with an average of 3.8.  Historically, recruitment would be classified as variable, likely due to the lakes winterkill nature.  In 2018, gill netted Northern Pike were 17.1 to 34.4 inches long with an average of 24.2.  Approximately 13% of the GN catch was 28 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Northern Pike have never been stocked into Cedar Lake and natural reproduction has provided a sufficient fishery for many years.  Northern Pike were not aged, but size distribution data indicated that multiple year classes were present.  New Northern Pike zone regulations went into effect in the spring of 2018.  Cedar was in the north central regulation zone, which had a 10 fish bag limit, where all fish from 22 to 26 inches in length had to be immediately released and only two harvested fish could be over 26 inches long.  Spearers were allowed to have one fish in the protected slot limit.  The regulation was designed to improve the size structure in lakes with \"stunted\" Northern Pike populations.  Over the last two decades Cedar was rarely clear enough for spearing. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers (38) of Black Crappie in 2018 for a catch rate of 7.6/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2009 LMP's long range goal (>3.0/net) was met.  The 2008 TN catch rate was 19.6/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2018 (n=8) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 44.0/net with an average of 11.7.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 3.4 to 9.8 inches long with an average of 6.5.  Only 13% of the TN catch was 9 inches or longer, indicating a low quality size structure.  Gill nets sampled moderate numbers of Black Crappie (57) for a catch rate of 6.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 GN catch rate was similar at 6.1/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2018 (n=8) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 45.6/net with an average of 7.8.  Gill netted Black Crappie were 4.1 to 8.9 inches long with an average of 6.5.  Approximately 21% of the GN catch was 8 inches or longer, indicating a population dominated by small fish.  Black Crappie were not aged, but length frequency distributions indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Black Crappie have never been stocked into Cedar Lake.  <br> \n   <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers of Bluegill (215) for a catch rate of 43.0/net, which was above the lake's normal range and the highest catch rate ever recorded at Cedar.  The 2009 LMP's long range goal for Bluegill (>1.1 and <14.9) was not met (too high).  The 2008 TN catch rate was 1.9/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2018 (n=8) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 43.0/net, with an average of 7.0.  In 2018, TN Bluegill were 3.6 to 6.7 inches long with an average of 5.1. Approximately 17% of the TN catch was 6 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure.  Bluegill were not aged.  Data indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Bluegill were intolerant to low oxygen levels and numbers can fluctuate widely at Cedar Lake depending on the latest winterkill event.  Bluegill have never been stocked into Cedar Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled high numbers (116) of Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 43.5/hour of sampling.  The 2009 LMP's long range goal (maintain presence) was met.  The 2008 catch rate was 10.5/hour.  Historical EF catch rates (n=3) from 1998 to 2018 ranged from 10.5 to 55.1/hour with an average of 36.4.  In 2018, Largemouth Bass were 4.5 to 17.2 inches long with an average of 11.0.  Approximately 43% of the EF sample was 13 inches or longer, indicating a moderate size structure.  Largemouth Bass were not aged, but the size distribution data indicated that most of the 13.0 to 14.9 inch fish were likely from the 2014 year class.  Only 1 longer fish (17.2 inches) was sampled, probably indicating that few Largemouth Bass survived the 2014 Cedar Lake winterkill.  Largemouth Bass immigrants, from connected Belle Lake, likely helped repopulate Cedar following the 2014 winterkill.  Largemouth Bass have never been stocked into Cedar. <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (13) for a catch rate of 1.4/net, which was below the lake's normal range and the second lowest catch rate ever recorded at Cedar.  The 2008 catch rate was similar (1.3/net).  Catch rates from 1975 to 2018 (n=8) were highly variable, ranging from 1.3 to 82.9/net with an average of 27.0.  Yellow Perch have not been sampled in high numbers since 1998 (82.9/net).  Gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.5 to 9.7 inches long with an average of 6.4.  Only 1 fish was over 7 inches in length.  Trap nets captured higher numbers (44) of Yellow Perch, ranging in length from 4.7 to 6.6 inches.  Yellow Perch were not aged, but data indicated inconsistent recruitment.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (6) for a catch rate of 1.2/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was 6.6/net.  Historic catch rates (n=8) from 1975 to 2018 were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 14.5/net with an average of 3.7.  Trap netted Common Carp were 15.4 to 26.6 inches long with an average of 19.5.  Gill nets sampled high numbers of Common Carp (38) for a catch rate of 4.2/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic GN catch rates (n=8) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 15.2/net with an average of 3.4.  Gill netted Common Carp were 13.6 to 31.2 inches long with an average of 19.2.  Size distribution data indicated that multiple year classes were present.  High numbers of Common Carp, over the years, have likely had significant negative impacts on submergent plant abundance and water quality in Cedar Lake.  Common Carp would be difficult to control, in Cedar, due to the lake's highly connected watershed (Belle Lake, Harden Lake, Hoff Lake, and the South Fork of the Crow River).   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (1,006) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 111.8/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Black Bullhead dominated the GN catch in 2018.  The 2008 catch rate was 9.1/net.  Historic GN catch rates from 1975 to 2018 (n=8) were mostly high, ranging from 9.1 to 218.3/net with an average of 93.1, as would be expected in a lake that winterkills.  Black Bullhead were well made to survive low oxygen levels, and typically exhibit excellent reproduction following a significant winterkill.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 5.1 to 14.7 inches long with an average of 7.1.  The majority of the fish were under 8 inches in length, indicating a poor size structure.  Trap nets sampled high numbers (213) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 42.6/net which was within the normal range for this lake type.  Trap netted Black Bullhead were 5.9 to 11.7 inches long with an average of 8.2.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included; Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake, McLeod County, is a 1,924-acre lake with a maximum depth of 8 feet.  A lake survey conducted on Cedar Lake during the weeks of June 8 and June 15, 1998, sampled 15 species of fish.  The survey utilized standard lake survey gill nets, trap nets, shoreline seining, and spring night-time electrofishing.  Net catch data were compared to that of other lakes within the lake's ecological classification.  The lake management plan lists northern pike and black bullhead as the primary management species and black crappie, yellow perch, and largemouth bass as secondary management species.During the 1998 survey, Hutchinson Area Fisheries personnel set nine 250-foot experimental gill nets and 14 standard 3/4 inch mesh, double-frame trap nets.  The four most abundant species in gill nets were yellow perch, black bullhead, northern pike, and black crappie.  The four most abundant species in trap nets were black bulllhead, black crappie, yellow perch, and bluegill.Trap nets sampled 357 black bullheads, for a catch rate of 25.5 per net.  This was above the median (14.7) for a lake of this type.  Historic catch rates for black bullhead have varied considerably (144.9 in 1993, 24.4 in 1983, and 207.9 in 1975).  Black bullheads ranged in length from 3.3 to 13.9 inches, with an average length of 7.3 inches.Gill nets sampled 62 northern pike, for a catch rate of 6.9 per net.  This was above the lake class median (4.5).  The catch rate was similar to catch rates in 1988 and 1983 (4.0 and 6.8, respectively).  Northern pike ranged in length from 14.2 to 30.0 inches, with an average length of 20.6 inches.Gill nets sampled 746 yellow perch, for a catch rate of 82.9 per net.  This was an increase over catch rates from 1988 and 1983 (14.2 and 15.1, respectively).  The 1998 catch rate was the highest recorded, exceeding the 1978 and 1975 catch rates (50.0 and 47.0, respectively).  Yellow perch ranged in length from 4.9 to 10.5 inches, with an average length of 6.8 inches.Trap nets sampled 172 black crappies, for a catch rate of 12.3 per net.  Historic catches of black crappie have been highly variable (0.9 in 1988, 44.0 in 1983, none in 1978, and 7.2 in 1975).  Black crappies were small, ranging in length from 3.6 to 9.1 inches, with an average length of 5.3 inches.Spring night-time electrofishing sampled 147 largemouth bass, for a catch rate of 55.1 per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass had not previously been sampled by this method on Cedar Lake.  Bass ranged in length from 4.0 to 16.7 inches, with an average length of 6.7 inches.</p>",
