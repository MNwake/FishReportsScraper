                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike and Bluegill are primary management species with Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie being considered secondary management species.  The 2009 lake management plan had goals of maintaining a quality Northern Pike fishery characterized by a catch <5.0/gill net with 40% > 21\" and 10% > 28\", and maintain a Bluegill fishery characterized by a catch rate of 10/trap net and 60% > 6\".  Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass have no management goals.  The lake is passively managed through statewide regulations.  This is one of three surveys conducted to assess the status of the fish population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are well suited for the lake, being the most abundant in gill nets (10.0/net) and similar to previous surveys (8.0/net in 1979 and 9.5/net in 1988), but above catches typically observed in similar lakes.  The catch failed to attain the management catch goal.  Size structure was good despite a high catch and small lake size, yet similar to the previous survey and the management size goal.  Lengths ranged from 10.9 to 37.6 inches with an average length of 21.0 inches.  Fish within the north central protected slot regulation (22\" to 26\") comprised 13% of the catch.  Age analysis identified relatively consistent recruitment with ages 1 to 8 present in the sample and somewhat even distribution of middle ages.  Growth was similar to the statewide averages for all ages.  Northern Pike averaged 23.2 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch was similar to the previous survey and lakes with comparable habitat.  Unfortunately, the catch was three times the management goal.  Size structure was fair, though few fish exceeded 8 inches (PSD-6=78, PSD-8=13, PSD-10=0, n=245) and similar to previous surveys.  Lengths ranged from 3.1 to 9.1 inches with an average length of 6.6 inches.  Age analysis identified ages 3 to 10 suggesting relatively consistent recruitment.  Ages 7 and 8 comprised 54% of the expanded age frequency.  Growth was similar to the lake class average early but exceeded averages by age 5.  Bluegill averaged 7.1 inches by age 7. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are suspected of being well suited for the lake, although limited information exists.  Largemouth Bass were captured in all surveys, however test netting is a poor indicator of bass abundance.  Lengths ranged from 9.9 to 17.4 inches.  Ages 3, 4, 6 and 9 were identified.  Growth was slow early but similar to statewide averages by age 3. <br> \n <br> \nTrap netting caught a relatively high number of Black Crappie compared to lakes with similar habitat.  Average numbers were caught in previous surveys.  Size structure was moderate and similar to the past surveys.  Lengths ranged from 7.4 to 11.5 inches with an average length of 9.3 inches.  Age determination identified ages 3 to 7 and 9.  Growth was slow, below statewide averages, but within 15% of averages by age 4.  Black Crappie averaged 9.7 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nThe Tullibee gill net catch was average and similar to previous surveys.  Tullibee likely contribute to the favorable Northern Pike size structure.  Lengths ranged from 10.0 to 16.2 inches with an average length of 14.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",
