                "narrative": "<p>Lightfoot Lake is a 64 acre lake located two miles northwest of Buffalo.  The lake has been  low priority for management because it has no public access and is subject to winter kill.  Lightfoot Lake is of interest because good fishing occasionally exists.  This was the first survey since 1962. <br> \n <br> \nThe maximum depth of Lightfoot Lake is 22 feet.  Dissolved oxygen, measured on 24 June, was 0.6 ppm at 11 feet.   Secchi depth was 3.5 feet.  Aquatic plants were diverse but grew only to a depth of 1.5 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing was conducted for the first time on Lightfoot Lake on 7 May during daylight.  In approximately one hour, eleven largemouth bass and twelve walleye were collected.  Largemouth bass were between 11 and 17 inches with an average length of 14 inches.  Walleye collected by all gear on Lightfoot Lake were between 10 and 25 inches with an average length of 18 inches.  Growth of both species was faster than the statewide averages. Since walleye are not stocked in Lightfoot Lake, walleye likely immigrated from nearby Buffalo Lake via Mill Creek. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of northern pike, 3.75/gill net, was about average for similar lakes.  Fish were between 18 and 30 inches.  Average length and weight were 25 inches and 4 pounds.  Seventy-three percent of northern pike were greater than 24 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were collected in gill nets and trap nets.  The trap net catch rate, 22/net, and average weight, 0.3 pounds, were within expected ranges.  Fish from all netting were between 4 and 10 inches and averaged 8 inches.  Growth was fast compared to similar lakes.  Black crappie could be expected to reach eight inches between ages three and four. <br> \n <br> \nBoth the trap net catch rate for bluegill, 15/net, and the average weight of each fish, 0.20 pounds, were near the average for similar lakes.  Bluegill from both trap nets and gill nets ranged from 4 to 8.5 inches with an average length of six inches.  Growth was above average for similar lakes as bluegill grew to six inches between ages three and four.  <br> \n    <br> \nOther fish collected were black and yellow bullhead, bowfin, carp, white sucker, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish, Johnny darter, bluntnose minnow, and common, emerald and golden shiner.   At the time of this writing (winter 2009) Lightfoot Lake had sustained another winter kill.</p>",
