                "narrative": "<p>Hill River Lake has undergone three documented periods of severe winterkill.  The first was during the drought in the 1930's.  A dam was constructed at the outlet in 1935 and reconstructed in 1950 in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent winterkill by raising water levels.  More recently, the dam was reconstructed during road reconstruction.  The second recorded period of winterkill, during winters of 1969 through 1971, was attributed to runoff from a large poultry farm.  The third period, during the mid 1990's, decimated populations of Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegills, and Black Crappies.  Although the lake has a 60 foot maximum depth, much of the lake is considerably shallower.  The lake is also relatively fertile and experiences heavy blue-green algal blooms annually. <br> \n <br> \nEighteen years after the most recent severe winterkill, however, fisheries for pike, bass,  and panfish have substantially recovered while bullhead populations have declined dramatically.  Modest populations of Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass were sampled in 2014 while net catches of Bluegill and Black Crappie were very strong.  Bluegills and crappies were relatively young and relatively small averaging 5.8 and 6.1 inches in length, respectively.  The abundance of young panfish in 2014 may bode well for panfish angling opportunities in the near future, barring a winterkill.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hill River Lake has undergone three documented periods of severe winterkill.  The first was during the drought in the thirties. Dams were constructed at the outlet in 1935 and again in 1950 in a futile attempt to prevent winterkill by raising water levels.  The second recorded period of winterkill, during winters of 1969 through 1971, was attributed to runoff from a large poultry farm.  The third, during 1993, has greatly affected current fish populations.  Although the lake has a 60 foot maximum depth, much of the lake is considerably shallower.  The lake is also relatively fertile.  Some of that fertility is due to natural conditions while some is likely due to non-point source agricultural runoff.  Thus, the lake is  vulnerable to winterkill.  During the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, quality populations of gamefish were present in Hill River Lake.     During the eighties, for instance, northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie were all considered abundant.  Bluegill and crappie were not only numerous, but also relatively large.  Winter pike spearing was popular on the lake.     Following the 1993 winterkill, yellow perch, bullhead, and white sucker replaced gamefish and panfish as the most abundant species in the fish community.  Populations of northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and walleye have been decimated.  Of those species, only two pike and one bluegill were caught in test nets in 1994.  Fortunately, spawning conditions for both of those fish species are considered quite good in the lake.  Additionally, growth rates of fish in winterkill lakes is usually rapid due to the lack of competition for available food.  However, even with excellent natural reproduction the first year following a winterkill, it will still require a few years for fish populations to rebound.     The upshot of all this is that winterkill has occurred and will occur in some kinds of lakes even without the influence of human activities.  In others, however, we have sped the natural process of eutrophication by poor land and water use practices.  Thus, we cause the premature aging of a lake with its undesirable symptoms like winterkill, algal blooms, and abundances of rough fish.  It behooves us all to care enough about those who come after us to \"clean up our acts.\"  Although it is clear that winterkill occurred at least sixty years ago in Hill River Lake, possibly with more \"natural\" conditions existing, it is also clear that damming and increased water levels have not prevented the problem.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hill River Lake has undergone three documented periods of severe winterkill.  The first was during the drought in the 1930's.  Dams were constructed at the outlet in 1935 and again in 1950 in a futile attempt to prevent winterkill by raising water levels.  The second recorded period of winterkill, during winters of 1969 through 1971, was attributed to runoff from a large poultry farm.  The third period, during the mid 1990's, decimated northern pike, bass, and panfish populations.  Although the lake has a 60 foot maximum depth, much of the lake is considerable shallower.  The lake is also relatively fertile and experiences heavy blue-green algal blooms annually.Eight years after the most recent severe winterkill, however, fisheries for pike, bass, bluegills, and black crappies have substantially recovered.  Net catches for each of these species were at or above the lake's historic averages in 2004.  Northern pike up to 31 inches were sampled in test nets.  Small bluegills and crappies were most common, but a few large ones were found as well.  The presence of several year classes indicates that natural reproduction has been successful.  Barring another severe winterkill in the near future, the fishery should continue to recover in Hill River Lake.</p>",

Walleye numbers remain low with only fish from age group VI or older being caught.  However, none were stocked since 1978.  Black crappie were present in average numbers.  The black bullhead (40.33/gillnet) catch remains high but has decreased significantly from surveys in 1984 (104.33/gillnet) and 1977 (188.5/gillnet).
