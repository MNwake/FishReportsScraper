                "narrative": "<p>Belle Taine Lake is located in south-central Hubbard County adjacent to the town of Nevis.  Belle Taine has a surface area of 1,185 acres and a maximum depth of 56 feet.  The public access is located on the east end of the lake and is owned and maintained by the city of Nevis.  Access is also available by small craft during \"normal\" water years from Shallow Lake, which lies to the north of Belle Taine.  Water levels in Bell Taine were very high in the late 1990's, 2 to 3 feet above existing high water marks, but have receded the past few years.  Belle Taine is a very popular lake for fishing and water recreation.  Belle Taine provides good angling opportunities for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Belle Taine is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Bad Axe, West Crooked, Ojibway, Eagle, Island, Big Mantrap, and Little Sand. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (7.5 walleye/gillnet) was at the current management goal of 7 walleye/gillnet.  Surveys since 1991 have had similar walleye abundance, with gillnet catch rates fluctuating just below the management goal.  Walleye abundance in earlier surveys has fluctuated from high numbers in the 1980's to low numbers in 1957 and 1973.  Walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 2.3 walleye/net in 1957 to 29.0/net in 1981.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 15.7 inches and 1.3 pounds, with fish measured up to 26.5 inches.  Belle Taine is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  The walleye forage base is a concern in Belle Taine as the abundance of yellow perch is very low.  Yellow perch abundance (0.1 perch/gillnet) is the lowest recorded for all surveys and well below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Yellow perch numbers have been low since 1986, while yellow perch abundance from earlier surveys were within or above the range \"typical\" for this lake class. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (7.0 pike/gillnet) was up from past surveys, but still within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Small northern pike dominated the sample, with an average length and weight of 21.1 inches and 2.0 lbs, and pike measured up to 31.1 inches.  Silver pike, a color phase of northern pike, are present in Belle Taine and occasionally caught by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nBelle Taine supports an abundant largemouth bass population as well as moderate numbers of smallmouth bass.  Spring electrofishing surveys sampled good numbers of largemouth bass (63 bass/hour) and smallmouth bass (14 bass/hour).  Largemouth up to 19.2 inches and smallmouth up to 18.9 inches were sampled.  A special tagging study of bass in conjunction with an angler creel survey was conducted in 2007.  Results of the tagging and angler creel survey will be used to better manage the smallmouth and largemouth bass populations in Belle Taine.  Belle Taine has good water quality, bottom substrate, and submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation that will insure a healthy largemouth and smallmouth bass population. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of black crappie are found in Belle Taine and angling for them is popular year around.  Black Crappie were sampled in moderate to abundant numbers for all gear types.  Anglers will find good numbers of crappie in the 9-10 inch size range.  Belle Taine also supports good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed, however, size of sunfish runs small.  Anglers will find lots of sunfish in the 6.0 size range.  Bluegill growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead, and moderate numbers of white sucker and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Belle Taine is located in south-central Hubbard County adjacent to the town of Nevis.  Belle Taine has a surface area of 1,497 acres and a maximum depth of 56 feet.  The main public access is located on the east end of the lake near the city of Nevis.  Access is also available by small craft from Shallow Lake, which lies to the north of Belle Taine.  Water levels in Bell Taine were very high in the late 1990's, but have receded the past several years.  Belle Taine is a very popular lake for fishing and water recreation.  Belle Taine provides angling opportunities for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Belle Taine is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Bad Axe, West Crooked, Ojibway, Eagle, Island, Big Mantrap, and Little Sand. <br> \n <br> \nBelle Taine supports an abundant largemouth bass population as well as moderate numbers of smallmouth bass.  Spring electrofishing survey sampled good numbers of largemouth bass (68 largemouth bass/hour) and smallmouth bass (8 smallmouth bass/hour), similar to past surveys. The proportion of larger bass sampled (> 15.0 inches) was below management goals. Belle Taine has good water quality, bottom substrate, and submerged and emergent vegetation that will insure a healthy largemouth bass and smallmouth bass population. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (9 walleye/gillnet) was up slightly from recent surveys and above the current management goal of 7 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance since 1991 has been similar, fluctuating near the management goal.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 14.8 inches and 1.25 pounds, with fish measured up to 24.8 inches.  Belle Taine is currently stocked with walleye during even numbered years.  The walleye forage base has been a concern in Belle Taine as the abundance of yellow perch is low.  Yellow perch abundance (1.5 perch/gillnet) is below the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to recent surveys. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (6.4 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Small northern pike dominated the sample, with an average length and weight of 20.0 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Northern pike up to 33.4 inches were sampled.  Silver pike, a color phase of northern pike, are present in Belle Taine and occasionally caught by anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nBelle Taine supports a good black crappie population and angling for them is popular year around.  Black crappie abundance was above the range \"typical\" for this lake class for all gear types.  Anglers will find good numbers of black crappie in the 9-12 inch size range.  Belle Taine also provides good fishing for bluegill and pumpkinseed, however, size of fish runs small.  Anglers will find lots of sunfish in the 6-7 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead and rock bass, and moderate numbers of white sucker. <br> \n</p>",

A city owned public access is located on the east shore of the lake. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Belle Taine Lake is in lake class 25. Class 25 lakes generally are deep, very clear, have hard water and are irregularly shaped. Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Bad Axe, West Crooked, Ninth Crow Wing, Ojibway, Island, Big Mantrap, Little Sand, Skunk, Spider, Straight and Two Inlets. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing to sample Largemouth Bass showed a lower catch rate than past samplings on Belle Taine, but had a higher average size.  Largemouth Bass ranged from 5 to 19 inches, with most fish 12-15 inches.  Smallmouth Bass were also sampled, and their numbers were higher than past samplings with a higher average size.  Smallmouth Bass ranged from 8-19.5 inches, with most fish 12-17 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2016 was consistent with previous years, and at the high end of lakes in lake class 25. Many Walleyes are 11-23 inches in length, with an average length of 16.5 inches and the largest sampled at 24 inches. Yellow Perch are important forage for Walleyes and Northern Pike, and their abundance was in line with class 25 lakes. Perch had an average size of 6.5 inches and were sampled up to 11 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in similar abundance compared to other lake class 25 lakes, and in line with past surveys. Pike ranged from 11.5 inches to 30.5 inches in length.  The average size of 21 inches and 2 pounds was similar to past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThere are angling opportunities for panfish including Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed. Black Crappie abundance were on the high end of lakes class 25 lakes, and fish ranged from 4-12 inches. Bluegill and Pumpkinseed abundance was similar to recent years on Belle Taine, but on the low end of lake class 25 lakes.  Most fish are small, with the majority of fish at 3-6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Belle Taine Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Belle Taine Lake was conducted on August 4th, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 18 sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 14 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass), and zero species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 23rd, 2021 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Fish that were average were, northern pike, walleye, rock bass, and black crappie.Yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, bluegill, and pumpkinseed net catches are high, net catches for all other species fall in the expected range for a lake of this type.  Common sucker and largemouth bass populations appear to have increased since 1957; yellow perch have apparently decreased in abundance.Management Recommendations:Continue stocking with winter rescue northern pike in view of the large population of bluegill and yellow perch.  Walleye fry stocking does not seem to show up in the net catch, outside of maybe one year (1968).  Fingerling stocking of walleye should be made in the future; large size would give better survival.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Belle Taine Lake is located in south-central Hubbard County adjacent to the town of Nevis.  Belle Taine has a surface area of 1,185 acres and a maximum depth of 56 feet.  The public access is located on the east end of the lake and is owned and maintained by the city of Nevis.  Access is also available by boat during \"normal\" water level years from Shallow  Lake which lies to the north of Belle Taine.  Water levels in Belle Taine have been very high since the late 1990's, 2 to 3 feet above existing high water marks.  Belle Taine is a very popular lake for fishing and water recreation.  Belle Taine provides good angling opportunities for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and black crappie. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Belle Taine is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Bad Axe, West Crooked, Ojibway, Eagle, Island, Big Mantrap, and Little Sand.Moderate numbers of walleye were sampled (5.5 walleye/gillnet).  This walleye catch rate is at the upper end of the \"normal\" range for this lake class and at the present management goal of 5.0 walleye/gillnet.  The two previous surveys in 1991 and 1996 had similar walleye abundance. Walleye abundance from earlier surveys has fluctuated from high numbers in the 1980's to low numbers in 1957 and 1973.  Walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 2.3 walleye/net in 1957 to 29.0/net in 1981.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 15.9 inches and 1.6 pounds, with fish measured up to 26.0 inches.  Walleye fingerlings stocking is contributing significantly to the population in Belle Taine as 80% of the sampled walleye corresponded to stocked years.  Only two non-stocked  year classes of walleye were sampled (1997 & 1999), however some adult walleye were stocked in 2000 so contribution from natural reproduction of walleye is difficult to assess.  Belle Taine is stocked with walleye fingerlings in even years.  The walleye forage base is a concern in Belle Taine as the abundance of yellow perch is very  low.  Yellow perch abundance (1.2 yellow perch/gillnet) is below the \"normal\" range for this lake class.  Perch numbers have been low since 1986, while yellow perch abundance from earlier surveys was within or above the \"normal\" range for this lake class.  Moderate numbers of northern pike were sampled (5.6 pike/gillnet), within the \"normal\" range for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance from past surveys has been slightly lower, generally at the low end of the \"normal\" range.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 2.0 pounds, with pike measured up to 31.6 inches.  Northern pike are slow growing in Belle Taine when compared to other area lakes.  Two silver pike, a color phase of northern pike, were sampled in the gillnets.Belle Taine supports an abundant largemouth bass population as well as moderate numbers of smallmouth bass.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time on Belle Taine and largemouth bass were sampled in very high numbers (115 largemouth bass/hour).  Sampled largemouth bass had an average length of only 9.9 inches, however, bass up to 20.5 inches were measured.  Smallmouth bass abundance was low (9 smallmouth bass/hour) when compared to largemouth bass abundance in spring electrofishing, however, numbers sampled from standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) were above or within the \"normal\" range for this lake class.  Belle Taine has good water quality, bottom substrate, and submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation that will insure a healthy largemouth and smallmouth bass population.Good numbers of black crappie are found in Belle Taine and angling for them is popular year around.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate to abundant numbers for all gear types. Most of the sampled crappie were in the 9 inch range, however, fish up to 12.2 inches were sampled.  Belle Taine also supports good numbers of bluegills, however, size of bluegill runs small.  Sampled bluegill had an average length of 5.0 inches with fish measured up to 7.6 inches.  Bluegill are slow growing in Belle Taine when compared to other class 25 lakes.Other species sampled include: abundant numbers of white sucker, moderate numbers of yellow bullhead and rock bass, and low numbers of pumpkinseed and black bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Belle Taine is located in south-central Hubbard County adjacent to the town of Nevis.  Belle Taine has a surface area of 1,497 acres and a maximum depth of 56 feet.  A city owned public access is located on the east shore of the lake.  Access is also available by small craft from Shallow Lake which lies to the north of Belle Taine.  Belle Taine is a very popular lake for fishing and water recreation.  Belle Taine provides angling opportunities for Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Panfish, Walleye, and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Belle Taine is in class 25.  Class 25 lakes are generally deep, very clear, have hard water, and are irregularly shaped.  Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids management include: Bad Axe, Big Mantrap, Dead (Upper Ojibway), Eagle, Island, Little Mantrap, Little Sand, Spider, Straight, Third Crow Wing, Two Inlets, and West Crooked.  <br> \n <br> \nBelle Taine supports an abundant Largemouth Bass population and moderate numbers of Smallmouth Bass.  Spring electrofishing sampling was not conducted in 2021 due to equipment issues, but past surveys have sampled good numbers and sizes of Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass.  Belle Taine has good water quality, bottom substrate, and submerged and emergent vegetation that will ensure healthy Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations. <br> \n <br> \nBelle Taine supports a good Black Crappie population and angling for them is popular year around.  Anglers will find good numbers of Black Crappie in the 9-12 inch size range.   Belle Taine also provides good fishing for Bluegill and Pumpkinseed; however, the size of fish runs small (6-7 inch size range). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was down from recent surveys, but still within the range for this lake class.   A strong year class of 8 to 11 inch Walleye were sampled and should provide good angling in future years. Walleye sampled had an average length of 16.4 inches with fish measuring up to 26.9 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was up and were sampled in the highest recorded number for all surveys on Belle Taine.  Northern Pike numbers in past surveys have generally fluctuated in moderate numbers for this lake class.  Anglers will find the Northern Pike population dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike.  Northern Pike sampled had an average length of 20.3 inches, weighed 1.8 pounds, and measuring up to 32.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Belle Taine.   To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

Smallmouth bass, bluegill and pumpkinseed catches were higher than state average.  Largemouth bass catch was about state average, while black crappie and northern pike catch was less than state average.Management Recommendations:The net catch indicates that walleye stocking from 1976-79 has produced strong year classes.  With the high perch population, the growth rate is above average.Management recommendations are to stock walleye fingerlings in alternate years.  The rate to stock should be 1/3 pound fingerlings per littoral acre.  The fingerlings should weigh 50 fish per pound or larger.  With the adequate spawning area, the other species of fish should be self-supporting.Yellow bullheads and black bullheads were high in the net catch, but are not a problem at this time.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Catches of walleye (6.25 fish/gillnet) were above the third quartile for Lake Class 25 of the Schupp Classification System, although they have decreased since 1981.  Mean weight of walleye (7.81 lbs/net) is within the normal range, dropping from being above the third quartile in 1981 and 1986.  The present PSD of 55 indicates a good size structure, however, there are few preferred length fish.  Growth rates are variable for walleye up to age 5.  This may be the result of stocking different sizes of fingerlings.  On average, the growth rate is good, with age 5 fish averaging 15.68 inches total length.  Some natural reproduction is occurring, as evidenced by the strong 1987 year class.Catch rates (numbers and pounds) of northern pike are generally within the normal ranges for both gill and trapnets.  The trend is for numbers to be near the first quartile and weights near the third quartile, resulting in a good mean weight (2.58 lbs).  Both numbers and sizes of northern pike had decreased to below normal in 1981, but since have recovered.  Growth rates are good (17.53 inches at age 3), but there is high variability within and among year classes.  The PSD (64) indicates a good size structure, however, similar to walleye, few fish are of preferred length.Pumpkinseed, bluegill and black crappie numbers and sizes are presently within normal ranges.  Pumpkinseed and bluegill abundances have fluctuated since 1957.  Both populations were low in 1986 and have since recovered, however, sizes remain small.  PSD's are 25 for pumpkinseed and 12 for bluegill.  Both species exhibit slow growth, averaging only 5.49 inches and 5.57 inches at age 5 for pumpkinseed and bluegill respectively.  Black crappie also grow slowly (8.35 inches at age 5), but their current size structure appears good (PSD=61).  Again, the abundance of preferred length fish is low.Yellow perch abundance has decreased greatly since 1957.  Sixty-two fish per gillnet were caught in 1957, compared to 1.25 fish/gillnet in 1991.  Presently, the numbers and sizes of yellow perch are below the normal range and the size structure is small (PSD=17).White sucker has increased since 1957.  The current figures of 7.38 fish/gillnet and 16.64 lbs/gillnet are well above the third quartile for lakes of this classification.  Although not efficiently sampled with gill and trapnets, smallmouth bass catches were also above the third quartile in numbers and pounds.  Growth is slow, however, with age 5 smallmouth bass averaging 12.60 inches.  Catches of bullhead, rock bass and largemouth bass were usually within normal ranges.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Belle Taine Lake is located in south-central Hubbard County, with the town of Nevis located on the east shore.  Belle Taine Lake has a surface area of 1,185 acres and a maximum depth of 56 feet.  The public access is located on the east end of the lake and is owned and maintained by the city of Nevis.  Access is also available from the river channel connecting Shallow Lake to the north.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has    classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Belle Taine Lake is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same class include Bad Axe (3 miles north of Emmaville), West Crooked (7 miles northwest of Nevis), Ninth Crow Wing (3.5 miles southwest of Akeley), Ojibway (5 miles north of Dorset), Eagle (9 miles north of Park Rapids), Island (10 miles north of Park Rapids), Big Mantrap (2 miles east of Emmaville), Little Sand (1.5 miles north of Dorset), Skunk (13 miles northeast of Park Rapids), Spider (2.5 miles north of Nevis), and Straight (Osage lies on the south shore).     The walleye gillnet catch of 6.9/net is above the range typical for lake class 25 (1.3 - 5.5).  The previous survey in 1991 had a similar walleye gillnet catch (6.3/net), while historical catches have varied from low to high numbers.  Walleye gillnet catches were low in 1957 (2.3/net) and 1973 (3.8/net), with high catches in 1981 (29.0/net) and 1986 (16.0/net).  Sampled walleye had an average length of 15.6 inches and 1.4 pounds, with fish measured up to 26.4 inches.  A strong 1994 year class of 12 to 14 inch walleye accounted for 50% of the catch.  Recruitment through natural reproduction is sporadic, with strongest year classes occurring during years of walleye fingerling stocking.  Belle Taine Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even calendar years.  Eight year classes of walleye were represented in the sample, with growth rates similar to other class 25 lakes.     The northern pike gillnet catch of 3.6/net is within the range typical for lake class 25, and similar to the two previous surveys in 1986 and 1991.  Northern pike were small is size, with an average length and weight of 21.0 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Some larger northern pike were sampled, with fish measured up to 29.3 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were below the average lengths of other class 25 lakes.     Both largemouth bass and smallmouth bass populations are found in Belle Taine.  Both species were sampled in numbers typical for lake class 25 and similar to historical nettings.  Largemouth bass up to 16.7 inches and smallmouth bass up to 18.0 inches were sampled.  Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective methods to assess largemouth or smallmouth bass abundance or size distribution.  To adequately assess a bass   population special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted on Belle Taine Lake.  Belle Taine lake has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that will insure a healthy largemouth and smallmouth bass population.     Belle Taine Lake has a good black crappie population, with the trapnet catch of 3.3/net just above the range typical for lake class 25.  Historical catches of black crappie have been similar for both gear types.  Black crappie up to 11.1 inches were measured with 11% of the sample 10.0 inches or larger.  Black crappie growth rates were below the average lengths of other class 25 lakes.       Bluegill were sampled in low numbers (3.9/trapnet), below the range typical for lake class 25 (5.6/trapnet - 42.3/trapnet), and below the range of previous surveys (9.3/trapnet - 43.6/trapnet).  Bluegill were small in size, with an average length of 5.4 inches and with fish measured up to 7.5 inches.     Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers (3.8/gillnet), below the range typical for lake class 25.  The two previous surveys in 1986 and 1991 had similar yellow perch gillnet catches, while historical catches were higher, ranging from 21.3/net (1981) to 62.1/net (1957).  Yellow perch were small in size, with an average length of 6.5 inches and with fish measured up to 8.9 inches.  Yellow perch are mainly a forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations, and are not of an acceptable size to support a fishery.     White sucker were sampled in high numbers (8.2/gillnet), above the range typical for lake class 25.  With the exception of 1957 (0.6/gillnet), historical white sucker catches have been high and similar to the 1996 catch.     Both yellow and black bullhead were sampled.  The yellow bullheadcatch of 3.8/gillnet is within the range typical for lake class 25, but below previous surveys.  One black bullhead was sampled (0.1/gillnet).  Excluding 1981 (43.7/gillnet), historical black bullhead catches have been low and similar to the 1996 catch.     Other fish sampled during the 1996 survey included pumpkinseed and rock bass.     Selected species and sizes of fish were sent to the section of Ecological Services in St. Paul as part of the fish contaminant monitoring project.  Results of this contaminant testing will be available in May of 1997 in a publication called \"Minnesota Fish Consumption Advisory\" published by the Minnesota Department of Health.     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but to release medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Belle Taine and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",
