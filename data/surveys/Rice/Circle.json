                "narrative": "<p>Circle Lake is an 838 acre lake located in Rice County northeast of Shieldsville. The lake has a maximum depth of 14 feet, so the entire lake is considered littoral. There are three islands on Circle Lake, one of which is designated as an Aquatic Management Area by the MN DNR. A DNR-maintained public access is located on the northwest end of the lake. A public fishing pier is located just east of the public access. The shoreline of Circle Lake is mostly undeveloped, with the exception of the east shoreline. Aquatic vegetation and woody debris, like fallen trees, near the shore are abundant in Circle Lake and provide valuable fish habitat. Circle Lake is classified in Lake Class 43 based on lake characteristics. Other lakes in this classification include Gorman Lake (Le Sueur County), Ida Lake (Blue Earth County), and Rice Lake (Rice County). Circle Lake is managed primarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch and secondarily for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. Circle Lake is stocked with Walleye fry every other year (even-numbered years) to maintain the population. In the event of a winterkill, managed fish species will be stocked at adult stages, except Walleye, which will be stocked as fry. <br> \n <br> \nCircle Lake is designated as infested due to the presence of Eurasian water-milfoil. First discovered in Circle Lake in 2011, Eurasian water-milfoil limits recreational activities by forming dense mats on the water surface and disrupts aquatic ecosystems by competing with and displacing native plants. Eurasian water-milfoil is spread primarily by the introduction of plant fragments, which can easily be transported by boaters. Always be sure to clean all aquatic plant material and drain all water from boats, trailers, and equipment before leaving the lake access. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted the week of June 12th, 2017 by the MN DNR as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). This survey included deploying four gill nets and twelve trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2017, Black Crappies were captured at a rate of 0.4/trap net, which is low for class 43 lakes, and at a rate of 1.5/gill net, which is also low for class 43 lakes. Past Black Crappie catch rates have been highly variable with trap net catch rates ranging from 0.0/trap net in 2001 to 90.0/trap net in 1988, and gill net catch rates ranging from 0.0/gill net in 2001 to 150.4/gill net in 1983. Black Crappies ranged in length from 3.4 to 11.4 inches and averaged 8.5 inches. Management goals were partially met in 2017 as the catch rates did not exceed 30.0/trap net, but more than 15% of Black Crappie sampled were equal to, or greater than, 10 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the past two decades Bluegill have occurred at relatively low numbers, as catch rates rarely exceeded 10.0/trap net (2007). In 2017, the Bluegill catch rate was 10.2/trap net, which was lower than the 2012 survey (21.0/trap net). Bluegill ages were estimated using scales and otoliths. Five year classes were sampled (2011-2013, 2015, and 2016). Bluegill size structure was small, with lengths ranging from 3.0 to 9.4 inches and averaging 5.6 inches. Management goals were not met as Bluegill catch rates did not exceeded the goal of 20.0/trap net and target size structure indices were not met. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers increased from 3.7/gill net in 2012 to 4.5/gill net in 2017. The 2017 catch rate was above the mean for lake class 43 and was the second highest since 1988 (2007, 6.0/gill net). Northern Pike averaged 23.1 inches in length and ranged from 17.6 to 32.5 inches total length. Forty-four percent of Northern Pike sampled were greater than 24 inches total length. Management goals were met as Northern Pike were captured at a rate greater than 3.0/gill net, and exceeded the desired size threshold (25% greater than 24.0 inches). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch decreased from 11.7/gill net in 2012 to 5.3/gill net in 2017 which was slightly below the average for class 43 lakes. The average length of was 15.6 inches and ranged from 10.8 to 17.8 inches. The majority of Walleye sampled were between 15.0 and 17.0 inches long. Only two year classes of Walleye were present and corresponded to two fry stocking events in 2014 and 2016 with ninety-five percent from the 2014 stocking.  Management goals were partially met as Walleye catch rates was greater than 4/gill net, however no Walleye greater than 18 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were captured at a rate of 33.3/gill net, which is high for class 43 lakes, but was much less than the 140.7/gill net in 2012. Yellow Perch ranged from 5.4 to 11.4 inches total length with an average of 8.9 inches. Yellow Perch, especially small Yellow Perch, are an important food for predator fish such as Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. Six year classes were sampled (2010, 2102-2016) indicating good natural reproduction. Management goals were met as catch rates greatly exceeded the goal of 15/gill net and more than 10% of Yellow Perch were greater than 10 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp catch in all gears has decreased since its peak in 2007. In gill nets, catch rates decreased from 47.7/gill net in 2007 to 2.5/gill net in 2017, which is low for class 43 lakes. In trap nets, catch rates decreased from 51.8/trap net in 2007 to 1.3/trap net in 2017, which is also low for class 43 lakes. Common Carp size structure varied greatly, average length was 17.0 inches and lengths ranged 7.4 to 26.7 inches. Concern was expressed that panfish numbers were not high enough in Circle Lake to suppress the carp population. The 2017 population assessment showed that Bluegill and Yellow Perch numbers were greater than the mean for class 43 lakes, suggesting populations that are more abundant than would be expected for Circle Lake. Furthermore, Common Carp abundance dropped significantly from the 2007 survey suggesting that the population is being suppressed. Also, the lake association has partnered with the private entities and commercial fishermen to remove carp from the lake. Both the panfish numbers and Common Carp numbers should be good news for anglers and property owners. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads have historically been extremely abundant in Circle Lake; however, in 2017 Black Bullhead abundance was low. Black Bullheads were sampled at a rate of 28.8/gill net and 4.8/trap net. Both the gill net and trap net catch rates were low for class 43 lakes. Black Bullheads up to 15.4 inches long were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in the nets but occurring in low numbers include Bigmouth Buffalo, Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, Smallmouth Buffalo, White Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, hybrid Sunfish, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Circle Lake (624.0 acres) is located in Rice County near the Town of Lonsdale. Residential development has disturbed and altered much of the shoreline on the south and east side of the lake. Remaining natural shoreline is limited to the northwest bay, the island, and the west side of the lake. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the shores edge with much of the lakeshore being stabilized with rock rip rap or sand blankets, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer. A DNR-owned boat ramp is located in the northwest corner of the lake providing access for the public. The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, yellow perch, walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass. Walleye fry have been stocked in 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010, and the current management plan calls for them to be stocked at a rate of 1000 fry per littoral acre in even numbered years. Yellow perch, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and northern pike populations are maintained through natural reproduction. A population assessment was conducted on 6-18-2012 to monitor the sport fish community in Circle Lake using 3 gill nets and 8 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements were collected 6-18-2012. Circle Lake was beginning to experience an algae bloom as the water appeared light green in color, and had a secchi depth reading of 2.5 ft. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 9.4 ppm at the surface to 2.8 ppm at 10.0 ft deep and did not appear to be thermally stratified.  <br> \n <br> \nPrimary management species in Circle Lake include bluegill, black crappies, and yellow perch. During the past two decades, bluegill occurred at relatively low abundance as catch rates have not exceeded 10.0/trap net (2007). In 2012, the bluegill catch rate increased to 21.0/trap net, which is high when compared to similar lakes. Five bluegill year classes were sampled (2007-2011) with age-1 bluegills representing 52% of bluegills collected. Bluegill size structure was small, with lengths ranging from 2.9 to 9.7 inches and averaging 4.9 inches. Circle Lake bluegill exhibit fast growth, as bluegill averaged 3.6 inches at age-1, 4.5 inches at age-2, 6.2 inches at age-3, 7.0 inches at age-4, and 9.7 inches at age-5.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2012, black crappies were captured at rate of 13.3/trap net, which is slightly higher than similar lakes, and at a rate of 42.0/gill net, which is extremely high when compared to similar lakes. Past black crappie catch rates have been highly variable with trap net catch rates ranging from 0.0/trap net in 2001 to 90.0/trap net in 1988, and gill net catch rates ranging from 0.0/gill net in 2001 to 150.4/gill net in 1983. Black crappie size structure was small, as 70% of the fish captured were age-1. Black crappies ranged in length from 3.5 to 9.8 inches and averaged 5.4 inches. Black crappies exhibited relatively slow growth, averaging 4.4 inches at age-1, 5.3 inches at age-2, 7.4 inches at age-3, 8.0 inches at age-4, and 9.0 inches at age-5.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were captured at a rate of 140.7/gill net, which is the highest observed catch rate on Circle Lake and up from 6.7/gill net in 2007. Yellow perch were 5.1 to 11.2 inches in length and averaged 7.2 inches. Five year classes were sampled (2007-2011), with age-3 and age-4 yellow perch representing nearly 70% of the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates decreased from 21.7/gill net in 2007 to 11.7/gill net in 2012, but still was above average when compared to similar lakes. Three year classes of walleye were present and corresponded to 3 stocking events in 2007, 2008, and 2010. Walleye size structure was good, with lengths ranging from 11.4 to 21.1 inches and averaging 17.0 inches. Forty-eight percent of gill netted walleye were greater than 18.0 inches in length. Walleye grow fast in Circle Lake as they averaged 14.8 inches at age-2.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch rate decreased from 6.0/gill net in 2007 to 3.7/gill net in 2012, but still was greater than any catch rate observed since 1983. The 2012 catch rate of 3.7/gill net is about average when compared to similar lakes. Four year classes were sampled which included 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. Northern pike averaged 23.4 inches in length, with the largest measuring 29.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nGill net and trap net common carp catch rates decreased drastically since 2007. In gill nets, catch rates decreased from 47.7/gill net in 2007 to 1.0/gill net in 2012, which is low when compared to similar lakes. In trap nets, catch rates decreased from 51.8/trap net in 2007 to 6.8/trap net in 2012. Common carp were large, ranging from 17.1 to 30.9 inches in length and averaging 23.8 inches. Furthermore, common carp abundance dropped significantly from the 2007 survey suggesting that the population is being suppressed.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads have historically been extremely abundant in Circle Lake; however, in 2012 black bullhead abundance was low. Approximately 52.0 black bullheads were captured per gill net and 24.7 per trap net, which are low compared to similar lakes. Black bullhead lengths ranged from 4.3 to 12.0 inches and averaged 9.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe bigmouth buffalo catch rate (2.6/trap net) was the highest observed on Circle Lake, which is high compared to similar lakes. The majority of bigmouth buffalo were small, measuring 13.0 to 15.0 inches. Other species captured in the nets but occurring in low numbers include freshwater drum, white bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, bowfin, creek chub, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, and largemouth bass.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

THE PRESENT BLACK CRAPPIES HAVE A DOMINANT AGE 2 GROUP PRESENT COMPARED TO THE AGES 3 AND 4 THAT DOMINATED THE 1986 NETTING. WHITE CRAPPIES HAVE INCREASED FROM A LOW OF 0.50/ GILL NET IN 1986 TO 5.50/GILL NET IN 1988. WHITE CRAPPIES ARE NOW DOMINATED BY AGE 2 FISH COMPARED TO THE AGES 2-4 SAMPLED IN 1986. BLUEGILLS REMAIN LOW IN ABUNDANCE, AVERAGING 2.67/ TRAP NET COMPARED TO ONLY 6 FISH SAMPLED IN 1986 NETTING. BLUEGILLS WERE FAIRLY ABUNDANT IN 1983, AVERAGING 19.50/TRAP NET. THE WALLEYE CATCH RATES REMAIN, LOW AVERAGING 0.75/GILL NET IN 1986 AND NOW AVERAGING 1.00/GILL NET IN 1988. THE LARGER WALLEYES SAMPLED CORRES- POND TO THE 1979 FRY STOCKING THAT DOMINATED THE 1986 AND 1983 NETTINGS. OTHER AGES SAMPLED INCLUDE 1, 3, AND 4 YEAR OLDS MAY REPRESENT REPRODUCTION OR POSSIBLE MIGRATION FROM THE CANNON RIVER. THE NORTHERN PIKE CATCH RATE HAS IMPROVED FROM ONLY TWO FISH SAMPLED IN 1986 TO 1.62/GILL NET IN 1988. NORTHERNS SAMPLED WERE REPRESENTED BY FIVE AGE GROUPS WITH 2 YEAR OLDS DOMINATING THE CATCH. A HIGH POPULATION OF WHITE BASS IS PRESENT. CATCH RATES INCREASED FROM 11.50/GILL NET IN 1986 TO 25.87/GILL NET IN 1988. WHITE BASS WERE REPRE- SENTED BY AGES 2-5 WITH 3 YEAR OLDS DOMINATING; THE 1986 NETTING SHOWED A MORE EVEN DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN AGES 1-4. YELLOW PERCH CATCH RATES DECLINED FROM 18.50/GILL NET IN 1986 TO 10.75/GILL NET IN 1988. YELLOW PERCH WERE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1-3 WITH A DOMINANT AGE 2 GROUP PRESENT. THE PERCH POPULATION SAMPLED IN 1986 WERE REPRESENTED BY 1-6 YEAR OLDS WITH 1, 3, AND 4 YEAR OLDS DOMINATING THE CATCH. BLACK BULLHEAD AND YELLOW BULLHEAD WERE SAMPLED IN NUMBERS BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS. FRESHWATER DRUM, WHITE SUCKER, BOWFIN, AND CARP WERE SAMPLED IN NUMBERS GREATER THAT STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS. BOWFIN WERE SAMPLED FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND BIG- MOUTH BUFFALO WERE SAMPLED IN 1986 BUT NOT IN 1988 NETTING.</p>",

Gamefish abundance has shown some change but fishing has declined greatly in recent years.  With the expansion of bullheads, the decline in gamefish, primarily panfish might not be accurately reflected in netting.  Black crappie abundance has increased from 1993 and bluegill abundance appears to be unchanged.  Yellow perch have experienced the largest decline in abundance and size.  The large increase of black bullhead was not predicted and will pose a significant fish management challenge for the future. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Circle lake was surveyed in late June of 2007 to assess the status of the fish community.  The lake continues to provide a variety of good fishing opportunities.  Walleye remain abundant following fry stocking after the 2003-04 winterkill event.  Gill net catches were high at 21.6/net and the mean size was 13 inches, although fish up to 18 inches were common.  Northern pike were also common in the gill net at 6/net.  Mean size was relatively small, however, at 19.7 inches.  Yellow perch were sampled in modest numbers but the size distribution was good and included individuals up to 10.9 inches.  Bluegill were the dominant panfish in the trap net and occurred at relatively low density (10/trapnet).  Size was excellent however with many individuals exceeding 8 inches.  Black crappie were sampled in low densities but size was good with fish up to 11.5 inches occurring.  Common carp were extremely abundant in both the gill net and trap net catches and may have a negative effect on fish community structure in the future. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of the fish community in Circle Lake was done in mid-June 2001.  The fish community in Circle Lake was comprised primarily of black bullhead with an average of over 250 bullhead captured in both trap nets and gill nets.  Common carp were also abundant with an average catch of over eight per trap net.  Few fish of other species were captured.Low oxygen levels in the winter of 2000 - 2001 probably were a factor in contributing to the high abundance of bullhead and the lack of panfish and game fish.  However, the increase in bullhead started sometime prior to 1999.  A fishery survey conducted in 1999 collected significantly more bullhead than the previous survey in 1993.  In spring 2001 about 3,000 bluegill, 700 black crappie, 16 largemouth bass, 3,200 yellow perch, and 630,000 walleye fry were stocked into Circle Lake in an attempt to reestablish a more desirable fish community.  Seining in August 2001 showed that bluegill, largemouth bass, and some yellow perch juveniles were present, probably a result of reproduction by the adults stocked in the spring.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Circle Lake is located in Rice County northwest of Faribault.  An access is located on the shallow western bay.  A fishery population assessment was conducted on Circle Lake in July 2004.  Circle Lake had low oxygen conditions in early 2001 and again in early 2004 despite the installation of an aeration system in 2003.  Black bullhead were the most abundant species in both the gill net and trap net samples.  Most black bullhead were around 6 inches long.  Northern pike were caught in moderate numbers.  The presence of an abundant northern pike population in Fox Lake, plus the relatively high tolerance of northern pike to low oxygen conditions may contribute to the maintenance of pike in Circle Lake.  Only one walleye was caught despite the stocking of fry, fingerling, yearling, and adult walleye in 2003 and fry in 2002.  A moderate number of bluegill were captured in the trap nets, many of which were around 4 inches long, indicating possibly some reproduction in Circle Lake.  Bluegill and black crappie were common in Circle lake in the 1980's through the 1993 survey.  Their abundance did not decline until the 2001 sample, when no black crappie and only five bluegill were caught.  Low oxygen levels in the winter of 2000 - 2001 probably were a factor in contributing to the high abundance of bullhead and the lack of panfish and game fish.  However, the increase in bullhead probably started after winterkill in 1997.  A fishery survey conducted in 1999 collected significantly more bullhead than the previous survey in 1993.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Circle Lake is an 838-acre lake located in Rice County northeast of Shieldsville. The lake has a maximum depth of 14 feet. There are three islands on Circle Lake, one of which is designated as an Aquatic Management Area by the MN DNR. A DNR-maintained public access is located on the northwest end of the lake. A public fishing pier is located just east of the public access. The shoreline of Circle Lake is developed on about half of the lake, primarily on the east shoreline. Aquatic vegetation and woody debris, like fallen trees, near the shore are abundant in Circle Lake and provide valuable fish habitat. Circle Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch. Circle lake experienced a significant winterkill during the winter of 2022/2023. In the event of a winterkill, managed fish species will be stocked at adult stages.  Circle Lake has been designated as a Tier-II lake in the Waterville area and future surveys will be conducted every six years. <br> \n <br> \nCircle Lake is designated as an infested water due to the presence of Eurasian water-milfoil. First discovered in Circle Lake in 2011, Eurasian water-milfoil limits recreational activities by forming dense mats on the water surface and disrupts aquatic ecosystems by competing with and displacing native plants. Eurasian water-milfoil is spread primarily by the introduction of plant fragments, which can easily be transported by boaters. Always be sure to clean all aquatic plant material and drain all water from boats, trailers, and equipment before leaving the lake access. <br> \n <br> \nCircle Lake was surveyed the week of 12 June 2023 by the MN DNR as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program. This survey included deploying four gill nets and eleven trap nets. <br> \n  <br> \nDuring the past two decades Bluegill have occurred at relatively low abundance as catch rates rarely exceeded 10.0/trap net. In 2023, due to the winterkill, approximately 750 adult pre-spawn Bluegill were stocked into Circle Lake to rebuild the population. In 2023, the Bluegill relative abundance was 3.9/trap net, which was half of the historical average for Circle Lake, and equal to the median for class 43 lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2023, 300 Black crappies were stocked in Circle Lake after the winterkill. Black Crappies were not sampled in trap nets and were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 2.0/net. Past Black Crappie catch rates have been highly variable with trap net catch rates ranging from 0.0/trap net in 2001 to 57.2/trap net in 1988, and gill net catch rates ranging from 0.0/gill net in 2001 to 51.9/gill net in 1988. Black Crappies sampled in 2023 ranged in length from 4.1 to 8.6 inches and averaged 6.4 inches. <br> \nYellow Perch were captured at a rate of 13.0/gill net. Yellow Perch ranged from 4.7 to 7.1 inches total length with an average of 6.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry were stocked into Circle Lake following the winterkill in 2023 at a rate of 250/Littoral acre, for a total of approximately 209,500 fry.  Walleye were not sampled in 2023 using gill nets or trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are tolerant of lower oxygen levels than some other species and persisted through the winterkill in 2023. The relative abundance of Northern Pike was 1.3/gill net. The historic average for Circle Lake is 2.8/gill net. Northern Pike averaged 22.3 inches in length and ranged from 12.2 to 28.7 inches total length. Twenty percent of Northern Pike sampled were greater than the southern zone minimum harvest size of 24 inches total length. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp relative abundance in all gears has decreased since its peak in 2007. In gill nets, the catch rate was 0.3/gill net and in trap nets, the catch rate was 0.5/trap net in 2023. Common Carp size structure varied greatly, average length was 17.0 inches and lengths ranged 2.3 to 24.1 inches. Concern has been expressed by lake shore property owners that panfish numbers were not high enough in Circle Lake to suppress the carp population prior to the winterkill. The lake association has partnered with private entities and commercial fishermen to remove carp from the lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads have historically been extremely abundant in Circle Lake; this was no different in 2023 post winterkill. Black Bullheads were sampled at a rate of 373.5/gill net and 43.6/trap net. Black Bullheads ranged in total length from 3.5 to 13.8 inches and averaged 7.8 inches total length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in the nets, but occurring in low numbers include Bigmouth Buffalo, Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), Golden Shiner, hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",
