A floating pedestrian bridge bisects the lake between two basins.  The east basin reaches a depth of 7.5 feet, while the western basin is 11 feet. The largemouth bass population is good, with a large size (5-18inches) and age distribution (1-10 yrs). Bluegill were the most abundant species, although most were under 7 inches long. Pumpkinseed, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish were sampled in moderate numbers with sizes of 4.0 to 6.5 inches. The black crappie and northern pike catch were low. Black crappie ranged from 5-8 inches while the three northern pike measured 19-25 inches.  Black bullhead averaged 9 inches and were not abundant.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackhawk Lake is located in the City of Eagan, Dakota County. Approximately half of the shoreline is in Blackhawk Lake Park which is managed by the City of Eagan Parks and Recreation Department. The City of Eagan maintains a carry-in boat access, a fishing pier, fishing platform, and shore fishing areas. A floating pedestrian bridge bisects the lake into an east basin and west basin. The maximum depth is 11.5 feet and is found in the western basin. A winter aeration system was installed in 1995 and is operated to prevent winterkill of the gamefish population. <br> \nBluegills were the most abundant fish sampled in the survey with over 500 being caught. Their average size was subpar though, with only two fish measuring over seven inches in length. This condition can produce good fishing action but typically results in very few larger fish to harvest. Largemouth Bass numbers and average size have declined from 2010. The largest fish was 8.70 inches long and the catch rate declined by 95%. The City of Eagan encourages anglers to practice catch-and-release for Largemouth Bass in Blackhawk Lake. Other species sampled included Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed Sunfish, both in low to moderate numbers with the majority of fish less than six inches in average length. Northern Pike were found in good abundance and a wide range of sizes, from 16 to 31 inches. Black Bullheads were sampled in moderate numbers and ranged in size from 6 inches to over 13 inches  <br> \n</p>",

Approximately half of the shoreline is in Blackhawk Lake Park which is managed by the City of Eagan Parks and Recreation Department. The City of Eagan maintains a carry-in boat access as well as a fishing pier, fishing platform and shore fishing areas. A floating pedestrian bridge bisects the lake into an east basin and west basin. The maximum depth is 11.5 feet and is found in the western basin. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most abundant fish sampled in the survey with over 500 being caught. Their average size was subpar though, with only three fish measuring over seven inches in length. This condition can produce good fishing action but typically results in very few fish to harvest. Largemouth bass numbers and average size has decreased from 2003 with the largest fish being 15.8 inches long and the catch rate in the survey gear declining by 34%. The City of Eagan encourages anglers to practice catch-and-release for largemouth bass in Blackhawk Lake. Other species sampled included hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseeds, both in low to moderate numbers and under six inches in average length. Northern pike were found in low abundance and a wide range of sizes, from 13 inches up to 34 inches. Black bullheads were sampled in low numbers but nearly all fish were over 10 inches in length. <br> \n</p>",
