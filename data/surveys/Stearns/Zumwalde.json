                "narrative": "<p>The Sauk River Chain of Lakes (SRCL) is located in south central Minnesota, near the city of Richmond. A dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring allows users to access over 3,200 acres by water. The Sauk River drains a large portion of central Minnesota before flowing through the chain of lakes. Combined with drainage from the Long Lake sub watershed to the south, the total watershed of the chain is nearly 600,000 acres. Although non-point source pollution (agricultural runoff) continues to be a concern, some major contributors of nutrient loading (such as municipal wastewater discharge) were greatly reduced in the 1980's and 1990's. Efforts continue to be made to address existing non-point pollution sources, but most of the lakes in the chain remain classified as hypereutrophic. <br> \n <br> \nThe Sauk River Chain was re surveyed in 2018, netting results from lakes east of County Road 71-(Zumwalde, Great Northern, Krays, Knaus, Schneider, and Bolfing (East Lakes)) were combined for this report to provide a larger sample size.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were assessed during the spring by day time electrofishing. Portions of Zumwalde, Great Northern, Krays, Schneider, and Bolfing were sampled. Catch rates were up from previous surveys but were approximately half the rate typically observed in other lakes within the Sauk Rapids management area. A late spring along with rapid warmup likely affected seasonal patterns as most bass sampled came from deeper water making it much harder to effectively sample bass with traditional electrofishing gear. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 7 to 19 inches with an average length of 12 inches. Of the catchable size Largemouth Bass (greater than 8 inches), 43% were greater than 12 inches and 20% were greater than 15 inches. Smallmouth Bass comprised 25% of the bass sampled by electrofishing and ranged in length from 7 to 20 inches with an average length of 14 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Northern Pike in 2018 was within the range of expected values for lakes similar to the Sauk River Chain, and showed a slight increase in abundance from the 2013 survey. Since 1980, catch rates of Northern Pike in the East Lakes have been relatively stable. Northern Pike ranged in length from 12 to 35 inches with an average length and weight of 23 inches and 2.6 pounds. Twenty-four percent of Northern Pike sampled were longer than 26 inches and 10% were longer than 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCedar Island and Horseshoe Lakes are stocked every two years with Walleye fry by the DNR. Migration among the lakes has been verified by fall electrofishing in 2011, 2015, and 2017 when fingerings were sampled throughout the eastern portion of the chain where none were stocked. In addition, fall electrofishing was conducted in 2018 to check for natural reproduction and young of the year Walleye were sampled at a rate higher than the average rate observed during years when fry had been stocked. The Walleye catch in 2018 was above average compared to other lakes like those in the Sauk River Chain, and higher than the 2013 survey. Walleye ranged in length from 9 to 27 inches and averaged 17 inches and 1.7 pounds. Walleye growth was fast reaching 17.4 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2018 was similar to 2013 and below the expected range for similar lakes. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5 to 9 inches and averaged 7 inches. Prior to the 2003 survey, catch rates of Yellow Perch were significantly higher on these lakes. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were introduced into the chain in 1976 and have become well established. In the 1985 and 1990 surveys, Channel Catfish were sampled at relatively low numbers in the East Lakes, but the population appeared to expand in the early 1990s. Schneider Lake has been the exception, as the catch rate here has remained low. The Channel Catfish population appears to have leveled off and catch rates have actually declined slightly for the first time since being introduced. Channel Catfish ranged in length from 10 to 30 inches with an average length and weight of 19 inches and 2 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch in 2018 decreased from 2013 in the East Lakes, but was still within the range of expected values for the lake class. Black Crappie ranged in length from 5 to 13 inches with an average length of 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch in 2018 was similar to 2013 and remained within the range of expected values for the lake class. Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 10 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches. Fifty-nine percent of the Bluegill sampled were longer than 6 inches and 17% were longer than 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nSince 2011, Horseshoe and Cedar Island lakes have been each stocked with 515 Muskellunge fingerlings every other year.  Standard summer surveys are not well suited to evaluate Muskellunge populations, they are better evaluated using spring surveys when adult Muskellunge concentrate in the shallows to spawn. Spring surveys have not been conducted to assess the Muskellunge population yet because the population is still developing, however anglers have reported catching fish in excess of 40 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2018 survey included: Bigmouth Buffalo, Black and Brown bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead and Silver redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Sauk River Chain of Lakes is located in south central Minnesota, near the city of Richmond.  A dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring allows users to access over 3,200 acres by water.  The Sauk River drains a large portion of central Minnesota before flowing through the chain of lakes.  Combined with drainage from the Long Lake sub-watershed to the south, the total watershed of the chain is nearly 600,000 acres.  Although non-point source pollution (agricultural run-off) continues to be a concern, some major contributors of nutrient loading (such as municipal wastewater discharge) were greatly reduced in the 1980's and 1990's.  Efforts continue to be made to address existing nonpoint pollution sources, but most of the lakes in the chain remain classified as hypereutrophic (nutrient-rich). <br> \n <br> \nMost of the Sauk River Chain was re-surveyed in 2013, with the exception of Horseshoe and Cedar Island which were surveyed prior to the introduction of Muskellunge in 2011.  Netting results from the river portion of the chain (lakes downstream of Cedar Island Lake - Zumwalde, Great Northern, Krays, Knaus, Schneider, and Bolfing) were similar and were combined for this summary.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were assessed in the spring by day-time electrofishing.  Portions of Zumwalde, Great Northern, Krays, Knaus, Schneider, and Bolfing were sampled.  Catch rates were down from previous surveys and were less than half the rate typically observed in other lakes in the Montrose management area.  Cooler than average spring water temperatures likely affected seasonal patterns as most bass sampled came from deeper water making it much harder to effectively sample bass with traditional electrofishing gear.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.1 to 19.5 inches with a mean length of 13.3 inches.  Of the catchable size Largemouth Bass, 83% were greater than 12 inches and 49% were greater than 15 inches. Smallmouth Bass also comprised 13% of the bass sampled by electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Northern Pike in 2013 was within the range of expected values for lakes similar to the Sauk River Chain, and similar to the 2003 survey.  Since 1980, catch rates of Northern Pike in these lakes have been relatively stable.   Northern Pike ranged in length from 17.8 to 35.6 inches with an average length and weight of 23.1 inches and 2.2 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nFrom 2000 to 2007, the Walleye population was supported through fry stocking by the Sauk River Chain of Lake's Association.  Nearby Cedar Island and Horseshoe Lakes are also biennially stocked with fry by the DNR, and migration among the lakes was verified by fall electrofishing in 2011 when fingerings were sampled throughout the eastern portion of the chain where none were stocked.  Fry stocking in 2009 on Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes was very successful and the catch throughout the Sauk River Chain was dominated by this year class.  The Walleye catch rate in 2013 was within the range expected for the Sauk River Chain, and similar to the 2003 survey.  Walleye ranged in length from 13.1 to 25.6 inches and averaged 17.6 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleye growth was average when compared to statewide data and grew to a length of 16.3 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates increased slightly from 2003 to 2013 survey but remained below the expected range for similar lakes.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.4 to 9.3 inches and averaged 6.8 inches and 0.16 pounds.  Prior to the 2003 survey, catch rates of Yellow Perch were significantly higher on these lakes. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were introduced into the chain in 1976 and have become well established.  In the 1985 and 1990 surveys, Channel Catfish were sampled at relatively low rates in the river portion of the chain, but the population appeared to expand in the early 1990s.  Schneider Lake has been an exception to this trend, as the catch rate has remained low.  Schneider Lake has clearer water, more submerged vegetation, is less river-like, and is probably less favorable for Channel Catfish.  Channel Catfish ranged in length from 10.9 to 25.8 inches with a mean length and weight of 17.6 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Growth rates of Channel Catfish were relatively slow as fish grew to an average length of 17.7 inches in eight years. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch was unchanged from 2003 in the eastern portion of the chain of lakes and generally exceeded the expected range for these types of lakes.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 2.3 to 13.0 inches with an average length and weight of 8.4 inches and 0.36 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch in 2013 was very similar to 2003, and remained at the low end of the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Bluegill ranged in length from 2.8 to 9.4 inches with an average length and weight of 5.6 inches and 0.24 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOne Muskellunge, a two year old 24.6 inch female, was sampled in Knaus Lake during the 2013 survey.  This fish was stocked in the fall of 2011 as a fingerling and was likely between 11 and 13 inches at the time of stocking.  This suggests that Muskellunge have the potential for excellent growth in the Horseshoe Chain of Lakes.  All muskie fingerlings stocked in the Horseshoe Chain in the fall of 2013 were implanted with an electronic tag under the dorsal fin which will allow the DNR to track the individual growth of fish in the future and is part of a research project to assess the success of the muskie introduction to the Horseshoe Chain of Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2013 survey included: hybrid and Pumpkinseed sunfish, Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Yellow, Brown, and Black bullhead, Golden, Greater, Shorthead, and Silver redhorse, White Sucker, and Common Carp. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Sauk River Chain of Lakes (SRCL) is located in south central Stearns County, near the city of Richmond. A dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring allows users to access over 3,200 acres by water. The Sauk River drains a large portion of central Minnesota before flowing through the chain of lakes. Combined with drainage from the Long Lake sub watershed to the south, the total watershed of the chain is nearly 600,000 acres. Although non-point source pollution (agricultural runoff) continues to be a concern, some major contributors of nutrient loading (such as municipal wastewater discharge) were greatly reduced in the 1980's and 1990's. Efforts continue to be made to address existing non-point pollution sources, but most of the lakes in the chain remain classified as eutrophic. <br> \n <br> \nThe Sauk River Chain was re-surveyed will gill nets in 2021, netting results from lakes east of County Road 71 (Zumwalde, Great Northern, Krays, Knaus, Schneider, and Bolfing (East Lakes)) were combined for this report to provide a larger sample size.   <br> \n <br> \nFrom 2000 to 20017, Cedar Island and Horseshoe Lakes were stocked every other year with Walleye fry by the DNR. Beginning in 2015, the DNR started annual fall electrofishing to document the consistency and extent of natural reproduction in the SRCL. After evidence of very strong naturally reproduced year classes in 2014 and 2016, the DNR decided to suspend all Walleye stocking in 2018 to determine if natural reproduction could sustain the Walleye population. Since that time, annual fall electrofishing catch rates of young-of the-year (YOY) in the East lakes have consistently been at or above rates observed during stocked years. The Walleye catch in the East Lakes in 2021 was similar to 2018 but the overall catch rate across all lakes in the SRCL was at an all-time high. Furthermore, 89% of the catch was from non-stocked years. Walleye ranged in length from 10 to 23 inches and averaged 16 inches and 1.4 pounds. Walleye growth was fast reaching 17 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Northern Pike in 2021 was similar to 2018 and within the range of expected values for lakes similar to the Sauk River Chain. Since 1980, catch rates of Northern Pike in the East Lakes have been relatively stable. Northern Pike ranged in length from 16 to 31 inches with an average length and weight of 22 inches and 2.2 pounds. Nine percent of Northern Pike sampled were longer than 26 inches and two percent were longer than 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2021 was similar to 2018 but below the expected range for similar lakes. Yellow Perch ranged in length from five to nine inches and averaged seven inches. Prior to the 2003 survey, catch rates of Yellow Perch were significantly higher on these lakes. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were introduced into the chain in 1976 and have become well established. In the 1985 and 1990 surveys, Channel Catfish were sampled at relatively low numbers in the East Lakes, but the population expanded in the early 1990s, reaching an all-time high of 26.5/ gill net in 2013. The Channel Catfish population appears to have declined as catch rates have decreased for the second consecutive survey, and averaged 14.3/ net in 2021. Channel Catfish ranged in length from 10 to 27 inches with an average length and weight of 20 inches and 3 pounds. Reproduction has been consistent as 17 age classes were sampled however the majority (82%) of the catch were age-10 or older. Catfish growth was slow reaching 17.8 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch in 2021 was similar to 2018 in the East Lakes and still within the range of expected values for the lake class. Black Crappie ranged in length from five to 12 inches with an average length of nine inches. Eight year classes of crappie were sampled but the majority (82%) were age-3 and younger. Growth of crappie was fast, reaching an average length of 9.7 inches in three years. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets are not normally used to assess relative abundance of Bluegill, but a total of 50 Bluegill were sampled from the East Lakes ranging in length from four to nine inches with an average length of 7.4 inches. Six years classes were represented in the age sample with 84% being age-4 or younger. Bluegill growth was fast, reaching seven inches in three years. <br> \n <br> \nSince 2011, Horseshoe and Cedar Island lakes have each been stocked with 515 Muskellunge fingerlings every other year. Standard summer surveys are not well suited to evaluate Muskellunge populations, they are better evaluated using spring surveys when adult Muskellunge concentrate in the shallows to spawn;. Spring surveys have not been conducted to assess the Muskellunge population yet because the population is still developing. However anglers have reported catching fish in excess of 40 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing is the best gear for sampling bass, but was not conducted in this survey. However, low numbers Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass were caught in the gill nets. Other species sampled in low numbers included: Black and Brown bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Zumwalde Lake is a 106 acre lake located one and half miles southwest of the City of Cold Spring. The maximum depth of the lake is 23 feet and during mid-August adequate oxygen is present down to 23 feet. No public access is located on Zumwalde Lake, however, access is available from a navigable channel from Cedar Island Lake. Zumwalde Lake is a part of the Horseshoe Chain of Lakes and therefore receives a moderate amount of fishing pressure. Black crappie, bluegill, walleye, northern pike, channel catfish and largemouth bass are all present in the lake. In the summer of 1995, a population assessment was conducted on Zumwalde Lake. The netting of the lake revealed the following information about the fish population. The northern pike catch rate in gill nets (1.0/gill net) did not significantly change from the 1990 survey (2.0/gill net), and remained below expected levels for lakes that are similar to Zumwalde. The average size northern caught in gill nets was quite nice, averaging 3.2 pounds and 25.9 inches. Three and six year old fish were sampled in gill nets and the growth rate of northern pike was average when compared with other populations in the state. The catch rate of walleye in gill nets (7.5/gill net) significantly increased from the 1990 survey and was above expected levels for this lake type. The average size walleye caught during our survey weighed 2.0 pounds and was 16.9 inches in length. Two to seven year old fish made the catch and the growth rate of walleye in Zumwalde Lake was average when compared with other populations in the state. The gill net catch rate of yellow perch in Zumwalde Lake (6.5/gill net) did not significantly change from the last survey (15.5/gill net) and remained within expected levels for this lake type. The average size yellow perch caught in gill nets was 7.1 inches in length and 0.2 pounds in weight. While this average size may seem small, yellow perch are very important in a lake as they are a major source of food for larger predators like the northern pike and walleye. The gill net catch rate of black bullheads in Zumwalde Lake (5.5/gill net) appeared to have fallen from the 1990 survey (96.0/gill net). On the other hand, the catch in gill nets of channel catfish increased from 1.0/gill net in 1990 to 19.0/gill net in 1995. This trend of the declining gill net catch of black bullhead in association with an increase in catch of channel catfish has happened throughout the entire Horseshoe Chain. This correlation has only occurred over one fish population assessment and further netting is needed to assess the level of this effect. The catch rate of black crappie in trap nets (47.0/lift) was high for this lake type. Black crappies sampled ranged in length from 5.0-10.0 inches and averaged 7.6 inches in length. The catch rate of black crappies was high throughout the rest of the attached Horseshoe Chain of Lakes, so the outlook for crappies in Zumwalde Lake appears to be good. The trap net catch of bluegills in Zumwalde Lake (11.5/trap net) appeared to decline from the previous netting in 1990 (33.2/lift). Variation in catch rates of panfish are highly dependent on the weather, therefore a change in catch rate like this may not always mean a significant change in the fish population. Bluegill caught in trap nets ranged in size from 3.5-8.8 inches and averaged 6.5 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Sauk River Chain of Lakes is located in south central Minnesota, near the city of Richmond.  Because of the construction of a dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring, boaters can access nearly 3,000 acres by water.  The Sauk River drains a large portion of central Minnesota before flowing through the chain of lakes.  Combined with drainage from the Long Lake sub-watershed to the south, the total watershed of the chain is nearly 600,000 acres.  Although non-point sources (agricultural run-off) continue to be a concern, some major contributors or nutrients (such as municipal wastewater discharge) were greatly reduced in the 1980's and 1990's.  Efforts are being made to address existing sources, but water quality in most of the lakes remains in the hypereutrophic range (very nutrient-rich).The entire Sauk River Chain was re-surveyed in 2003.  Netting results from the river portion of the lake chain (lakes downstream of Cedar Island Lake - Zumwalde, Great Northern, Krays, Knaus, Schneider, and Bolfing) were similar, and were combined for this summary.  The lakes are managed primarily for northern pike and largemouth bass, although walleye, black crappie, bluegill, and channel catfish are also popular with anglers.  The catch rate of northern pike in 2003 was within the range expected for lakes similar to the Sauk River Chain, and similar to the 1995 survey.  Since 1980, catch rates of northern pike in these lakes have been relatively stable.  Mean weight of fish sampled in 2003 (3.1 pounds) was similar to 1995.The walleye population is currently supported by stocking of fry by the lake association.  Nearby Cedar Island and Horseshoe Lakes are also stocked with fry by the DNR, and some migration among lakes is likely.  Fry stocking in 2001 on Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes appeared very successful (based on fall electrofishing), and the catch throughout the Sauk River Chain was dominated by this year class.  Catch rates of walleye in the river portion of the chain were similar to those reported in Horseshoe and Cedar Island.  As with these other Sauk River lakes, catch rates were down from 1995.  Mean weight of walleye sampled in 2003 was 1.8 pounds.Yellow perch catch rates declined sharply from the 1995 survey to the 2003 survey, in all of the lakes in the Sauk River Chain.  Mean weight (0.14 pounds) was similar to 1995.  Prior to the 2003 survey, catch rates of yellow perch were significantly higher on these lakes.Largemouth bass were assessed by electrofishing.  Portions of Bolfing, Knaus, Krays and Great Northern were sampled.  Catch rates were similar to other lakes in this part of the state.  The average length of bass was 12 inches, and the largest was 18 inches.  A few smallmouth bass were sampled during summer in these lakes, but not by electrofishing.Channel catfish were introduced into the chain in the 1980's, and have become well established.  In the 1985 and 1990 surveys, catfish were sampled at relatively low rates in the river portion of the chain.  The population appeared to expand in the early 1990's.  Schneider Lake has been an exception to this trend, as the catch rate has remained low.  Schneider Lake has clearer water, more submerged plant growth, less river-like, and is probably less favorable for channel catfish.  Mean weight of catfish sampled in the river portion of the chain was 1.8 pounds, lower than Horseshoe (2.7 pounds) or Cedar Island (2.1 pounds).  Most of the small catfish (less than 12 inches) sampled in 2003 were found in these smaller, more riverine lakes.Catch rates of black crappie were lower than in 1995 in all of the Sauk River chain of lakes, although still favorable.  Mean weight increased to 0.41 pounds.  Both catch rate and average size was higher in these lakes than in Horseshoe or Cedar Island.  As with channel catfish, catch rates of crappie have generally been lower in Schneider than the other lakes.  Catch rates of bluegill in 2003 were similar to 1995, while mean weight increased (from 0.21 to 0.34 pounds), and is now very favorable.Other species sampled during the 2003 survey included bullhead, redhorse, white sucker, carp, and several minnow species.</p>",
