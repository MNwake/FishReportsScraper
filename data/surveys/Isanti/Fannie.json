                "narrative": "<p>  Since the initial survey, Fannie lake has been surveyed every two to eight years.  During August of 1991, the lake was surveyed with five gillnets, three trapnets, and four shoreline areas were seined.  The gamefish populations in Fannie Lake are described in the following paragraphs.  Fannie Lake is managed as a centrarchid-largemouth bass lake.  The lake conditions provide good spawning habitat for largemouth bass and panfish, but only poor to fair spawning habitat for northern pike and walleye.  Management of Fannie Lake includes stocking walleye fingerling once every two years.  \n  Only one largemouth bass was caught for a catch rate of 0.33/set which was between the lake class median (0.25/set) and the third quartile (0.63/ set).  The largemouth bass net catch has remained relatively constant in Fannie lake.  The largemouth bass was approximately 13.0 inches and weighed 1.20 pounds.  Back-calculated lengths from previous surveys indicated normal growth rates when compared to statewide averages.  The largemouth bass captured during 1991 was five years old.  One largemouth bass young of the year (yoy) was seined during 1991.  \n  The northern pike net catch (2.20/set) was between the first quartile (1.75/set) and the median (3.43/set) for the lake class.  Historically, the net catch has varied only small amounts (1.80 to 2.67/set).  The northern pike size is normal for the lake class, and has remained relatively unchanged from survey to survey.  Northern pike ranged in length from 19.0 to 29.9 inches with a median length group of 24.0 to 24.9 inches.  The back-calculated lengths indicated a normal growth rate, and the average weight (2.80 pounds) was near the lake class median (2.44 pounds).  The northern pike ranged in age from two through five years old.  Northern pike yoy were not seined, however northern pike have not been stocked since 1979.  \n  The bluegill net catch (84.00/set) is extremely high for this lake class (third quartile = 37.19/set) and is the highest recorded catch rate in Fannie Lake.  The bluegill ranged in length from 3.5 to 7.9 inches, with a median length group of 6.0 to 6.4 inches, and the average weight (0.16 pounds) was near the lake class median (0.19 pounds).  Back-calculated lengths indicated a slow growth rate for bluegill in Fannie Lake.  The size and growth rate was similar to those sampled during the 1986 survey.  But, the bluegill sampled during 1981 (two years after a partial winterkill) had a larger median length group (7.0 to 7.4 inches) and average weight (0.28 pounds), and faster growth rate.  The bluegill captured during 1991 ranged in age from one to eight years old, and 32 yoy bluegill were seined.  \n  The black crappie net catch (10.33/set) was between the lake class median (5.86/set) and the third quartile (15.00/ set).  The black crappie ranged in length from 4.0 to 9.4 inches, with a median length group of 6.0 to 6.4 inches.  Back-calculated lengths indicated a slow growth rate and the average weight (0.20 pounds) was below the first quartile (0.51 pounds).  The fish size and growth has not changed significantly from the two most recent surveys.  The black crappie ranged in age from one to seven years old.  Black crappie yoy were not captured during 1991.  But have been seined in past surveys.  \n  The yellow perch net catch (2.60/set) was low (first quartile = 4.91/set) for this lake class, but remained similar to the 1987 net catch. The yellow perch ranged in length from 5.0 to 6.9 inches, with a median length group of 6.0 to 6.4 inches. The average weight (0.08 pounds) was below the first quartile (0.10 pounds), but has remained relatively consistent from survey to survey.  Ages ranged from one to five years old, with seven of the thirteen fish from the 1987 year class.  Many (88) yellow perch yoy were seined during 1987, but none were captured during the 1991 survey.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Based on respective local medians the present fish population is as follows:  The walleye (3.20/set) shows a real increase from the 1981 survey (1.00/set) to a level close to the local median (3.52/set).  Past attempts at establishing a walleye population by fry stocking have proven unsuccessful.  The current population is the product of a 1984 fingerling stocking that resulted in good survival and growth (median length group 16.0 - 16.9 inches).  A small drop in the northern pike net catch (1.80/set) from the 1981 survey (2.20/set) is not large enough to indicate a real decline in the population and is relatively consistent with historical levels that have been below the local median (3.88/set).  A modest amount of natural reproduction apparently sustains the northern pike population.  The 11 northern pike taken in test nets ranged in size from 15 to 29 inches.  Yellow perch (3.40/set) show a real increase from 1981 (0.40/set) but remain far below the local median (24.27/set).  Yellow perch have historically been taken in low numbers in the test nets while being well represented in shoreline seining, as is exhibited in the current survey, 88 young-of-year and 31 others recorded in shoreline seining.  Net catches of largemouth bass are somewhat higher in gillnets and trapnets than both the previous survey and the local medians, suggesting a possible increase in abundance.  Interpretations of largemouth bass net catches, however, are complicated by the unpredictable susceptibility of this species to test nets.  Shoreline seining recorded 62 young-of-year largemouth bass.  The net catch for bluegills (52.00/set) is substantially higher than the previous survey (30.50/set) and far above the local median (25.67/set).  The median length group for bluegills is 6.5-6.9 inches.  Black crappies (4.50/set) have declined significantly from 1981 (22.75/set) in the trapnets but increased in the gillnets, from 16.40/set to 29.20/set.  The reversal in net catches corresponds to a change in length frequencies, from a median group of 8.0 - 8.4 inches in 1981 to 4.5 - 4.9 inches at present.  Black bullheads remain far below the local median in the trapnets but above the local median in the gillnets as they have in the past.  Yellow bullheads remain above the local medians.  Both black and yellow bullheads should be of interest to commercial fishermen with their apparent abundance and overall size, median length group 10.0 - 10.4 inches and 9.5 - 9.9 inches respectively.  Other species taken in test nets (bowfin, carp, golden shiner, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, and pumpkinseed) do not appear to be substantially above or below local medians nor to have undergone any noteworthy changes from the previous survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fannie Lake is a 366 acre basin located in central Isanti County. With 84% littoral area and high fertility Fannie is subject to occasional winterkills. Historically the water clarity has been low but it appears to be gradually improving. Prior to the 1990's secchi disk readings fluctuated near the 2-foot mark. Since then secchi readings have ranged from 4 to 6 feet.  The lake has approximately 12.5 houses per mile of shore.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake can be viewed as three distinct basins. The southwest basin has a maximum depth of 4.5 feet, mucky substrates, and an abundance of aquatic vegetation. The northeast and northwest basins both have predominately sand substrates, a moderate to low abundance of aquatic vegetation, and deeper water. Fannie is a bass-panfish lake managed primarily for walleye. Fishing pressure is moderate but increasing. Historically, Fannie Lake has sustained a normal abundance of quality sized walleye and northern pike with a high population of small panfish.   <br> \n <br> \nDue to the Minnesota government shut down, the sampling scheduled for 2011 was limited to night electrofishing for largemouth bass.  Largemouth bass were more abundant than in 2006. Night electrofishing sampled 38.3 bass per hour, a moderate catch rate. Bass quality, based on both mean weight and length-frequency indices, was very similar to the 2006 level.  Largemouth averaged 13.2 inches and 1.7 pounds with RSD-12 and RSD-15 values of 76 and 33 respectively. Fannie Lake has some potential as a trophy bass fishery with some individuals in excess of 21 inches. Reports from bass anglers continue to be favorable. Bass growth, however, remains slow. Based on scale interpretation, Fannie Lake largemouth bass required six years to attain 12 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnesota DNR Fisheries IBI program staff conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on Fannie Lake on Sep 09 2020, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 47 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 78.4 (+/- 3.4), indicating overall lakeshore habitat quality was moderate (66-84). Approximately 48 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 60.9 (+/- 4.0), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 95.2 (+/- 2.1). The Score the Shore survey was designed to provide a means to quantify and compare lakeshore habitat between lakes. The Fannie Lake shoreline habitat score of 78.4 is higher than the statewide lake score average of 73.6.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fannie lake was surveyed to evluate lake management goals and objectives.  A moderate winterkill occured in 1997.  Largemouth bass, walleye, and  bluegill were absent in the spring testing and therefore stocked in May and June of 1997.  Survey netting data will also be used to assess the effectiveness of reestablishing these populations.Long range management goals include establishing a moderate walleye fishery and maintaining the northern pike population. The gillnet catch rate goal for both species is 2.5 per set or better with mean weights of 2 and 2.5 pounds respectively.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into lake classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Fannie is assigned to lake class 35.  Gillnet catch rates for black bullhead, black crappie, walleye, and northern pike were in the normal range when compared to other lakes in Fannie's class.  Black bullhead had the highest gillnet catch rate at 26.5 per net, a 58 percent reduction from the last netting in 1996.  All bullheads were between 5.3 and 7.8 inches.The black crappie catch also decreased since 1996.  Sampled crappie were small with a 4.1 to 6.6 inch range and a 5.8 inch average.  Eighty four percent of the crappie catch were 3 years old and likely represented the first successful reproduction following the 1997 winterkill.  Northern pike abundance increased from 6.6 per gillnet in 1996 to 7.5 while maintaining a respectable 2 pound average.  The pike catch was well above the management goal in numbers and close to the target weight.  Lengths ranged from 17.6 to 27.4 and averaged 21.2 inches.  The majority (83%) of northerns were from the 1997 and 1998 year classes.  These post-winterkill year classes averaged 19.5 inches and should be available to anglers for several more years.  The yellow perch catch was low in numbers and small in size when compared to other lakes in the lake class.  Perch were the only major species below the normal catch range.  All the sampled perch were 2 and 3 year olds spawned after the 1997 winterkill which explains their lack of size and numbers.Walleye are currently stocked as fingerlings in alternate years.  In response to the 1997 winterkill, walleye fry were also stocked in the May of 1997.  The walleye population appears to have returned to its pre-winter kill level, nearly matching the 1996 catch in both size and numbers.  Sampled walleyes averaged 18 inches and 2 pounds.  The lake management goal for weight was met but the catch rate fell below the target levels.  The walleye population in Fannie recovered far better than that in Skogman lake which experienced the same sequence of winterkill and stocking.   Three year classes of walleye were sampled, all were stocking years.Largemouth bass also appear to have returned to pre-winterkill levels after 42 adult bass were stocked in June of 1997.  Night electrofishing on May 31, 2001 sampled 31.4 bass per hour, more than twice the 1996 level.  Bass were a little smaller than in 1996 with 10.7 inch and 0.8 pound averages.  The 1997 year class, the first spawn following the winterkill, accounted for 45% of the catch.  These 4 year olds averaged 10.9 inches and should soon be increasing the bass reproduction in Fannie Lake.One hundred adult bluegill were stocked in May of 1997.  Bluegill abundance was only half the 1996 level based on the trapnet catch.  However, both the catch rate and size were in the normal range when compared to other lakes in Fannie's class.  Bluegill averaged 5.8 inches and 0.16 pounds.  The catch was comprised of predominately post-winterkill 2, 3, and 4 year olds.    Other species present during the survey included bowfin (dogfish), common carp, green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead.The 2001 survey results indicate that the fishery recovered well from the 1997 winterkill that walleye and northern populations are approaching management goals.  Despite the winterkill growth of all species was similar to the statewide norm.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fannie Lake is a 366-acre lake managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, and panfish.  Although the lake has a maximum depth of 33 feet, a major winter-kill occurred in 1997.  Following the winter-kill, walleye fry and adult largemouth bass and bluegill were stocked to reestablish gamefish populations.  Walleye fingerlings are currently stocked biennially. <br> \n <br> \nA population assessment was conducted in June of 2006 to evaluate lake management goals and objectives.  Long-range management goals include establishing a moderate walleye fishery and maintaining the northern pike population. The gillnet catch rate goal for both species is 2.5 per set or better with mean weights of 2 and 2.5 pounds respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into lake classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Fannie is assigned to lake class 35.  In June of 2006, catch rates were high for black bullhead and low for yellow bullhead, white sucker, and pumpkinseed.  Black crappie, bluegill, walleye, and northern pike were in the normal range when compared to other lakes in Fannie's class.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead had the highest gillnet catch rate at 76.2, a substantial increase since the last netting in 2001.  Black bullheads were small, averaging 7.2 inches with none exceeding ten.  <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie gill net catch rate was similar to 2001.  Sampled crappie remained marginal sized with less than 10% of the total catch exceeding 8 inches.  They averaged 6.9 inches and 0.2 pounds.  The majority of crappies were between 7 and 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance decreased from 7.5 per gillnet in 2001 to 5.5 but pike size improved with a 2.9-pound average.  The pike catch surpassed the management goal in abundance and size.  Lengths ranged from 17.3 to 30.4 and averaged 23.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch (8/gill net) rose above the 25th percentile.  Although their abundance increased, perch remained small with the bulk of the catch (90%) in the 5-inch interval, essentially forage size. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are currently stocked as fingerlings in alternate years.  The Walleye catch rate increased to 2 per gill net, within the normal range but below the management plan target.  Walleyes averaged 20.5 inches and 2.9 pounds, surpassing the goal for size.  Four-year classes were present with sizes  <br> \ndistributed between 18 and 23 inches.  Growth was similar to the state wide average. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were slightly less abundant than in 2001.  Night electrofishing sampled 28.5 bass per hour, a low to moderate catch rate.  Bass were quality size with 31% of the sample over 15 inches.  Largemouth averaged 14 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Fannie Lake has some potential for trophy bass with fish approaching 20 inches present.  Reports from bass anglers have been favorable.  Bass ranged in age from 4 to 10 years and grew slower than normal.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance increased to 38.3 per trap net but remains below the high levels of the 1990's.  Both the catch rate and size were in the normal range when compared to other lakes in Fannie's class.  Bluegill averaged 5.6 inches and 0.14 pounds.  Few sampled bluegills were greater than 7 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species present during the survey included bowfin (dogfish), common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow and brown bullheads. <br> \n</p>",

The walleye was very low at 1.00 per set.  The yellow perch as has been its general history in Fannie Lake was extremely low at 0.40 per set.  The bluegill at 30.50 and the black crappie at 22.75 per set had slightly high populations as did the largemouth bass.  The black and brown bullheads had low trapnet figures but showed up high in the gillnet catch.  The yellow bullhead was high at 14.00 per set.  The bowfin had slightly low and the carp slightly high figures. The golden shiner was high at 8.40 per set.\nNOTE: Although the yellow perch has had extremely low catch figures in all surveys, it has shown up fairly well in associated shoreline seining results.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fannie Lake is a 366 acre lake managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, and panfish.  The lake, having a median depth of 4.6 feet, is characterized by three distinct bays or arms.  The maximum depth is 33 feet.  Although the lake does not usually experience winterkill, there were two years (1979 and 1992) when some dead fish were observed following ice-out.  Spring netting assessments after each of these events confirmed good survival of all species normally present.  No severe winterkill has ever been recorded.  Various stocking has occurred through the years with present management plans calling for walleye fingerlings stocked on an alternate year basis.During June 25-28, 1996, a population assessment was conducted to evaluate the present fish population in Fannie Lake (Lake Class 35).  Gear types consisted of: five standard gillnets and eight standard trapnets, night electrofishing for largemouth bass on May 31, 1996, and standard seining natural reproduction checks on September 11, 1996.Walleye were sampled at normal abundance levels for this type of lake.  Although very limited natural reproduction probably occurs, their presence is mainly due to stocking. The lengths ranged from 11.5 to 21.7 inches with an average of 17.3 inches.  The average weight was 2.0 pounds.  Northern pike were also sampled at normal abundance levels but it happened to be the highest recorded catch in seven survey years since 1951.  Their lengths ranged from 12.7 to 29.2 inches with an average of 21.1 inches.  The average weight was 2.3 pounds.  Ages 1-6 were represented by all fish caught with age 3-4 fish (76% of total catch) showing signs of good reproduction in 1992 and 1993.  Two northerns that were sampled by seining in September were from this year's hatch and they averaged 7.64 inches.Bluegill were sampled at higher abundance levels than what is normal for type of lake.  In fact, the bluegill have always been recorded in high numbers dating back to all surveys.  This year's catch sampled fish from 2.8 to 8.5 inches, while the average was 6.0 inches.  Seining sampled good natural reproduction for this year.Black crappie were taken at normal levels in both the trapnets and the gillnets.  Crappie catches have varied through the survey years but most catches generally showed high abundance. The 1996 catch sampled crappie ranging from 4.3 to 10.3 inches with the average being 6.2 inches.  Night electrofishing is a technique used to sample largemouth bass.  This method momentarily stuns the fish so they can be collected for measurements.  The sample of bass ranged in length from 7.3 to 16.8 inches, averaging 12.8 inches.  This was the first time Fannie Lake was electrofished by the DNR, but these long-term studies will continue on a 5-year rotation.Yellow perch were present at normal abundance, however, this was the highest recorded catch since 1951.  These fish ranged from 4.7 to 7.9 inches and averaged 6.0 inches.  It was good to see their numbers at least at normal levels while their predators, the northern pike and walleye, were holding a normal population.The most notable catch record from this survey was from black bullhead.  They were sampled at high levels and the catch was also a historical high for Fannie Lake.  They ranged from 6.0 to 12.8 inches with an average of 9.1 inches.  A possible explanation of their high abundance might be related to the 1992 partial winterkill.  Judging from the strong length group of 8.5 - 9.5 inch bullheads, it was conceivable that a dominant year-class was produced in 1992.  Even though DNR records confirmed survival of many species that spring, the overall game fish population was down a little bit.  That could explain for the bullhead hatching success.  In the fall of 1996, a commercial fisherman had removed 5,000 pounds of bullheads from Fannie Lake.Thirteen other species were represented in the netting gear: bowfin, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, blackchin shiner, emerald shiner, fathead minnow, johnny darter, and tadpole madtom.  The bowfin and pumpkinseed were sampled at high levels while the golden shiner and white sucker were found at low abundance.  All other species were sampled at normal abundance levels for this lake type.Prepared by: Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fannie Lake is a 366-acre lake managed primarily for Walleye, Northern Pike, and panfish.    A population assessment was conducted in June of 2013 to evaluate lake management goals and objectives.  Long-range management goals include establishing a moderate Walleye fishery and maintaining the Northern Pike population. The gillnet catch rate goal is 2.5 per set or better for both species with mean weights of 2 and 2.5 pounds respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into lake classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Fannie is assigned to lake class 35.  Compared to other lakes in the class, catch rates were high for Northern Pike and Bluegill and low for Walleye.  Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Black Bullhead were in the normal range.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate was similar to the previous three assessments.  Sampled Crappie remained marginal sized with none in the sample exceeding 9 inches and an average near 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate was the highest recorded on Fannie Lake.  At 13.5 per gillnet with a 3.5-pound average, the Pike catch surpassed the management goal in abundance and size.  Lengths ranged from 16.2 to 36.5 and averaged 24.5 inches.  The 2007 and 2008 year classes represented more than a third of the Pike sample.  Growth was fairly normal compared to the statewide rate. <br> \n <br> \nDespite record levels of Northern Pike the Yellow Perch catch (6.7/gill net) remained above the 25th percentile.  Size is still an issue from an angler's perspective with few perch exceeding 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are currently stocked as fingerlings every fall.  The Walleye catch rate decreased to 0.8 per gill net, falling below both the lake class normal range and management plan target.  However, Walleyes again surpassed the goal for size averaging 20.4 inches and 3 pounds.  Two year classes were present, 2006 and 2008.  Both corresponded to fingerling stockings.  Growth was similar to the state wide average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fannie Lake is a 366-acre lake located in Isanti County that has been assigned to lake class 34.  The lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill.  To assess the current population, a population assessment was conducted from June 27 to 30, 2022 with standard lake survey gillnets and trap nets.  Electrofishing was done on June 1 to sample the Largemouth Bass population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gillnet catch in 2022 was 15 fish, resulting in a catch rate of 2.5 per lift.  This is the highest catch rate recorded for Walleye on this lake dating back to the 1996 survey. However, this is still a low number of Walleye and because Walleye numbers have been consistently low, Walleye fingerling stocking was discontinued after 2013.  The management plan does call for Walleye fry to be stocked when surplus is available.  Walleye fry were stocked in 2017, 2019, 2021, and 2022. The Walleye caught in the 2022 survey were large, with an average length of 23.7 inches, and ranged in size from 20.9 to 28.0 inches. This was also the largest average size of Walleye dating back to 1996 and the ages ranged from 10 to 14. All year classes corresponded to years when Walleye were stocked (either fry or fingerling), except age 13. As in past surveys, the Walleye population appears to be made up of mostly larger, older individuals at a low density. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gillnet catch was 5.0 per lift as compared to 13.5 per lift in 2013, so the population appears to be at a more normal level at the present time and meets the management goal of 5.0 per lift. When comparing the catch to the combined average 1996, 2001, and 2006 (6.5 per net) which seem to represent more typical catch rates it is still slightly low. Northern Pike sampled in gillnets ranged from 22.1 to 35.2 inches with an average length of 27.0 inches in 2022. The average gillnet catch length has been steadily increasing since 1996. Northern Pike ranged in age from 3 to 9 years old.  Overall, the Northern Pike population seems to be maintaining itself near the management goal and the fish have been steadily increasing in average size over the past five surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, primarily forage for both Northern Pike and Walleye, have historically fluctuated in abundance, but have never had a large presence in Fannie Lake. In 2022 the gillnet catch was 110 fish with a catch rate of 18.3 fish per net. This was the highest gillnet catch by number and rate dating back to the 1996 survey. Most of the fish in 2022 were between 6.0 and 6.5 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches ranging in size from 5.6 to 7.8 inches.  The increasing number of perch should provide a good forage base for the Northern Pike and remaining Walleye in the lake but are likely too small to be targeted by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie gillnet catch in 2022 was 31, the highest in the five surveys from 1996 to 2022. Black Crappie caught in gillnets ranged in size from 5.2 to 9.3 inches, with a mean length of 6.8 inches. The average size caught in the gillnets was equal to that of 2013 and tied for the largest in the last five surveys. The 2022 Black Crappie trap net catch was 11. Black Crappie trap net catch ranged in size from 6.6 to 8.9 inches, with a mean length of 7.7 inches. The average size caught in the trap nets was less than in 2013 but was the second largest in the last five surveys. With the gillnet catch at the all-time high and the trap net catch about average, it looks like the numbers of Black Crappie has remained consistent, although the fish are of a relatively small average size.   <br> \n <br> \nThe total Bluegill trap net catch was 297 for a catch rate of 37.0 per net.  The 2022 catch was slightly below average as the average catch rate for surveys from 1996 to 2013 is 47.5 per net and the total catch average is 374 for those surveys. Bluegill sampled in trap nets in 2022 ranged in size from 3.0 to 7.9 inches with an average length of 5.9 inches.  Most of the Bluegill were from 6.5 to 7.5 inches in length.  In addition to the fish caught in trap nets in 2022, 258 Bluegill were captured in the gillnets. The average size of these fish was 6.6 inches with a length range of 4.1 to 7.9 inches.  Based on the number of Bluegill caught in both the gillnets and trapnets it appears that the Bluegill population is doing quite well with regard to numbers, but the size structure is relatively small. This has been a consistent theme with Fannie Lake, as the average length for fish caught in both trap nets and gillnets has been around 6 inches and has not exceeded 6.6 inches in any survey from 1996 to 2022. Additionally, the maximum length of fish caught appears to be going down. In 1996 and 2001 there were fish exceeding 8.0 inches captured. No Bluegill exceeding 8 inches have been sampled since that time.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch rate of 70.3 per hour and total catch of 40 in 2022 was much higher than previous surveys in 1996, 2001, and 2006.  Average length in 2022 was 11.8 inches with a length range of 4.7 to 19.5 inches.  With the highest recorded catch both in number and rate, the Largemouth Bass population looks to be higher than it has ever been.  The average size in 2022 is slightly down, but the maximum length in 2022 was the largest of the last four surveys.  Overall, the number of Largemouth Bass appears to be increasing in the lake, but the average size is slightly declining. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the fishing on Fannie Lake for many species should be quite good.  There are good numbers of Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike based on sampling with gillnets, trap nets, and electrofishing. The Walleye population appears to be the highest it has ever been, although the number of fish is still low, but they are of a nice average size. Northern Pike are increasing in size and 68% of the fish sampled were 26 inches and larger. Bluegill are abundant but on average run relatively small. The Largemouth Bass population appears to be very high currently, although the fish are on average smaller than in previous assessments. <br> \n</p>",
