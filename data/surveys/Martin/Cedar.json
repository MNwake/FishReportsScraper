                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a 710 acre lake that is managed primarily for northern pike and secondarily for yellow perch, white crappie, and black crappie.  Much of the northern pike population is a result of natural reproduction.  High fertility and shallow water contributes to the frequency of partial winterkill (?1 out of 3 years).  Two aire-O2 aerators were first installed during the winter of 1998-99 on an emergency basis.  The aerators are currently placed in the north end of the lake in approximately 4 to 5 feet of water.      The average northern pike catch rate was 7.0 fish/net.  The catch rate for northern pike was near the upper average range (8.00 fish/gill net) for this lake class.  Northern pike total lengths ranged from 19.21 to 25.79 inches with a mean of 21.51 inches.  Wet springs are usually conducive to northern pike natural reproduction.  The year of 1996-97 had considerable winter precipitation which likely translated to a wet spring.  The 1997 year class dominated the catch of northern pike (75%).  A decent northern pike population is present for some great \"tip-up\" action.     The average walleye gill net catch rate was 5.33 fish/gill net.  The catch rate for walleyes was close to the average range (6.83 fish/gill net) for this lake class.  Total lengths of walleyes captured in gill nets ranged from 6.85 to 27.13 inches with a mean of 18.54 inches.  The average weight of walleyes captured was 2.72 lbs./fish which is greater than the upper average range (2.30 lbs./fish) for this lake class.  The mean walleye trap net catch rate was 3.00 fish/ trap net.  The catch rate for walleye in trap nets was greater than the upper average range (2.95 fish/trap net) for this lake class.  Walleyes have never been stocked in Cedar Lake which indicates immigration from Cedar Creek via Elm Creek via the Blue Earth River and/or natural reproduction from illegal stocking.  Good fishing action for walleyes can be had when the panfish slow down at dusk.     The average yellow perch gill net catch rate was 2.00 fish/gill net.  The catch rate for yellow perch was below the lower average range (2.00 fish/gill net) for this lake class.  Many yellow perch relative abundances tend to cycle approximately every 3rd year in the pothole prairie region.     The average channel catfish gill net catch rate was 5.00 fish/gill net.  Total lengths of channel catfish captured with gill nets ranged from 13.74 to 24.84 inches with an average of 17.37 inches.  Channel catfish were found to be Age 6 (406 mm), Age 7 (549 mm), Age 10 (558 mm), and Age 11 (503 mm).  A portion of the channel catfish population may have experienced winterkill during the winter of 2000-2001.         The average black crappie trap net catch rate was 23.00 fish/trap net.  Trap net catch rates have never been as high as in the 2000 survey.  Total lengths of black crappie captured in trap nets ranged from 6.10 to 13.35 inches with a mean of 9.17 inches.  This population size structure was dominated by larger individuals from the 1998 (23%) and 1997 (64%) year classes.  The crappie action on Cedar Lake could provide some good action and fillets.      The average white crappie trap net catch rate was 20.58 fish/trap net.  The white crappie catch rate was greater than the upper average range (5.96 fish/trap net) for this lake class.  Total lengths of white crappie captured in trap nets ranged from 6.57 to 14.49 inches with a mean of 9.09 inches.  All of this indicates a white crappie population that was dominated by larger individuals.  Most of the fish were from the 1998 (31%), 1997 (40%), and the 1996 (24%) year classes.  Five seine hauls found 18 Age 0 white crappie which further documents natural reproduction.  The last two consecutive surveys (1995 and 2000) have found crappie populations that were dominated by larger individuals.  This white crappie population along with the black crappie population could produce some real \"slabs\".     The average black bullhead gill net catch rate was 34.67 fish/gill net.  Size structure indicies collected from both gill nets and trap nets indicated a healthy population.  The average common carp trap net catch rate was 13.67 fish/trap net.  These common carp can provide some great bow-fishing opportunities, especially in the south basin.       The average freshwater drum trap net catch rate was 6.08 fish/trap net.  The catch rate of freshwater drum was nearly double the upper average range (3.25  fish/trap net) for this lake class.  The freshwater drum size structure was dominated by smaller individuals with only a few of the larger sized individuals remaining.       To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Cedar Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is located in Martin County two miles northwest of the city of Trimont, has surface area of 710 acres, and a maximum depth of 7 feet. Cedar Lake is primarily managed for northern pike and secondarily for yellow perch, white crappie, black crappie, and walleye. Much of the fish population that exists in Cedar Lake is a result of natural reproduction, because northern pike, yellow perch, white crappie, and black crappie have not been stocked since 1990. The operational plan calls for stocking winter-rescue northern pike at 0.5 lbs. and/or 10 fingerlings per littoral acre only if gill net catches drop to less than 1.0 per set and if drought conditions preclude natural reproduction. Additionally, the operational plan calls for stocking yellow perch, white crappie, and/or black crappie at one pound per littoral acre if the catch rate drops to less than 2 fish/gill net for yellow perch, or less than 1 fish/trap net for black or white crappie combined for two successive assessments. High fertility and shallow water contribute to frequent winterkill in Cedar Lake which last suffered a partial kill during the winter of 2000-2001. Two aire-O2 aerators are currently placed in the north end of the lake in approximately 4 to 5 feet of water. The aerators may have better operational success if placed off the county park shoreline. North and northwest wind during the winter may aide the aerators' efficiency by opening more water.The northern pike catch rate was well above average for lakes similar to Cedar. Lengths of northern pike ranged from 18.5 to 34.2 inches with an average length of 22.7. Several year classes were identified during sampling which should provide sufficient broodstock and angling opportunities for the near future. Great winter \"tip-up\" action has been reported in 2004.The walleye catch rate was slightly below average for lakes similar to Cedar. Lengths of walleye ranged from 15.4 to 18.2 inches. The growth rates were above average for lakes in this region. All walleye sampled were from the same year which corresponds to a fry stocking in 2001. Shoreline seining sampled four young-of-the-year walleye, most likely the result of fry stocked in the spring of 2004. Walleye was added as a secondary management species in 2001. Fry stocking appears to be successful and should continue. Winter anglers have been reporting nice catches of 17 to 20 inch walleye in 2004.The yellow perch catch rate was slightly below average for lakes similar to Cedar. Lengths of yellow perch averaged 7.5 inches with 82 % of the fish from the 2001 year class. Although yellow perch numbers tend to cycle in most lakes, this population was probably competing poorly with the abundant white and black crappies and providing baitfish for the northern and walleye populations.Black and white crappie are sought after by many local anglers and Cedar remains a great destination choice. Black crappie catch rates were at a historic high. Lengths of black crappie ranged from 6.6 to 13.2 inches with an average length of 9.7. The average white crappie was 11.25 inches and weighed over 3/4 of a pound. The average channel catfish swimming in Cedar Lake is 20 inches long and weighs 2.8 pounds. Although the channel catfish catch rates are down slightly from 2000 a healthy population remains in Cedar and does not appear to have suffered significantly from the 2000-2001 partial winterkill.The black bullhead catch rate was above average for lakes similar to Cedar. Black bullhead numbers appear to be on an upward cycle. However, the average weight of bullheads captured indicate a relative healthy bullhead population.Other species of fish sampled during the assessment include bigmouth buffalo, common carp, common shiner, fathead minnow, freshwater drum, orangespotted sunfish, quillback carpsucker, spottail shiner, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled. Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality. Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake. It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Cedar Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Philip Nasby   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a shallow, 710-acre lake that has a maximum depth of 7.0 ft. and is located 1 mile west of Trimont in Martin County.  Cedar Lake consists of two basins (North and South Cedar) that are separated by a road and connected by a large culvert that allows fish passage.  Cedar Lake has a history of winterkill, with the most recent occurring during the winter of 2013-2014.  Cedar Lake's connectivity to other waterbodies (Fish Lake, Buffalo Lake, Little Twin Lake, several small wetlands) during high water events allows fish to repopulate the lake relatively quickly following a winterkill and also provides favorable habitat for Northern Pike.  Because of Cedar Lake's susceptibility to winterkill and favorable Pike habitat, the lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for crappie, Walleye and Yellow Perch.  Cedar Lake was surveyed the week of June 4, 2018 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates in Cedar Lake have ranged from 0.0 per gill net in 2014 to 16.7 per gill net in 2004.  In 2018, the Northern Pike catch rate was 4.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 22.8 to 30.8 inches and averaged 25.4 inches.  The Northern Pike population in Cedar Lake sustains itself through natural reproduction in connected lakes and wetlands, as the only stocking event in the last decade occurred in 2014, following the partial winterkill.  A strong 2018 year class may be present in the system, as many young-of-the-year Northern Pike were observed during the 2018 Walleye fingerling harvest on Buffalo Lake, a connected waterbody.  Cedar Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the new Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike 24 inches or longer can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate in 2018 was 9.3 per gill net, which is within the expected catch rate for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net), and was the highest Walleye catch rate ever recorded at Cedar Lake.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 12.3 to 26.0 inches and averaged 18.9 inches.  Growth of Walleye was fast, with average lengths at age-1, age-2, and age-3 being 10.0, 14.1, and 16.9 inches, respectively.  Sixty two percent of sampled Walleye were from the 2014 year class, which were stocked following the winterkill of 2013-2014.  Age-2, age-3, age-5, and age-8 Walleye were also sampled, and all corresponded to stocking events except the 2015 year class (age-3) which likely moved into Cedar Lake from Fish Lake at Odin, which was stocked with adult Walleye in 2017.  Cedar Lake provided a prime example of the positive impacts that a winterkill can have.  Typically, Walleye fry stocked the spring after a substantial winterkill event will do very well, which was the case with the strong 2014 year class that was produce in Cedar Lake.  Anglers have reaped the benefits of this strong year class of Walleye, as great fishing has been reported since 2016, and should continue into the near future.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2018 was 13.0 per gill net, a decrease from 31.3 per gill net in 2014, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.6 to 9.1 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  The abundant 2014 Walleye year class is likely controlling or decreasing Yellow Perch abundance through predation; however, a fishable population of Yellow Perch is still present.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate in 2018 was 4.2 per trap net, an increase from the 2014 catch rate of 2.6 per trap net and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 6.9 to 10.2 inches and averaged 8.2 inches.  White Crappie were captured at a rate of 5.7 per trap net, which is high when compared to similar lakes (6.0 per trap net).  White Crappie lengths ranged from 7.6 to 11.9 inches and averaged 9.2 inches.  Fishable populations of Black and White Crappie exist in Cedar Lake, and populations should continue to increase in abundance as they continue to recover from the 2013-2014 winterkill.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Black Bullhead in 2018 was 293.0 per gill net, with lengths ranging from 5.2 to 12.1 inches and averaging 7.3 inches.  Cedar Lake would be a good place to go if you are looking to pull some bullheads out of that cool spring water.  The Freshwater Drum catch rate in 2018 was 18.0 per gill net which is the highest recorded catch rate for this lake.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, Golden Shiner, and Green Sunfish.  Channel Catfish were present before the winterkill of 2013-2014, but were not sampled in the 2014 and 2018 surveys. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is managed primarily for northern pike.  Pike numbers are considered normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  The population is dominated by younger fish ranging in length from 19 to 22 inches.  On average, northern pike collected in our gillnets weighed approximately 2 lbs.  Pike were last stocked in 1989.The yellow perch population is also considered normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  Perch collected in our gillnets ranged in length from 7 to 9 inches.  Yellow perch reproduced naturally in Cedar Lake, and the population appears to be healthy.  Yellow perch were last stocked in 1988. White crappie numbers declined since our last survey in 1991 while black crappie numbers increased.  Both crappie populations are considered normal compared to other lakes in our area.On average, white crappie collected in our trapnets were 10 ? inches in length while black crappie were 9 ? inches in length.  Both populations are comprised mainly of larger fish which should provide anglers with good numbers of \"slab\" sized crappie.Walleye numbers are considered normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  Walleye collected in our gillnets ranged in length from 13 ? to 22 inches with an average of approximately 17 inches.  Walleye were absent in all our sampling gear in 1991.  It appears that walleye migrated into Cedar Lake from upsteam areas. Black bullhead numbers have historically been high in Cedar Lake and currently remain high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Bullhead collected in our trapnets ranged in length from 5 ? to 10 inches.Cedar lake also supports high numbers of rough fish.  Commercial fishermen removed 203,000 lbs. of carp and 79,475 lbs. of buffalo over the past five years.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Cedar Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar is a 710-acre lake with a maximum depth of 7 feet and is located in Martin County one mile west of Trimont.  The lake is just downstream from Little Twin Lake which has been used as a walleye rearing pond and may be a source of walleye for Cedar in years when heavy rain can cause the lake to overflow into Cedar.  Fish Lake near Odin is another upstream lake that is stocked with walleye and may provide walleye for Cedar in years with high rainfall events.  Because of frequent low winter dissolved oxygen levels, the lake is managed primarily for northern pike while walleye, yellow perch, and crappie are managed secondarily. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate of 4.0 fish/gill net was what we would expect for lakes with similar characteristics as Cedar Lake.  The average walleye catch rate for the last six population assessment is 3.8 fish per net.  The gill net catch rate was 4.3 in 2004 and 5.3 fish/net in 2000.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 15.0 to 19.9 inches and had an average length of 17.1 inches.  The walleye population in Cedar has remained fairly stable despite poor some low winter oxygen levels during the last 6 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population is doing very well in Cedar Lake.  The gill net catch rate of 49.0 was much higher than the catch rate of 3.7 in 2004 and 2.0 in 2000.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 5.4 to 11.6 inches and averaged 7.7 inches.  There were good numbers of perch in the 9 to 10 inch range which should provide some good angling opportunities for perch fishermen. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population is also doing very well in Cedar Lake.  We would consider the population to be high when compared to lakes with similar physical characteristics to Cedar.  Historically Cedar has been a very good northern pike lake.  The average gill net catch rate over the last 6 assessments is 7.9 fish per net which is very good for lakes like Cedar.  Lengths of northern pike caught in our gill nets ranged from 16.3 to 36.9 inches and averaged 19.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie population is also high in Cedar Lake.  The trap net catch rate of 25.3 is considered high and was down just a bit from the fish survey conducted in 2004.  The long term average catch rate for Cedar Lake is 14.1 fish per trap net.  Lengths of black crappie caught in our trap nets ranged from 4.4 to 12.4 inches and averaged 7.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers are down in Cedar Lake.  The black bullhead trap net CPUE has dropped from a high of 354.3 in 1995 to a low of 6.2 in 2010.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in our trap nets ranged from 4.9 to 11.8 inches and averaged 9.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSixteen fish species were sampled during the 2010 population assessment on Cedar Lake.  Other species sampled included bigmouth buffalo, bluegill, common carp, channel catfish, golden shiner, green sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, white crappie, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Cedar Lake; we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a shallow (maximum depth of 7.0 ft.), 710-acre lake located near Trimont in Martin County.  Cedar Lake has two basins (North Cedar and South Cedar) that are separated by a road, but connected by a large culvert that allows fish passage.  Cedar Lake has a history of winterkill, with the most recent occurring during the winter of 2013-2014.  Cedar Lake's connectivity to other waterbodies (Fish Lake, Buffalo Lake, Little Twin Lake, several small wetlands) during high water events allows fish to repopulate the lake relatively quickly following a winterkill, and provides favorable spawning habitat for Northern Pike.  Cedar Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for crappie, Walleye and Yellow Perch.  Cedar Lake was surveyed the week of June 6, 2022 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake has historically been a productive Northern Pike fishery, as catch rates have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 2014 (following a winterkill) to 16.7 per gill net in 2004, and have averaged 6.5 per gill net since 1986.  In 2022, the Northern Pike catch rate was 7.0 per gill net, which is near the upper end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Northern Pike ranged in length from 17.7 to 31.5 inches and averaged 24.4 inches.  While the Northern Pike population in Cedar Lake is sustained mostly through natural reproduction in connected lakes and wetlands, supplemental stocking has occurred sporadically when extra Northern Pike are available (2014 and 2021).  Mean relative weight of Northern Pike was 80, indicating that pike are in good condition and are foraging successfully.  Cedar Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike longer than 24 inches can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Walleye catch rate was 3.7 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net), but was a decrease from the 2018 catch rate of 9.3 per gill net.  Historically, Walleye catch rates have varied from 3.3 per gill net in 2014 to 9.3 per gill net in 2018, and have averaged 5.5 per gill net since 1995.  Three year classes of Walleye were sampled including Walleye from the 2015, 2018, and 2020 year classes.  2020 was a non-stocked year for all lakes in Minnesota due to COVID limitations, thus the 2020 year class was from natural reproduction.  Growth of Walleye in Cedar Lake is fast when compared to Walleye growth in other similar lakes across Minnesota, as mean length at age-2 was 12.9 inches and at age-4 was 17.9 inches.  Along with fast growth, condition of Walleye was good, as mean relative weight was 89, suggesting that prey resources are abundant.  The management goal of providing a secondary Walleye fishing opportunity has been achieved through stocking Walleye fry every other year (2022, 2024, 2026?).  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates have steadily declined from 49.0 per gill net in 2010, to 31.3 per gill net in 2014, to 13.0 per gill net in 2018.  The decline continued in 2022 as the catch rate of Yellow Perch was 2.7 per gill net, which is below the long term average of 21.0 per gill net and is near the lower end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.6 to 25.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.6 to 11.5 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.  Condition of Yellow Perch was good, as relative weight was 89, suggesting that prey is available.   <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake's Black Crappie population has been highly cyclical, where catch rates were low for several years (lower than 5.0 per trap net; 1986 to 1995), then high for several years (higher than 23.0 per trap net; 2000 to 2010), then low again for a few years (2014 to 2018).  Cedar Lake Black Crappie appear to be in the uptick of the cycle, as the 2022 catch rate was 19.6 per trap net, which exceeds the long term average of 13.9 per trap net, and is near the upper end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 5.2 to 13.1 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  Black Crappie that were 10.0 inches or larger comprised 25 percent of the sample and should provide a great fishery.  Black Crappie condition was high, as mean relative weight was 99, indicating that they are foraging successfully.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappie catch rates have been highly variable, ranging from 0.3 per trap net in 2014 to 50.2 per trap net in 1986, averaging 10.3 per trap net since 1986.  The 2022 White Crappie catch rate was 4.9 per trap net, which is near the upper end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 5.9 per trap net).  White Crappie lengths ranged from 6.4 to 14.1 inches and averaged 11.4 inches. Cedar Lake provides a unique opportunity, as 67 percent of the White Crappie were 12.0 inches or larger.  Mean relative weight of White Crappie was high at 88, suggesting that food is available.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Black Bullhead catch rate was 182.7 per gill net, exceeding the long-term average of 107.0 per gill net and exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net). Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 4.8 to 12.6 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  The Common Carp catch rate was the highest ever recorded on Cedar Lake at 41.0 per gill net.  Lengths of Common Carp ranged from 10.3 to 30.6 inches and averaged 14.9 inches.  Based on the lengths of the Common Carp in the gill net it would appear that a majority of them sampled were from 1 year class of fish.  Channel Catfish have still not been sampled since the winterkill of 2013-2014.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Bluegill, Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, White Sucker, Quillback, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nCedar Lake is a 710-acre Minnesota DNR class 43 lake with a north and south basin.  Located 1 mile west of Trimont in Martin County, Cedar Lake only reaches depths of 7 feet in the north basin but boasts 9.5 miles of shoreline.  Locally, the lake is actually considered 2 separate lakes, but for fish management they are considered one lake due to connectivity that allows fish to freely swim between lakes.  Cedar Lake is also connected to Buffalo Lake and Fish Lake from the North and Little Twin Lake from the south as well as several small wetlands that all make up decent habitat for Northern Pike.  Because of the abundance of decent habitat for Northern Pike and because Northern Pike are tolerant of low dissolved oxygen, which Cedar Lake commonly experiences during winter, the lake is managed first for Northern Pike.  Secondarily, Black and White Crappie as well as Walleye and Yellow Perch are managed to create additional game fishing opportunities.  Cedar Lake recently experienced very low dissolved oxygen levels of less than 1 ppm for several months during the winter of 2013-2014.  At ice-out in the spring of 2014 many dead fish were observed along the shoreline, mainly Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo, Freshwater Drum, and some game fish.  A spring trap net assessment revealed 11 species of fish remained alive in the lake despite the low oxygen levels and all managed species listed above were still present in good numbers.  However, a follow-up population assessment was conducted in June of 2014 to continue to regularly monitor the population and determine the severity of the winterkill to see if numbers of game fish were more or less than expected compared to past assessments.    <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nHistorically, Cedar Lake has been known as a good lake for Northern Pike fishing.  Northern Pike have been stocked as fingerling in 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1989.  In addition, Buffalo Lake has been stocked with fingerling only once in 1994 while Fish Lake has been stocked with various sizes of Northern Pike frequently since 1979 with the most recent stocking of fingerling in 2014.  While Northern Pike are regularly stocked in these lakes there are times when successful natural reproduction adds to the population.  However, there is a need to protect and potentially enhance the remaining spawning habitat within the connected lakes to ensure future success of the Northern Pike.  The historical survey netting since 1986 in Cedar Lake indicates an average gill net catch of 6.7 per net.  The typical Windom Fisheries Management Area class 43 Lake has an average gill net catch rate of only 2.2 Northern Pike per net as of 2014, so Cedar Lake's historical catch rate is high compared to other Windom area lakes.  Prior to the 2014 survey the gill net catch rate ranged from a low of 2.7 per gill net in 1995 to a high of 16.7 per gill net in 2004.  However, following the winterkill in 2013-2014 the June 2014 gill net catch rate was 0 per net.  Although, the post winterkill spring trap netting revealed Northern Pike were still present in the lake, but their numbers were obviously reduced by the winterkill due to 0 fish caught in June.  It is possible that some Northern Pike moved to either Buffalo Lake or Fish Lake during higher water levels in June, but the population has never before been at a level that resulted in 0 fish being caught in June sampling.  As a result, 353 adult Northern Pike were stocked in December of 2014 to boost the adult population.  Also, the fingerling stocking in Fish Lake in June 2014 may also contribute to the catchable population in Cedar Lake in the future and boost levels to a more normal range.  Cedar Lake will be resurveyed in 2018, if at that time the Northern Pike population has not fully recovered additional restocking may be needed.  Overall, it appears that the Northern Pike population is poised to make a quick recovery from the 2013-2014 winterkill even though no fish were caught in June.      <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \nCedar Lake is home to 2 species of crappie, Black Crappie and White Crappie.  Since 1986, the Black Crappie trap net catch rate has averaged 14.5 per net and the White Crappie trap net catch rate has averaged 11.8 per net.  During the 2000's, there was a boom in crappie numbers in Cedar Lake and the Black Crappie catch rate ranged from 23.0 per trap net in 2000 to 29.9 per trap net in 2004.  During the same time the White Crappie catch rate ranged from 2.1 to 20.6 per trap net.  In 2014, the catch rates for Black Crappie and White Crappie were 2.6 per trap net and 0.3 per trap net respectively.  It is apparent that the winterkill of 2013-2014 had a negative impact on the Crappie population in Cedar Lake.  Regardless of the negative effect of the winterkill, the remaining Black and White crappie ranged in length from 6.7 to 10.9 inches and 6.5 to 10.0 inches respectively indicating spawning aged adults still remained in the lake.  In addition, the post winterkill spring sampling revealed 1.8 Black Crappie and 0.5 White Crappie per trap net that ranged from 5.8 to 10.3 inches for Black Crappie and 8.3 to 10.1 inches for White Crappie.  Additionally, the Black Crappie and White Crappie in the sample were plump, indicating good body condition and health.  It appears that the two species of Crappie are also poised for a quick recovery from the 2013-2014 winterkill.  Good numbers of spawning adult fish are still present that will most likely lead to successful reproduction in 2015 and beyond.  The population will be monitored closely, and the follow-up lake survey in 2018 will help to inform the need for re-stocking if the population does not recover as expected.    <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nWalleye were first stocked in Cedar Lake in 2001 when fry were introduced.  Prior to that however, Walleye were first observed in Cedar Lake netting in 1996 with a catch rate of 8.9 per gill net.  Walleye were observed again in 2000 with a catch rate of 5.3 per gill net.  These Walleye in Cedar Lake were determined to be from downstream drift of Walleye from Fish Lake.  Fish Lake has been stocked occasionally with Walleye since 1991.  With good catch rates in Cedar Lake in 1996 and 2000, Walleye were added to the managed species list and fry stocking started in 2001, and was continued in 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014.  In addition, Walleye fingerlings were stocked in September of 2014 following the winterkill in 2013-2014 to boost the recovery of the population.  During the post winterkill netting in the spring of 2014, 8 Walleye ranging from 16.6 to 19.5 inches were caught in 6 trap nets.  In the June netting in 2014, 3.3 Walleye were caught per gill net and 0 Walleye were caught in trap nets.  The gill net catch rate is within the normal range but is less than the long-term Cedar Lake average catch rate of 5.1 per gill net.  The lower catch rate in 2014 led to the fall stocking of fingerling mentioned above.  The size of Walleye caught in the June 2014 netting ranged from 9.7 to 20.6 inches with a mean of 17.7 inches.  The size range of the fish in the sample was skewed toward larger fish indicating that the population of Walleye in Cedar Lake may be dominated by large fish with little smaller fish to replace them as they die.  Therefore, this also led to the stocking of fingerling in the fall of 2014 to help balance the size structure of the population.  Future stocking in Cedar Lake will be with Walleye fry, but follow-up fish netting in 2018 will help to determine if additional fingerling stocking is needed to boost the population.  Overall, it appears that the Walleye population in Cedar Lake weathered the winterkill of 2013-2014 well and the population should recover quickly.       <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nEven though Cedar Lake experienced a partial winterkill during 2013-2014, The Yellow Perch did not seem to be as affected as Northern Pike, Crappie, or Walleye.  The Yellow Perch post winterkill trap net catch rate during the spring of 2014 was 58.7 per net and the June 2014 catch rates were 31.3 per gill net and 1.0 per trap net.  The June gill net catch was the third highest ever observed and greater than the historical gill net catch rate average of 24.7 per gill net and also greater than the class 43 upper normal range.  Additionally, the trap net catch rate of 1.0 per net was equal to the historical trap net average and within the normal range for lake class 43.  The Yellow Perch in the gill net sample ranged from 5.3 to 10.8 inches with a mean of 9.3 inches and the Yellow Perch in the trap net sample ranged from 4.9 inches to 10.2 inches with a mean of 7.0 inches.  The size distribution of the Yellow Perch in the gill net and trap net was dominated by larger fish.  Additionally, the body condition of the fish in the sample was good indicating a healthy population of Yellow Perch.  While Cedar Lake received a re-stocking of Northern Pike and Walleye, Yellow Perch were not in need of re-stocking.  The population appears to be doing much better than the other game fish in the lake and can be considered recovered from the winterkill of 2013-2014.  Future success in spawning will help the Yellow Perch population regain some size balance that was skewed toward larger fish during 2014.  Additionally, habitat conservation and establishment of downed trees along the shoreline and submerged vegetation should continue to help the population remain fishable.   <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nOther species sampled during the June 2014 netting survey were Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Orangespotted Sunfish, Quillback, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, and White Sucker gill net catch rates were all within the normal class 43 catch ranges but the Black Bullhead gill net catch rate was less than the class 43 normal range.  All species but the Yellow Bullhead trap net catch rate was within the class 43 normal catch rate ranges, the Yellow Bullhead trap net catch rate was less than normal for a class 43 lake.  Interestingly, Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum, and Bluegill were absent from the post-winterkill netting and June 2014 netting indicating either a very low abundance population still exists that avoided the nets or these species are now absent from Cedar Lake.  Future monitoring in 2018 with a regularly scheduled netting assessment will be conducted to further assess the non-managed species mentioned above.  <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \nOverall, it appears that the winterkill of 2013-2014 did have an effect on the Northern Pike, Crappie, and Walleye in Cedar Lake but it did not seem to adversely impact the Yellow Perch.  However, June netting revealed that the current population levels of Northern Pike and Crappie are sufficient to recolonize the lake.  In addition, re-stocking of Northern Pike and Walleye in 2014 will help to speed up the recovery of those populations.  With adequate winter dissolved oxygen levels and good spring spawning conditions in 2015, the game fish populations should flourish.  A possible benefit of the 2013-2014 winterkill is the lack of Channel Catfish and Freshwater Drum found in netting in Cedar Lake in 2014.  If populations of Channel Catfish and Freshwater Drum are in fact removed from the lake, it will free up resources and reduced unwanted competition with game fish.  A future lake survey in 2018 using gill nets and trap nets in June will help to monitor the long-term health of the fish communities and the lake as a whole.  For now, Cedar Lake appears to be making a good recovery from the winterkill of 2013-2014.

The seine hauls captured 13 species of fish, including Johnny Darter (N=5), Bigmouth Shiner (N=1), Black Bullhead (N=50), Black Crappie (N=51), Blackside Darter (N=1), Bluntnose Minnow (N=17), Fathead Minnow (N=12), Freshwater Drum (N=17), Golden Shiner (N=7), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=49), Spotfin Shiner(N=17), Walleye (N=1), and Yellow Perch (N=9).  Electrofishing captured 18 species of fish including Johnny Darter (N=1), Bigmouth Buffalo (N=1), Bigmouth Shiner (N=1), Black Bullhead (N=2), Blackside Darter (N=2), Bluegill (N=1), Bluntnose Minnow (N=11), Common Carp (N=33), Emerald Shiner (N=1), Fathead Minnow (N=49), Freshwater Drum (N=1), Green Sunfish (N=87), Largemouth Bass (N=6), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=8), Spotfin Shiner (N=4), Walleye (N=3), Yellow Bullhead (N=1), and Yellow Perch (N=3). Natural Reproduction exists for some of the species in Cedar Lake, as young-of-the-year Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Freshwater Drum, and Yellow Perch were sampled.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of Cedar Lake.  The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community. <br> \n</p>",
