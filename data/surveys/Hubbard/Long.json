                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is located two miles east of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Long Lake has a surface area of 1,926 acres and a maximum depth of 135 feet.  Long Lake is heavily developed for this area and is a very popular lake for fishing and other water recreation.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Long Lake is in lake class 22.  Class 22 lakes are deep, have hard water, and a small littoral zone (lake area less than 15 feet in depth).  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Big Sand, Lower Bottle, Kabekona, and Potato. <br> \n <br> \nLong Lake is a popular Walleye lake and is known for producing some large fish.  Walleye abundance (5.2 Walleye/gill net) was near the current management goal of 6.0 Walleye/gill net, similar to recent surveys.  Sampled Walleye had an average length and weight of 18.5 inches and 2.3 pounds, with fish measured up to 27.3 inches.  Important Walleye forage species such as Yellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) were sampled in good numbers.  Long Lake is currently stocked with Walleye fingerlings during even numbered years. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range typical for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 25.1 inches and 3.1 pounds, with pike measured up to 38.6 inches.  A good forage base of Tullibee (Cisco) and White Sucker provides the conditions to produce large Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nLong Lake supports a healthy Largemouth Bass population, especially in the north and south bays where there is shallower water and good beds of submerged aquatic vegetation which provides excellent habitat.  Anglers will find good numbers of bass in the 12-14 inch size range as well as larger fish.  Smallmouth bass have been sampled in past surveys, but they are found in very low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie fishing is popular right after ice-out on the north end of the lake in an area known as \"the fill\".  Black Crappie abundance in Long Lake has remained fairly stable, generally at low to moderate levels.  Anglers will find good numbers of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in Long Lake; however, average size is poor (5.0 inches).  Larger Bluegill are present in Long, but the size of Bluegill is limited by slow growth rates. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of Rock Bass, and moderate numbers of Yellow Bullhead.  Bowfin (Dogfish) and Hybrid Sunfish were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Long Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 22-23, 2019 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Eighteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, six sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and eleven sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Site conditions prevented the use of seines at one site.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 18 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured twenty-three species of fish including two species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish and Blacknose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bigmouth Shiner, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Fathead Minnow, Finescale Dace, Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Least Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Northern Redbelly Dace, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Spottail Shiner, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on July 8, 2019, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Long Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Long Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

The present walleye population has an abundance comparable to similar lakes in the Park Rapids area (e.g. Big Sand, Potato, Kabekona).  Walleye up to 29 inches were sampled during the 1993 survey, and the average weight was a high 2.3 pounds.  Walleye fingerlings or fry have been stocked almost every year since 1981; however, spawning grounds are now being posted in the spring to try to increase natural reproduction in the lake.  Both northern pike size and abundance are comparable to similar area lakes.  The average size of northern pike sampled in gillnets in 1993 was 21.8 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Largemouth bass and black crappies have not been efficiently sampled enough with standard survey nets to evaluate their abundance and size structures.  However, both species provide a popular and successful fishery.  Bluegills are abundant in Long Lake, and their small size structure is characteristic of a population with high reproductive success and slow growth rates.  Only 15% of the the measured bluegills were 6 inches or larger.  Yellow perch are also small in Long Lake, but unlike the bluegills, their abundance is very low.  The lack of a yellow perch forage base may contribute to slow growth of walleyes and northern pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is located two miles east of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Long Lake has a surface area of 1,974 acres and a maximum depth of 135 feet.  Long Lake is eight miles long from the north to south end.  Long Lake has moderate to heavy home/cabin development for this area and is a very popular lake for fishing and other water recreation.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Long Lake is in lake class 22.  Other Park Rapids area lakes in this same classification include: Big Sand, Lower Bottle, Kabekona, and Potato.Long Lake is a popular walleye lake and is known for producing some big fish.  Long has a reputation of being a tricky lake to fish, probably due to the clear water and large area of deep water.  Good numbers of walleye were sampled (9.2 walleye/gillnet).  This is the highest walleye gillnet catch rate for all surveys going back to 1959, and above the current management goal of 6.0 walleye/gillnet.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 17.4 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Important walleye forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in good numbers.  The abundant walleye population currently found in Long Lake is the result of an aggressive and successful DNR stocking program.  Age analysis showed that 91% of the walleye sample (127 of 140 walleye) corresponded to stocked years.  Long Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even years. Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (5.0 pike/gillnet), within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 23.6 inches and 3.0 pounds, with fish measured up to 33.3 inches.  A good tullibee (cisco) forage base provides the conditions to produce large pike.Black crappie fishing is popular right after ice-out on the north end of the lake in an area known as \"the fill\".  Black crappie abundance in Long Lake has remained fairly stable, generally at low to moderate levels.  Fishing for other panfish species is limited on Long Lake.  While bluegill and pumpkinseed numbers are high, average size is poor (5.1 inches).  Larger bluegill are present in Long, however, the size of bluegill is limited by very slow growth rates.Long Lake supports a healthy largemouth bass population, especially in the north and south bays were there is shallower water and good beds of submerged aquatic vegetation which provides excellent habitat.  Anglers will find good numbers of bass in the 12-14 inch size range as well as larger fish.Other species sampled included in moderate abundance and similar to past surveys included white sucker, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.  Shorthead redhorse, brown bullhead, and bowfin (dogfish) were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is located two miles east of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Long Lake has a surface area of 1,974 acres and a maximum depth of 135 feet.  Long Lake is eight miles long from the north to south end.  Long Lake has moderate to heavy home/cabin development for this area and is a very popular lake for fishing and other water recreation.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Long Lake is in lake class 22.  Other Park Rapids area lakes in this same classification include: Big Sand, Lower Bottle, Kabekona, and Potato.Long Lake is a popular walleye lake and is well known for producing big fish.  It has a reputation of being a tricky lake to fish, probably due to the large area of deep water.  Walleye were sampled in good numbers (7.1/gillnet), within the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  The 1988 and 1993 surveys had slightly lower, but similar walleye abundance.  Historical walleye gillnet catch rates have been lower: 2.7/net (1972) and 4.8/net (1983).  Walleye were large-size, averaging 17.3 inches and 2.2 pounds with fish up to 28.4 inches sampled. Yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) provide an excellent forage base for the growth of larger walleye. The walleye population in Long Lake is maintained almost exclusively through stocking, with 97% of the sample (111 fish) corresponding to stocked years.  Long Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even years.Northern pike were sampled in high numbers (8.0/gillnet), just above the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  With the exception of high numbers in 1983 and 1998, northern pike abundance in past surveys has generally been at moderate levels.  Northern pike averaged 21.4 inches and 2.5 pounds, with fish measured up to 36.4 inches.  Black crappie fishing is popular  right after ice-out on the north end of the lake in an area known as \"the fill\".  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has remained fairly stable, generally  at low to moderate numbers.  Some anglers have reported catching fewer and smaller black crappie  in recent years.  Heavy fishing pressure when fish are concentrated in a small area may be affecting black crappie abundance and size structure.  Fishing for other panfish species is limited on Long Lake.  While bluegill abundance was high in the survey (40.7/trapnet), average size  was poor (5.2 inches).  While bluegill over 8.0 inches were found, size of bluegill is limited by slow growth rates.  Pumpkinseed were also found in moderate abundance and small average size (5.7 inches).Long Lake supports a healthy largemouth bass population, especially in the north and south bays were there is shallower water and good beds of submerged aquatic vegetation which provides excellent habitat.  Generally, standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective in sampling largemouth bass populations.  However, fifty-two bass were sampled with catch rates similar to past surveys.  Spring electrofishing is usually done to assess largemouth bass populations. Electrofishing equipment was not available for past surveys, but will be conducted in future years.Yellow perch were sampled below the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  Yellow perch abundance in past surveys has been even lower.  While the average size of the yellow perch was small (6.9 inches), fish up to 11.3 inches were sampled providing the angler with a limited yellow perch fishery. Other species sampled in moderate abundance and similar to past surveys include rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead .  Brown bullhead and bowfin (dogfish) were sampled in low numbers.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Long Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is located two miles east of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Long Lake has a surface area of 1,926 acres and a maximum depth of 135 feet.  Long Lake has a heavily developed shoreline of lake homes and cabins for this area and is a very popular lake for fishing and water recreation.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.   Long Lake is in lake class 22.  Class 22 lakes have the characteristics of being deep, having hard water, and a small littoral zone (lake area less than 15 feet in depth).  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Sand, Kabekona, Lower Bottle, and Potato. <br> \n <br> \nLong Lake provides a multi-species opportunity for the angler, with good populations of Walleye, Northern Pike, Panfish, and Largemouth Bass.  Long Lake is a popular Walleye lake and is known for producing some large fish.  Walleye abundance was down slightly from past surveys, but still within the range typical for this lake class.  Anglers will find good numbers of Walleye between 14 to 18 inches.  Sampled Walleye had an average length and weight of 18.1 inches and 2.3 pounds, with fish measured up to 27.9 inches.  Currently Long Lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Historically, surveys have shown a moderate Northern Pike population in Long Lake.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 23.8 inches and 3.5 pounds, with fish measured up to 37.6 inches.  Long Lake supports a healthy Largemouth Bass population, especially in the north and south bays where there is shallower water and abundant beds of submerged aquatic vegetation which provides excellent habitat.  Anglers will find good numbers of Largemouth Bass in the 12 -14 inch size range.  Black Crappie fishing is popular right after ice-out on the north end of the lake in an area known as \"the fill\".  Black Crappie abundance in Long Lake has remained fairly stable, fluctuating at low to moderate levels.  Anglers will find good populations of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in Long Lake, however, average size is small (5.3 inches). <br> \n   <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of Rock Bass and moderate numbers of White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Bowfin.  Brown Bullhead were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nFaucet snails, an aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Long Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving. <br> \n</p>",

Largemouth bass and panfish appear to be abundant, but the average size is small and the fish are slow-growing.Walleye taken in the test nets were of good average size, but their abundance as indicated by the test nets, was below the statewide median.Oxygen and temperature conditions appear to be suitable for trout throughout a large portion of the lake.  Maintenance stocking to provide a sport fishery for cold-water species seems feasible, but would require great numbers of stocked fish in order to build a population density that would provide a satisfactoru catch-rate.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is located two miles east of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Long Lake has a surface area of 1,974 acres and a maximum depth of 135 feet.  Long Lake is eight miles long from north to south end.  Long Lake has heavy home/cabin development for this area and is a very popular lake for fishing and other water recreation.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Long Lake is in lake class 22.  Other Park Rapids area lakes in this same classification include: Big Sand, Lower Bottle, Kabekona, and Potato. <br> \n <br> \nLong Lake is a popular walleye lake and is known for producing some large fish.  Walleye abundance (5.8 walleye/gillnet) was near the current management goal of 6.0 walleye/gillnet, similar to recent surveys.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 17.0 inches and 2.1 pounds, with fish measured up to 28.5 inches.  Important walleye forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in good numbers.  Long Lake is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (5.9 pike/gillnet), within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.7 inches and 3.0 pounds, with pike measured up to 35.0 inches.  A good tullibee (cisco) forage base provides the conditions to produce large pike. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie fishing is popular right after ice-out on the north end of the lake in an area known as \"the fill\".  Black crappie abundance in Long Lake has remained fairly stable, generally at low to moderate levels.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in Long, however, average size is poor (5.2 inches).  Larger bluegill are present in Long, however, the size of bluegill is limited by slow growth rates. <br> \n <br> \nLong Lake supports a healthy largemouth bass population, especially in the north and south bays where there is shallower water and good beds of submerged aquatic vegetation which provides excellent habitat.  Anglers will find good numbers of bass in the 12-14 inch size range as well as larger fish. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of rock bass, yellow bullhead, and white sucker and low numbers of brown bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n</p>",
