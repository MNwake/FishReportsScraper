                "narrative": "<p>Lotus is a 246-acre lake located in Chanhassen in Carver County.  It is primarily managed for walleye and largemouth bass.  A fish population assessment was conducted during mid-July 2010 to determine the size structure and abundance of game fish species in the lake. <br> \nThe walleye population density in Lotus Lake has been stable over the last two assessments.  Walleye density is moderate (3.3/gill net) and unchanged from the previous assessment in 2004 (3.3/gill net).  Eighty-five percent were 10 inches or greater, 75% were 15 inches or greater, and 10% were 20 inches or greater.  Mean length and weight in the gill nets were 15.4 inches and 1.4 lbs, with the largest measuring 22.9 inches.  Walleye ranged in age from 1 to 7.  The strongest year class was the 2006 cohort (age 4), which comprised 59% of the sample.  Walleye reached 15 inches by age 3 and 20 inches by age 5.         <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population, like the walleye population, has remained stable over the last two assessments.  Bluegill abundance is moderate (25.4/ trap net), similar to the previous assessment in 2004 (25.0/ trap net).  Sixty-four percent were 6 inches or greater and the largest measured 7.4 inches.  Mean length and weight were 5.8 inches and 0.17 lbs.  Bluegill ranged in age from 1 to 7, 61% were age 5 and 19% were age 4.  Bluegill averaged 6 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance is moderately low compared with similar lakes in the state.  Gill net catch has dropped by 74%, from 12.8/net in 2004 to 3.3/net in 2010; however, 2010 trap net catch (1.1/net) has remained similar to 2004 (2.0/ net).  Based on gill net catch, 60% of black crappie were 8 inches or greater, and the largest measured 8.9 inches.  Mean length and weight were 7.7 inches and 0.24 lbs.  Ages 1 to 5 were represented, with the 2007 (age 3) and 2008 (age 2) year classes each comprising 34% of the sample.  Black crappie averaged 8 inches by age 3. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance appears to be decreasing, from a high of 181/gill net in 1999 to a low of 4/gill net in the 2010 assessment.  Compared to other similar lakes, 4/ gill net is considered low.  Mean size (0.13 lbs) has improved over the previous assessments; however it is average compared to other similar lakes.  All yellow perch sampled were between 6 and 8.3 inches, averaging 7.1 inches.  Eighty-five percent were age 4 or 5, the remaining 15% were age 3.  Yellow perch reached 8 inches by age 5.       <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented in these nets for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  Two largemouth bass were sampled at 4.4 and 17.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to previous assessments, northern pike abundance is low (0.3/gill net).  The two captured were 20.9 inches and 24.7 inches.  Other species sampled in low abundance were brown bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, greens sunfish, and yellow bullhead.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lotus is a 246-acre, Class 24 lake located in Chanhassen in Carver County.  It is primarily managed for Walleye and Largemouth Bass.  A Standard Survey was conducted during mid-July 2015 to assess the gamefish populations in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was moderately high; the catch rate of 6.2 fish per gill net was between the median and 75th percentile for this Lake Class.  Twenty-nine percent of the fish exceeded 15 inches, and 6 percent exceeded 20 inches.  Mean length and weight in gill nets were 15.1 inches and 1.24 lbs, with the largest fish measuring 24.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were moderately abundant in 2015; the catch rate of 44.0 fish per trap net was between the median and 75th percentile for this Lake Class.  Ninety-three percent of the fish were 6 inches or greater, and 16 percent were 7 inches or greater. The largest measured- from all sampling-was 7.8 inches.  Mean length and weight were 6.6 inches and 0.22 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nAn abundance of small-sized Black Crappie were caught in the gill nets.  The catch rate of 36.8 fish per net is more than double the 75th percentile for this Lake Class.  The average size of fish was 4.6 inches and 0.05 pounds; 96 percent of the fish were smaller than 5 inches.  The largest gill netted Black Crappie was 8.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance appears to be decreasing, from a high of 181 fish per gill net in 1999 to a low of 1.4 fish per gill net in the 2015 assessment.  Compared to other Class 24 lakes, 1.4 fish per gill net is considered low (below the first quartile).  Mean size (0.14 lbs) has improved over the previous assessments; however it is average (near to the median of 0.13 lbs) compared to other Class 24 lakes.  Yellow Perch were between 6 and 8.2 inches, averaging 7.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to previous assessments, Northern Pike abundance was low.  The catch rate of 1.4 fish per gill net was below the first quartile for this Lake Class.  The fish tended to be large; average size was 25.1 inches and 4.11 pounds.  The largest Northern Pike was 34.1 inches and 9.1 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes sampled in low abundance were Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lotus Lake is a 245-acres (182 littoral acres) with a maximum depth of 29 feet. Lotus is located north of Chanhassen in northeastern Carver County. Lotus is primarily managed for Walleye and Largemouth Bass, but also supports catchable populations of Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch. Public water access is provided by the City of Chanhassen on the south side of the lake off of State Highway 101 (up to 10 vehicle/trailer parking spaces). <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was conducted on Lotus Lake during the week of 7/6/2021 to assess the fishery. During the 2021 survey, Lotus was productive (brown-green stained water), with moderate water clarity, measured at 5 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen was zero parts per million (ppm) below 13 feet during the survey period. Eurasian Watermilfoil, Brittle Naiad, and Zebra Mussels has been found in Lotus Lake and remain present. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye in Lotus Lake are maintained through fingerling stocking in odd numbered years. During the 2021 survey, Walleye were captured at high numbers (9.5/net); the highest catch rate in the previous 27 years. There were 57 Walleye sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 15.7 inches and the largest measured at 24.2 inches. Walleye size indices describe a balanced population (an intermediate between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish). Growth rates were fast compared to the statewide average, with an average length of 12.3 inches by age 2. The 2021 survey results show Lotus exceeding abundance and size goals, providing desirable angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during spring 2021 with nighttime boat electrofishing; the first time this type of sampling has been completed on Lotus. Catch rates were moderate, with 34.4 fish/hour.  A total of 63 bass were sampled, with an average length of 12.6 inches and the largest measured at 19.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (79.7/net). There were 717 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2021 survey, with an average length of 5.5 inches and the largest measured at 7.9 inches. Bluegill size indices describe a population skewed towards smaller individuals. High Bluegill densities and competition among other Bluegill are likely reducing growth potential and keeping sizes low. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (8.5/net) and trap nets (14.6/net), near the expected catch rates of similar metro lakes. There were 182 Black Crappie sampled during the 2021 survey, with an average length of 7.2 inches and the largest measured at 15.0 inches. Black Crappie in Lotus Lake are mainly composed of small individuals with only 32% of fish sampled greater than 8 inches. However, the presence of a single crappie greater than 15\" shows that lake conditions exist that have the potential to grow fish to trophy size. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets (2.2/net). There were 13 Yellow Perch sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 7.1 inches and the largest measured at 8.9 inches. While providing little value to anglers, Yellow Perch in Lotus Lake play an important role in the diets of Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Brown Bullhead, Northern Pike, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nWith multiple invasive species found in Lotus Lake, anglers can help stop the spread by following three steps every time they leave a lake or river - whether or not it's infested: <br> \nClean all aquatic plants, zebra mussels, and other invasive species from boats, trailers, and water-related equipment. <br> \nDrain water from your boat, ballast tanks, motor, live well and bait container. Remove drain plugs and keep drain plugs out while transporting equipment. <br> \nDispose of unwanted bait in the trash. To keep live bait, drain the water and refill the bait container with bottled or tap water.</p>",

GOLDEN SHINER, YEL- LOW BULLHEAD, YELLOW PERCH, BLUEGILL AND WHITE CRAPPIES WERE SAMPLED AT LEVELS ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN. NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF LARGEMOUTH BASS WAS CONFIRMED BY SHORELINE SEINING. THE SOURCE OF CHANNEL CATFISH SAMPLED IS UNCERTAIN. NORTHERN PIKE ARE FEW IN NUMBER BUT OF LARGE SIZE AND RE- PRESENTED BY THREE YEAR CLASSES. NORTHERN PIKE ARE FEW IN NUMBERS BUT OF LARGE SIZE AND REPRESENTED BY THREE YEAR CLASSES. THE WALLEYE SAMPLED IS PRO- BABLY THE RESULT OF THE 1977 FRY STOCKING, ALTHOU- GH ITS AGE GOES NOT CORRESPOND TO THAT DATE. THE NUMBERS OF PERCH PRESENT PROVIDES ADEQUATE FORAGE FOR LARGER NUMBERS OF PREDATORS. BLUEGILLS WERE FOUND IN VERY HIGH NUMBERS AND SMALL SIZE, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NUMBERS OVER THE 1974 AND 1979 NETTINGS, BUT SIMILAR TO THE 1954 NETTING. CRAPPIE NUMBERS HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE SINCE 1979. CARP AND BULLHEAD NUMBERS WERE FOUND TO BE LOW AND NUMBERS OF CARP ARE DOWN FROM 1979.</p>",

The average length and weight sampled were 19.5 inches and 3.0 pounds. A high yellow perch population could make walleye fishing tough due to abundant forage. The northern pike population has increased since the last survey and are averaging approximately 27.5 inches in length. Bluegills are extremely abundant and over 66% are 6 inches or larger, but there are few fish that are larger than 7 inches. Largemouth bass, which are normally not caughht in trapnets, were rather abundant. The average length sampled was 10.4 inches. The largest bass sampled was 18.8 inches. Both yellow and black bullheads are present in Lotus Lake. The black bullheads are less abundant and smaller than the yellow bullheads that were sampled. Other species present include green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, carp, white sucker, and golden shiner.    </p>",

Fish sampled during this survey reflect this management with most individuals being from the 1993 stocking. Anglers report that haevy fishing pressure for walleye has be observed the last couple of years. Growth rate for walleye appears to be above average in this lake. Few northern pike were captured during this survey, but anglers report catching some quality fish on occasion. Largemouth bass up to 19.7 inches were captured by electrofishing. About 1/3 of the bass captured measured 16.0 inches or longer.Bluegill are very abundant at the present time with the average size being only about 5.8 inches in length. Black and white crappie are also present with the average size being between 7 and 8 inches in length. Carp were also observed throughout most of the lake, however, very few were captured in the nets during this survey.</p>",

The large number of age 1 fish sampled is promising and may provide anglers with some decent fishing in the future.  Overall, walleye mean length and weight was 15 inches and two pounds, respectively.  Northern pike abundance is below that observed in 1999, but most of the fish were 30 inches or greater in length and weighed over six pounds.  Black crappie had the highest abundance in the history of the lake.  These fish were primarily 6.5-7.5 inches long and no fish over 8.5 inches were sampled.  Bluegill abundance was the lowest in the lake since 1989.  Despite this small number, size was still small with a majority of the population being less than six inches.  Yellow perch numbers were also low; with most fish being less than seven inches long.  Moderate numbers of largemouth bass, black bullhead, and yellow bullhead were also present during this survey.</p>",

All stations were sampled with a backpack electrofishing unit, 8 were sampled with a 50-foot seine, and 1 was sampled with a 15-foot seine. One station was not sampled with a seine because of dense vegetation and deep water. Nearshore sampling captured 12 species of fish, which included no intolerant species and 2 tolerant species (Common Carp and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2015 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. Lotus Lake scored poorly with the FIBI compared to a threshold developed for similar lakes. The low score was driven by the low diversity of vegetation dwelling species and the low proportion of intolerant individuals captured in nearshore gear, and the low relative biomass of top carnivores in the gill nets compared to similar lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Lotus Lake is located in the Lower Minnesota River Watershed.</p>",
