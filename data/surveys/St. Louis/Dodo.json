Northern pike catch rates are very high for lakes in this class, and most are of the \"hammerhandle\" variety.  The bluegill population is also at historic highs thanks to two strong year classes in 1995 and 1996.  Most of the bluegill sampled tended to be on the smaller side, however, a few larger individuals were present.  The largemouth bass population is also dominated by smaller individuals and no fish larger than 16 inches were sampled.     With its direct connection to Leora Lake there is probably fish constantly moving between the two basins.  Leora Lake has more preferred habitat for northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.</p>",
