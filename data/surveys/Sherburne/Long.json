A public access is owned by Haven Township and is considered carry-in only. A standard survey was completed in 1975 to collect fisheries data.\n\nA high population of small Black Crappie were present. Bluegill abundance was about average. One Largemouth Bass was sampled in the gill nets. Northern Pike abundance was good. Yellow Perch were sampled in high numbers for the lake class. Other species sampled included: Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker. \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is connected to Pickerel and Round Lakes and the three are located three miles west of Clear Lake in western Sherburne County.  Haven Township owns the access, which is considered carry-in only.  The lake is heavily developed.   Management has been limited to periodic netting and the last survey was 1989.  No stocking has been done. <br> \n <br> \nCurled pondweed was not abundant and grew at or near the surface on 0.5 acres, or less than 1% of the lakes\u0019 entire surface acres.  Twenty species of aquatic plants were noted in Long Lake.  Northern milfoil, muskgrass, bushy pondweed, Illinois pondweed and sago pondweed were the most common aquatic plants.  Muskgrass was the most abundant submersed aquatic plant and grew out to a depth of 16 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nFew changes have occurred in the fisheries from 1989 to 2007.  Northern pike are still extremely abundant and three times higher than the normal range for this lake class.  The average size northern pike is two pounds and anglers can expect to stay busy catching fish at this level of abundance.  Forage species such as golden shiners and yellow perch were not abundant. <br> \n <br> \nA primary management species for Long Lake is largemouth bass.  Long Lake has an excellent bass population with a wide range of sizes available to anglers including fish up to 20 inches.  Little is known about the former condition of the largemouth bass population, as 2007 was the first opportunity to sample the lake with night electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are abundant in Long Lake, but the black crappie population is low.  Few quality size bluegills can be found in Long Lake.  Only eight fish larger than seven inches were captured with trap nets; and the average size was about five inches.  The bluegills in Long Lake grow slow and reach seven inches in seven years. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included: brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye, white sucker, yellow bullhead and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nMaintaining the water quality in Long Lake should be a high priority of the county and landowners around the lake.  Some effort may be needed to identify any sources of excess phosphorus and plans developed to reduce these sources.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property will help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Also, maintaining adequate septic systems and keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake will also help reduce the amount of nutrients entering the lake, thus slowing excess algal and vegetation growth. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

A public access is owned by Haven Township and is considered as carry-in only. A standard survey was completed in 1983 to update fisheries data last collected in 1975.\n\nThe Northern Pike catch rate in 1983 (8.8/gill net) decreased from 1975 (12.0/gill net) and remained within the range of expected values for the lake class. Northern Pike ages two to eight were sampled with a strong 1978 year class. Growth was slow through age six.\n\nLargemouth Bass were sampled in average numbers. \n\nThe Bluegill catch rate in 1989 (47.2/trap net) increased from 1975 (26.5/trap net) and was within the expected range of values for the lake class.\n\nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 1989 (9.3/gill net) decreased from 1975 (41.0/gill net) and was about average for abundance. \n\nBlack Bullhead were not reported in 1975, but were present in high numbers in 1989 (96.2/trap net). Most Black Bullhead were less than six inches in length. \n\nWhite Sucker abundance was about average. \n\nOther species sampled included: Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed.\n</p>",

A public access is owned by Haven Township and is considered as carry-in only. A standard survey was completed in 1989 to update fisheries data last collected in 1983.\n\nThe Northern Pike catch rate in 1989 (29.5/gill net) was more than five times the local median and significantly higher than 1983 (8.8/gill net). The Northern Pike modal length measured females at 17 inches and males at 16 inches. Most of the Northern Pike ranged in length from 14 to 18 inches and were ages four and five. Growth of females was good for ages one to three and slow thereafter. Growth for males was good for the first two years and then slow. \n\nNo Walleyes have been stocked by the DNR and only two were sampled in the gill nets.  \n\nYellow Perch abundance was low with only one fish sampled.\n\nThe Bluegill catch rate in 1989 (22.5/trap net) decreased from 1983 (47.2/trap net) and was near the local median. Bluegill ranged in length from 3.5 to 7.7 inches with a modal length increment of 6.0 to 6.4 inches. Growth was good for the first two years and then slow thereafter. Six age groups were represented in the Bluegill sample.\n\nThe Black Bullhead catch rate decreased from 1983, but remained well above expected values for the lake class in high numbers. Black Bullhead had a modal length of 9.0 to 9.4 inches. Yellow Bullhead were first sampled in 1989 and had a modal length of 9.0 to 9.4 inches. Only two Brown Bullhead were sampled, but were in the expected range.\n\nOther species sampled included: Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed.\n</p>",
