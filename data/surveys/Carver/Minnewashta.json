In 1997 a catch and release only experimental regulation was implemented.  A public meeting held on September 15, 2005 produced no comments.  Following its expiration in 2006, the experimental regulation was converted to a special regulation.  Compared to data collected before the regulation was implemented, the largemouth bass population in Lake Minnewashta has undergone significant changes. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 special assessment resulted in 70 largemouth bass being sampled.  Two types of CPUE were calculated, fish per hour and lbs per hour.  The fish/hr value of 54.2 was the highest ever recorded.  While the lbs/hr value of 62.1 was also the highest rate sampled to date.  The total number of fish (N=70) was only the fifth highest, out of nine assessments.  Although, it is the highest value seen since 1998.   <br> \n  <br> \nThe size structure Lake Minnewashta largemouth bass displayed in the 2008 assessment remains much improved compared to pre-regulation data.  Mean length (12.1) was the fourth highest seen, again out of nine values calculated from previous assessments.  Mean weight (1.15 lbs) is the lowest recorded since 2000 (mean weight=1.03), but remains higher than the three years preceding implementation of the catch and release regulation and the two years following implementation.  RSD16=21 and RSD18=6, both are the second highest values yet found.  Lake Minnewashta largemouth bass PSD=53 in the 2008 assessment, the lowest seen since 2000 (PSD=48).  The PSD value from the 2008 assessment is still higher than any pre-regulation and the two samplings immediately after the regulation was implemented.  Overall, the size structure and abundance of largemouth bass in Minnewashta has increased.   <br> \n <br> \nGrowth of largemouth bass in Lake Minnewashta varied by age.  Age 1 and 2 fish displayed a slow growth rate compared to state wide average.  The mean length of age 3 fish suggests a slight improvement.   By age 4 growth rates improved to average.  Compared to state wide averages growth rates for age 5-9 largemouth bass remained average.       <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike were abundant in the sample but averaged only 19.5 inches in length. Only 8.5 percent of all northern pike sampled measured 25.0 inches or longer. Largemouth bass were also present in good numbers during the electrofishing sample. Average size of bass sampled was only 10.3 inches in length, but individuals up to 20.1 inches were captured. Largemouth bass 16 inches or larger made up only 6.7 percent of the total number captured. Bluegill were the most abundant of all the panfish species present in this survey. The average length of bluegill captured was only 5.8 inches in length. One out of every eight bluegills measured during this survey was 7.0 inches or larger. Black crappie are present in normal abundance, but the average size is only 7.7 inches in length.Yellow bullhead is the most abundant of the three species present, but within expected levels. Average size of yellow bullhead captured was about 10.5 inches in length.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minnewashta is a 738 acre lake with a maximum depth of 70 feet, located in Carver County.  A large regional park provides ample recreational facilities.  Two boat launches are located within the park.  Beaches provide swimming.  Picnics, volleyball and other activities are possible after purchasing a park permit.  Water quality in Lake Minnewashta is fair, compared to other West Metro lakes.  By late summer most species of fish cannot inhabit water deeper than 14 feet for extended periods of time.  Anglers should keep this in mind when pursuing largemouth bass and northern pike.  Fishing in water deeper than 14 feet in mid to late summer could yield very few fish.  Boaters should also keep in mind that new state laws require the drain plug be removed while traveling on public roadways.  A catch-and-release only regulation for largemouth bass is in effect on Lake Minnewashta.        <br> \n <br> \nThe predator community in Lake Minnewashta reflects a natural state.  No stocking occurs.  Northern pike numbers were high compared to historic averages for Lake Minnewashta.  Average length was 21.9 inches.  The 2011 population assessment suggests largemouth bass abundance decreased compared to past surveys, but remains about? average for lakes similar to Minnewashta.  Average length was 17.3 inches.  Standard lake survey gear does not consistently provide an accurate estimate of largemouth bass abundance.   <br> \n <br> \nSix species of panfish are present in Lake Minnewashta.  Black crappie abundance is average.  Very few large fish were sampled. Average length was 7.2 inches. Bluegill abundance increased compared to the 2007 survey, but stayed within the historic range for this lake.  Average weight also increased.  Fully 50% of sampled bluegill were greater than 6 inches.  Less than 1% were 8 inches or larger.  Yellow perch abundance is below average compared to other lakes.  Looking at past sampling in Lake Minnewashta, the 2011 survey found the highest abundance ever.  Mean weight of yellow perch was below average. Average length was 6.5 inches.  Pumpkinseed were sampled at a below average abundance.  Hybrid and green sunfish were also sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nOverall, rough fish are present in low numbers.   No common carp were sampled.  Black bullhead were also sampled at very low abundance.  Yellow bullhead were sampled at above average abundance.  White sucker abundance was very low.  All rough fish abundances were typical for Lake Minnewashta. <br> \n</p>",

The east and northeast shorelines are part of the Lake Minnewashta Regional Park operated by Carver County Parks.  Boat access in obtained by the two concrete launches located within the park.  Lake Minnewashta is primarily managed for largemouth bass and northern pike and secondarily for bluegill and is currently (as of 2008) under a catch-and-release only regulation for largemouth bass.    <br> \n <br> \nLake Minnewashta has one of the highest northern pike densities in the West Metro Area.  Pike were sampled at a rate of 14.8/gill net; although, catch was down from 2001 when the gill net catch rate was 18.6/gill net.  Because of the high abundance, average size of northern pike was relatively small.  In the gill nets, mean length and weight were 21.2 inches and 1.9 pounds. The largest measured was 32.1 inches and 7.1 pounds.  Mean length and weight seemed to have remained constant over the past 6 years, as both are similar to the previous assessment.  Approximately 53% of northern pike sampled were 21 inches or longer and 5% were 28 inches or larger.  Growth was slow for all ages classes compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area. <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gear, such as trap nets and gill nets, is not an effective method for collecting a sample of largemouth bass, so the data collected for largemouth bass is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method used for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  However, 7 largemouth bass were collected ranging in size from 6.0 to 18.3 inches and weighing 1.5 to 3.5 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nLake Minnewashta has a high density, slow-growing bluegill population with a small size structure.  Bluegill were sampled at a rate of 49.3/trap net and 23.9/gill net.  Trap net catch was higher than the previous assessment in 2001 (23.4/net), but gill net catch was similar (23.1/net).  Mean length and weight were 5.7 inches and 0.1 pounds, although the largest bluegill measured was 8.5 inches and 0.4 pounds.  Mean size appears to be somewhat smaller compared to previous surveys including in 2001 when bluegill averaged approximately 6.6 inches.  Approximately 39% of bluegill were 6 inches or longer and 1% were 8 inches or longer.  Growth was slower than average for similar lakes in the West Metro Area.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers appear to be up from 2001 when both gill net and trap net catches were low.  In the current survey, black crappie were moderately abundant in gill nets at 9.5 per net, and trap net catch was low.  Mean length and weight of fish from both trap and gill nets was 7.1 inches and 0.2 pounds and the largest black crappie measured was 12.2 inches and 1.0 pound.  Approximately 33% of black crappie sampled were 8 inches or longer and 2% were 10 inches or longer.  Growth was slower than average for similar lakes in the West Metro Area.   <br> \n <br> \nOther panfish that were collected in low abundance were hybrid sunfish (1.25/trap net), pumpkinseed (0.83/trap net), and green sunfish (0.08/trap net).  Yellow bullhead were captured at a rate of 6.2 per gill net and 0.8/trap net and averaged 10.7 inches and 0.7 pounds.  Other rough fish were captured in low abundance and included black bullhead (0.25/gill net), white sucker (0.08/gill net), and common carp (0.08/gill net, 0.08/trap net).     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike are the predominant predator species in Lake Minnewashta.  The population abundance is well above average for this type of lake.  The average length and weight of sampled northern pike was 21.1 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Only 13.3% of the northern pike captured were larger than 25 inches.  The largest individual measured was 33.4 inches in length.Largemouth bass were sampled with relatively good abundance levels and with above average size during spring electrofishing on this lake.  Mean largemouth bass length was measured at 14.2 inches while mean weight was 1.7 pounds.  In addition, 27.3% and 15.2% of bass sampled during this survey were over 16.0 and 18.0 inches, respectively.  The largest individual fish was 20.4 inches long.  All of these measures of bass size were the highest recorded since special sampling began on Lake Minnewashta in 1994.  A bass catch and release only regulation is in effect on Lake Minnewashta until March 1, 2006.The bluegill population is very abundant in Lake Minnewashta, although the number of fish sampled has decreased substantially compared to previous lake surveys on this lake.  Average size has also decreased slightly from previous surveys.  The average length and weight for sampled bluegill were 6.3 inches and 0.2 pounds for all gear types combined.  Sixty-eight percent of bluegill sampled were over 6.0 inches in length while 25.7% were greater than 7.0 inches.  Only 2% were greater than 8.0 inches in length.Black crappies were found to be below average in abundance for this type of lake.  They had an average length and weight of 7.0 inches and 0.21 pounds.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish are also present in the lake but at fairly low abundance levels.  Pumpkinseed sunfish averaged only 4.6 inches and 0.1 pound, while hybrid sunfish had a mean length of 6.7 inches and weighed 0.27 pounds per fish on averageTwo large walleye were also sampled during the survey.  These fish were both above average in size, weighing an average of 5.7 pounds and measuring 22.0 and 26.9 inches in length, respectively.  These fish are probably originating from Lake Virginia through a connected channel, or may be reproducing naturally in Lake Minnewashta.  Walleyes have not been stocked in the lake by the DNR since 1968.Black, brown, and yellow bullheads were each caught during this survey but at very low abundance levels.  Black and yellow bullhead each averaged 0.65 pounds and ranged in length from 6.5 to 13.5 inches.  Common carp and bowfin (dogfish) are also present. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minnewashta (DOW 10-0009-00) is a 738-acre, Class 24 Lake with a maximum depth of 70 feet. It is located in northeast Carver County in the City of Chanhassen. There are two boat launches located within a Carver County regional park. A fishing pier and short reach of shore access are available at City of Chanhassen's Roundhouse Park, on the lake's west shore. <br> \n <br> \nLake Minnewashta is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass (Special Regulation: catch-and-release-only) and Northern Pike. Lake Minnewashta supports additional game species, including Bluegill and Black Crappie. A standard survey (11 trap nets/9 gill nets) was conducted on Lake Minnewashta during the week of 7/13/16 to monitor water characteristics and fish populations. Lake Minnewashta is a productive eutrophic lake. Water clarity was 5 feet, with overall water color brown-green during the 2016 survey. Dissolved oxygen fell to zero parts per million at depths greater than 18 feet. The Lake Minnewashta Park beach was closed for a period in late September 2016 because of high E. coli bacteria levels. Zebra mussels were first discovered in Lake Minnewashta during summer 2016. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass in Lake Minnewashta have been managed under a Special Regulation-catch-and-release-only- since 1997.  Nighttime boat electrofishing sampled Largemouth Bass at a rate of 78.2/hour. The 2016 catch rate was the highest recorded on Lake Minnewashta, and more than double the previous high catch rate of 31.4/hour. A total of 189 bass were sampled during electrofishing, with an average length of 10.5 inches and the largest measured at 20.1 inches. Despite high abundance, body condition was good. Largemouth Bass reached 9.3 inches by age 3, indicating average growth when compared to the statewide Lake-Class average. Results from a 2015 voluntary creel survey found about 50 percent of angler caught bass were greater than 15 inches, while 1 percent of bass were greater than 20 inches. As of the 2016 survey results, Largemouth Bass populations were near long-range management goals and will continue to be managed under the Special Regulation. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike in Lake Minnewashta were very abundant, with gill nets catches (11.7/net) well above the expected rate. Northern Pike average length was 22.8 inches, with a maximum length of 31.7 inches. When compared to other lakes across the state, growth rates were above average, with an average length of 21.4 inches at age 3. Body condition was on the low end of the normal range. An abundance of spawning habitat in Lake Minnewashta allows Northern Pike to consistently reproduce, shown by 9 consecutive year classes recorded in age analysis. Results from the 2016 Lake Minnewashta survey show Northern Pike exceeding management goals by most measures. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill in Lake Minnewashta were abundant, with trap net catches (36.9/net) well above catch rates of similar lakes across the state. Bluegill were also sampled in unusually high numbers in gill nets (22.8/net), suggesting Bluegill are moving offshore during summer. Combining trap net and gill net catches, 583 total fish were caught; average length was 5.7 inches, with the largest measured at 7.9 inches. The 2016 survey results describe a population skewed toward small individuals. Despite high numbers of small fish, body condition was good. Bluegill growth was moderate, with an average length of 5.2 inches by age 3. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets (14.9/net) and trap nets (4.6/net), typical catch rates compared to similar lakes across Minnesota. Although Black Crappie catch rates in Lake Minnewashta were average compared to similar lakes, the 2016 catch values were the highest recorded on Lake Minnewashta. Combining trap net and gill net catches, 174 total fish were caught; average length was 7.0 inches with the largest measured at 12.4 inches. Body condition of Black Crappie was good; growth rates were normal compared to the statewide average, with an average length of 6.0 inches by age 3. Despite a high percentage of small fish in the catch, Lake Minnewashta has the potential to produce crappie greater than 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Walleye, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Minnewashta Lake was conducted on August 30th thru September 1st, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 14 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at five stations. Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Iowa Darter) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill were most abundant by number (average size was 5.4 inches and 16% were 7 inches or larger) and Bluegill, Common Carp, and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the trap net catch by biomass.   <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from July 13th, 2016 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey provides supporting evidence that the fish community in Minnewashta Lake is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score just below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Twin Cities Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
