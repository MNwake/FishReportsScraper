The steep access is located on State Forest lands, however, most of the shoreline is private.   <br> \n <br> \nA survey of the fish community was conducted in late July and early August 2017 with one gill net and five trap net sets.  Only four species were captured in the survey: bluegills, northern pike, black crappies, and one golden shiner.  Bluegills were the most abundant species in both net types.  The bluegills were rather small with an average length of 4.5 inches in the gill net catch and 4.3 inches in the trap net catch.  The largest bluegill captured was 6.5 inches long.  The northern pike ranged from 17.7 to 23.2 inches long.  The few black crappies ranged in length from 6.9 to 11.6 inches.   <br> \n</p>",
