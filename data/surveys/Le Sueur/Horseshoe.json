                "narrative": "<p>\tHorseshoe Lake in LeSueur County is a 393 acre lake north of Waterville. A DNR owned public access is located on the south shore off LeSueur County road 14. A fish survey was conducted the week of June 23rd, 2008 to monitor the fish community in Horseshoe Lake. <br> \n\tBlack crappies were the most numerous fish in the assessment for both trap and gill net catches. Black crappies ranged between 5 and 8 inches. Black crappies were captured at a rate of 14.5 fish per gill net and 17.8 fish per trap net. Bluegills were trap netted at a rate of 7.4 fish per net. Bluegill averaged (mean) 5 inches in length.  <br> \n\tNine walleye were captured in the combined gears, ranging in length from 18 to 20 inches. Walleye abundance was in the normal range for this lake type. Walleye captured were stocked fish from 2001 that followed a winterkill event in the winter of 2000-2001. <br> \n\tNorthern pike abundance dropped from the 2003 survey of 20 fish to the 2008 survey of 6.3 fish per gill net lift. Still, northern pike are present in good numbers; pike ranged from 19 to 37 inches with an average length of 24 inches.  <br> \n\tYellow perch are present in modest numbers. Perch ranging from 5 to 8 inches were gill netted at a rate of 8.8 fish per lift. Other fish sampled include bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, common carp, freshwater drum, golden shiner, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n\tAn Aquatic Management Area (AMA) exists on the lake's north side to protect shoreline habitat, maintain water quality and provide fishing and hunting opportunities. Another AMA was recently acquired on the lake's west side. For more information about the Horseshoe Lake AMAs, contact the Waterville Area Fisheries Office. <br> \n\tAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Horseshoe Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n\tShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. <br> \n\tShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

Horseshoe Lake had low oxygen conditions in the winter of 2000 to 2001 that resulted in some winterkill of fish.  A fishery survey was conducted in 2003 to monitor the fish community and habitat in Horseshoe Lake.  Northern pike are abundant in Horseshoe Lake and should provide excellent angling.  Most were around 20 to 30 inches in length.  Some walleye are present and were around 13 inches in length.  Black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch are present in moderate numbers.  Panfish populations are recovering from the winterkill and may provide increasing angling opportunities in the next few years.  Black bullhead are abundant, although most fish were around only 4 to 5 inches long.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is a 393 acre lake located in Le Sueur County northeast of the city of Waterville.  A DNR owned public access is located on the south side of the lake off County Road 10.  Horseshoe Lake has a maximum depth of 26 feet and consists of a shallower northern basin and deeper southern basin.    <br> \n <br> \nHorseshoe Lake was surveyed the week of July 1, 2013 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR.  This survey consisted of deploying trap and gill nets to monitor the fish community.  Black bullhead was the most abundant fish species observed in this survey, with a total of 307 fish caught among all nets.  Black bullhead total lengths ranged from 5.0 to 15.0 inches and averaged nearly 9.0 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates in the 2013 survey were 8.0 fish/gill net and 1.5 fish/trap net.  Overall, the total length of black crappie averaged 6.0 inches and ranged from 4.0 to 10.0 inches.  Bluegill abundance was moderate at the time of this survey, with trap nets sampling 25.0 fish/ trap net.  The average length of bluegill from trap nets was 5.0 inches, with the largest fish nearly 10.0 inches.  Yellow perch abundance in Horseshoe Lake was relatively high in 2013, with a gill net catch rate of nearly 40.0 fish/gill net.  The average length of yellow perch from gill nets was over 6.0 inches and the largest fish sampled was nearly 11.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nHorseshoe Lake continues to offer a quality northern pike and walleye fishery.  Gill net catch rates were over 5.0 northern pike/net.  Northern pike from gill nets averaged nearly 24.0 inches in length and ranged from 18.0 to 30.0 inches, with an average weight of 3.2 pounds.  Walleye abundance was very strong during the 2013 survey.  Gill nets catch rates averaged 9.5 walleye/gill net, which is above average for similar lakes in the area.  The average length of walleye from gill nets was over 18.0 inches, ranging from 15.0 to 22.0 inches.  Walleye fry are stocked in Horseshoe Lake two of every three years.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were scarce during this survey, with only 2 fish collected overall.  However, largemouth bass are not effectively sampled with the gear types used in this survey so this is not a good representation of the largemouth population in Horseshoe Lake.  Spring electrofishing would be the preferred method to assess the largemouth bass population in Horseshoe Lake; however, electrofishing was not conducted in 2013.  Other fish species collected in low numbers included freshwater drum, common carp, yellow bullhead, and green sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Prepared by:  Kip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is a 393-acre lake located in Le Sueur County northeast of the city of Waterville.  A DNR owned public access is located on the south side of the lake off County Road 10.  Horseshoe Lake has a maximum depth of 26 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was performed the week of June 25, 2018 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR.  A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). This survey consisted of deploying trap and gill nets to monitor the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nHorseshoe Lake has been designated a Tier-2 lake and will be surveyed every 6 years, including: spring day electrofishing to assess the Largemouth Bass population, gill nets and trap nets to assess the fish community for size structure and abundance . <br> \n <br> \nHorseshoe Lake has historically produced moderate quality Black Crappies. Since 1983, Black Crappie relative abundance has varied from 0.6/trap net in 1990 to 63.7/trap net in 1988. The trap net catch rate for Black Crappie in 2018 of 7.1 is what we would expect for lakes similar to Horseshoe, which was an increase from 2013 (1.5/trap net) and was slightly above the average for similar lakes (5.5/trap net). Black Crappies were also sampled very effectively with gill nets, and were captured at a rate of 20.0/gill net, which was higher than what we would expect for lakes similar to Horseshoe Lake (17.5/gill net). Black Crappie size structure was small, indicative of a sample dominated by young fish (2015-2017 year classes). Black Crappie ranged from 4.3 to 11.5 inches and averaged 8.1 inches in trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill relative abundance has been variable in Horseshoe Lake ranging from 1.3/trap net in 1983 to 60.4/trap net in 1993.  Bluegills were sampled at a rate of 19.6/trap net in 2018, which was lower than in 2013 (24.9/trap net) and slightly above the average (15.9/trap net) for lakes similar to Horseshoe Lake. Bluegills ranged from 2.8 to 9.4 inches in length and averaged 7.4 inches in 2018 compared to 4.9 inches in 2013. Six year classes of Bluegill were sampled in 201 (2012-2017). The majority of Bluegills aged (81%) were from the 2014-2015 year classes (ages 3-4). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates decreased from the 2013 survey from 9.5/gill net to 4.5/gill net in 2018, but still was within the long term range of catch rates (0 to 9.5/gill net). Seven year classes of Walleye were present (2009-2011, and 2013-2016). Walleyes ranged from 14.7 to 26.3 inches and averaged 21.6 inches in gill nets. Walleye growth was fast in Horseshoe Lake as fish averaged 13.7 inches at age-2 and 19.5 inches at age-4. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are secondary management species on Horseshoe Lake and were assessed using day-time electrofishing in 2018. Previous to 2018 Largemouth Bass abundance was only assessed using standard trap netting. We caught 39.7 Largemouth Bass per hour of electrofishing. The average length of Largemouth Bass sampled in 2018 was 12.2 inches and ranged from 4.9 to 19.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch rates have historically been stable in Horseshoe Lake, gill net catch rates ranged from 0.7/gill net in 1996 to 20.0 in 2003 which was more than triple the next highest catch rate since 1983. The 2018 catch rate was 5.5/gill net, which was above average (4.7/gill net) for Horseshoe Lake. Northern Pike sampled with gill nets ranged from 16.2 to 32.4 inches in length and averaged 23.8 inches. Fifty-two percent of Northern Pike sampled were greater than the 24-inch minimum length limit. Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations are in effect for Horseshoe Lake. Anglers are allowed 2 fish per day and all fish under 24 inches must be immediately released. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Yellow Perch catch rate (28.5/gill net) decreased from 2013 (39.9/gill net) but was still high. Yellow Perch exhibited small size structure, with only one fish exceeding 10.0 inches. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 4.4 to 10.6 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBoth Black and Yellow Bullheads were present in the 2018 sample.  Combined bullheads had a catch rate of 15.3/gillnet.  Bullhead size ranged from 5.4 inches to 15.9 inches and averaged nearly 12 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in low numbers included: Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Bowfin (dogfish), Bigmouth Buffalo, and Golden Shiner. <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, specialist <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

TO BOLSTER THE PANFISH COMMUNITY, 11.75 LB./ACRE OF ADULT BLG AND BLC, AGED AT 3 AND 4, WERE STOCKED IN THE FALL OF 1990.  THIS POPULATION ASSESSMENT WAS DONE TO DETERMINE THE CONTRIBUTION AND GROWTH RATE OF STOCKED CRAPPIE AND BLG.  BLG INCREASED FROM 6.80/ TRAP NET IN 1990 TO 17.75/TRAP NET.  BLG WERE DOMINATED BY YEARLINGS WITH FEWER 3 YEAR OLDS IN THAN IN 1990.  AGES 1-5 WERE SAMPLED WITH AGES 2-4 MOST ABUNDANT.  THE INCREASED NET CATCH AND DIFFERENT AGE CLASSES PRESENT INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION FROM STOCKED BLG.  GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR BLG IN 1990 COMPARED TO NOW WITH FAST GROWTH EXHIBITED BY AGES 1-4.  BLC WERE SCARCE IN 1990 WITH ONLY 3 FISH SAMPLED.  BLC NOW AVERAGE 3.50/TRAP NET AND ARE REPRESENTED BY AGES 3 AND 4.  GROWTH IS SLOW FOR CRAPPIE WHICH REFLECTS SLOW GROWTH BEFORE THEY WERE STOCKED. CRAPPIE AGED IN 1990 EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  IT IS APPARENT THAT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CRAPPIES SAMPLED WERE FROM STOCKING IN 1990.  WAE AVERAGED 1.50/TRAP NET AND ARE DOMINATED BY AGE 2 FISH WITH ONE 3 YEAR OLD SAMPLED.  WAE FRY WERE STOCKED IN 1989.  WAE SEEM TO BE GROWING AT AN AVERAGE RATE, 9.6 INCHES AT AGE 2.  BLB ARE ABUNDANT AVERAGING 321.25/TRAP NET COMPARED TO 218.00/TRAP NET IN 1990.  BLBS WERE REPRESENTED BY 4.5-10.9 INCH FISH WITH 7.5-8.4 INCH FISH MOST ABUNDANT.  THE OLDER 9.4-11.4 INCH BLHS THAT DOMINATED THE CATCH IN 1990 APPEAR TO HAVE DIED OFF.  CAP WERE NOT SAMPLED IN 1990 AND NOW AVERAGE 11.00/TRAP NET. WITH THE LARGE SIZE PRESENT 12.0-25.9 INCHES IT IS SUSPECTED THAT CAP MIGRATED INTO HORSESHOE LAKE RECENTLY.

THE POPULATION IS MADE UP OF MORE YOUNGER FISH, THE 1985 AND 1984 YEAR CLASSES, WITH FAIR NUMBERS OF THE 1983 AND 1982 YEAR CLASSES PERSENT. THE NUMBER PER TRAPNET SET (8.80) WAS ABOUT ONE-HALF THE LOCAL MEDIAN (15.0/TRAPNET) BUT ABOUT THREE TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN (2.67/TRAPNET) AND ABOUT FIVE TIMES LESS THAN THE CATCH PER NET (41.17/TRAPNET) IN THE 1983 SURVEY. THE MODAL LENGTH WAS 7.5 INCHES TO 7.9 INCHES, WITH GROWTH AVERAGE TO A LITTLE ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THIS AREA. THE WHITE CRAPPIE POPULATION IS MADE UP OF FISH WITH A MODAL LENGTH OF 7.5 INCHES TO 7.9 INCHES WITH MOST OF THE REMAINDER OF THE POPULATION LESS THAN THIS LENGTH. MOST OF THE WHITE CRAPPIES WERE CAUGHT IN GILLNETS WITH 5.25 PER SET WHICH IS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN (5.00/GILLNET) AND LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT WAS CAUGHT PER SET IN 1983 (12.86/GILLNET). ALL OF THE WHITE CRAPPIE CAUGHT WERE FROM THE 1985 AND 1984 YEAR CLASSES. WHICH HAS AVERAGE GROWTH. THE BLUEGILL POPULATION HAS A MODAL LENGTH OF 6.5 INCHES TO 6.9 INCHES, WHICH IS VERY ACCEPTABLE TO THE ANGLER. THE NUMBER OF FISH  CAUGHT PER SET (8.00/TRAPNET) WAS BELOW BOTH THE STATE (11.67/TRAPNET) AND LOCAL (15.91/TRAPNET) MEDIANS, BUT EIGHT TIMES LARGER THAN IN THE 1983 SURVEY (1.33/TRAPNET). THE AGE DISTRIBUTION WAS VERY GOOD WITH FISH SHOWING UP IN ALL YEAR CLASSES FROM THE 1979 YEAR CLASS TO THE 1984 YEAR CLASS. GROWTH WAS A LITTLE BELOW AVERAGE BUT STILL SATISFACTORY. THE YELLOW PERCH POPULA- TION HAS A MODAL LENGTH OF 8.5 INCHES TO 8.9 IN. WITH FAIR NUMBERS BELOW THIS LENGTH. THE 8.5 INCH FISH ARE VERY ACCEPTABLE TO THE ANGLER. THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE AT 32/GILLNET IS ABOUT FOUR TIMES LOCAL (8.83/GILLNET) AND STATEWIDE (8.00/ GILLNET) MEDIANS, BUT ABOUT ONE-HALF OF THE CATCH/ GILLNET IN 1983 (71.57). THE CATCH WAS MAINLY MADE UP OF NORTHERN PIKE (3) WALLEYES (7) MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE ABOVE AVERAGE NUMBERS OF PERCH PER SET CAUGHT. THE BLACK BULLHEAD POPULATION STILL SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY HIGH, BUT ALL BULLHEADS CAUGHT WERE OF A SIZE THAT WOULD BE DESIRABLE TO THE ANGLER. THE FRESHWATER DRUM WERE CAUGHT IN FAIRLY HIGH NUMBERS AND COULD BE UTILIZED COMMERCIALLY. ON A WHOLE, THE NUMBERS OF FISH CAUGHT PER SET IN 1986 WERE LOWER THAN THE NUMBERS CAUGHT PER SET IN 1984 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE BLUEGILLS. EVEN WITH THE LOW NUMBERS OF FISH CAUGHT, FISHING ON THE LAKE SEEMS TO HAVE IMPROVED WITH REPORTS OF FAIR NUM- BERS OF CRAPPIES, PERCH, AND NORTHERN PIKE BEING CAUGHT.</p>",

THE MODAL AGE OF 3 IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 1990 POPULATION ASSESSMENT, AND WITH THE POST-WINTER KILL COHORT EXPECTED FROM THE ADULT BLG STOCKED IN THE SPRING OF 1989.  GROWTH FOR AGES 1-3 IS SLOWER THAN THAT MEASURED IN THE 1991 SAMPLE, BUT IS STILL ABOVE THE STATE AVERAGE FOR ALL AGES SAMPLED.  BLC TRAP NET INCREASED FROM 3.50/NET IN 1991 TO 10.25/NET. THIS IS WITHIN THE INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR CLASS 32 LAKES.  A WIDER LENGTH RANGE WAS REPRESENTED THIS YEAR, WITH BLC RANGING FROM 6.0-9.4 COMPARED TO A RANGE OF 6.5-7.9 IN 1991.  IN 1991, ONLY AGES 3 AND 4 BLC WERE SAMPLED.  IN 1992, A WIDER RANGE OF AGES, 2-6, WERE SAMPLED.  GROWTH IS SLOWER THAN AVERAGE AFTER AGE 2.  PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS MENTION SLOW GROWTH FOR 1990 STOCKED BLC.  THIS IS BORNE OUT BY THE BACK-CALCULATED LENGTHS OF EACH SEPARATE YEAR CLASS.  THE AGE 2 LENGTH OF THE 1987 YEAR CLASS, 3.56 INCH SHORTER THAN THAT OF THE 1988 YEAR CLASS (4.56 INCHES), AND SHORTER STILL THAN THE AGE 2 LENGTHS OF THE 1989 (5.29 CLASSES.  THE 1987 YEAR CLASS WAS ALSO MUCH SHORTER THAN THE 1988 YEAR CLASS AT AGES 3 AND 4. ONLY 3 WAE WERE SAMPLED, BUT THIS WAS SUFFICIENT TO PLACE THE GILL NET CATCH OF 1.00/NET WITHIN THE INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR CLASS 32 LAKES.  THE WAE ARE AGES 3 AND 6, WITH THE AGE 3 FISH MATCHING A 1989 FRY STOCKING.  GROWTH IS NEAR THE STATE AVERAGE.  NOP, NOT CAPTURED IN EITHER THE 1990 OR 1991 ASSESSMENTS, WERE CAUGHT AT 1.50/GILL NET AND 0.75/TRAP NET.  THESE RATES ARE BELOW AND WITHIN THE RESPECTIVE INTERQUARTILE RANGES FOR CLASS 32 LAKES, AND CLOSE TO THE 1988 SURVEY CATCHES OF 2.00/GILL NET AND 1.00/TRAP NET.  THE 1986 YEAR CLASS, WHICH DOMINATED THE 1988 SURVEY AS 2 YEAR OLDS, REPRESENTED 1/3 OF THE 1992 NOP CATCH AS AGE 6 FISH.  AGES 2 AND 3 NOP WERE ALSO CAPTURED.  THE PRESENCE OF THESE AGES INDICATES THE OCCURRENCE OF NOP NATURAL REPRODUCTION, SINCE STOCKED NOP HAVE ALL BEEN ADULTS THAT WOULD BE OLDER THAN AGE 3.  GROWTH IS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR ALL AGES.  YEP CATCH HAS INCREASED FROM 1990 AND 1991.  GILL NET CATCH IN 1992 WAS 8.50/NET; WITHIN THE INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR CLASS 32 LAKES.  LENGTH RANGE WAS LITTLE CHANGED FROM 1991 (6.5-10.4 5.5-1.4 DOMINATING THE CATCH.  GROWTH CONTINUES TO BE ABOVE AVERAGE FOR ALL AGES SAMPLED.  PMK, NOT SAMPLED SINCE THE 1988 SURVEY, WERE CAPTURED AT 1.25/TRAP NET WITHIN THE INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS.  TRAP NET CATCH OF BLB DECLINED TO 30.50/NET FROM THE 321.25/NET OF 1991.  THIS CATCH AND THE 229.50/GILL NET ARE IN THE UPPER QUARTILE FOR CLASS 32 LAKES.  THE 4.0-7.4 RANGE IS MORE COMPRESSED THAN THE 1991 RANGE OF 4.5-10.9 SMALLER LENGTH CLASSES DOMINATE EACH YEAR, WITH FISH 5.5-6.4 DECREASED TO 1.25/TRAP NET, FROM 11.00/TRAP NET IN 1991.  AS IN 1991, NO SMALL CAP (<13.0 WERE SAMPLED.  OTHER SPECIES SAMPLED WERE FRD AND BIB.</p>",

The abundance of walleye and northern pike remains low, but similar to previous assessments.       Aquatic vegetation was abundant in 1998, with moderate stands of coontail, Canada waterweed and curled pondweed present.  </p>",

Black crappie are present, but in smaller numbers and smaller size, with most fish 6.0-7.5 inches in length. Walleye and northern pike numbers are both low, but the few fish present are of acceptable size.  Walleyes are between 14-16 inches and northern pike are around 20 inches in length.  Black bullhead numbers are up from previous surveys, with most fish  between 6.5 and 8.0 inches.Water quality during the summer of 1993 was good.  A secchi disc reading of 3 feet indicated low algae abundance and good water clarity.  The abundance of Canada waterweed throughout the lake to depths of more than 4 feet was another indication of better-than-average water clarity.</p>",
