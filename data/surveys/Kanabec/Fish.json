                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 502 acre impoundment of the Ann River. The lake has a maximum depth of 8 feet and typically has low water clarity. Aquatic vegetation is abundant in shallow areas. It is assigned to lake class 42. Fish Lake is managed primarily for Walleye with Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike as secondary species. It has been stocked with 502,000 Walleye fry annually. A survey of the fish community was conducted in July 2017. The previous survey occurred in 2012.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate was 5.5 fish per net which is within the interquartile range for the lake class and similar to the historic catch for the lake. Mean weight was 3 lbs. and also within the interquartile range for the lake class. This was slightly larger than the previous survey but still typical compared to historic catches. Pike ranged from 19 to 35.9 inches in length and averaged 23.7 inches. Growth was unremarkable with fish representing each year class from 2009 to 2014. The largest fish was aged from the 2006 year class and was 11 years old when captured. The long range goal of five fish per net is currently being exceeded but not by a substantial amount. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled Walleye at a rate of 1.5 fish per net. This is lower than the last couple of surveys but still within the interquartile range for the lake class. Mean weight was above the lake class median at 1.8 lbs. which is the same as the previous two surveys. Fish ranged from 14.6 to 24.8 inches and averaged 17.1 inches in length. The majority of the fish aged were from the 2013 year class with two from the 2014 year class and the largest individual from the 2008 year class. These ages all correspond to stocked year classes indicating natural reproduction is unlikely to occur. Considering the sizes that these relatively young fish have reached, growth is fairly fast. The long range catch rate goal of five fish per net is a long way off and has not been met since 1982. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch in trap nets was low with 1.25 per net and equal to the previous survey. This is well below the first quartile for the lake class. Crappie catch in trap nets has historically been fairly low in this lake. Mean weight was improved to 0.38 lbs. which exceeds the third quartile for the lake class. The catch rate in gill nets decreased significantly from the previous two surveys with 9.6 fish per net but was still above the median for the lake class. Mean length was 7 inches in gill nets and 8.5 inches in trap nets with the largest fish measuring 10.8 inches. Although occasionally abundant in the past, only four White Crappies were sampled in this survey.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate was 12.3 fish per net. This was similar to historical catches and slightly above the median catch for the lake class. Mean weight was also typical for the lake class and historical surveys. Fish ranged from 3.5 to 9.2 inches and averaged 6.1 inches in length. Fish were fairly well distributed throughout this size range with 14 percent of fish exceeding 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 7.6 fish per net. This is approximately the median rate for the lake class. While it is a substantial decrease from the rate of 14.8 fish per net in the previous survey, it is still fairly high when compared to historical catches. Fish were not particularly large averaging 0.16 lbs. but several individuals exceeding 9 inches were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish provide an angling opportunity which is unique for a lake in this area. Gill nets sampled them at a rate of 4.6 fish per net. There are no catfish catch quartiles for this lake class but this rate is the highest of all previous surveys and more than twice as high as the previous survey. Mean weight was 3.9 pounds and mean length was 20.7 inches. Fish ranged from 12.7 to 32.1 inches in length. Fish were well distributed through this range indicating consistent recruitment and the potential for large fish production.  <br> \n <br> \nNo Largemouth Bass were sampled in this survey but they are not reliably sampled with nets and electrofishing was not conducted. Other species sampled were; Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, Freshwater Drum, Golden Redhorse, Greater Redhorse, Shorthead Redhorse, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Common Carp, and Chestnut Lamprey.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  Fish Lake was surveyed on July 27-30, 1992 utilizing four gillnets, six trapnets, and three shoreline seine hauls.  Based on fish samples collected using these methods, the present fish population of Fish Lake was evaluated through comparisons with previous Fish Lake investigations and statewide lake class medians (lake class 42).  In addition, fish samples were sent to the water chemistry lab for contaminant analysis.  These results will be available after June 1993 in the Minnesota Fish Consumption Advisory, Minnesota Department of Health. \n  The northern pike gillnet catch (0.50/set) was the lowest ever recorded by DNR personnel on Fish Lake dating back to 1950.  This catch was a significant decrease from the 1987 population assessment catch of 1.00/set and below the first quartile (1.00/set) when compared to the lake class median.  The three northern pike captured ranged from 20.0-33.9 inches in length and had a mean weight of 2.05 pounds which is considered normal when compared to the mean of 1.95 pounds for this lake class.  Back-calculated age data determined from scale samples indicated that captured northern pike were either four or seven years old and displayed normal growth relative to the statewide growth rate for the species.\n  The walleye gillnet catch (1.25/set) decreased significantly from the 1987 catch of 4.50/set but was normal when compared to the lake class median of 4.33/set.  The captured walleye ranged from 9.5-17.9 inches in length and had a mean weight of 0.98 pounds which is normal when compared to the lake class mean of 1.26 pounds.  Back-calculated age data determined from scale and spine samples indicated that the captured walleye ranged from two to five years of age and displayed normal growth compared to the statewide growth rate.  The walleye population is composed of both stocked and natural reproduction within Fish Lake and adjoining Ann and Snake Rivers. \n  The channel catfish gillnet catch (3.75/set) was the highest ever recorded by DNR personnel on Fish Lake, dating back to 1950, and a major increase from the 1987 catch of 1.00/set.  The channel catfish captured ranged from 18.0-23.9 inches in length and with a mean weight of 2.67 pounds.  Back-calculated age data obtained from spine samples indicated that captured fish ranged from four to seven years of age with nearly 50% of the fish being six years old.  The growth of channel catfish in Fish Lake is very near the norm for channel catfish in the Snake River watershed.  \n  The bluegill trapnet catch (3.33/set) is the lowest ever recorded by DNR personnel on Fish Lake dating back to 1963, but is normal when compared to the lake class median of 8.80/set.  Captured bluegill ranged from 3.5-7.9 inches in length with a median length group of 7.0-7.5.  The mean weight of captured bluegill was 0.26 pounds which is normal in reference to the lake class mean of 0.24 pounds.  Back-calculated age data determined from scale samples indicated that captured bluegill ranged from two to five years of age with more than half being four years old.  Growth was fast until age four when it decreased to normal.  Shoreline seine hauls captured 524 young of the year bluegill.\n  The white crappie gillnet catch (2.50/set) is down from the 1987 catch of 4.25/set but normal when compared to the lake class median of 0.75/set.  Captured white crappie ranged from 7.5-9.4 inches in length and had a mean weight of 0.20 pounds which is normal with reference to the lake class mean of 0.25 pounds.  Back-calculated age data obtained from scale samples indicated that captured white crappie ranged from two to four years of age with more than half being three years old.  No white crappie were captured in the shoreline seine hauls.\n  The black crappie trapnet catch (3.33/set) is down from the 1987 catch of 20.33/ set but is normal when compared to the lake class median of 8.08/set.  Captured black crappie ranged in length from 4.5-11.4 inches and had a median length group of 9.5-9.9 inches.  The mean weight of captured black crappie (0.51 pounds) is above the third quartile of 0.34 pounds.  Back-calculated age data based on scale samples indicated that captured black crappie ranged from two to seven years of age with nearly half being five years old.  Growth was normal compared to the statewide rate.  The shoreline seine hauls captured 157 young of the year black crappie.\n  The yellow perch gillnet catch (3.00/set) showed a significant increase from the 1987 catch of 1.25/set but is below the first quartile of 3.50/set.  Captured yellow perch ranged from 7.0-9.4 inches in length with a mean weight of 0.14 pounds which is normal based on the lake class mean of 0.20 pounds.  Back-calculated age data from scale samples indicated that captured yellow perch ranged from three to six years of age with normal growth compared to the statewide rate.  The shoreline seine hauls captured 213 yellow perch.\n  Nine other species (common carp, golden shiner, white sucker, silver redhorse, shorthead redhorse, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, white bass, and freshwater drum) were sampled during the survey.  All had normal catch rates except white sucker (20.75/set) and black bullhead (4.75/set) which were respectively above and below their quartile ranges for the lake class.  All mean weights were normal except the black bullhead (0.72 pounds) which is higher than the third quartile value of 0.46 pounds.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Based on respective local medians the present fish population is as follows:  A drop in the walleye net catch (4.50/set) from the 1982 survey (6.00/set), is not large enough to indicate a real decline in the walleye population.  It continues at a level above the local median (3.52/set).  The present walleye population is the product of natural reproduction supplemented with periodic fingerling stocking.  The actual contribution of fingerling stocking is undetermined.  Year classes with sufficient numbers to distinguish them from natural reproduction and correlate with stocking are not apparent.  Walleyes exhibit a slow growth rate and tend to be small (median length group 13.0 - 13.9 inches).  Northern pike (1.00/set) show a real decline from a high point in 1982 (3.25/set) to a level consistent with surveys prior to 1982, and well below the local median of 3.88/set.  Past attempts at improving the northern pike population by stocking have proven largely ineffective and have been discontinued.  Successful natural reproduction of both northern pike and walleyes appears dependent on spring water levels of the Ann River.  Yellow perch (1.25/set) show a real decline from 1982 (9.50/set) to a level far below the local median (24.27/set).  Shoreline seining recorded 104 young-of-year yellow perch. Largemouth bass were not taken in test nets but 38 young-of-year and 13 others were recorded in shoreline seining.  The net catch for bluegills (14.00/set) is somewhat less than 1982 (19.16/set) and well below the local median (25.67/set).  Over 400 young-of-year bluegills were recorded in shoreline seining.  Black crappies (20.33/set) have increased substantially from 1982 (8.67/set) to a level slightly above the local median (18.45/set).  Both bluegills and black crappies exhibit good size distributions with median length groups of 6.5 - 6.9 and 8.0 - 8.4 inches respectively.  White crappies and black crappies have historically alternated in abundance and the increased black crappie population has produced a corresponding decline in white crappies, from 16.00/set in 1982 to the current 2.50/set.  Other species taken in test nets (carp, white sucker, channel catfish, white bass, silver redhorse, shorthead redhorse, golden redhorse, and freshwater drum) do not appear to be substantially above or below local medians nor have they undergone any noteworthy changes from the previous survey.  Smallmouth bass were not taken in test nets but 2 adults were recorded in shoreline seining. \n\nNote:  Six (6) walleyes were taken during the natural reproduction seining effort in the \"other\" category and were aged as 5 - 2 year olds and 1 - 1 year old. These walleyes were included in the age- growth data.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 407 acre impoundment of the Ann River created by a 50 foot fixed sill dam.   The walleye population is maintained through biannual fry stocking, although natural reproduction does occur.  Fish Lake is assigned to lake class 42.  Lakes grouped in class 42 are typically shallow and turbid with hard water.  In order to assess the current fish population and lake management goals, netting was conducted during the summer of 2002.The walleye catch was on the low end of the normal range for the lake class but similar to catches from the past 15 years.  Sampled walleye were large averaging 19.6 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Anglers reported good success for walleyes during May of 2002.  Night electrofishing, conducted in September, found a good abundance of both adult and young walleye.  Although the gillnet catch was below the lake management goal, walleye are available in catchable numbers.Northern pike were more abundant in the gillnet catch than ever before.  The catch rate of 8.8/gillnet was also high compared to other class 42 lakes.  Although the catch far exceeded the management goal, size structure was acceptable averaging 22.2 inches and 2.4 pounds.  The northern population was predominately 3 and 4 year olds, and exhibited good growth.The majority of Fish Lake anglers target crappies and sunfish.  Both species were sampled in good abundance with quality sizes available.  The black crappie trapnet catch rate (6.6 per net) was the highest since 1987 and just above the lake class median.  Crappie size was above normal with more than half the catch exceeding 9 inches.  Growth rates were good with the strong 1997 and 2000 year class.  Bluegill were more abundant than in past nettings and exceeded the lake class norm.  Size was still acceptable with 40% of the catch larger than 7 inches.  Bluegill ages were well distributed from 3 to 6 years.  Young of the year bluegill were abundant in the shoreline seining indicating a good bluegill hatch in 2002.  For the first time since 1982, yellow perch catch rate was within the lake class normal range.  Although perch are an important forage species, half the catch exceeded 8 inches offering anglers an additional opportunity.  Based on shoreline seining results, yellow perch reproduced successfully in 2002.Night electrofishing was conducted in May to sample largemouth bass.  Bass were sampled at a rate of 10.5 per hour.  Although this catch rate is moderate to low,  it was higher than the 5.9 per hour recorded in 1997.  Bass ranged from 9.5 to 19.3 inches and with a 14.4 inch and 1.9 pound average.  Young of the year bass were present in the shoreline seining, indicating successful reproduction in 2002. The channel catfish catch (1.3/gillnet) was similar to rates reported in past assessments.  Channel cats were large averaging 7.7 pounds and ranging from 14.3 to 34.5 inches.  Some anglers have reported targeting channel catfish specificaly.White crappie were present in a normal abundance relative to lake class 42.  Only one white crappie sampled was less than 9.5 inches.  White crappie were absent in the 1997 netting.   Other fish species present in the sampling included black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, common carp, freshwater drum, golden shiner, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 407 acre impoundment of the Ann River. The lake has a maximum depth of 8 feet and is subject to low water clarity. Aquatic vegetation is abundant in shallow areas. Fish Lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, with largemouth bass, crappie, and bluegill as secondary species. A population assessment was conducted on Fish Lake during the summer of 2012 to assess current fish populations and management goals.  <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population in Fish Lake is maintained by stocking, although some spawning does occur. Walleye fingerlings have been stocked annually since 2006. The 2012 gillnet catch (2.5/set) was similar to the 2007 rate and within the normal range for this lake type. Sampled walleye ranged from 6.5-26.5 inches, with an 18.6 inch mean length. The walleye fishery in Fish Lake has been gradually improving according to recent population assessments, and is in good shape overall.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch, 10.8/set, was higher than in any recent survey and exceeded the long range management goal for Fish Lake. Sampled northerns ranged from 15.8 to 31.5 inches, with a 22 inch average. Age analysis found nearly all northerns to be from 3-6 years in age, with numbers evenly distributed among these four age groups.  <br> \n <br> \nDespite the high abundance of northern pike, yellow perch numbers, at 14.8 per gillnet, were at a record high in 2012 while size remained within the lake class norm. Yellow perch provide an important forage base for walleye and northern pike, but most perch in Fish Lake are too small to be of interest to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass spring electrofishing catch rates improved from 31.3 fish per hour in 2007 to 43.8 fish per hour in 2012. Lengths ranged from 3.3 to 18.6 inches with an 11.4 inch, 1.3 pound average. Size quality was very good with 69% of adult bass 12 inches or larger and 38% reaching 15 inches or larger. With excellent catch rates, good growth rates, and consistent recruitment, the largemouth bass population in Fish Lake should provide quality fishing.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in Fish Lake remain well above the lake class norm. While the average weight of black crappie (0.21 pounds) was above the 50th percentile compared with similar lakes, it was the lowest in recent years for Fish Lake. Black crappie ranged from 4.2 to 11.5 inches with a 7 inch mean. Age analysis found good growth, with black crappie reaching 9 inches in four years. White crappie are also present in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate increased slightly from the 2007 assessment and was above the 50th percentile for similar lakes. Average size, 0.23 pounds, was similar to previous assessments. Sampled bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 9.1 inches with a 6.4 inch mean. As with black crappie, good numbers of acceptable sized bluegill are available for panfish enthusiasts.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish provide an additional fishing opportunity not found in most lakes in the area. The channel catfish catch rate was 2.2 fish per net set, slightly higher than the long term average for Fish Lake. Good sizes are present, with lengths ranging from 17.2-30.2 inches and an average length of 22.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in 2012 were common carp, shorthead, greater, and golden redhorse, white sucker, northern hogsucker, yellow bullhead, bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, and freshwater drum.</p>",

The walleye although low in the gillnet catch was high in the trapnet catch as in the 1973 survey.  The northern pike and yellow perch are low while the carp, white sucker, freshwater drum, and channel catfish have slightly high populations.  The silver redhorse, northern redhorse, golden shiner, bowfin, yellow bullhead, and white bass are low when compared to the local median while the bluegill and the black and white crappies are slightly low.  The pumpkinseed was very low.  Largemouth bass were absent in net catches, but young- of-the-year were taken in the shoreline seining.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake (lake class 42) is a 407 acre reservoir lake that has a maximum depth of ten feet.  It is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike and secondly for largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.  Because it is an open-ended system, the fish population can experience unpredictable changes due to its connection to the Ann and Snake Rivers. Since the last survey in 1992, Fish Lake was part of the Lake Assessment Program in 1993.  A study was conducted by the MN PCA, The Fish Lake Improvement Association, MN DNR, and the Kanabec County NRCS to assess the trophic status of the lake by collecting and analyzing baseline water quality data, land use, and drainage patterns in the watershed.  The water quality of Fish Lake was found to be poor when compared to other lakes in the North Central Hardwood Forest Ecoregion (MPCA 1993).  Phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations were high relative to other lakes within this ecoregion.  This resulted from the lake having a moderately large watershed, shallow depth, and excess amounts of phosphorus reaching the lake.  Efforts to reduce the phosphorus levels will have to be conducted throughout the entire watershed to improve the water quality.Stocking dates back to 1908 and include such species as largemouth bass, crappie, walleye, and northern pike.  From 1978 to 1992, stocking was made up of primarily walleye fingerlings and occurred on average 2 out of 3 years.  In 1994, the lake management plan was amended to include alternate year stocking of walleye fry.During the week of July 7, 1997, a population assessment was conducted to assess the current fish population status.  Gear types utilized included; four gillnets, nine trapnets, shoreline seining (September 12, 1997), and night electrofishing (May 26, 1997).Walleye numbers and average size (1.9 lbs.) were normal for this lake type.  Lengths ranged from 6.8 to 28.0 inches with a average length of 17.2 inches.  The presence of walleye during several nonstocked years and the presence of 134 young-of-the-year walleye collected during fall sampling efforts indicate that substaintial natural reproduction has been occurring within Fish Lake and the adjoining Ann and Snake Rivers. Walleye fry stocking does not appear to substaintially increase the population, but may provide supplemental fish to the population during poor natural reproduction years.  The growth rate of Fish Lake walleye was normal.The abundance and average weight (3.4 lbs.) of northern pike were within the normal range for this lake class.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 15.0 to 40.4 inches with and average length of 23.1 inches.  The 40.4 inch northern pike sampled was eight years old.  When compared to statewide averages, Fish Lake northern pike showed normal growth from ages 1-6, but above normal growth was observed for ages 7 and 8.  Largemouth bass appeared to be low in numbers while their average size was 1.3 pounds.  Lengths ranged from 11.3 to 15.6 inches with an average of 13.2 inches.  Growth rates were normal when compared to statewide averages.Bluegill abundance was normal while the average weight (0.4 lbs.) was above normal for this lake class.  Captured bluegill ranged in length from 3.0 to 9.9 inches with an average of 7.2 inches.  Of the 128 bluegill measured, 41% were 8.0 inches or above.Black crappie numbers along with average weight were within the normal range when compared to similar lakes of this type.  Lengths sampled were from 4.1 to 12.1 inches with and average of 6.9 inches.  White crappie were not sampled during the 1997 survey.Yellow perch fell below normal in numbers and within the normal range for size (average weight = 0.1 lbs.).  Lengths of captured yellow perch ranged from 5.2 to 7.4 inches with an average length of 6.6 inches.The channel catfish numbers were down from previous surveys dating back to 1979.  Lengths ranged from 20.7 to 26.8 inches with an average weight of 5.3 pounds.During the 1997 assessment, the following species also made up the fish composition in Fish Lake: pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, freshwater drum, common carp, white bass, black, brown, and yellow bullhead, golden shiner, Johnny darter, and tadpole madtom.  Abundance of both freshwater drum and white sucker were above average for the lake class while pumpkinseed sunfish, black, brown, and yellow bullhead all fell below average in number.  Common carp, shorthead redhorse, and white bass fell within the normal range for lakes of this type.  Above normal average weights were sampled for black, brown, and yellow bullhead while all other species fell within the normal range for size.The 1997 shoreline seining showed successful natural reproduction for bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch.Prepared by Audrey Posterick, Fisheries SpecialistMinnesota Pollution Control Agency. 1993.

The fry were a local genetic strain sourced from the Knife River in April.  Fish Lake was electrofished on the night of October 18, 2023, to evaluate the relative abundance of young of the year Walleye.  The catch rate of 51 age-0 Walleye per hour was below average (78/hr)  and was less than the 2020 rate of 294 per hour, a non-stocked year. The age-0 Walleye ranged from 4.7 to 6.7 inches in length with a 5.3-inch average.  The possibility of natural Walleye reproduction makes the fry stocking's contribution to the 2023 Walleye year class unknown.</p>",

The bluegill sunfish at 19.16 and the black crappie at 8.67 per set had low population figures while the white crappie was very high in both the trapnet and gillnet with 16.00 and 68.25 per set respectively.  The channel catfish at 1.25 and the yellow perch at 9.50 per set had slightly low and low population figures respectively.  The white sucker and northern redhorse had moderately high populations while the largemouth bass, freshwater drum, and carp had slightly low figures.  The golden shiner, yellow bullhead, and black bullhead were represented by 1 adult each.  The white bass was not present in the gillnet (selective gear) but was high at 1.50 per set in the trapnet.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 407 acre impoundment of the Ann River created by a 50 foot long dam.   The walleye population is maintained through biannual fry/fingerling stocking, although natural reproduction does occur.  Walleye fry have been stocked every other year in Fish Lake since 1994.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1989, 1990, and 1992.  Fish Lake is assigned to lake class 42.  Lakes grouped in class 42 are typically shallow and turbid with hard water.  The current management goal is to attain a walleye gill net catch between 2.0 and 6.0 per gill net and northern pike between 1.0 and 3.0 per gill net. A population assessment was conducted on Fish Lake the summer of 2007 in order to assess current fish populations and management goals.   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gillnet catch (2.3/set) was within the normal range compared to other catches in the lake class and increased from the 2002 survey catch of (1.0/set).  Walleye averaged 1.8 pounds, which is a decline from 2.7 average pounds in the 2002 survey.   The walleye catch was within the management goal of  2.0 to 6.0 fish per net.  Sampled walleye ranged from 7.2 to 21.3 inches with a 16.7 inch mean.  Walleye size structure has decreased from the 19.9 inch average in the 2002 survey.   While walleye growth was slowed down compared to past surveys, it is still in the 50th quartile when compared to the lake class norm.  The 2007 population assessment has shown the walleye population in Fish Lake to be slowly improving when compared to past surveys.   Although there is some variance in year class strength from year to year the overall status of the walleye fishery in Fish Lake is in good condition. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch of  6.7/ set exceeded the long range management goal of 1.0 to 3.0 pike per gill net. Sampled northerns ranged from 17.4 to 32.5 inches with a 23.2 inch average.  Northern pike catch rates decreased from 8.8/set  in 2002 to 6.7/set  in 2007. Average length of northern pike is up from 22.1 inches in 2002 to 23.2 inches in 2007.  The northern pike maximum length slightly increased from 30.1 inches in 2002 to 32.5 inches in 2007.   Average weight has slightly decreased from the 2002 survey but is in the 50th quartile for lakes in this class.  Growth and ageing data analysis from northern pike scales displayed six year classes from 2000 through 2005. The growth rate is within the normal range when compared to other lakes in the same class.  By all accounts the northern pike fishery in Fish Lake is  presently healthy with good numbers and showing great signs of quality angling. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing for largemouth bass sampled 26 bass.  Catch per unit effort increased from 10.5 fish per hour in 2002 to 31.3 fish per hour in 2007.  Total weight of the bass sampled in 2002 was 17.5 pounds compared to 48.3 in 2007.  The size structure of largemouth bass sampled in 2007 ranged from 6.5 inches to 21 inches.  Aging data revealed nine year classes (3-11) from 1996 to 2004.  Length at age data portrays a moderate and steady growth rate for largemounth bass in Fish Lake.  With excellent catch rates, good growth rates, and consistent recruitment, the outlook for largemouth bass in Fish Lake is in good condition and should remain healthy for years to come.   <br> \n    <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in the Fish Lake 2007 population assessment have significantly increased from the 2002 survey.  Gill net catch rates for black crappie increased from 7.2 fish per set in 2002 to 48.5 fish per set in 2007.  The 48.5 fish per net is the highest catch rate ever recorded in Fish Lake.  The average weight of black crappie was .33 lbs and above the 75th quartile for lakes in this class.  Black crappie sampled ranged from 4.2 to 11.3 inches with a 8.0 inch mean, which indicates an excellent size structure.   The high numbers and exceptional size structure of black crappie will create a first class black crappie fishery in Fish Lake for years to come.  <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnetting was in the 50th quartile compared to others in the lake class with the catch rate of (14.4/set).  Bluegill numbers have increased from 9.6 fish per net in 2002 to 14.4 fish per set in 2007.  The  average size of 0.25 pounds has decreased compared to the 2001 survey of .33 pounds, but is in the 50th quartile for lakes in this class.   Sampled bluegill ranged from 5.3 to 11.1 inches with a 8.2 inch mean.    Bluegill gillnetting sampled (3.8/set) and ranged from 4.2 to 11.3 inches with a 7.8 inch mean.  There is a good number and even distribution of bluegills in Fish Lake, which will produce a good number of quality  <br> \nsize fish for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were below the 25th quartile for this lake class.  Yellow perch catch rate decreased from (4.7/gillnet) in 2002 to (2.5/gillnet) in 2007.  The average weight of 0.23 pounds was in the 50% quartile for the lake class.  Yellow perch are an important forage fish and numbers may be declining due to predation from other gamefish populations. <br> \n <br> \nThe channel catfish catch rate was 1.3 fish per net set in 2007, which is similar to past surveys.  Length of catfish ranged form 20.1 to 28.2 inches and the average length was 22.8 inches.   Although there is not a high number of channel catfish in Fish Lake, the size structure is good.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap net sets sampled 37 common carp in 2007, compared to 6 sampled in 2002.  Common carp abundance has increased from .67 fish per net in 2002 to 4.11 fish per net in 2007.   Carp lengths ranged from 18.9 to  32.8 inches.  The 37 carp sampled in 2007 is the highest catch for common carp in Fish Lake since the 1979 survey, in which 39 carp were captured.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite crappies were absent from the Fish Lake survey in 2007.  Eight white crappies were caught during the 2002 survey. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the 2007 Fish Lake survey were shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, white sucker, yellow bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, freshwater drum, and greater redhorse.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
