                "narrative": "<p>Big Watab Lake is located in Stearns County, three miles south of Avon.  The lake is the deepest (123 feet) in Stearns County and is extremely clear.  These conditions allow for survival of rainbow and brown trout in the deeper, cooler water.  Trout have been stocked annually in Big Watab since 1989, and have provided a popular fishery for both summer and winter anglers.  The clear water also favors a diverse community of aquatic plants - more than 30 species were found in a recent survey.  Big Watab's shoreline is mostly developed with homes and cabins.  A public access with a boat ramp and parking for 12 vehicles is located on the north end of the lake.  Only thirteen rainbow trout were caught in gillnets during the 1999 survey, at a rate of 2.2 per net.  Although this is down from the 1993 survey, anglers still report good success.  Trout ranged from 12 to 15 inches.  No brown trout were captured, but they are stocked at a much lower rate than rainbows, and anglers do report catching them.  Walleye fingerlings are also stocked regularly in Big Watab.  Numbers were low in the 1999 survey compared to lakes similar to Big Watab.  Walleye ranged in size from 17 to 18.5 inches, and growth rates were average.  Northern pike numbers and size were typical for this lake type.  Pike averaged 20 inches in length, with one individual at 36 inches.  Largemouth bass are abundant, with average growth.  Bass ranged from 5 to 17 inches, with a mean length of 10 inches.  The yellow perch population is average.  Bluegill numbers are also average, but individuals are small (4.7 inches, on average) and growth is slow.  The black crappie population appears to be low.  Big Watab also supports populations of bullhead, rock bass, and white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Watab is a recreational development lake located three miles south of Avon in Stearns County.  There is one public access located on the northeast side.  Anglers may want to note that on summer weekends the public access fills quickly in the morning and late-comers must have alternate plans.  This was the first survey since 1999.   <br> \nThe lake is deep (120 feet), clear (Secchi depth 12 feet) and well oxygenated at 40 feet (5 mg/l at 45? F).  No curled pondweed was found during the June survey.  Only the muskgrass group of aquatic plants was abundant and widespread.  Northern milfoil and several beneficial pondweeds (bushy, clasping-leaf, floating-leaf, Illinois, and sago) were widely distributed, but rare in abundance.  Plants grew out to a depth of 28 feet.    <br> \nRainbow and brown trout are the primary species managed in Big Watab Lake.  Rainbow trout have been stocked annually since 1989 (10,000 yearlings) and brown trout annually since 1994 (2,000 yearlings). By all accounts, the trout management has been very successful.  Anglers have harvested a high percentage of stocked fish and yet some growth has been realized as well.  Catch rates are highest in spring after stocking, then decline as summer temperatures force trout into the thermocline.   <br> \n <br> \nSome changes have been noted in the fishery since 1999.  The northern pike catch increased significantly in 2008.  The average weight of pike decreased from 2.7 pounds in 1999 to less than two pounds.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike.  Otherwise, northern pike prey on stocked trout and walleye.     <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked every two to three years in Big Watab Lake.  The catch rate in 2008 was below the normal range for similar lakes.    <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing showed that largemouth bass were abundant but small.  Growth was below the statewide average: only 9.1 inches by age four and 12.5 inches by age seven.  However, the sample was nearly identical to that of 1999.  Anglers can expect good fishing for largemouth bass.   <br> \n <br> \nThe historic patterns of abundance and size for bluegill and black crappie remained true in 2008.  The bluegill catch was above the range of expected values, but growth was slow: more than six years to reach six inches.   The black crappie catch was below the range of expected values, but the average size was similar to the statewide average.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species collected during the 2008 survey were hybrid, green and pumpkinseed sunfish; Iowa and Johnny darter; rock bass; brook stickleback; and bluntnose minnow.  Also collected were sensitive species: blacknose, blackchin and pugnose shiner, least darter and banded killifish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 1993 population assessment was the first lake survey done since the introduction of Rainbow Trout.  A total of 30 trout were caught at a rate of 5 fish per gill net.  Trout caught ranged in size from 11.7-19.4 inches and averaged 13.2 inches in length.  Only 1 and 2 year old fish were sampled, with 1 year olds making up 93% of the total catch.  The growth of rainbow trout appeared to be good, reaching 16.2 inches in length in two years.The catch rate of Walleye in gill nets (1.3/net) appeared to decline from the last survey (2.8/net) but remained within expected levels for lakes like Big Watab.  Walleye caught ranged in size from 8.9-24.0 inches and averaged 14.9 inches.  Age 1-9 fish were sampled and no dominant year class was sampled.  The growth rate of Walleye in Big Watab was average.The catch rate of Northern Pike (1.7/gill net) also appeared to have declined from the last survey (4.4/gill net) and fell below expected values for this lake type.  The average weight of fish caught in gill nets (4.8 lbs) appeared to have increased from the last survey (3.1 lbs) and remained large for this lake type. Northern Pike caught ranged in size from 12.2-35.0 inches and averaged 23.3 inches in length.  One to seven year old pike were sampled and no dominant year class was observed.  The growth rate of pike was fast for 1-3 year old fish and average for 4-7 year olds.The catch rate of Bluegill in trap nets (46.3/net) remained similar to the previous survey (50.7/net) and was above average for this lake class.  Bluegill caught ranged in size from 2.6-7.0 inches and averaged 4.7 inches in length.  The growth rate of bluegill was slow compared to other populations in the state.The catch rate of Yellow Perch in gill nets (14.0/net) significantly increased from the last survey and rose into expected levels for this lake class.  Yellow Perch caught were generally small (0.1 lbs), and averaged 6.8 inches in length.  The Largemouth Bass population was assessed by trap nets (0.8/net) and only 2 year old fish were sampled. Largemouth Bass caught ranged in size 5.2-6.2 inches and averaged 5.5 inches in length.  The growth rate of Largemouth Bass was average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Watab lake is a small (217 acres) lake located three miles south of Avon in Stearns County. There is a state-owned public access on the northeast side of the lake with enough parking for 12 vehicle/trailer combinations as well as a dock and a portable toilet. On summer weekends, anglers may want to note that the public access fills quickly in the morning and anyone coming later may need alternative plans. A standard survey was conducted in 2023 to monitor the changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nBig Watab Lake has a maximum depth of 123 feet and has excellent water clarity with a 10-year average summer water clarity of 16 feet. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were suitable to sustain sport fish to depths of 45 feet during the third week of July.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake has a diverse aquatic plant community, with twenty-five species being identified during the 2008 survey and found growing to a depth of 28 feet. Chara was the only aquatic plant that was abundant and widespread. While northern milfoil and several other beneficial pondweeds (bushy, clasping-leaf, floating-leaf, Illinois, and sago) were widely distributed, but rare in abundance. Emergent and floating leaf vegetation was mapped and covered approximately 16% of the shoreline with bulrush and yellow waterlily being the most common. Native vegetation helps stabilize shoreline soils and acts as a buffer for runoff, reducing the amount of pollution that enters a lake. It is important that all lake shore owners follow County shoreline rules and only mow a small area down to the lake to allow access without altering an unnecessary length of shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow and Brown Trout are the primary managed species in Big Watab Lake. Rainbow Trout have been stocked annually since 1989 (10,000 yearlings) and Brown Trout annually since 1994 (2,000 yearlings). Trout management has been very successful as anglers harvest a high percentage of stocked fish, but some growth has been realized as well. Catch rates are highest in spring after stocking, then decline as the summer temperatures force trout into the thermocline.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings were stocked biennially for almost 50 years, but was discontinued after 2016 because of diminished returns over the last 40 years. No Walleye were sampled in the 2023. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was similar to the 2016 survey and remains within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  While the catch rates have been similar over the last three surveys the average size has decreased from earlier surveys (pre-2000). From 1982 - 1999 the average length and weigh of Northern Pike sampled was 22.3 inches and 3.4 pounds compared 16.7 inches and 1.6 pounds from 2000 - 2023. Only 32%of Northern Pike sampled in 2023 were longer than 21 inches, meaning that most of the pike present are small in size. Anglers are encouraged to harvest these small pike (under 22 inches) and release larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and improve growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also allow Yellow Perch numbers to increase, which would benefit other species as Yellow Perch are an important prey species. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Largemouth Bass in 2023 was about a third of the catch rate observed in 2016, but still higher than the average daytime catch rate for the Sauk Rapids Management Area. Largemouth Bass had an average length of 9.9 inches with only 23% being longer than 12 inches. Anglers can expect good fishing for smaller Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch in 2023 was lower than the 2016 survey and was the lowest on record. Lengths ranged from 3 to 10 inches with an average length of 6.8 inches, but 78% percent of Bluegills sampled were larger than six inches. The Black Crappie catch for 2023 was similar to the previous survey and remains below the range of expected values. Black Crappie abundance has historically been low in Big Watab Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low numbers included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Brown Trout, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rainbow Trout, and Rock Bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike abundance remained similar to nettings in 1980 and 1982 and was considered average for area lakes. Sampling done in 1960 and 1975 indicated these fish were scarce. The 22 pike sampled in the survey had grown at an average rate. Bluegill declined from 82.0/trap net in 1982 to 50.7/trap net in 1988, but remained abundant. Bluegill continue to exhibit slow growth, with most individuals being less than six inches in length. Largemouth Bass, while difficult to assess, appear to be abundant at 4.4 per gill net gill net. Two-thirds of the sample was of age two fish. Growth was good and young of the year were caught in shoal water seining. Walleye abundance remained average but declined from the 4.2 per gill net in 1982. Their growth rate continued to be good. Black Crappie were scarce as they have been in previous nettings. Hybrid and Green Sunfish have historically been abundant and remain so at 13.0 and 5.7 per trap net lift, respectively. Pumpkinseed abundance continued to be average. The trap net catch of Rock Bass was average, but the gill net catch indicated they were abundant. White Sucker abundance remained average. Yellow Perch abundance declined significantly since 1982 and now can be considered low. Young of the year perch were present in shoal water seine catches. Though no bullheads were caught in trap nets, gill nets yielded expected amounts of Yellows and Browns. No Black Bullheads were sampled in this survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Big Watab Lake was conducted on September 5th, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations, and a 15-foot seine was used to sample one station. Nearshore sampling captured seventeen species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Big Watab Lake is healthy, as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous findings, which indicated that Big Watab Lake fully supported aquatic life use based on the FIBI.  These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River - Sartell Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 6 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 3 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 1 station. Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including 6 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in June 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Big Watab Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Mississippi River - Sartell Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Watab is a small (217 acres) lake located three miles south of Avon in Stearns County. There is a state-owned public access on the northeast side which has enough parking for 12 vehicle/trailer combinations as well as a dock and portable toilet. Anglers may want to note that on summer weekends the public access fills quickly in the morning and late-comers must have alternate plans. A standard summer survey was conducted in 2016 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2008 as well as near shore Index of Biotic Integrity sampling and emergent and floating leaf vegetation mapping to evaluate the physical habitat of Big Watab Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is deep (123 feet), and clear (10 year average secchi depth 16 feet) and well oxygenated at 50 feet (4 mg/l at 46? F). The aquatic plant community is diverse and plants grew out to a depth of 28 feet at the time of the last submerged plant survey in 2008. Chara was the only aquatic plant that was abundant and widespread. While northern milfoil and several other beneficial pondweeds (bushy, clasping-leaf, floating-leaf, Illinois, and sago) were widely distributed, but rare in abundance.  Emergent and floating leaf vegetation was mapped and covered approximately 16% of the shoreline with bulrush and yellow waterlily being the most common. Changes in shoreline development have the potential to negatively affect the health of a lake. It is important that all lake shore owners follow County shoreline rules and only mow a small area down to the lake to allow access and avoid clearing their entire shoreline. Native vegetation helps stabilize shoreline soils and acts as a buffer reducing the amount of pollution that enters a lake from runoff.  <br> \n <br> \nRainbow and Brown Trout are the primary managed species in Big Watab Lake.  Rainbow Trout have been stocked annually since 1989 (10,000 yearlings) and Brown Trout annually since 1994 (2,000 yearlings). By all accounts, the trout management has been very successful.  Anglers have harvested a high percentage of stocked fish and yet some growth has been realized as well.  Catch rates are highest in spring after stocking, then decline as summer temperatures force trout into the thermocline.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch in 2016 was similar to that of 2008 and at the upper end of the expected range for its Lake Class. Pike ranged from 9 to 36 inches but most were small with an average weight of 1.4 pounds. Anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike (under 22 inches) and release larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and to improve growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also increase Walleye stocking success and allow Yellow Perch numbers (which are low) to increase. Higher perch populations are desirable as they are an important prey species for both Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked every two years in Big Watab Lake.  The catch rate in 2016 has remained below the normal range for its Lake Class where it has been since 1999.    <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Largemouth Bass was nearly four times higher than the average day-time catch rate for lakes in the Sauk Rapids Management Area, but the average size was less than one pound.  Anglers can expect good fishing for small Largemouth Bass with the chance of catching fish over 20 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch decreased from the 2008 survey but was within the range of expected values for its Lake Class.  Bluegill ranged in length from 4 to 9 inches and averaged 6.7 inches. The Black Crappie catch was unchanged from the previous survey and remained below the range of expected values. Historically Black Crappie abundance has been low in Big Watab Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey were: Black Bullhead, Brown Trout, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rainbow Trout, Rock Bass, and Yellow Bullhead. All of these species were sampled at rates either within or below the range of expected values for the respective lake class. <br> \n</p>",
