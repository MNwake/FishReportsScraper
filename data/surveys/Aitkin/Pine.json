                "narrative": "<p>Big Pine Lake is a moderately clear water lake located in southwestern Aitkin County and is part of the Mille Lacs/Rum River watershed.  There is a state-owned public access located on the south side of the lake.  Big Pine Lake has a variety of habitats available to the angler from open, wind-swept gravel and rock to areas of heavy vegetation.  Shorelines vary from areas with gentle slopes and shallow depths to areas with sharp drop-offs and deep water.  Mid-water areas consist primarily of deep water, but there are several gravel bars with steep sides that rise to within a few feet of the surface.  <br> \n <br> \nGamefish species available to anglers include Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill and both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass.  Though there are some favorable spawning areas for Walleye, and minimal natural reproduction does occur, historically the better year classes have been those supplemented by stocking.  Walleye have been stocked with varying success in Big Pine Lake since the early 1900's.  Due to poor returns from stocked fry in the late 1990's and early 2000's, fingerling stocking resumed and were stocked annually from 2004-2007.   Big Pine Lake then became part of a statewide research project to evaluate to effectiveness of stocking Walleye frylings, which are an intermediate size between fry and fingerlings, and were stocked in 2008 and 2010.  Test nets in 2011 and 2103 suggested fryling stocking at Big Pine Lake were less successful than fingerlings.  Current management has reverted to annual fingerling stocking.  Overall, the Walleye gill net catch rate has been stable and has averaged about 4/net the last four surveys.  Although slightly below the average in 2021 (3.4/net) and is slightly below the management goal of 5 per net, it is still about normal for this type of lake. The mean length was 16.3 inches, and fish up to 27.1 inches were sampled.  Nine-year classes were present indicating good survival of stocked fish and meeting current management objectives.  Additionally, a higher than usual amount of Walleye were observed in the trap nets (1.25/net) and they averaged almost 20 inches.  Walleye fingerling survival will continue to be evaluated in future surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThe gillnet catch rate for Northern Pike has not varied much in survey history but did increase to 4.3/net in 2021, which is slightly above the long-term average of 3.4/net spanning 13 surveys back to 1956.  This is normal for this lake type and meets the current management goal of 2 - 6/net.  A wide range of sizes and ages were found with 7 of 51 (13%) fish being longer than 26 inches.  The size structure is typically favorable and was again with an average length of 21.9 inches and fish up to 38.7 inches being sampled.  The management goal of achieving an average size of 24 inches was not met but the size structure was still decent.  The best way to maximize the benefits of this quality pike fishery is for anglers to recycle these fish.  That way, more than one individual can experience the catching of a quality pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch rate was 2.5/net in 2021 and has been stable at about that level for the last 20 years.   The mean length of Largemouth Bass was 11.6 inches with individuals up to 15.1 inches.  Electrofishing for Largemouth Bass was also completed in 2021 and yielded a catch rate of 66/hour, which indicates good abundance.  The size structure matched what was observed in the gill nets.  A previous electrofishing survey in 2002 had similar results (68/hour) further indicating a stable population.  Smallmouth Bass are known to be present in small numbers in Big Pine Lake, however few have been observed in traditional sampling gear, and only one was observed from a trap net in 2021. Several juvenile Smallmouth Bass were also observed in the nearshore assessment (see the 7/06/2021 Targeted Assessment).  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap net catch rate was low again at 3.2/net, when compared to the long-term average of 26/net and was a decrease from the previous survey in 2016 (10.9/net).  Catch rates for Hybrid Sunfish were double that of Bluegill in 2021.  Hybrids have a slight edge on the Bluegills in terms of size structure with a mean size of 6.6 inches, with individuals measuring out to 8.8 inches. They typically account for the majority of the sunfish over 8 inches in the Big Pine Lake fish community.  Although spawning habitat and escape cover is not limited, Bluegills appear to be increasing the frequency with which they spawn with other species, which might partly explain the decrease in abundance.  The decline appears to be independent to the Walleye stocking regime since the decline continued during the period of fry stocking when Walleye survival (and potential predation) was very low.  Bluegill growth rates appear to be improving and are starting to approach average growth rates for the area and so we may start to see greater contributions of Bluegills to the quality sizes over 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNice sized Black Crappies are also present in the fishery, but traditionally their abundance is low.  Black Crappie did show an increase in abundance in the gill nets, from less than 0.5/net in 2016 to 2.1/net in 2021.  The increase is primarily from a good year class of 3-year-old fish from the 2018 year class that are currently in the system, and which made up about fifty percent of the sample.  They are growing well averaging  8.1 inches by age 3.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Pine Lake is a moderately clear water lake located in southwestern Aitkin County and is part of the Mille Lacs watershed. There is a state owned public access located on the south side of the lake.  Big Pine Lake has a variety of habitats available to the angler from open, wind swept gravel and rock to areas of heavy vegetation. Shorelines vary from areas with gentle slopes and shallow depths to areas with sharp drop-offs and deep water. Mid-water areas consist primarily of deep water, but there are several gravel bars with steep sides that rise to within a few feet of the surface.  <br> \n <br> \nGamefish species available to anglers include walleye, northern pike, black crappie, bluegill and both largemouth and smallmouth bass. With the possible exception of the smallmouth bass, all of these species are native to the lake. Walleye have been stocked with varying success in Big Pine Lake since the early 1900's. Due to poor returns from stocked fry in the late 1990's and early 2000's, fingerling stocking resumed and were stocked annually from 2004-2007.   Big Pine Lake then became part of a statewide research project to evaluate to effectiveness of stocking walleye frylings, which are an intermediate size between fry and fingerlings, and were stocked in 2008 and 2010.  Test nets in 2011 suggest fryling stocking at Big Pine Lake appeared largely unsuccessful; although a final conclusion will follow the 2013 population assessment and completion of the research study.  Though there are some favorable spawning areas and minimal natural reproduction does occur, historically the better year classes have been those supplemented by fingerling stocking.  Annual fingerling stocking resumed again in 2011.  The 2004 and 2007 year classes are driving the walleye fishery, both of which were fingerling stocked years. Overall the gill net catch rate increased by 1 fish to 3.8/net from 2007 and the size structure was desirable with an average length 18.5 inches with fish sampled to nearly 29 inches. Walleye fingerling survival will continue to be evaluated in upcoming surveys. Yellow perch abundance appears relatively steady within the last 5 surveys (1991 to 2011) with catch rates ranging from 1 to 3 yellow perch per gill net. <br> \n <br> \nGillnet catch rates for northern pike has varied little in survey history and at 3/net in 2011 was near the long term average, which is normal for this lake type.  The size structure remains favorable and consistent with previous surveys with 41% of pike being longer than 24 inches with individuals up to 33 inches present.  The best way to maximize the benefits of this quality pike fishery is for anglers to recycle these fish. That way, more than one individual can experience the catching of a quality pike. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass catches have been stable around 2/gill net for the last decade or more but in 2011 have increased to 4/gill net. In recent years, an increase in bass has been common in many lakes throughout the state.  The size structure was average with average length about 11 inches and individuals observed up to about16 inches. Smallmouth bass are known to be present in small numbers in Big Pine Lake, however few have been observed in traditional sampling gear. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population has been decreasing in recent years as indicated by both trap net and gill net assessments. Along with this decrease, there has been a steady increase in the numbers of hybrid sunfish, which have a slight edge in size on the bluegills. The average bluegill sampled was 5.4 inches long and the largest bluegill caught was 8.2 inches. Although spawning habitat and escape cover is not limited, bluegills appear to be increasing the frequency with which they spawn with other species, which might partly explain the decrease in abundance.  The decline appears to be independent to the walleye stocking regime since the decline continued during the period of fry stocking when walleye survival (and potential predation) was very low.  If bluegill densities continue to decline, we may see an improvement in growth rates.  Nice sized black crappies are present in the fishery, but their abundance is very low.   <br> \n <br> \nDue to its proximity to Mille Lacs, invasive species are of great concern.  Anglers are encouraged to take extra precautions to help stop the spread aquatic invasive species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special assessment consisting of summer gill nets was conducted the week of 8/26/2013 to assist in evaluating the success of fryling stocking, which occurred in 2008 (19,692 fish) and 2010 (39,380 fish).  Primary management is for walleye, which have been stocked regularly at different sizes and frequencies since the 1950's.  The current goal is an index of 5-8/gill net with at least 4 year classes present.  Historic walleye gill net catches from twelve previous surveys dating back to 1946 have ranged from 0-6.0/net with an average of 2.8/net.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rate (5.3/gill net) was slightly higher than in 2011 (3.8/gill net), and was above the interquartile range for lake class 23 for the first time since 1996.  Growth was above county and statewide averages for all ages and was similar to what was observed in the 2011 population assessment.  <br> \n <br> \nFish ranged from age 1 to age 9 with eight year classes identified and the 2011 fingerling-stocked year accounting for 52% (33 of 64) of the catch.  The fryling-stocked 2010 year class was the second most abundant (9 of 64), while relatively few individuals from the 2008 fryling stocking were sampled (3 of 64).  These results suggest fryling stocking may be capable of producing year classes similar to fingerling stocking, but not substantially stronger.  The lake is part of a fisheries research project evaluating the success of fryling stocking statewide, which may provide greater insights on the future use of fryling stocking.  Completion of the OTC analysis to confirm the fish identified by age to be from a fryling stocking, is forthcoming. <br> \n <br> \nAge analysis suggests limited natural reproduction may be occurring as one individual was identified from the non-stocked 2009 year class.  It is also possible that some older walleye were included with a load of fingerlings stocked after 2010.   If evaluating the contributions of natural reproduction is important, more non-stocked years should be incorporated into the stocking plan, which will be reviewed during the lake management plan revision scheduled for 2014.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch (5.4/gill net) increased significantly compared to 2011 (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test: p=0.052, n=7), just above the goal in the current plan (1.5-5/gill net) and the lake class median (5.0/gill net).  Size was very good and ranged from 15.8 to 36.5\" with an average of 24.7\" and 3.6 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nAn adult smallmouth bass (20.7\") was captured for only the second time in standard fisheries nets. <br> \n <br> \nCatches for all other species were similar to the 2011 population assessment.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Big Pine Lake was conducted on July 7-8, 2021, by Aitkin Area Fisheries Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eleven stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 21 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Smallmouth Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Iowa Darter and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish and Black Bullhead). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates the fish community of Big Pine Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Rum River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The trap net index for bowfin was below the lake class 23 first quartile.  The trap net index for black crappie was above the lake class 23 third quartile. Northern pike (38 of 39 aged) ranged from one to seven years of age.  The growth rate for the first annual increment was faster than normal.  Growth rates for the fourth, fifth and sixth annual increments were slower than normal.  Total length at annulus formation for the fourth annulus was normal.  Bluegill (44 of 176 aged) ranged from three to eight years of age with a strong year class in 1987.  Growth rates for the first, second, third and fourth annual increments were slower than normal.  Largemouth bass (17 of 18 aged) ranged from one to seven years of age with most of the fish sampled from the 1989 and 1990 year classes.  The growth rate for the second annual increment was slower than normal. Total length at annulus formation for the fourth annulus was normal.  Black crappie (21 of 33 aged) ranged from two to six years of age with most of the fish sampled from the 1989 year class.  The growth rate for the first annual increment was slower than normal.  Growth rates for the third and fourth annual increments were faster than normal based on aging of two fish.  Yep (17 of 17 aged) ranged from two to four years of age with a strong year class documented in 1988.  Growth rates for the first and second annual increments were slower than normal.  Walleye (47 of 51 aged) ranged from two to eight plus years of age with strong year classes in 1985, 1986 and 1989 which correspond to the last three walleye stockings.  The growth rate for the first annual increment was slower than normal. The abundance of yep and walleye increased from the 1986 assessment to the 1991 assessment (Wilcoxon's signed rank test, n=9: yep, p=0.0624; walleye, p=0.0078).  The abundance of yellow bullhead and pumpkinseed increased from the 1986 assessment to the 1991 assessment (Wilcoxon's signed rank test, n=12: yellow bullhead, p=0.1562; pumpkinseed, p=0.0274).

                "narrative": "<p>Big Pine Lake is a moderately clear water lake located in southwestern Aitkin County and is part of the Mille Lacs watershed.  Big Pine Lake has a variety of habitats available to the angler from open, wind swept gravel and rock to areas of heavy vegetation. Shorelines vary from areas with gentle slopes and shallow depths to areas with sharp drop-offs and deep water. Mid-water areas consist primarily of deep water but there are several gravel bars with steep sides that rise to within a few feet of the surface.   Gamefish species available to anglers include walleye, northern pike, black crappie, bluegill and both largemouth and smallmouth bass.  With the possible exception of the smallmouth bass all of these species are native to the lake.  Walleye have been stocked with varying success in Big Pine Lake since the early 1900's.  The present stocking program calls for annual stocking of walleye fry.  The present walleye population, while down somewhat from 1996, is still within the normal range for this lake type and should produce some good fishing for anglers with the strong 1996 year class averaging about 19 inches in length.As in past surveys the northern pike population appears to be healthy.  The gillnet catch index is normal for lakes of this lake class and the length frequency distribution shows a nice size distribution.  The average northern pike caught during the survey was 21 inches long and weighed approximately 2 pounds.  Bass anglers should have great fishing on Big Pine Lake.   During the electrofishing segment of this survey largemouth bass were caught at almost two fish per minute.  No large fish were seen (15.5 inches was the largest) but the size distribution for all of the gear types used were similar and the aging analysis reveals consistent recruitment.The bluegill population is consistant with indicies from the 1996 survey.   The average bluegill sampled was less that 6 inches long and the largest bluegill caught was less than 8 inches.  With the large expanses of available spawning habitat and the large areas of dense submerged vegetation available as escape cover, bluegill are able to successfully reproduce to the extent that available food sources limits growth, which results in small average and maximum size.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Pine Lake is a moderately clear water lake located in southwestern Aitkin County and is part of the Mille Lacs watershed. An improved public access is found on the southwestern end of the lake. Big Pine Lake has a variety of habitats available to the angler from open, wind swept gravel and rock to areas of heavy vegetation. Shorelines vary from areas with gentle slopes and shallow depths to areas with sharp drop-offs and deep water. Mid-water areas consist primarily of deep water, but there are several gravel bars with steep sides that rise to within a few feet of the surface. <br> \n <br> \nGamefish species available to anglers include walleye, northern pike, black crappie, bluegill and both largemouth and smallmouth bass. With the possible exception of the smallmouth bass all of these species are native to the lake. Walleye have been stocked with varying success in Big Pine Lake since the early 1900's. Due to poor returns from stocked fry in the late 1990s and early 2000s, fingerling stocking resumed in 2004 and is scheduled for annual stocking under the current management plan.  The 2007 catch rate for walleye was 2.8 per net, which falls within the normal range for this lake type.  Fish from the 2004 year class were most abundant and were 14 to 18 inches in length.  Walleye fingerling survival will continue to be evaluated in upcoming surveys. Yellow perch abundance appears relatively steady within the last 4 surveys (1991 to 2007) with catch rates ranging from 1 to 3 yellow perch per gill net. <br> \n <br> \nThe gillnet catch rate for northern pike was down in this survey to 2.3 fish per net compared with 5.4 in 2003. Although abundance is down slightly, the size distribution of pike in Big Pine Lake is healthy with the average northern pike weighing over 3 pounds. During the 2007 survey the mean length for pike was 25.3 inches and fish up to 34 inches were sampled. <br> \n  <br> \nThe bluegill population has been decreasing in recent years as indicated by both trap net and gill net assessments. Along with this decrease, there has been a steady increase in the numbers of hybrid sunfish, which accounted for the majority of sunfish over 7 inches (up to 8.6 inches).  The average bluegill sampled was 5.2 inches long and the largest bluegill caught was 7.3 inches. Although spawning habitat and escape cover is not limited, bluegill appear to be increasing the frequency with which they spawn with other species, which might partly explain the decrease in abundance.  The decline appears to be independent to the walleye stocking regime since the decline continued during the period of fry stocking when walleye survival (and potential predation) was very low.  If bluegill densities continue to decline, we may see an improvement in growth rates.  Nice sized black crappies are present in the fishery, but their abundance is very low. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indices of abundance for Bowfin, Northern Pike, Rock Bass, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie and Walleye are between the first and third regional quartiles. The catch indices for White sucker, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch are below the first regional quartile. Catch indices for Bowfin, Northern Pike, Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Walleye are between the first and third area quartiles. The indices for White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch are below the first area quartile. The catch indices for Black Crappie is above the third area quartile. Northern Pike ranged from two to eight plus years of age. Twenty seven percent were age 4 and three percent were age five. Growth rates were normal for all increments through age eight. Rock Bass ranged from three to five years of age. Ages three and four each made up forty three percent of the sample. The growth rates for the first fourth and fifth increments are 31, 29 and 42 percent faster than normal respectively. Growth rates for the second and third increments is normal. Pumpkinseed ranged from three to five years of age with no apparent age class strength differences. Growth the first, third, fourth and fifth increments are normal. Growth the second increment was twenty nine percent slower than normal. Bluegill ranged from two to five years of age. Twenty one percent were age two, twenty nine percent were age three and thirty eight percent of 34 were age four. Growth for the first, fourth and fifth increments was normal. Growth for the second and third increments was thirty three and twenty seven percent a lower than normal respectively. Largemouth Bass ranged from one to five years of age. Age one fish dominated the sample with forty three percent of the fish aged. Growth the first, second and third increments ranged from 12 to 23 percent slower than normal. Growth for the fourth and fifth increments was normal. Black Crappie ranged from one to four years of age with age two and age three dominating the sample. Growth rates for the first and third increments were seventeen and twenty percent faster than normal. Growth rates for the second and fourth increments were normal. Walleye ranged from one to seven years of age. The sample aged was dominated by age one and age four and ages six and seven. Age one, age four and age seven correspond positively to the years of Walleye stocking. Growth rates for all ages are normal. The abundance of Northern Pike has not changed since the 1980 assessment. The average length of Northern Pike increased from 21.2 inches in 1980 to 24.2 inches in 1986. This increase in mean length is caused by the decrease in fish less than 16.0 inches and the increase in fish between 21.0 and 27.9 inches from 1980 to 1986. In 1980, 20.6 percent of the sample was less than 16.0 inches and 38 percent was between 21.0 and 27.9 inches. In 1986, there were no fish sampled less than 16.0 inches and 74 percent of the sample was in the 21.0 to 27.9 inch range. Twenty six percent in 1980 and forty three percent in 1986 were greater than 25.0 inches. The abundance of pumpkinseed has not changed since 1980 but the mean length has decreased from 5.4 to 5.0 inches. The decrease in mean length is caused by the overall shift toward smaller fish seen in the sampled. In 1980 twenty three were less than 5.0 inches; in 1986 forty one percent were less than 5.0 inches. The index of abundance of bluegill has increased from 18.6 per trap net in 1980 to 30.1 per trap net in 1986 and the mean length has decreased from 5.9 to 5.0 inches. The decrease in mean length is a result of two main factors, (1) a decrease in maximum length observed in the two samples from 8.4 inches in 1980 to 7.4 inches in 1986 and (2) an increase from 17.8 percent in 1980 to 42.6 percent in 1986 of fish less than 5.0 inches in the samples. Most of the fish seen in both 1980 and 1986 were between 5.0 and 6.9 inches, sixty five percent in 1980 and fifty six percent in 1986. Walleye abundance has not changed since 1980. The samples aged in both the 1980 and 1986 assessments indicate that there is probably poor natural reproduction and that there is a positive correlation to the Walleye fingerling stocking program in Big Pine. The last four Walleye stockings were in 1974, 1979, 1982, and 1985. Of the twelve fish aged in 1986 three were from the 1985 year class, four from the 1982 year class and one from the 1979 year class. In 1980 of the twenty one fish aged two were from the 1979 year class and the length frequencies indicate that several would be from the 1974 year class. Rock Bass, Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie have not changed in abundance since 1980 and the samples are too small to draw any conclusions from.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Pine Lake's sport fishery includes angling for walleyes, northern pike, black crappies, bluegills, largemouth bass and rock bass. other species that may provide some interest to anglers include bullheads, yellow perch and common carp.  Walleye stocking has succeeded in producing a quality walleye fishery on Big Pine Lake. The catch rate of 6.0 walleyes per net set in this survey is above normal for lakes of this type. Walleyes average 16.1 inches and ranged from 10.3 to 24.3 inches in this survey. The 1992 year class was most prominent, reflecting a substantial stocking which followed two years of no stocking. The 1994 year class, which was also supplemented with fingerlings, was also well represented. The fry stockings of 1993 and 1995 did not produce strong year classes. These year classes may have been suppressed by the previous year classes of fingerling stockings. Additional evaluation will be needed to determine if fry stocking is feasible in Big Pine Lake. Walleye growth is rapid enough to justify maintaining the walleye population at the current level. Natural reproduction is minimal and active enhancement to maintain the population will be required in the short term. Most of the shoal, or shoreline, substrate is sand, followed by equal amounts of gravel, rubble, muck and silt. A previous shoreline egg deposition check revealed no walleye eggs, even in places that appeared to be suitable for walleye spawning.    The northern pike fishery is also healthy. Northern pike were caught at normal rates in this survey, and the 23.5 inch mean and 33.6 inch maximum lengths indicate a desirable population structure that has remained unchanged since the first survey in 1941. Growth is and has been fast for young fish and slow for older, larger fish. The low abundance of suitable prey items such as white suckers, small common carp and large yellow perch restricts growth for larger pike. Any increased harvest of larger fish will tend to reduce average size, however the surveys have not yet revealed a decrease in pike size.    Black crappies usually produce only one strong year class out of several years and fishing success jumps up and down. Most of crappies in this survey were from the 1994 year class. These fish will be about 8 inches long in 1997 and will make up most of the angler's catch. Their abundance will decrease over the next few years resulting in lower catch rates until the next strong year class occurs.    Bluegills reproduce regularly and grow slowly in the lake. Bluegills averaged only 5.3 inches in this survey and few fish were over 8.0 inches. Bluegills reach just 6.2 inches after 8 years. The bluegill catch rate in the surveys from 1970 to this survey has been within the normal range for this lake type. The bluegill fishery will continue to produce average catches of small fish.    Largemouth bass are relatively common in the lake and production of new fish, or recruitment, occurs regularly. Slow growth limits the production of larger bass. Most of the bass were caught in the gillnets, away from the shoreline, during this survey. Anglers who fish in deeper water likely achieve acceptable catch rates of medium size fish.    Yellow perch abundance was near the low end of normal for this lake type. Perch grow slowly, and most of the fish were six inches long. Only one white sucker was caught in this survey, and no common carp were caught. Only one smallmouth bass was caught despite reports of anglers catching smallmouth bass on the lake. Smallmouth bass were stocked on alternate years from 1977 through 1983.    The presence of purple loosestrife and curled, or curly leaf, pondweed is of special concern. The threat to Big Pine Lake is the replacement of more fish and wildlife-friendly native shoreline plants with less suitable purple loosestrife.  Northern watermilfoil is common on the lake, as it is in other area lakes, and no eurasian watermilfoil was located. Other threats include development of increasingly unstable and unsuitable shoreline, leading to erosion, siltation and reduction in emergent plants. Bulrush bed sizes have decreased in recent years. Further degradation of shallow water areas could eventually lead to reductions in northern pike spawning success and a reduced pike fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Pine Lake is a moderately clear water lake located in southwestern Aitkin County and is part of the Mille Lacs watershed. There is a state owned public access located on the south side of the lake.  Big Pine Lake has a variety of habitats available to the angler from open, wind-swept gravel and rock, to areas of heavy vegetation. Shorelines vary from areas with gentle slopes and shallow depths to areas with sharp drop-offs and deep water. Mid-water areas consist primarily of deep water, but there are several gravel bars with steep sides that rise to within a few feet of the surface.  <br> \n <br> \nGamefish species available to anglers include walleye, northern pike, black crappie, bluegill and both largemouth and smallmouth bass.   Though there are some favorable spawning areas and minimal natural reproduction does occur, historically the better year classes have been those supplemented by stocking.  Walleye have been stocked with varying success in Big Pine Lake since the early 1900's. Due to poor returns from stocked fry in the late 1990's and early 2000's, fingerling stocking resumed and were stocked annually from 2004-2007.   Big Pine Lake then became part of a statewide research project to evaluate to effectiveness of stocking walleye frylings, which are an intermediate size between fry and fingerlings, and were stocked in 2008 and 2010.  Test nets in 2011 and 2103 suggested fryling stocking at Big Pine Lake were less successful than fingerlings. Current management has reverted to annual fingerling stocking.  Overall the walleye gill net CPUE has been stable and has averaged about 4-5/net the last three surveys. The walleye catch rate decreased slightly in 2016 (4/net), dropping slightly below the management goal of 5 per net, but still above the median value for lake class 23. The mean length was 14 inches, and fish up to 20.5 inches were sampled, which is smaller than recent surveys.  Five year classes were present, meeting management objectives.  Walleye fingerling survival will continue to be evaluated in upcoming surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThe gillnet CPUE for northern pike has not varied much in survey history and at 3.2/net in 2016, and is again near the long term average of 3.3/net spanning 13 surveys back to 1946.  This is normal for this lake type and meets the current management goal of 1.5 -5/gill net.  Though lower than last survey, the size structure is typically favorable with 20% of pike being longer than 24 inches and individuals up to 32 inches present in 2016.  Mean length of pike was 20.9 inches, which is the below the management goal of 24 inches.  The best way to maximize the benefits of this quality pike fishery is for anglers to recycle these fish. That way, more than one individual can experience the catching of a quality pike. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass catches have been stable at around 2/gill net for the last 20 years and were as high as 4/gill net in 2011.  In 2016, the largemouth bass catch rate was 2.3/gill net. In recent years, an increase in largemouth bass has been common in many lakes throughout the state.  The mean length of largemouth bass was 10 inches with individuals up to 14.5 inches.  Smallmouth bass are known to be present in small numbers in Big Pine Lake, however few have been observed in traditional sampling gear, and none were observed in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trap net catches were low again at 10.9/net when compared to the long term average of 30/net, however abundance of larger bluegills (>8\") improved for the second survey in a row.  Catch rates for hybrid sunfish have mirrored bluegill and have been increasing over the last few surveys.  Hybrids had a slight edge on the bluegills in terms of size structure with a mean size of 6.3 inches with individuals measuring out to 8.9 inches.  Although spawning habitat and escape cover is not limited, bluegills appear to be increasing the frequency with which they spawn with other species, which might partly explain the decrease in abundance.  The decline appears to be independent to the walleye stocking regime since the decline continued during the period of fry stocking when walleye survival (and potential predation) was very low.  If bluegill densities continue to remain at this low level, we may see an improvement in growth rates, and a continued improvement in size structure.   <br> \n <br> \nNice sized black crappies are also present in the fishery, but their abundance is very low.   <br> \n <br> \nDue to its proximity to Mille Lacs, and now Round Lake, invasive species are of great concern.  Boaters and lake shore equipment owners are encouraged to take extra precautions to help stop the spread aquatic invasive species. <br> \n</p>",
