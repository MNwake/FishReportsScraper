Only 5.5% of the bluegills sampled were 6 inches or longer. Black crappies were present in low numbers, but still within the normal range for this type of lake. The average length for black crappies was found to be 8.1 inches. Both bluegill and black crappies are stocked in the late spring/early summer by DNR Fisheries crews.Yellow and black bullhead were each sampled in low numbers. Carp, green sunfish, and white suckers were each sampled for the first time during this survey.Pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled within normal ranges for this type of lake. The average length fish caught was only 4 inches. Hybrid sunfish were rather abundant in this lake.</p>",

It is surrounded by a beautiful city park and contains two fishing piers for easy access for fishing the deeper holes in the pond.  Firemen's Pond is a Lake Class 40 lake that has been managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2007 and this is the first assessment completed by the FiN crew.  This pond is stocked annually with bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the primary species captured with a high abundance for this type of lake.  Bluegills ranged in length from 3.0 to 6.6 inches with an average length of 4.7 inches.  There were four black crappies captured, which is a low abundance for this lake type. Their lengths ranged from 6.7 to 9.5 inches with an average length of 8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOne northern pike was captured in the gill net.  It was 26.9 inches in length and weighed 4.0 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nAlthough electrofishing is the ideal way to target largemouth bass, there were a total of 3 largemouth bass captured during the survey.  One largemouth bass caught was 8 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in low numbers during this survey were common carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at:  www.mndnr.gov/fishing/fin. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Firemen's Pond is a 9-acre lake in the middle of downtown Chaska. In 2016 the City of Chaska completed a project that upgraded the surrounding park which has increased access to a large portion of the shoreline for fishing.  A portion of the pond is designated for swimming and sits adjacent to a playground and a picnic area. Firemen's Pond has been part of the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2007.  Since that time, this pond has been stocked annually with Bluegill and occasionally with Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie. For more information about the FiN program or FiN stocking updates, please visit us at: www.mndnr.gov/fishing/fin . <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the primary species captured with an abundance above average for similar lakes.  Though extremely abundant, Bluegill in the lake were small averaging 0.1 pounds per individual.    Bluegills ranged in length from 4.0 to 7.2 inches with an average length of 5.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was above average compared to similar lakes but individuals were small, averaging 0.1 pounds.   The average length of Black Crappie was 6 inches and ranged from 5.5 to 6.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed abundance was notable as well hybrid sunfish. Hybrid sunfish are a cross between 2 distinct sunfish species. Other species captured in lower abundance included Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike, Common Carp, and Largemouth Bass were not captured although they were present in the previous survey (2010). Gillnets were not used in the 2017 survey due to limited space caused by the existing walking bridge across the middle of the lake. Electrofishing is the typical means used to sample Largemouth Bass, but that method was not used for this survey <br> \n</p>",
