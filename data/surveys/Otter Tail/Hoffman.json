The maximum depth is 20 feet; however, the majority of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2012 lake survey was 11.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 12.7 feet. <br> \n      The shoreline is moderately developed with homes and cottages.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the southeast shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic vegetation (bulrush, cattail, and wild rice) is located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They are also important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Hoffman Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-bluegill type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     A high-density northern pike population exists.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 14.2 to 34.7 inches with an average length and weight of 18.0 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 17.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     The bluegill population has an excellent size structure.  Seventy-three percent of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.3 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Data from an electrofishing assessment in 2005 indicated that a balanced largemouth bass population with consistently good reproduction exists in Hoffman Lake.  <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium and large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Hoffman Lake is a 150-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately four miles south of Vergas, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 20 feet; however, the majority of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 12.7 feet. <br> \n     The shoreline is moderately developed with homes and cottages.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the southeast shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) is prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     A spring electrofishing survey was conducted to analyze the Largemouth Bass Population.  Catch and length data indicate that a balanced bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 7.7 to 18.0 inches with an average length and weight of 13.4 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass attain an average length of 13.5 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium and large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Hoffman Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.     <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Average weight of pike increased form 2.6 pounds in 1970 to 3.6 pounds and reproduction appears good as several age-classes were represented in the sample.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance doubled from 70.0 per trap net lift in 1970 to 142.3 per net.  Less than 1% of the bluegills measured were greater than 7.0 inches in length compared to 19% in 1970.   <br> \n     Largemouth bass reproduction appears good as the sample consisted of fish aged II+ through IV+.  <br> \n     Black crappie were not sampled in 1970, but abundance in this survey was 6.8 per trap net lift, more than seven times the area median.  Black crappie reproduction appears to be consistent as age-classes II+ through IV+ were represented in the sample.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance remains low at 1.0 per gill net lift.   <br> \n     Walleyes have not been stocked since 1970.  Walleye abundance was 3.0 per gill net lift, similar to 2.5 per net in 1970.  Average weight was 3.8 pounds.  All walleyes sampled were at least age VI+.  This suggests that walleye immigrated from West McDonald lake before the channel was closed off and that little reproduction occurs. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hoffman Lake is a 150-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County.  It has a maximum depth of 16 feet and 98% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 12.7 feet in 2005.  A DNR owned public access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Hoffman Lake is included in class 39 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.     Moderate development exists around the lake.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattail, and wild rice) is located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Hoffman Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-bluegill type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Hoffman Lake contains good, well balanced populations of largemouth bass, northern pike, and bluegill.       Catch data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that largemouth bass are very abundant.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 2.9 to 17.6 inches with an average length and weight of 13.1 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 11.4 inches at four years of age.     Northern pike are very abundant.  The test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the expected range for class 39 lakes.  Pike reproduction is also consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 15.1 to 34.0 inches with an average length and weight of 21.1 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 21.6 inches at five years of age.     Bluegill abundance is equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range.  The 1998 year class is strong and composed a majority of the sample.  Sixty-one percent of the bluegill sampled were greater than 7.0 inches in length.   Bluegill attain an average length of 6.9 inches at seven years of age.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.          </p>",
