                "narrative": "<p>  On June 16, 1993, a lake survey was conducted on Greigs Lake (lake class 20).  Standard netting and electrofishing methods were used to evaluate the present fish population status.  Greigs is managed for largemouth bass, northern pike, and panfish, however, little can be done to this lake due to its small size and lack of an official public access.  This lake, also known as Lake Ten, was named after former conservation officer Sheridan Greig.  He had his place of residence there, which is now St. Croix Camp II.  Local historians claim that Sheridan Greigs stocked lake sturgeon (circa 1930's) and trout into this lake.  Unofficial catches of lake sturgeon have been reported the past 20 years.  Northern pike abundance was normal for this type of lake with fish averaging 20.1 inches.  The average weight was 1.7 pounds.  Ages 4-6 were sampled with growth being typical of normal.  Largemouth bass abundance was high with fish ranging from 5.4 to 17.2 inches.  The average length was 10.5 inches and the average weight was 0.8 pounds.  Ages 3-9 were sampled with growth being slower than normal.  The bluegill abundance was normal for this lake type with fish up to 7.2 inches.  Average lengths were 4.7 inches and average weights were 0.08 pounds.  The bluegills ran small and were thin in appearance.  The black crappie abundance was very low with only 4 fish being sampled ranging from 4.8 to 10.3 inches.  Yellow perch have historically had low numbers in this lake.  The northern pike most likely keep the perch numbers down.  Pumpkinseeds have usually fared well with the bluegills.  Their abundance was above normal and their average length was 5.6 inches.  The remainder of the fish population consisted of:  brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and yellow bullhead.  Their abundance levels were below normal for this type of lake.  It would appear after reading this report that the overall fish population is low or fish tend to be small.  This is partially true in some regards since deep, clear, less fertile lakes like Greigs are prone to have low fish populations.  What usually occurs is that a few species do well in abundance and size/age ratio.  Other species may be lacking in presence or be abundant, but stunted to some degree.Prepared by:  Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",
