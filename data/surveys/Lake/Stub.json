                "narrative": "<p>Stub Lake is located approximately 7 miles NE of Ely. It has a surface area of 85 acres and a maximum depth of 20 ft. Aquatic vegetation is abundant and grows to depths near 10 ft. Access is primarily by a 120 rod portage from a parking area off CR 18. During periods of high water the outlet to Fall Lake can be navigated and a short 10 rod portage must be taken. There are no campsites present. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2012 (131.0/trap net) were considerably higher than the average when compared to similar lakes. The average bluegill sampled was 6 inches long and about 6 years old. The growth rate was slower than average compared to other lakes in this class. The largest bluegill sampled was 10.2 inches. Anglers are strongly encouraged to release the larger bluegill to preserve the quality size structure that is currently present. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in 2012 (4.0/trap net) were slightly above the average when compared to similar lakes. The average crappie sampled was 8.7 inches long and about 6 years old. The growth rate was slower than average compared to other lakes in this class. The largest crappie sampled was 10.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike, largemouth bass, rock bass and yellow perch were also sampled. Yellow perch numbers (4.8/trap net) were higher than average when compared to similar lakes. The largest perch sampled was 9.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
