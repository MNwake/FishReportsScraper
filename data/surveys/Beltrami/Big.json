                "narrative": "<p>Big lake, and others in class 27 are described as large, deep hard-water lakes with regular shorelines.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include: Andrusia, Grace, Clearwater, Big Wolf, Blackduck, and Kitchi.  There are 104 identified lakes in this class distributed throughout Minnesota, but primarily in the northern half of the state.    The walleye population is very good, exceeding that of more than 75% of the lakes in this class.  About one-third of the walleye were more than 15 inches in length, and about one-half were 11-14 inches long.  The largest walleye sampled was 25 inches long.  Walleye fingerlings were last stocked in Big lake in 1992, and appear to have contributed to a strong year class.  Walleye from that year class were about 12.5 inches in length during June of 1995.  Natural reproduction produced good year classes in 1988, and 1991.    Northern pike were also sampled at a rate higher than 75% of the lakes in class 27.  More than one-half of the northern pike sampled were between 15 and 20 inches long, with the largest about 35 inches long.  Big lake is a designated muskellunge management lake and dark house spearing has not been authorized since 1975.    Muskellunge were sampled by three different methods during 1995, with a total of 15 muskellunge captured.  Sizes ranged from 10.8 inches to 40.3 inches.  All muskellunge sampled came from year classes when muskellunge were stocked, though natural reproduction may be occurring.  Leech lake strain muskellunge        have been stocked intermittently since 1987.   Minimum legal harvest size for muskellunge from Big lake is 40 inches (total length).    Tullibee are abundant, and are an excellent forage source for northern pike, walleye, and muskellunge.  Gill netting for Tullibee is not authorized, though subsistence netting by reservation band members is permitted.  Tullibee may be taken by angling.    Yellow perch were sampled at above average abundance, with an average size of about 6.8 inches.  About 20 percent of the perch sampled were more than 8 inches long.  Neascus Spp (black spot) and yellow grub, are present though the incidence appears to be low.    Class 27 lakes are generally considered as walleye/ northern pike/ perch lakes and will not typically have high populations of bass, or panfish, though individual fish sizes will often be good.    Largemouth bass are present in Big lake, in slightly below average abundance, but the size appears to be good with about two-thirds of the bass sampled being more than 12 inches long.  The largest bass sampled was 15.8 inches long.    Bluegill were sampled in about average abundance, for the lake class, and the size is good at about 7.2 inches, and one-third pound.  The largest bluegill sampled was about 9 inches long.  Pumpkinseed and rock bass were also sampled in good abundance, and the size is better than average, at about one-third pound.    Black crappie are also above average in abundance, and size for this lake class.  Most crappie sampled were 9-10.5 inches long.    Black, yellow, and brown bullheads were sampled with browns the most abundant, and the largest.  Average bullhead weight was about one pound.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake is 3533-acre lake with a maximum depth of 35 feet.  The lake is located eight miles east of Bemidji in east central Beltrami County.  The lake is entirely within both the Leech Lake Indian Reservation and the Chippewa National Forest.  There is a US Forest Service public access in the southeast corner of the lake off of Forest Service Road 2177.  The DNR manages the lake for walleye, muskellunge, northern pike and bluegill.Walleye is the primary species of concern on Big Lake.  Once thought to be capable of sustaining desirable levels without stocking, poor reproductive success resulted in declines in walleye abundance.  An aggressive stocking program initiated in 2000 appears to be very successful with young walleye again being very abundant in the population.  Anglers will notice improved fishing as these young fish grow to acceptable size.Muskellunge are native to Big Lake, though numbers were thought to have been greatly diminished by the 1960s.  Stocking has been successful in providing a quality population that is popular with the anglers.  Though standard netting assessments in the summer seldom sample muskies, reported angler success has been good with 40 - 50 inch fish quite common.  A spearing ban is in place to protect muskies from inadvertently being speared.There is good natural reproduction of northern pike.  In fact, natural reproduction has produced an over abundance of small pike.  This coupled with a high harvest of desirable size pike has resulted in a population dominated by small fish.  In the most recent assessment, 88% of the pike sampled were less than 24 inches in length.  An experimental regulation implemented in 2003, protecting all northern pike between 24 - 36 inches, hopes to reverse this trend.Bluegill provides a lesser known, quality component to this fishery.  Abundance in the 2003 assessment was at an all time high and was spread over multiple ages.  Since preferred habitat may be limited to the smaller bays, and it takes many years to produce 8 - 10 inch bluegill, this population could decline in quality by over harvest.  To maintain or improve good quality, anglers need to use some restraint if large bluegill are really biting.  Release the larger bluegill and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size bluegill have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.Yellow perch, important for their value as a food fish for predator fish such as northern pike and walleye, also provide anglers some very desirable sizes, exceeding 10 inches.  Other species present and adding to the diversity of the population include pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, largemouth bass and black crappie.As with many lakes in the Bemidji area, there has been much development and has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  Shoreline areas are critical areas for fish production and water quality.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife and clean water that is associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can greatly affect a lake's ability to produce fish and protect water quality.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting.  For more information on how to accomplish this, contact your nearest Area Fisheries office.</p>",

A targeted survey was completed by the Bemidji Area Fisheries staff on Big Lake during early July of 2019 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 24 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community.  Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted.  A total of 13 sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at all 24 sites.  A total of 25 species of fish were sampled, which included nine species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Muskellunge, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from the standard survey completed in 2019 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Big Lake.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicated Big Lake is in good health with a FIBI score above the impairment threshold and uniform with the exceptional threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",

The electrofishing assessment in 2016 was phase 2 of a two-year population estimate.  A targeted assessment for muskies using large-frame trap nets was conducted in 2015 and all 30 captured adults were marked with a fin clip.  Electrofishing was conducted the following spring to derive a population estimate from the proportion of recaptures. <br> \n <br> \nNear the end of April, 2016, electrofishing was conducted on five nights to capture adult muskies during the spawning season.  During 17.5 total hours of electrofishing, 17 fish were captured.  Of those 17 fish, 6 were males, 10 were females, and 1 was immature.  Lengths ranged from 17.3 to 52.2 inches and averaged 44.0 inches.  Weights ranged from 0.7 to 36.1 lbs. and averaged 16.7 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nFour of the 16 mature fish captured in 2016 had a fin clip from 2015.  Utilizing a simple model to estimate population size, approximately 120 adult Muskellunge inhabited the 3,596 acre lake in 2015 at a density of 0.03 muskies per surface-acre.  Though a seemingly low density, this is a typical density of mature adults for a lake of this size.  It illustrates how low to moderate exploitation can deplete these populations.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake is a 3,596 acre lake that is popular among local and destination anglers alike.  Mostly known for Muskellunge and Walleye, large Yellow Perch and Bluegill have also been popular attractions in past years.  Big Lake is located about 13 miles east of Bemidji in the Chippewa National Forest and has one public access on the east side maintained by the U.S. Forest Service.  Big Lake has a lot of mid-lake structure as well as shallow back bays for cover on windy days.  The lake has a maximum depth of 35 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are the most popular species sought on Big Lake.  During the 2019 standard survey, 58 Walleye were captured in 15 gillnets resulting in a catch rate of nearly 4 fish/net, slightly below the 15 year average.  Average size was nearly 15 inches with the largest fish captured just under 26 inches.  Walleye are stocked every spring as newly hatched fry.  This fry stocking is evaluated each fall with electrofishing gear to check on fry to fingerling survival.  In just over one hour of field work, 35 Walleye fingerlings were captured and released resulting in a catch rate of 34 fish/hour.  Catch rates at this level indicate a high likelihood of a successful year class.    <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are also popular and maintained with supplemental stocking on an annual basis.  Only three juvenile muskies were captured during the 2019 survey which is not unusual because they tend to avoid standard survey nets.  Special spring trap net assessments are typically used to evaluate Muskellunge populations.  The most recent targeted netting was in 2015 and yielded 32 total Muskellunge with lengths up to 53.2 inches and individual weights just short of 30 pounds.  In 2016, a follow-up assessment generated a population estimate of just over 100 mature muskies in Big Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were captured during the standard survey with a catch rate of just under 5 fish/net.  Lengths observed were generally small, although angler reports indicate that there are some decent sized pike in Big Lake.  Either way, pike can provide an excellent opportunity for young anglers or simply provide some action when other fish refuse to bite. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are abundant and can occasionally achieve large sizes.  During the survey in 2019, 210 Bluegills were captured in trap nets with lengths up to 8.9 inches. <br> \nLargemouth Bass were not specifically targeted during this survey; nonetheless, 41 bass were captured with lengths that exceeded 19 inches and averaged just over 12 inches.  Big Lake isn't generally thought of as a bass lake but there are plenty of nice-sized, healthy fish to pursue. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are abundant with some fish exceeding the 11 inch mark.  A total of 434 perch were captured in gillnets with lengths ranging from 5 to 11 inches and an average size of 7 inches.  Perch are one of the most important species in Big Lake, not only from a sport fish standpoint, but also as prey for Walleyes, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and Muskellunge.   <br> \n <br> \nCisco (tullibee) are another important species for Big Lake.  Thriving in cool, clean water, their presence is an indication of good water quality.  A total of 35 were captured in gillnets with lengths up to 15.8 inches present.  Much like perch, tullibee are a valuable prey species as they are easy to digest and rich in calories and fats. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake is a 3500 acre shallow, windswept basin located in eastern Beltrami County, within the confines of the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Reservation.  Much of the shoreline is developed and most of what is not developed is either unsuitable for development or is owned by the USFS or LLR.  Large bulrush stands dominate the shallow areas and contribute to adequate bass and panfish natural reproduction.  Care is taken to protect the natural vegetation areas by closely monitoring aquatic vegetation removal permits and development.  Primary management in Big Lake is for walleye and muskellunge but northern pike, largemouth bass, yellow perch, and sunfish are also important components of this fishery.  Walleye stocking has occurred on Big Lake at various rates and frequencies for many years.  Aging from previous assessments suggested that natural reproduction might be contributing substantially to the walleye population.  Similar lakes on connected waters have recently been producing excellent natural year classes not attributed to stocking events.  To accurately determine the extent of natural reproduction in Big Lake, walleye stocking was suspended in 1992.  It was hoped that natural reproduction would be adequate to carry the population.  Fall electofishing in 1997, 1998, and 1999 produced no young of the year walleye, so it was no surprise in the 1999 netting assessment to see very few small walleye in our sample.  Ninety-eight percent of the 1999 sample was over 15 inches and 74 percent of the sample was between 16 and 20 inches.  Even though the overall walleye catch rate was above the management goal for the lake, and higher than any previous assessment except 1995, the lack of small walleye triggered a return to stocking.  Walleye fingerlings and yearlings were stocked in the fall of 1999, followed by 2,100,000 fry in the spring of 2000.  Fall electrofishing will be used to document spring fry stocking success.  If it was not successful, fall fingerlings will be stocked once again.  After this initial intensive stocking effort a new management plan will determine what long term maintenance stocking may be necessary.Big Lake is connected to the Mississippi River through Big Lake Creek and Lake Andrusia and is thus a natural muskellunge lake.  The muskellunge population has historically been quite low, but stocking in recent years has bolstered the population to a more fishable level.  A muskellunge assessment in 1999 captured 101 fish with none over 49.1\".  Length frequency distributions and aging suggested most year classes back to 1988 were present.The panfish fishery is composed primarily of yellow perch and bluegill, with smaller numbers of black crappie, pumpkinseed, and rock bass.  Overall numbers of panfish are not high but anglers do target their favorite species seasonally.  Size of all panfish species is higher than average but low numbers limits angling pressure.  Most are free from external parasites.Quality largemouth bass are present but no special assessment has been conducted specifically targeting them.  Future assessments should include electrofishing for bass.Other species sampled in small numbers in 1999 include tullibee, black, yellow, and brown bullheads, bowfin, and white sucker. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake is 3533-acre lake with a maximum depth of 35 feet.  It is located eight miles east of Bemidji and east central Beltrami County.  The lake is entirely within the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Indian Reservation.  There is a US Forest Service public access in the southeast corner of the lake off of Forest Service Road 2177.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Big Lake is in lake class 27.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Andrusia, Blackduck, Big Turtle, Clearwater, Kitchi, Marquette and Big Wolf Lakes.  Typically lakes in this lake class are large, deep, hardwater lakes with regular shaped shorelines.  Walleye are an important management species for all Bemidji area class 27 lakes.  Other species managed for in Big Lake are muskellunge, bluegill, and northern pike.  With the exception of black bullhead, all species of fish typically found in a lake class 27 fish community are found in Big Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThere are a couple of special fishing regulations in effect on Big Lake that anglers should be aware of.  The minimum size limit for muskellunge is 48 inches.  All muskellunge less than 48 inches must be immediately released.  <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are native to Big Lake but population density was low. Supplemental stocking first occurred in 1969 and efforts intensified in 1986 when a consistent supply of Leech Lake strain fingerlings became available.  An excellent muskellunge fishery has developed. Musky stocking density was reduced in 2001 but continues on alternate years to maintain a moderate level of recruitment. This fishery is now a popular musky fishing destination with opportunity for 50+ inch muskellunge.   <br> \n  <br> \nBig Lake also has a 24\" - 36\" protected slot for northern pike that was implemented in 2003.  This regulation is intended to improve the quality of pike population and help maintain a more balanced predator population.  A long-term objective of the protected size regulation is to eventually shift the population from a high-density small pike population to a lower density population of larger pike.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance had been consistently high, averaging 17 pike per gill net set over the past four assessments. The catch rate dropped sharply in 2007 to just 7.7 per gill net. If this decline is a result of the recent regulation change improvement has occurred more rapidly than expected. Hopefully this indicates a significant long-term shift toward a lower density pike population and not just normal sampling variability.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in this assessment at 4.1/gill net set.  This catch rate may be a poor representation of actual abundance since the current population is dominated by young fish not fully recruited to the sampling gear.  Fall electrofishing in recent years has documented successful recruitment of young walleye from fry stocking. This is supported by the size structure from the gill nets where 66% of the wallerye sample is less than 15 inches.  All indications are good for walleye fishing on Big Lake over the next few years.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are important both as a recreational fish for anglers and as a forage fish for predators such as walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge.  In 2007 perch ranged length from 5 to 11 inches with 19% greater than 9 inches, sizes generally considered acceptable to anglers.  This was an increase over 2003 where only 6% were greater than 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnother species that anglers have success catching is bluegill. This assessment sampled a lot of 6-8 inch bluegill, but few larger than 8 inches.  In the past, the lake has had a reputation for larger bluegills, and there is some concern about quality over-harvest.  In order to improve quality, anglers are encouraged to show some voluntary restraint when bluegill are biting well.  By practicing selective harvest, anglers can harvest the smaller more abundant bluegill for eating and release more of the medium to large fish.  This will help maintain balance in the population and increase the opportunity to catch large bluegill in the future. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2007 include largemouth bass, black crappie, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and tullibee. <br> \n <br> \nMuch of the shoreline around Big Lake is privately owned and subject to development.  Development pressure is increasing around the shorelines and within the watersheds on Minnesota lakes.  This degrades water quality and impacts valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients, and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.  For more information on how to accomplish this, contact the nearest Area Fisheries office or go to the following website:  www.dnr.state.mn.us/shorelandmgmt. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake is a 3,592-acre lake with a maximum depth of 35 feet located 12 miles east of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  Big Lake lies within the Chippewa National Forest.  There is a USFS public water access consisting of a single lane concrete boat ramp with parking for about 12 trucks/trailers located on the east shore of the lake off of CSAH 33 (Mission Road).  Important species in the fish community include northern pike, muskellunge, walleye, panfish (including black crappie), yellow perch, tullibee (cisco) largemouth bass, redhorse/sucker and bullhead species.  There is a special regulation in effect for northern pike consisting of a 3 fish bag limit with a protected slot limit from 24 to 36 inches, and one fish over 36 inches allowed in possession.  Statewide regulations apply to all other species. <br> \n <br> \nBig Lake is a good multi-species fishery that provides consistent angling opportunities for most of the major species of gamefish found in the Bemidji area.  During the open-water season, Big Lake primarily attracts walleye, panfish and muskellunge anglers.  High quality, diverse habitat exists within Big Lake for all of these species.  There are numerous shoreline points, drop-offs and inside turns as well as off-shore humps and rock piles.  Bulrush stands are extensive, and submerged aquatic vegetation is abundant, particularly the various species of pondweed that anglers refer to as \"cabbage.\" <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked annually in Big Lake, and natural reproduction does occur from time to time.  The 2011 population assessment showed a stable walleye population with good numbers of younger fish (ages 1 to 3) that indicate successful recruitment from recent stocking efforts.  Age-5 walleye were the most abundant year class captured in the assessment, and these fish averaged 15.4 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nManagement of muskellunge in the state of Minnesota has gained national attention in recent years, and Big Lake has become known as a destination lake for quality musky fishing, including the opportunity to catch trophy-class (50-inch +) fish.  Big Lake has benefitted from the ongoing research into musky genetics and stocking strategies that has been conducted in Minnesota in recent years.  Muskellunge are not sampled effectively in standard population assessments, but previous assessments directed at muskellunge have resulted in relatively high net catch rates when compared to other musky lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe special northern pike regulation in effect on Big Lake was implemented in 2003 to increase the number of larger pike and restore balance to the population, which had become dominated by high numbers of smaller pike.  The 2011 assessment showed that the abundance of northern pike had declined from high levels documented in earlier assessments, but the proportion of larger pike (greater than 24 inches in length) has not increased substantially.  Northern pike are readily caught on Big Lake, and can offer lots of action for young and old anglers alike. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill captured in the 2011 assessment had a good average size at 6.6 inches in length and 0.24 lbs/fish.  A good proportion (14%) of the bluegill captured were over 8 inches in length, with fish up to 8.9 inches present.  Bluegill numbers were down from previous assessments, but this may be the result of survey timing, as the 2011 state government shutdown pushed the start date of the Big Lake assessment back to late August, when bluegill are not utilizing shallow shoreline habitats as frequently as they do in early to mid-summer when most assessments have been conducted in the past. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie from 4 year classes were identified, which represents a diverse population with 2 of 4 year classes being sexually mature.  Black crappie had an average size of 9.4 inches and 0.69 lbs/fish, which is above the upper quartile value for class 27 lakes.   The largest black crappie captured in 2011 was 13 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake is a 3,596 acre lake that is popular among local and destination anglers alike. Mostly known for Muskellunge and Walleye, large Yellow Perch have also been popular attractions in past years. Big Lake is located about 13 miles east of Bemidji in the Chippewa National Forest and has one public access on the east side maintained by the U.S. Forest Service. Big Lake has a lot of mid-lake structure as well as shallow back bays for cover on windy days. The lake has a maximum depth of 35 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are the most popular species sought on Big Lake and are stocked annually in the spring. During the 2022 survey, 64 Walleye were captured in 15 gillnets resulting in a catch rate of just over 4 fish/net, slightly below the 15 year average. Average size was nearly 17 inches with the largest fish captured just under 24 inches. Big is stocked annually with Walleye fry. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are also popular and maintained with supplemental stocking on an annual basis. Only one juvenile muskie was captured during the 2022 survey which was not unusual because they are rarely captured in gillnets. The next spring trap net assessment targeting Muskellunge is scheduled for the spring of 2023. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were captured during the survey with a catch rate of just over 5 fish/net. Lengths observed were generally small, although a 34 inch pike was measured and angler reports indicate that there are some decent sized pike in Big Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are abundant with some fish exceeding the 11 inch mark. A total of 138 perch were captured in gillnets with lengths ranging from 4 to 11 inches and an average size of 7 inches. Perch are one of the most important species in Big Lake, not only from a sport fish standpoint, but also as prey for Walleyes, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge.   <br> \n <br> \nCisco (tullibee) are another important species for Big Lake. Thriving in cool, clean water, their presence is an indication of good water quality. A total of 97 were captured in gillnets with lengths up to 15.8 inches present. Much like perch, tullibee are a valuable prey species as they are easy to digest and rich in calories and fats. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake is a 3,533 acre fishery that is very popular among local anglers and destination fishermen alike.  Mostly known for Muskellunge and Walleye, large Yellow Perch and Bluegill have also been popular attractions in past years.  Big Lake is located about 13 miles east of Bemidji in the Chippewa National Forest and has one public access on the east side maintained by the U.S. Forest Service.  Big Lake has a lot of structure and breaks as well as shallow back bays for cover on windy days.  The lake has a maximum depth of 35 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nA special regulation protects Northern Pike from 24 through 36 inches with one allowed over 36 inches.  Darkhouse spearing, which until recently was closed, is now open again to state anglers for pike and rough fish.  <br> \n <br> \nFour different assessments including Muskellunge spring trap netting, Largemouth Bass night electrofishing, a standard lake survey, and fall night electrofishing for young-of-the-year Walleye were conducted on Big Lake in 2015.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are the most popular species sought on Big Lake.  During the standard survey, 79 Walleye were captured in 15 gillnets resulting in a catch rate of 5.3 fish/net, slightly above the 15 year average.  The average length was 15.2 inches with the largest fish captured more than 24 inches, though larger fish have been reported.  Walleye are stocked every spring as newly hatched fry at a rate of 1000 fry/littoral-acre.  This fry stocking is evaluated in the fall with electrofishing to check on fry to fingerling survival.  In just over one hour of field work, 44 Walleye fingerlings were captured and released resulting in a catch rate of 43 fish/hour.  Catch rates at this level indicate a high likelihood of a successful year class.    <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are also very popular and also maintained with supplemental stocking.  Because muskies tend to avoid the nets during standard surveys, spring trap net assessments are used to target mature fish during their spawning season.  Netting in 2015 yielded 32 total Muskellunge with lengths up to 53.2 inches and individual weights just short of 30 pounds.  Of the 30 muskies that were mature, 14 were males and 16 were females.  All of the mature fish were marked with a fin clip that will be recognizable during follow-up electrofishing in 2016 where the ratio of new and recaptured fish will generate a population estimate.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled during the standard survey with a catch rate of 8.4 fish/net.  Lengths observed were generally small, though reports from lake shore owners indicate that there are some decent sized pike in Big Lake.  Either way, pike can provide an excellent opportunity for young anglers or simply provide some action when other fish refuse to bite.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are abundant and can occasionally achieve larger sizes.  During the survey in 2015, 102 Bluegills were captured in trap nets with lengths up to 8.7 inches.  Size structure appears to be declining in recent years, probably because of increased angling pressure.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were captured during a night electrofishing assessment in early June of 2015.  During a little more than two hours of operating time, 154 bass were captured resulting in an excellent catch rate of 73 fish/hour.  Lengths exceeded 19 inches and averaged just over 13 inches.  Big Lake isn't generally thought of as a bass lake but there are plenty of nice-sized, healthy fish to pursue. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are very abundant with a few exceeding the 10 inch mark.  A total of 245 fish were captured in gillnets with lengths ranging from 5.2 to 11.4 inches and a mean size of 7.2 inches.  Just over 27% of YEP were over eight inches in length and 11% were over nine inches.  Perch are one of the most important species in Big Lake, not only from a sport fish standpoint, but also as prey for larger Walleyes, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge.  Perch provide the forage base for the lake as well as draw predation away from young Walleyes.   <br> \n <br> \nCisco (tullibee) are another important species for Big Lake.  Thriving in cool, clean water, their presence is an indication of good water quality.  A total of 49 were captured in gillnets with lengths up to 15.9 inches present.  Much like perch, tullibee are valuable prey species as they are easy to digest and contain a lot of energy and fats.   <br> \n</p>",

A targeted assessment for muskies using large-frame trap nets was conducted in 2023 as part of a two-phased evaluation. Electrofishing is planned for spring 2024 to derive a population estimate from the proportion of recaptures. <br> \n <br> \nIn May 2023, trap netting was conducted to capture adult muskies during the spring spawning season. This resulted in capture and release of 39 adult Muskellunge. Sizes ranged from over 28 to 51 inches and averaged just short of 44 inches in length. Fin clips were taken for ageing purposes; the oldest fish found was 19, though the majority were between 12 and 14 years old. <br> \n</p>",
