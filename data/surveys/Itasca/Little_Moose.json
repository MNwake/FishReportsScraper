                "narrative": "<p>Little Moose Lake is managed primarily for muskellunge and walleye.  The type of gear used in this assessment, however, isn't effective at measuring muskie abundance.  Instead, a trapnetting assessment was conduced in the spring of 1995, which should be referred to for information on the muskie population.     Walleye were sampled in the gill nets at a rate within the expected range for this type of lake and near the rate set as a long range goal in the management plan.  The mean size of these walleye appears to be good (length = 18.2 inches;  weight = 2.0 pounds).  Growth appears to be good.  Most of the walleye that were sampled were from years in which neither Little Moose nor Moose were stocked, suggesting that natural reproduction may be sufficient to maintain the walleye population without stocking.     Northern pike were also sampled in gill nets at a rate within the expected range.  The northern pike that were sampled had a mean length of 23.7 inches and a mean weight of 2.9 pounds.     Black crappie were sampled in the trap nets at a rate within the expected range.  They ranged from 4.9 to 9.3 inches in length.  Only two crappie were sampled in the gill nets, but they were both larger than any of the crappie sampled in trap nets.     Yellow perch were sampled in the gill nets at a rate slightly above the expected range for this type of lake.  They ranged from 5.3 to 10.0 inches in length.       Bluegill were sampled in trap nets at a rate below the expected rate.  Lakes with low bluegill abundance are typically more likely to produce larger bluegill than those with high bluegill abundance.  The bluegill sampled in trap nets ranged from 3.5 to 8.5 inches in length.     Other species sampled in this assessment include:  muskellunge, white sucker, rock bass and common shiner.     Lake shore owners and users have the ability to insure that Little Moose Lake will continue to produce a quality fishery by practicing wise use of the land and water to preserve water quality and fish habitat.  Anglers might also consider practicing catch and release or selective harvest in order to keep the fishery healthy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Moose Lake is a class 31 lake located 14 miles northwest of Grand Rapids, MN.  The outlet of Little Moose Lake flows into Moose Lake that flows into the Deer River and eventually to the Mississippi River.  The lake has one earthen public access and low shoreline development.  The 2002 lake management plan indicates muskellunge as the primary species of management with black crappie, bluegill, and walleye as secondary species.  The 2011 assessment also included additional sampling of near shore fish species in order to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled with gill nets (4.0 fish/net) and trap nets (5.9 fish/net) effectively in the 2011 assessment.  The catches for both gears were above the lake class third quartiles but were typical for Little Moose Lake.  The sampled fish were similar in size for both gears.  The gill net sampled fish ranged from 4.5 to 9.2 inches and had a mean length of 8.0 inches while the trap net sampled fish ranged from 3.6 to 9.7 inches and had a mean length of 7.3 inches.  Eight year-classes from 1 to 8 years old were identified from scales.  Growth was poor compared to statewide averages with fish averaging 7.5 inches after five years of growth.  The slower growth is consistent with the higher density population. <br> \n <br> \nTrap-net catch rates for bluegill have been below the lake class first quartile (6.1 fish/net) in all but one assessment.  The trap-net catch was 4.6 fish/net in 2011.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.3 to 9.1 inches and had a mean length of 6.9 inches.  Eight age-classes were identified from scales ranging from age 1 to age 9.  Age-5 fish were the most commonly sampled.  In general, growth was average; however, mean back-calculated lengths-at-age were greater than (>115% of median) those reported for class 31 lakes for older ages. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by spring night electrofishing for the first time in 2011.  The catch of 15.0 largemouth bass/hr on-time would suggest a low density population.  Largemouth bass ranged from 11.8 to 18.2 inches with a mean length of 14.6 inches.  Nine year-classes were identified from scales ranging from age 3 to age 11.  Growth was similar to the statewide averages for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are not sampled effectively using our standard summer assessment gear.  As a result, only one muskellunge was captured and it was 28.5 inches and weighed 6.1 pounds. Muskellunge were sampled during a spring assessment in 2011 (see Little Moose Lake Muskellunge Special Assessment for details).  Ten large-framed trap nets were set on 4/26/11 and were lifted for 12 days.  A total of 15 muskellunge were captured of which two were recaptures from earlier in the assessment.  Two of the fish had previously been caught and marked in Moose Lake; thus documenting migration from Moose Lake.  These fish were both last observed in Moose Lake in the spring of 2009.  The sampled fish ranged from 31.8 to 47.7 inches and had a mean length of 41.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net catch rates have been fairly stable (4.5 to 12.2 fish/net) since 1974.  The northern pike gill-net catch was 6.0 in 2011 which was near the lake class median of 6.7 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 18.4 to 31.6 inches and had a mean length of 22.4 inches.  Northern pike were not aged in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have generally been stable ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 since 1979.  In 2011, the catch was below the first quartile value and the lowest on record at 0.5 fish/gill net.  The sampled fish ranged from 18.1 to 20.7 inches and had a mean length of 19.6 inches.  Three year-classes from age 4 to 9 were identified from scales and opercles.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages.  Walleye averaged 16.1 inches at age 4.  It appears the population has been maintained by immigration from Moose Lake since good spawning habitat is limited in Little Moose Lake.  Lower population numbers may follow periods of low water level that could hinder immigration from Moose Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch rates have been relatively stable in the last few assessments.  In 2011, the catch was 28.2 fish/gill net, which is between the lake class median and third quartile value.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.3 to 7.9 inches and had a mean length of 6.1 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected.  Based on the size distribution, anglers would not likely target yellow perch but they remain an important part of the fish community as a prey species.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the population assessment included bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker.  Additional species observed during IBI sampling included banded killifish, blackchin shiner, bluntnose minnow, brook stickleback, central mudminnow, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, least darter, longear sunfish, and tadpole madtom.  The least darter is considered a species of concern in Minnesota while the longear sunfish has very spotty distribution.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Moose is a shallow, moderately productive lake located 14 miles northwest of Grand Rapids, MN.  The outlet of Little Moose Lake flows into Moose Lake that flows into the Deer River and eventually to the Mississippi River.  Navigation of the channel is limited to a determined person in a canoe/kayak.  The lake has an earthen public access with limited parking and low shoreline development. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Moose supports a variety of aquatic vegetation species with habitat for Largemouth Bass, Muskie, Northern Pike and panfish.  The 2012 lake management plan indicates Muskie as the primary species of management with Black crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike as secondary species.  The management goals were to: maintain a Muskie population with 60-80% longer than 30 inches and 10-30% longer than 42 inches, provide Black Crappie and Bluegill fisheries with the opportunity to catch some 10-inch crappie and 8-inch Bluegill, provide a pike fishery having a catch of 5.0/gill net with 50% longer than 21 inches and 10% longer than 28 inches, and provide a limited Walleye fishery through natural reproduction and immigration from Moose Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in August 2023 to assess the status of the fishery.  The survey used 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets but gears targeting bass and Muskie were not included.  The 2023 survey included additional sampling of near shore fish species in order to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score.  The IBI information is available in a separate report. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were effectively sampled with gill nets (8.7 fish/net) and trap nets (3.0 fish/net) in the 2023 survey.  Catches for both gears were high compared to other lakes with similar habitat.  The trap-net catch was typical for Little Moose Lake but high in the gill nets.  The gill-net sampled fish ranged from 4.5 to 12.3 inches and averaged 8.4 inches while the trap net sampled fish ranged from 4.3 to 11.4 inches and averaged 8.2 inches.  Nine year-classes from 1 to 10 years old were identified from scales.  Growth was slow compared to similar lakes. The fish averaged 8.5 inches after four years of growth.  The slower growth is consistent with the higher density population.  Anglers should expect good action of moderate sized crappie.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap-net catch rates for Bluegill have been lower in all but one survey.  The catch was 2.3 fish/trap net in 2023.  The sampled Bluegill ranged from 3.9 to 8.9 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  Six year-classes were identified from scales ranging from age 2 to age 8.  Age-3 fish were the most commonly sampled.  Growth rates have improved compared to prior surveys with fish approaching 8 inches after five years.  The population should provide good angling opportunities at times. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches have fluctuated from 4.5 to 12.2 fish/gill net since 1974.  The pike catch of 10.8/gill net in 2023 was the second highest recorded for the lake.  The sampled fish ranged from 16.2 to 35.8 inches but only averaged 20.4 inches.  Seven year-classes from age 1 to 9 were estimated from bony structures.  Nearly 70% of the sample were age 3 and 4.  Growth was similar to statewide averages through age 4 with fish averaging 20.5 inches.  The few larger fish sampled grew faster than the statewide average.  Anglers can expect to have relatively fast action from smaller pike but are encouraged to release larger fish.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches have ranged from 0.3 to 3.0 since 1979.  The two most recent surveys (2011 and 2023) experienced the lowest catches on record.  The 2023 catch of 0.3 fish/gill net was also low compared to other lakes with similar habitat.  The two sampled fish were 20.9 and 26.4 inches.  The sample size was too low to evaluate age and growth.  The population has been maintained by immigration from Moose Lake since good spawning habitat is limited in Little Moose Lake.  The low catches in Little Moose reflect the poor recruitment experienced in Moose Lake in the last 12 years. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have been above average for this type of lake in most surveys.  The perch catch declined from 28.2/gill net in 2011 to 3.8/gill net in 2023.  The 2023 catch was the lowest on record.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.9 to 9.5 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.  Based on the size distribution, anglers would not likely target perch but they remain an important part of the fish community as a prey species.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the survey included Bowfin, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass and Yellow Bullhead.  Additional species observed during IBI sampling included Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Common Shiner, Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Mimic Shiner, Northern Sunfish and Spottail Shiner.  </p>",

The lake is 271 acres and has a maximum depth of 23 feet.  A survey targeting nearshore fish species was conducted by Area fisheries staff beginning on 3 July, 2023.  Ten sampling sites (100 feet long) were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-ft 1/8th inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining was conducted at 7 sites using the 15-ft seine.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 19 different species: 12 species by seining and 13 species by backpack electrofishing.  The species can be found in the gear-specific catch tables in this report. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used with the gill net and trap net data from the standard survey conducted on 14 August, 2023, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of lake health.  The surveys will assist the watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

The 1991 assessment showed a CPUE of 12.2 with an average weight of 2.2 lbs.  When compared to all lakes statewide that are ecologically similar and grouped into lake class #29 this CPUE is above the third quartile for both numbers and weight while growth rates for young fish were above average.During the spring muskellunge assessments done in 1986 and 1990 no population estimates were made because of small sample sizes.  Only one muskellunge and one tiger muskellunge were sampled during the 1991 assessment.  Natural reproduction may be taking place and documented migration from Moose Lake and hibridization is occurring.Rough fish abundance of bullhead were represented by three species with a relatively low but stable population.  White sucker gill net CPUE's were 3.0, putting their abundance above the third quartile for this lake class in both numbers and weight.Both largemouth bass and pumpkinseed have low, stable populations and rock bass abundance has declined from 1974.  Bluegill levels have risen to a high of 13.7/trap net but still remain below lake class medians.  The bluegill have average growth rates with 50% age class III's or younger and good size with a PSD of 67 (67% > quality size of 6\") and an RSD - 7 of 58 (58% > 7\").  Black crappie catch rates declined from 1974 but have now risen above those levels to a trap net catch rate of 5.3, well above the lake class third quartile, with an average weight of 0.58 lbs./fish.  This species has normal growth rates and good size although almost 60% are age class III's.  They have a PSD of 91 (91% > quality size of 8\") and an RSD - 10 of 34 (34% > preferred size of 10\").The 1974 yellow perch gill net CPUE was 78, dropping off rapidly to 5.2 in 1984.  This population has now rebounded up to a CPUE of 13.6 in this assessment which is slightly above lake class medians.The walleye population was also high in 1974 with a gill net catch rate of 8.5, then dropping to 1.2 in 1979.  At the present time the gill net CPUE is 1.8 which is slightly above lake class medians.  55% of this sample were from the 1989 year class.  Several other year classes since 1974 are also from non-stocked years.  Spawning success of migrating Moose Lake walleye and local walleye has been sufficient in sustaining the population.  It is inconclusive to say walleye fry and fingerling stocking has contributed to any major year classes.</p>",

There is an earthen public access on the west side of the lake with limited parking.  The lake has two inlets and one outlet to Moose Lake, another Muskellunge lake. <br> \n <br> \nSpring Muskellunge surveys have been conducted seven times on Little Moose Lake since 1986.  These data are used to evaluate changes in management such as regulations, stocking regimes, and the effect of catch and release on the population.  Muskellunge are native to Little Moose Lake but the extent of natural reproduction in the lake is unknown.  Muskellunge were stocked six times from 1968 to 1977 with Shoepack strain ancestry and once in 1988 with Leech Lake strain ancestry fish.  Immigration from Moose Lake and an unknown amount of natural reproduction has sustained the low Muskellunge population.   <br> \n <br> \nRecent spring surveys have used large-frame trap nets (LTN) to sample Muskellunge shortly after ice-out.  Due to staffing reductions and a concurrent Muskellunge survey on Moose Lake (20 LTN) in 2018, it was determined a few nights of electrofishing should provide similar information to a netting survey, while requiring substantially less physical labor and time.  Night electrofishing was conducted on 5/7, 5/10, and 5/14/18 for roughly 8.5 hrs of run-time.  The entire lake was considered the station.  All Muskellunge were measured for length, identified for sex/ripeness, anal fin rays were removed to estimate age, scales were collected for genetics, and each fish received a PIT tag.  Recaptured fish were recorded each day but were not re-measured. <br> \n <br> \nThe three nights of electrofishing were seasonally mild but one was windier than preferred.  The turbid water made searching for Muskellunge prior to shocking difficult so the power was deployed during much of the sampling.  The method allowed for a sample to be collected but at least three fish evaded capture.  A total of 10 different Muskellunge were sampled while an additional two were recaptured.  One fish previously marked with a PIT tag from Moose Lake was sampled.  The sampled fish ranged from 39.4 to 51.1 inches and had a mean length of 43.9 inches.  Anal fin rays did not provide sufficient accuracy for aging fish so they were not recorded.  No attempt to estimate the adult population size was made in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2011, Little Moose Lake Muskellunge were sampled for ancestry because of a concurrent genetics project in Moose Lake and fish move between the two lakes.  All of the Muskellunge sampled had various degrees of the native Moose Lake and Wisconsin strain genetics.  Wisconsin strain Muskellunge were never stocked in Little Moose Lake but were stocked in Moose Lake in 1985.  The lack of any pure native fish in Little Moose Lake may indicate there is limited natural reproduction and much of the population is sustained by migration from Moose Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 samples for genetics had not been analyzed at the writing of this report but will be included in future Lake Management plans.  Ancestry of the individual fish originally marked in Moose Lake and later sampled in Little Moose Lake was roughly 33% Moose (native) and 66% Wisconsin.  The fish was a female that was 44.5 inches long in 2011 and 44.8 inches in 2018; essentially no growth in seven years.  The fish was in poor condition when captured in 2018.  It is not known if the fish reached its maximum size based on genetics or if the fish may have sustained an injury.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Moose Lake is managed primarily for muskellunge, walleye and panfish.  The lake is not currently being stocked.In this assessment, no muskellunge were sampled, but they are rarely captured in our standard netting gear.  Special spring test-netting is conducted to sample muskellunge.  The most recent assessment was conducted in 2000.Walleye were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 1.3/set, which was equal to the first quartile for lake class 31.  This is the second lowest catch rate yet observed on Little Moose Lake.  Walleye sampled in gill nets ranged from 15.8 to 23.1 inches long, and had a mean length of 18.3 inches.  All the walleye sampled were from non-stocked years.  Growth rates appear to be average.Northern pike were sampled at a rate of 5.8/gill net, which was within the expected range (3.5 - 10.5/set).  Northerns captured in the gill nets ranged from 17.5 to 29.7 inches long, and a had mean weight of 2.7 pounds.  Northern pike in Little Moose grew fast for the first two years, then growth appeared to slow to an average rate as they got older.The black crappie gill net catch rate (1.5/net) was within the expected range (0.6 - 3.5/gill net), whereas the trap net catch rate (3.9/trap net) exceeded the third quartile (3.4/trap net).  Mean length of gill net and trap net caught black crappie were 9.9 and 8.0 inches, respectively.   Growth was average for all ages.The yellow perch gill net catch rate (31.8/net) was within the expected range (3.4 - 43.6/set).  The mean size of the gill net sampled perch in Little Moose lake was fairly small (6.6 inches), ranging from 3.5 to 8.3 inches.The bluegill trap net catch rate (3.3/set) was below the first quartile (6.1/set).  Bluegills ranged from 4.5 to 9.6 inches in length, and had a mean length of 6.9 inches.Only two largemouth bass were sampled (0.2/trap net).  Since bass are difficult to catch in nets, net catch rates are not good indicators of abundance.Other species sampled in this assessment include; golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker.Like most developed lakes, the way lakeshore owners manage their shoreline can impact water quality in Little Moose Lake.  Water quality can be preserved by following best management practices: such as; using  only non-phosphorus fertilizers; maintaining natural vegetation buffers along the shore; minimizing the size of lawns; maintaining functioning septic systems, which includes regular pumping and keeping lawn clippings and leaves out of the lake.  Leaving aquatic vegetation in the lake is also important as they filter nutrients out of the water, provides habitat and food for fish and animals, and protects the shoreline from erosion.  All anglers can help insure good fishing in Little Moose Lake by limiting their harvest of all species, especially by releasing the medium to large fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Moose Lake is a muskellunge lake located 14 miles northwest of Grand Rapids, Minnesota.  There is an earthen public access on the west side of the lake with limited parking.  The lake has two inlets and one outlet to Moose Lake, another native muskellunge lake. <br> \n <br> \nSpring muskellunge assessments have been conducted six times on Little Moose Lake since 1986.  The data are used to evaluate changes in management such as regulations, stocking regimes, and the effect of catch and release on the population.  Muskellunge are native to Little Moose Lake but the extent of natural reproduction in the lake is unknown.  Muskellunge were stocked six times from 1968 to 1977 with Shoepack strain ancestry and once in 1988 with Leech Lake strain ancestry fish.  Immigration from Moose Lake and an unknown amount of natural reproduction has sustained the muskellunge population since stocking was discontinued.   <br> \n <br> \nAs the ice retreated from the lake on 4/26/11, 10 large-frame trap nets were set.  Sampling occurred from April 26 to May 8, a period of 12 days that resulted in 120 net nights.  All muskellunge and northern pike were measured for length.  Muskellunge were weighed, identified for sex, anal fin rays were removed for ageing, scales were collected for genetics, and each fish received a PIT tag.  Recaptured fish were recorded each day but were not re-measured.  The modified Schnabel method was used to estimate the adult muskellunge population. <br> \n <br> \nSpring weather conditions were cold and windy, with rain and snow for a good portion of the assessment.  These conditions are generally poor for sampling muskellunge.  A total of 15 muskellunge were sampled of which two were recaptures.  Two of the fish had previously been marked with PIT tags from Moose Lake.  The catch of 0.13 muskellunge per net was similar to previous assessments excluding the 2004 assessment when we captured 33 fish for a catch of 0.55/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 31.8 to 47.7 inches and had a mean length of 41.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge ages were estimated from anal fin rays for the first time in the Grand Rapids area.  Confidence in the estimated ages was highly variable among fish due to clarity of annuli, especially near the edges of fish age 8 and older.  It is too difficult to characterize growth due to a low sample size in conjunction with other variables such as size at capture and sex.  Nine age classes from age 5 to age 17 were estimated.   <br> \n <br> \nThe spring population estimate was determined by the Modified Schnabel method.  Of the 15 muskellunge captured in this assessment two were recaptured individuals.  The adult population was estimated at 43 fish with 95% confidence intervals of 13 to 421 fish.  Although the estimate of 43 fish seems low, it may even be an overestimate of what is present.  The modified Schnabel method overestimated the population in Moose Lake in three of the four consecutive years of comparing various population estimate methods. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Moose Lake muskellunge were sampled for ancestry in 2011 because of the genetics project occurring in Moose Lake and fish movement between lakes.  All of the muskellunge sampled were various degrees of crosses of the native Moose Lake and Wisconsin strain fish.  Wisconsin strain muskellunge were never stocked in Little Moose Lake but were stocked in Moose Lake in 1985.  The lack of any pure native fish in Little Moose Lake may indicate there is limited natural reproduction in the lake and much of the population is sustained by migration from Moose Lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn previous years, northern pike lengths were sub sampled during spring muskellunge assessments.  All of the northern pike were measured in 2011.  A total of 337 fish were captured resulting in a catch rate of 2.8 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 11.2 to 35.2 inches and had a mean length of 21.6 inches.</p>",
