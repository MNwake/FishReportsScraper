Year class strength and stocking were related in the 1989 survey indicating that stocking contributes to natural reproduction's production.  Northern pike are moderately abundant with a catch rate of 6.3 per gillnet lift in 1989.  They have been increasing slightly each assessment.  No large northerns (30+ inches) were taken.  Yellow perch abundance (23.3 per gillnet lift) increased dramatically, but no individuals smaller than 5 inches were collected in gill or trap nets.  White suckers had been increasing but dropped in the 1989 survey.  Their abundance is still high at 9.5 per gillnet lift.  Like many area lakes that were assessed in 1989, bluegill (8.5) and black crappie (6.0 per trapnet lift) expanded.  Pumpkinseed remained unchanged from 1977 at 1.5 per lift.  Crappie were dominated by the 1986 year class.  The 1984, 1986-1988 bluegill year classes were strong.</p>",

Abundance indices for northern pike, black crappie and bluegill were within accepted ranges compared to lakes of similar type.  Largemouth bass were well represented in shoreline seining samples, but abundance of adult bass was not obtained due to lack of proper sampling equipment.  Quality of size structure for black crappie and bluegill was good with 100% of sampled crappie longer than 8 inches and 93% os sampled bluegill longer than 6 inches.  Twenty eight percent of sampled northern pike were longer than 21 inches.     Stocking of walleye fry in Upper Comstock Lake appears to have been successful in establishing an incidental fishery with abundance indices within an accepted range compared to other lakes of similar type.  Of 28 walleye aged, 71% were born in years that fry were stocked, with all aged walleye less than six years old born in years that fry were stocked.  Quality of walleye size structure was good, with 86% of the sampled walleye longer than 15 inches.     Other fish species documented in Upper Comstock Lake include yellow perch, white sucker, shorthead redhorse, common and spottail shiner.  Yellow perch were low in abundance and small.  White sucker were abundant and quite large, while shorthead redhorse were low in abundance but also quite large.</p>",

Walleye and Black Crappie are the primary management species for Upper Comstock Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry have been stocked into Upper Comstock at a rate of 2,000 per littoral acre every even year since 1998.  Walleye abundance of 1.8 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other similar Minnesota Lakes.  Walleye average length was quite small at 12.4 inches.  Ninety-three percent of Walleye aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 6.6 per trapnet lift was above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  The catch rate observed in 2016 represents a historic high for Black Crappie in Upper Comstock Lake.  Average length was 9.3 inches with fish up to 11.3 inches sampled.  Anglers should expect good catches of Black Crappie in the next couple years with two strong year-classes present (2010 and 2011).  Bluegill abundance was average at 4.8 per trapnet lift.  Average length was 7.0 inches with nearly two-thirds of the sample exceeding 7.5 inches.  Yellow perch were abundant but small.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 2.2 per gillnet lift was average compared to other similar Minnesota Lakes.  Average size was 22.4 inches and 2.6 pounds. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Comstock is a 271-acre lake with 130 acres (48%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 28 feet.  The lake is located approximately six miles south of Markham, Minnesota.  There is a state administered, concrete back-in access located on the north side of the lake off of County Road 547.  Upper Comstock is connected to Lower Comstock by a channel that is navigable by small watercraft.  Walleye fry have been stocked into Upper Comstock at a rate of 2000 per surface acre every even year since 1998.  Upper Comstock was surveyed during the summer of 2008 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the success of the walleye stocking program.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 2.2 per gillnet lift was up from 2000 (0.8) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was good at 18.8 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Forty-six percent of the walleyes were over 20 inches in length.  Eight year-classes were represented, and 50% of the sample corresponded to stocked year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 3.5 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 21.0 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2006 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 6.2 per trapnet lift was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 6.2 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2006 were represented in the sample with strong 2005 and 2006 year-classes, comprising 78% of captured fish.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 10.8 per trapnet lift was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was good at 7.5 inches but growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Recruitment was consistent with all year-classes from 2000-2006 represented, with a strong 2003 year-class.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 9.7 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 6.7 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2006 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance of 0.1 per trapnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black bullhead mean length was 9.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include shorthead redhorse, pumpkinseed, rock bass and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Results of the 2000 Upper Comstock Lake survey indicate a system most suited to northern pike, black crappie and bluegill.  Abundance indices  for northern pike, black crappie and bluegill were within or above accepted ranges compared to lakes of similar type.  Yearling largemouth bass were well represented in shoreline seining samples but lack of YOY bass and centrarchids in general may suggest a poor 2000 year class.  Abundance of adult bass was not obtained due to scheduling conflicts.  Size structure for black crappie and bluegill was promising with good numbers and sizes of \"keeper\" fish.  Strong year classes in the late 1990's will hopefully provide good future angling opportunities for these species.  Northern pike numbers and size structure has not changed much from the 1995 population assessment.        Stocking of walleye fry in Upper Comstock Lake appears to have been successful in establishing an incidental fishery.  Catch rates (0.8 per lift) were the lowest recorded and have fallen steady from the 1977, 1989, and 1995 investigations.  Nine of the 14 walleye aged correlated to years that fry were stocked.  Quality of walleye size structure was good, with 67% of the sampled walleye longer than 15 inches.      Other fish species documented in Upper Comstock Lake include yellow perch, white sucker, shorthead redhorse, common and spottail shiner.   </p>",
