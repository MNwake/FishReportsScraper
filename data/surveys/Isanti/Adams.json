                "narrative": "<p>On June 30, 1993, a lake survey was conducted on Adam's Lake (lake class 30).  Two gillnets and 4 trapnets were set to evaluate the present fish population.  Adams Lake is managed for centrarchid-largemouth.  Periodic winterkills have been reported on this lake.  The outlet provides a source of fish migration from Little Stanchfield Creek and Rum River.  The absence of some species during the survey would indicate a significant winterkill in recent years.  The last stocking was in 1957.     The northern pike abundance was very high.  Lengths ranged from 15.2 to 26.6 inches with an average length of 20.5 inches.  The average weight was 1.9 pounds.  Age 3-5 were sampled with growth being normal.     The yellow perch abundance was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Lengths where from 5.1 to 8.9 inches averaging 6.0 inches.  Ages 2-5 where sampled with most perch being 2 and 3 years old.     Five other species were also captured by testnetting:  black bullhead, golden shiner, tadpole madtom, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  The bullheads were at normal abundances, while the golden shiner, tadpole madtom, and white sucker were caught at levels below normal.     Prepared by:  Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",
