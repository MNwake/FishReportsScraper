Be sure to consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations book for regulations, seasons, and possession limits before fishing designated trout waters. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout are stocked annual as spring yearlings (1,200/year).  The gill net catch of 34.5/net was the highest catch observed on Strawberry.  Average length was 11.1\".   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in high numbers in gill nets (3.5/net) and trap nets (4.0/net) when compared to similar lakes.  Most ran on the small side with an average length of 10.7\" for gill net captured fish and 9.6\" for fish from trap nets.  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers at 33.4/trap net.  Average length was 6.5\" with 34% at least 7\" in length.  The presence of Largemouth Bass and Bluegills will degrade the quality of the trout angling in Strawberry Lake through competition with the trout and predation on trout. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been found in Strawberry but are in the area.  Before and after launching, lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
