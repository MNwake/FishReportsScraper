This 35 acre lake has dark, bog stained water and the shorelines are rocky with moss covered ledgerock areas present. The surrounding forest is dominated by conifers growing on shallow soils. <br> \n <br> \nA short 10 rod portage from the South Kawishiwi River is the most common access to Bruin Lake. A longer (285 rod) portage from Little Gabbro Lake is another option for access. The survey crew could not locate the USFS campsite near the long portage. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the only fish species sampled in the gill nets in 2015. Pike numbers (1.7/gill net) were below average compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average pike sampled was 22.6 inches and the largest pike sampled was 28 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the-year largemouth bass were observed near shore in 2015. Black crappie were reported by ice anglers in the past. The last survey in 1975 indicated low numbers of northern pike, rock bass and yellow perch.</p>",
