                "narrative": "<p>Little Cutfoot Sioux is in ecological lake class 35 and is part of the Lake Winnibigoshish system north of Deer River.  Bluegill are one of the primary management species with a management goal to provide a high quality fishery with the opportunity to catch fish of preferred size (over 8 inches).  The 2017 targeted survey was one of three spring surveys targeting Bluegill since 2007. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting sampled Bluegill at a rate of 3.5/net, similar to the previous assessments (6.1/net and 2.9/net).  Standard summer survey catches are typically low, while the lake has historically contained a quality population.  Size structure was favorable and consistent with management goals (PSD=92, RSD-8=71, RSD-10=5, n=157) and similar to what was observed in 2012 (PSD=99, RSD-8=55, RSD-10=3, n=233) and 2007 (PSD=87, RSD-8=43, RSD-10=1, n=160) targeted surveys.  The fish ranged from 3.4 to 10.4 inches with a mean length of 8.4 inches in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nSex and maturity determination identified 43% of the sample was male of which 3 were immature, while 82 were mature females and 8 immature.  Immature females had a mean length of 4.6 inches and a median age of 2, similar to immature males which had a mean length of 4.7 inches and a median age of 2. <br> \n <br> \nScale analysis identified ages 2 to 9 were present in the sample.  Ages 3 to 6 were well represented and evenly distributed in an expanded age frequency, comprising 80% of the sample.  Back-calculated length-at-age for males (n=55) and females (n=52) were similar to Ecological Lake Class 35 for all ages.  Males averaged 8.1 inches while females averaged 7.9 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were the most numerous species sampled in spring trap nets, at a rate of 3.5/net.  The 2017 catch was similar to the 2012 (3.2/net) and 2007 (2.8/net) catches.  Summer trap net catches have typically been within the lake class inter-quartile ranges.  A desirable size structure was observed (PSD=76, RSD-10=46, RSD-12=7, n=157), similar to previous spring assessments.  Lengths ranged from 4.7 to 12.6 inches with a mean length of 9.4 inches.  Scale analysis identified ages 2 to 8 inches with ages 3 to 6 well represented, comprising 85% of the age distribution.  Growth was similar to the statewide averages for all ages.  Black Crappie averaged 10.5 inches by age 5. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Cut Foot Sioux Lake is a 619 acre lake located 15 miles northwest of Deer River, Minnesota. The lake is connected to Cut Foot Sioux and is part of the larger Winnibigoshish system in the upper end of the Mississippi River drainage. Much of the lake is shallow and vegetated, as the maximum depth is 20 feet. Little Cut Foot Sioux is the site of an annual Walleye spawn take, where staff from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources collect eggs to hatch for stocking in Little Cut Foot Sioux, Cut Foot Sioux, Winnibigoshish, and other upper Mississippi drainage lakes. A standard fish survey is completed here approximately every ten years.   <br> \n <br> \nLittle Cut Foot Sioux has been identified as a lake with a high-quality Bluegill population and is currently protected with a 5 fish bag limit. During the 2023 survey, Bluegill in trap nets averaged over 7 inches in length and the largest Bluegill sampled during the survey was just over 10 inches. Black Crappie are another popular panfish species, and the abundance of these was within the expected range for this type of lake. Crappies averaged 8 to 9 inches and the largest were approaching 13 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Little Cut Foot Sioux, as is typical with shallow lakes in north-central Minnesota. The maximum size potential is typically small with high density populations, and this is generally the case for this lake. During the 2023 survey the average Northern Pike length was 20 inches. The majority of the population was less than 4 years old, but a few fish that reached older ages were approaching 33 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile there is a large spawning run of Walleye into Little Cut Foot Sioux in the spring, the abundance of Walleye in the lake is fairly low outside of that period of time. Abundance of Walleye in survey nets was below the expected range for the lake. Walleye fry from the spawn take operation are stocked back into the lake each year. The Walleye sampled in 2023 ranged from 11 to 22 inches and were 2 to 7 years old.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was down from the historic average for the lake, but still well within the expected range for the lake. Perch are a major prey item for predators such as Northern Pike and Walleye, but they do reach sizes that are of interest to anglers here. The average length during this survey was just under 7 inches, and the maximum size was over 10 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) have been present in high abundance in Little Cut Foot Sioux in the past. Cisco populations in the Winnibigoshish system, as well as many other lakes in Minnesota, have been trending downward the past few decades. This was the first survey where sampling nets failed to catch any Cisco in the lake. Cisco are an important prey item for predators such as Northern Pike, Walleye, and Muskellunge. The lack of Cisco will put more pressure on other prey species, such as Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are another gamefish species present in Little Cut Foot Sioux. The nets traditionally used in standard surveys are not effective for sampling Largemouth Bass, so none were caught during this survey. Other species sampled in this survey include Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Cut Foot Sioux Lake is managed primarily for walleye and bluegill.  Walleye abundance in the lake fluctuates seasonally.  Little Cut Foot Sioux is part of a flowage system that is a tributary to Lake Winnibigoshish (Winnie), and attracts a large migration of spawning walleye in spring.  The DNR Section of Fisheries utilizes this spawning run to collect walleye eggs for stocking needs on other lakes.  A percentage of eggs taken from the run are returned to Little Cut Foot as walleye fry, to account for any recruitment losses incurred from the egg-take operation.Walleye gill-net CPUE in 1990 was 2.7/net, and reflects a typical summer abundance following emigration of spawning fish back to Big Cut Foot Sioux and Lake Winnie.  The 1990 catch rate is within the normal range for lakes of this type, and is similar to the catch rates reported in the 1980 and 1985 surveys of 3.0 and 2.7/net, respectively.  A majority (87%) of walleye in the 1990 sample were age 3 or 4.  Growth rates for walleye in Little Cut Foot Sioux were similar to those in Big Cut Foot Sioux and Lake Winnie.Bluegill in Little Cut Foot Sioux Lake have generally been low in abundance but with a good average size.  Trap-net CPUE for bluegill in 1990 was below the normal range at 2.5/net, but growth rates were well above average for similar lakes.  Similar to past surveys, black crappie abundance in 1990 was within the normal range at 3.2/net.  The black crappie sample consisted mainly of age 3 fish, with age 2 and age 4 fish also present.  Black crappie growth rates appeared to be above average for lakes of this type.Northern pike abundance in Little Cut Foot Sioux has typically been below the normal range for lakes of this type.  Northern pike gill-net CPUE in 1990 was below the first quartile at 2.8/net.  Spawning habitat for northern pike is considered good in Little Cut Foot Sioux.  Low catches of northern pike observed in mid-summer test-netting may be due to a similar migration pattern as that reported for walleye.Yellow perch are a major prey species in Little Cut Foot.  Gill-net catches for perch have been highly variable in previous surveys (6.5-38.5/net).  Yellow perch gill-net CPUE was above the normal range in 1990 at 36.9/net.Tullibee gill-net CPUE has declined sharply from previous surveys.  The gill-net catch rate of 3.0/net in 1990 is the lowest on record and far below the record high catch of 39.8/net in 1975.  Reasons for the apparent decline in tullibee abundance are unclear, but could be due to a seasonal migration out to Big Cut Foot Sioux and Lake Winnie.All three bullhead species (black, brown and yellow) are present in Little Cut Foot Sioux.  Black bullheads were the most abundant in the 1990 survey, with a gill-net CPUE of 48.2/net.  The bullhead population has been commercially fished by the Leech Lake Indian Reservation, but the total annual harvest information is not available. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Cut Foot Sioux Lake is located 15 miles northwest of Deer River, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake has a surface area of 660 acres and a maximum depth of 20 feet.  Little Cut Foot Sioux is in lake class 35.  Other area lakes in this class are Lawrence and Pughole Lakes.  Little Cut Foot Sioux is a fairly productive lake that occasionally experiences winterkill.  The lake is within the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Indian Reservation.  The US Forest Service maintains an earthen ramp boat access on the southwest corner of the lake.  Access is also available by boat through a channel from Cut Foot Sioux Lake.Little Cut Foot Sioux is connected to Cut Foot Sioux and Winnibigoshish Lakes, and the abundance of many fish species fluctuates due to seasonal migrations within the system.  Little Cut Foot experiences a large migration of walleye during spring.  The Minnesota DNR operates a walleye egg-taking operation on Little Cut Foot Sioux each spring, with a percentage of the collected walleye eggs returned to the lake as fry.  Walleye gill-net catch rates during June assessments have been variable, and are likely affected by early summer weather patterns which influence the migration of walleye back out to Cut Foot Sioux and Winnibigoshish.  The walleye gill-net catch was 2.3/net in 2002, which is slightly above the lake class average.  The fish ranged from 7.1 to 24.4 inches, with a mean length of 15.1 inches.  Scale analysis identified fish from ages 1-6 and 8, with ages 3 and 4 making up 67% of the sample.  Growth was considered average.Northern pike were moderately abundant in the 2002 assessment.  The gill-net catch rate of 8.7/net was slightly above the lake class average.  Sampled fish ranged from 9.4 to 35.5 inches, with a mean length of 19.8 inches.  Age and growth analysis indicated consistent natural reproduction, and growth was similar to the statewide average for all ages examined.As in previous assessments, bluegill remained low in abundance but had a good average size.  In 2002, the bluegill trap-net catch was below the lake class normal range at 1.9/net.  Trap-net sampled bluegill ranged from 7.5 to 10.1 inches with a mean length of 8.3 inches.  Ages 3-7 were identified from scale analysis, with no dominant year class.  Growth was above the lake class average for all ages.The black crappie population has typically had moderate numbers and size structure.  In 2002, the trap-net catch for black crappie was 1.8/net, similar to the lake class average of 1.7/net.  Fish in the sample ranged from 3.5 to 11.8 inches, with a mean length of 8.8 inches.  Yellow perch abundance has been above the normal range in four of the last five assessments.  In 2002, the yellow perch gill-net catch rate was 38.8/net and size structure was moderate.  Gill-net sampled perch ranged from 5.0 to 10.8 inches with a mean length of 7.9 inches.    Gill-net catch rates for tullibee have been variable, but have been above the lake class normal range in every assessment.  In 2002, the gill-net catch rate was 5.8/net, down from 32.8/net in the 1995 assessment.  The high but variable abundance of tullibee in Little Cut Foot Sioux Lake, relative to other class 35 lakes, is likely due to the connection to Cut Foot Sioux and Winnibigoshish Lakes.Other species sampled in the latest assessment included: black, yellow and brown bullhead, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker. In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may seem relatively small, yet the combined effects of many lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, installing sand beach blankets, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, uncontrolled run-off and failing septic systems all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.

The lake has a surface area of 660 acres and a maximum depth of 20 feet.  Little Cut Foot Sioux is in ecological lake class 35.  Other area lakes in this class include Lawrence and Pughole Lakes.  Little Cut Foot Sioux is a fairly productive lake that occasionally experiences winterkill.  The lake is within the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Indian Reservation.  The US Forest Service maintains a concrete ramp boat access on the southwest corner of the lake.  Access is also available by boat through a channel from Cut Foot Sioux Lake.\nA night electrofishing assessment was conducted in spring 2007 to collect information on the largemouth bass population.  This was the first electrofishing assessment ever conducted on Little Cut Foot Sioux Lake.  The electrofishing boat used two Wisconsin style droppers and pulsed DC current.  Surface water temperature was 66 F, and water clarity was moderate.  Only six largemouth bass were captured for a catch rate of 4.1/hour of on-time.  Sampled fish ranged from 9.3 to 16.8 inches, with a mean length of 12.6 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average.  Although Little Cut Foot Sioux contains relatively good largemouth bass habitat, the results of this assessment would seem to indicate it supports a low-density population of bass at the present time.\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Cut Foot Sioux is in ecological lake class 35 and is part of the Lake Winnibigoshish system north of Deer River.  Bluegill are a primary management species, and the lake has historically contained a quality population.  The 2012 spring trap-net assessment specifically targeted bluegill to improve our knowledge about the population.  Size structure, age and growth information was also collected from black crappie.  This is the second time a spring assessment has been conducted on Little Cut Foot.  The 2012 special assessment used the same number of nets and net locations used in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 38 net nights captured 233 bluegill for a catch rate of 6.1/trap net.  This was an improvement from the 2007 catch rate of 2.9/net.  Variability in spring catch rates is typically due to weather patterns at the time of sampling, not necessarily an indicator of changes in population size.  Sampled bluegill ranged from 5.0 to 10.6 inches with a mean length of 8.1 inches.  Bluegill size structure improved slightly from 2007 and was characterized by PSD, RSD-P (8 inches) and RSD-M (10 inches) values of 99, 55 and 3, respectively.   Eight year classes were determined from scale samples, with fish ranging from age 2 to age 9 in the sample.  Recruitment appeared more consistent in the 2012 sample than in 2007.  Age distribution showed 50% of the fish in the 2012 sample were age 5 and older, compared to only 19% in 2007.  Bluegill growth remained well above the lake class average with fish reaching 8.4 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 120 black crappie were sampled for a catch rate of 3.2/trap net.  This is similar to the 2007 catch rate of 2.8/net.  Sampled crappie ranged from 4.4 to 12.5 inches, with a mean length of 9.0 inches.  Black crappie size structure was characterized by PSD, RSD-P (10 inches) and RSD-M (12 inches) values of 73, 53 and 6, respectively.  Seven year classes from age 2-8 were identified from scale samples, but recruitment appeared somewhat inconsistent.  A strong age-2 year class made up 35% of the sample.  Thirty-four percent of aged fish were age 6 and older.  Black crappie growth was similar to the lake class average with fish reaching 10.3 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nThe results of this assessment indicate that Little Cut Foot Sioux continues to support a quality panfish fishery.  Future spring assessments will likely be conducted to monitor the status of the bluegill and black crappie populations.     <br> \n</p>",

It also supports high numbers of perch and tullibee and some walleye, probably because of its connection to Cut Foot Sioux and Winnibigoshish lakes.     Walleye were sampled in this assessment at a rate below the last few assessments but still within the expected range for this type of lake.  Walleye sampled in gill nets ranged from 9.5 to 21.7 inches in length (mean = 16.2 inches) and had a mean weight of 1.5 pounds.     Northern pike were sampled at the highest rate ever for the lake, well above the expected range.  Northern pike sampled in gill nets had a mean length of 19.3 inches and a mean weight of 1.5 pounds.     The bluegill trap net catch rate, while not high for this type of lake, is the highest recorded on Little Cut Foot Sioux.  Bluegill sampled were fairly large (7.2 to 10.3 inches in length) and they appear to have good growth rates.       Yellow perch were also sampled at the highest rate yet, which is also above the expected range.  Yellow perch sampled in gill nets ranged from 4.2 to 13.0 inches in length.     Black crappie were sampled at low rates in gill nets but within the expected range in the trap nets.  The crappie sampled in the trap nets ranged from 3.8 to 12.2 inches in length and had a mean of 9.6 inches.     Tullibee were sampled at a rate over ten times the expected rate.  Tullibee abundance in Little Cut Foot Sioux Lake may be highly dependent on migration from Cut Foot Lake.     Other species of fish sampled include; white sucker, black bullhead, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, bowfin, rock bass and hybrid sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Cut Foot Sioux Lake is located 15 miles northwest of Deer River, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake has a surface area of 660 acres and a maximum depth of 20 feet.  Little Cut Foot Sioux is a fairly productive lake that occasionally experiences winterkill.  The lake is within the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Indian Reservation.  The US Forest Service maintains a boat access on the southwest corner of the lake.  Access is also available by boat through a channel from Cut Foot Sioux Lake.  Little Cut Foot Sioux is in ecological lake class 35, which represents moderate size lakes with a high percentage of littoral area and moderate water clarity and hardness.  Other area lakes in this class include Blandin Reservoir and Prairie Lake.  The lake management plan lists bluegill and walleye as primary management species. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Cut Foot Sioux is connected to Cut Foot Sioux and Winnibigoshish Lakes and experiences a large migration of walleye during spring.  The Minnesota DNR operates a walleye egg-taking operation on Little Cut Foot Sioux each spring, with a percentage of the collected walleye eggs returned to the lake as fry.  Walleye gill-net CPE in June assessments has been variable, and is likely affected by early summer weather patterns that influence the migration of walleye back out to Cut Foot Sioux and Winnibigoshish.  The 2012 walleye gill-net catch was 2.3/net, similar to the lake class average and management plan goal of 2.1/net.  Walleye size structure was modest; sampled fish ranged from 10.7 to 27.8 inches with a mean length 15.3 inches.  Ages 2-7, 10 and 12 were identified from scale samples.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching 15.3 inches at age 4. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch rate for bluegill was within the expected range at 8.4/net.  This is an increase from the previous assessment, but near the lake class average and management plan goal of 9.2/net.  Bluegill size structure was good with fish over 9 inches in the sample.  Sampled bluegill ranged from 5.1 to 9.9 inches with a mean length of 8.0 inches.  A special trap-net assessment targeting bluegill was conducted earlier in the spring and reported a similar size distribution.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled within the expected range at 5.3/net.  Catch rates in previous assessments have varied from 1.6 to 14.6/net.  Size structure was poor in the 2012 sample; fish ranged from 12.4 to 34.6 inches with a mean length of 19.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill-net catch was within the expected range at 15.8/net.   Catch rates in previous assessments have varied from 6.5 to 65.2/net.  Size structure was moderate in 2012.  Sampled perch ranged from 5.2 to 10.7 inches with a mean length 7.5 inches.  Analysis of scale samples indicated consistent recruitment with ages 2-8 represented in the sample.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with perch reaching 7.9 inches at age 4.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled within the expected range at 7.2/gill net and 0.8/trap net.  The sample was predominately made up of smaller sized fish.   Gill-net sampled crappie ranged from 4.1 to 11.6 inches, with a mean length of 6.4 inches.  Black crappie from trap nets ranged from 5.3 to 7.8 inches with a mean length of 6.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nGill-net catch rates for tullibee have been variable, but have been above the lake class third quartile (3.0/gill net) in past assessments.  In 2012, the tullibee gill-net catch declined to 0.5/net.  Sampled tullibee ranged from 13.8 to 15.9 inches.  Tullibee are an important prey source for larger northern pike and walleye.  The long-term but variable abundance of tullibee in Little Cut Foot Sioux Lake, relative to other class 35 lakes, is mainly due to the connection to Cut Foot Sioux and Winnibigoshish Lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBrown bullheads were sampled above the expected range at 8.1/gill net.  Bullheads have made up a considerable portion of the fish community at various times in the past.  Brown bullheads sampled in 2012 ranged from 10.0 to 14.6 inches with a mean length of 13.1 inches, large enough to be of interest to anglers.     <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the latest assessment included: black and yellow bullhead, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Cut Foot Sioux is a class 35 lake that is part of the Lake Winnibigoshish system north of Deer River.  The management plan indicates bluegill and walleye are primary species of management with black crappie and largemouth bass as secondary.  The 2007 spring special assessment targeting bluegill was intended to improve our knowledge of the population.  For the purposes of this bluegill assessment, the area between William's Narrows and the Highway 46 bridge, was included in the Little Cut Foot Sioux investigation.  Ten trap nets were set in Little Cut Foot and five were set west of the bridge.\n\nA total of 56 net nights captured 160 bluegills, resulting in a catch rate of 2.9/net.  Spring catch rates are typically influenced by spring weather patterns more than changes in bluegill numbers.  The sampled bluegill ranged from 4.3 to 10.6 inches with a mean length of 7.7 inches.  Bluegill size structure was characterized by PSD, RSD-P (8 inches), and RSD-M (10 inches) values of 87, 43, and 1, respectively.  Seven year-classes were determined from the scale samples with fish from age 2 to age 8.  The largest year-class sampled was from 2003, representing 66% of the sample.  Mean back-calculated lengths at age were higher (>115% of median) than those reported for class 35 lakes for all age 2 and older fish.\n\nThe Little Cut Foot Sioux special assessment was similar to all of our other spring bluegill assessments in the area in that we sampled more females than males.  The sex distribution was 63 percent females and 37 percent males.  It is not clear whether the sex ratio is representative of what exists in the population or if it is the result of the timing of our sampling in relation to sexual behaviors or some unknown factor.\n</p>",
