Walleye growth rates had been about average for the area, despite the lack of a good yellow perch forage base.The northern pike catch in 2000 was above the normal range for lakes of this class, however, most of the fish collected were fairly small.  The population was dominated by three-year-old fish, with only one older fish observed.  Northern pike growth rates had been somewhat faster than average for this area, perhaps due to the presence of some smaller white sucker to serve as forage.  Some of the northern pike collected in 2000 had been feeding on walleye.No other game fish, and no panfish, were collected in 2000, and none were known to be present in the lake.</p>",

ALL THE WAE TAKEN IN THIS ASSESSMENT WERE FROM INTRODUCTORY STOCKINGS IN 1985, 1986 AND 1987.  MOST OF THESE FISH WERE PROBABLY IMMATURE, SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SOON TO SEE ANY INDICATION OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION.
