                "narrative": "<p>Kabekona Lake is located three miles south of Laporte in northeastern Hubbard County.  Kabekona has a surface area of 2,433 acres and a maximum depth of 133 feet.  A county-owned public access is located on the west shore of the lake.  The access is shallow and sandy which might be difficult for larger boats.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Kabekona is in lake class 22.  Class 22 lakes are generally very large, very deep, clear, and hard water lakes, with very irregularly shaped shoreline and low littoral zone. Other class 22 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Lower Bottle, Long, Potato, and Big Sand. <br> \n <br> \nKabekona has excellent walleye spawning habitat of large wind-swept rubble areas as well as inlet and outlet stream areas.  A protected slot length limit for Walleye is currently in place on Kabekona that requires the release of all Walleye between 18 and 26 inches with one Walleye over 26 inches allowed.  The possession limit for Walleye on Kabekona is four.  This 18 to 26 protected slot length limit for Walleye should help protect spawning size fish in Kabekona. It is hoped that if walleye abundance is increased that natural reproduction may contribute significantly to the walleye population in Kabekona Lake which is starting to be evidenced since the slot limit was implemented.  Walleye abundance in 2014 was the highest ever recorded.  Multiple year-classes of Walleye were sampled with a lot fish in the 12 \u0013 16 inch range.  The average size was 17.8 inches and fish up to 28.9 inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bowfin, Brook Trout, Brown Bullhead, Burbot, Lake Whitefish, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Tullibee, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Kabekona. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  <br> \n</p>",

A county owned public access is located on the west shore of the lake off MN Highway 64. Kabekona provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, and Smallmouth Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Kabekona Lake is in lake class 22. Class 22 lakes generally are very large, very deep, with very irregularly shaped shoreline with clean and hard water and a low littoral area (depth under 15 feet). Other class 22 lakes in the Park Rapids area include Lower Bottle, Long, Potato, and Big Sand. <br> \nKabekona Lake has a special Walleye regulation which consists of 20\"-26\" protected slot with one over 26\" and a possession limit of four.  The Walleye abundance in the 2020 survey was above the long-term average for Kabekona but down from the record high abundance recorded in 2017. The Walleye averaged 17.75 inches in length, and the largest Walleye was 27.5 inches. Yellow Perch are important forage for Walleyes and Northern Pike. Perch abundance was lower than any previous survey with an average length of 7 inches and fish sampled up to 10.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at their highest abundance since 2011 with an average length of 22.7 inches. Most pike sampled were between 18 and 25 inches with the largest being 32 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass are present but our sampling gear does not effectively sample them.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Kabekona. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to move all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  <br> \n</p>",

A county-owned public access is located on the west shore of the lake off MN Highway 64.  Kabekona is known for its Walleye fishery, but also provides fishing opportunities for Yellow Perch and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Kabekona is in lake class 22.  Class 22 lakes generally are very large, very deep, with very irregularly shaped shoreline with clean and hard water and a low littoral area (depth under 15 feet).  Other class 22 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include: Lower Bottle, Long, Potato, and Big Sand. <br> \n <br> \nKabekona has a special Walleye regulation which consists of a 20-26 inch protected slot with one over 26 inches and a possession limit of four.  Walleye abundance in the 2023 survey was down from recent surveys.  Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 17.0 to 29.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye were sampled in low numbers for this lake class.  Yellow Perch had an average length of 6.4 inches with fish measured up to 9.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown the Northern Pike population in Kabekona to fluctuate from low to moderate abundance.  Northern Pike up to 31.5 inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nKabekona supports an abundant Tullibee (Cisco) population and a low to moderate Lake Whitefish population for anglers or netters looking to pursue those species.  A Tullibee (Cisco) forage base provides an excellent forage base for larger Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of White Sucker and Rock Bass and low numbers of Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Burbot, Bowfin, and Brook Trout. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Kabekona.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kabekona Lake, Hubbard County, was examined by a Bureau of Fisheries Research crew on July 26 to August 6, 1946, to determine the status of the fish population and the fertility or potential productivity of the water.This lake has an area of 2,400 acres, a length of 3.9 miles, a width of about 1.1 mile, and a very clear shoreline of about 10 miles in length.  A maximum depth of 140 feet and an average depth of 52.5 feet were found.  At most places the bottom drops off rapidly from shallow to depths.  The shoreline is mainly of sand, rubble, and gravel, and the watershed is of rolling glacial soil almost completely forested with aspen, birch, and pine.  Kabekona River flows through the lake and two other tributaries enter as well.  Outlet is to the Mississippi River at Leech Lake.Temperature readings indicate that the water warms to a depth of 35 feet during the summer and remains cool below that level.  The bottom layers of cold water retain oxygen and thus are suitable for fish all year round.  Chemical analyses indicate that the lake is a very hard non-alkali body of water able to support only a moderate fish population because of its low phosphorus content.  The deeper waters are well suited to such cold-water fish as tullibee and trout.A wide variety of aquatic plants is present but able to grow only in a narrow rim around the shores of the lake.  Small food organisms were abundant in the bottom muck.  Twenty-four kinds of fish were found including tullibee, suckers, northern pike, perch, walleyes, both kinds of bass, and sunfish.  Forage fishes such as shiners, chubs, and darters were abundant around the shoreline.  Tullibee were more common than in the average Minnesota Lake, but all other species were present in less than average numbers.  Experimental nets were tampered with on this lake and may have given inconclusive results.  In comparison with fish from other lakes, the walleyes and rock bass average larger in size while the perch are smaller than usual.  Growth rates of all fish are above average indicating that no stunting or crowding is taking place.  Spawning conditions are excellent for walleye pike, fair for northern pike and smallmouth bass, and poor for tullibee.Kabekona Lake has been stocked with fish since 1911 with principal emphasis place on the planting of walleye pike fry.  This planting program has not produced satisfactory results.  It is recommended that the lake be managed as a walleye pike lake but that stocking be done with greater numbers of walleye fingerlings instead of fry.  This survey verified reports that walleyes leave the lake to spawn but does not make clear whether those fish or their offspring ever return to the lake.Abundance of Fishes:Gillnets set in Kabekona Lake for a total of 96,988 foot hours (number of feet of net set multiplied by number of hours set) gave figures on auundance of eight species of fish:  Species  # taken   Gillnet ratio*    State Avg gillnet ratioTullibee       221     5.47       3.27White Sucker        15     0.37       1.26Northern Pike        32     0.79       1.91Yellow Perch       126     3.12      11.08Walleye        23     0.57       1.04Bluegill         3     0.07       1.84Pumpkinseed         5     0.12       1.47Rock Bass         5     0.12       1.37* Number of fish taken in 100 feet of experimental net in 24 hours.  This data may not present the true picture of fish abundance because all sets were tampered with by inquisitive persons and one was stolen.  They do show, however, that with the exception of tullibee, all species of fish are low in abundance as would be expected from the report on the lake's basic fertility.In comparison with other lakes, the walleyes and rock bass of Kabekona Lake average larger in size, the suckers smaller, and other species about normal.  The bulk of the perch in Kabekona are about 6 inches in length, but few large individuals between 9.5 and 11.0 inches long weighted the average in that direction.Examination of scales indicated that all species are growing at normal rates in Kabekona, with no overcrowding or stunting present.  There were no age groups consistently missing in these species, indicating that spawning had been successful over a period of years with no gaps.Natural Fish Propagation:Spawning conditions appear to be poor for panfish because of the paucity of shallow water.  They are good for walleye pike, fair for northern pike and smallmouth bass, and excellent for tullibee.  They might be good for rainbow trout.In seining shore areas, small northern pike, black bass, bluegills, and perch were taken, indicating that successful hatches had been made.History of Lake Management:Kabekona Lake has been planted with fish since 1911.  Although principal emphasis has been placed on the stocking of walleye pike fry, crappies, largemouth bass, sunfish, lake trout, smallmouth bass, and northern pike have also been planted.  Following is the stocking record for this lake through 1945 (see oldstock.dbf).  Judging from complaints of residents, the program of fry planting in Kabekona Lake has not produced results.In the past a walleye pike spawning station was operated in the Kabekona River below the lake.  This station was discontinued about 5 years ago.  The walleye run here was peculiar in that the fish ran downstream to spawn from Kabekona Lake, rather than upstream from Leech Lake.  There have been requests that the Kabekona River be screened off below Kabekona Lake to prevent walleyes from leaving the lake.  Aside from the near impossibility of keeping such a screen clean it is not desirable to keep the fish from their natural spawning beds.Present Use of the Lake:Kabekona Lake is used principally as a recreational area.  On it are 5 resorts, 64 cottages, and 61 boats.  Fishing is mostly confined to general angling.  There are reports, however, of illegal netting and during the survey one Conservation Department net was stolen and others tampered with.Present fishing pressure is not heavy for a lake of this size.  According to local residents, 5 to 6 darkhouses yielded only about 15 northern pike in the winter of 1945-46, and their were no boats on the lake until \"a few years ago\".  Fishing is said to have been good until recently when it dropped off rapidly and decisively.Special Problems:The present survey has established the facts that Kabekona Lake is only moderately fertile, possesses oxygen for fish life down to its bottom, has only a mediocre fish population because of its limited fertility and its steep basin, and that those fish are growing and feeding well.  It has also verified reports that fish leave the lake to spawn, but does not make clear whether those fish or their progeny ever return to the lake.  It is probable that suck a downstream run has been undertaken every spring for centuries and that the lake remained as full of fish as its limited facilities permitted until humans began catching them.  An ambitious trapping, marking, and releasing program would have to be undertaken, and recovery of marked fish made by nets some years later, to completely establish all alleged facts.  The Fishereies Research Unit is not able to devote the men and time to this project at present.Management Policy:Careful consideration of the above data leads to the conclusion that Kabekona Lake should be managed as a walleye pike lake.Physical Improvements:Little can be done to improve this lake, except some control over water levels might aid the spawning of fishes in shoal water areas near shore.  An increase of one foot in water depth would be beneficial.Control of Fish Populations:No control of over-abundant fish is necessary now, but tullibees might become so abundant in the future that fall netting for them might be permitted.Planting Recommendations:Elimination of walley fry planting and inauguration of a fingerling planting program is recommended.  To be effective, about 100,000 to 150,000 fingerling should be planted annually.Chemical Characteristics:Field chemical analyses were made on July 30, 1946 with the following results:\t\t\t5'      40'     60'     130'Total alkalinity     176.3     170.0   193.8    193.8 ppmDissolved CO2 1.9      11.0    12.6     19.8 ppmDissolved oxygen       9.1       7.3     6.2      3.5 ppmHydrogen ion (ph)      8.3       7.5     7.5      7.3 ppmVery similar results were obtained in the 1938 survey.

Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 11 and 12, 2023, to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Twenty-four 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, ten sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine and fourteen sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 24 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured twenty-three species of fish including five species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, Burbot, Log Perch, Mimic Shiner, and Molted Sculpin. Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Black Bullhead, Bluntnose Minnow, Bowfin, Brook Stickleback, Common Shiner, Fathead Minnow, Johnny Darter, Iowa Darter, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Northern Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Spottail Shiner, Tadpole Madtom, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on June 20, 2023 to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Kabekona Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Kabekona Lake is located in the Leech Lake River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The survey conducted on Kabekona Lake in 1993 indicates the fishery is similar to the historical records, with some modest natural fluctuations.  These fluctuations are normal and are continuously taking place in all biological communities.The abundance of the walleye is as high as we have ever recorded.  The average weight of the walleyes sampled was over 2 pounds with about 65% of them over 15 inches.  Nearly all year classes up to 13 years of age were represented, with the majority at 3 and 4 years of age.  Growth rates of walleyes were average up through age 4, but increase beyond that.Northern pike abundance is up slightly from the previous survey in 1988, but is down slightly from the historical past.  The average size was 23.9 inches and 3.7 pounds, considerably larger than the historical past.Largemouth and smallmouth bass and black crappie have not been sampled enough with standard survey nets to adequately assess their abundance and size structures.  However, they appear to be at low levels as they have been historically.  Bluegill abundance is higher than historical levels, but is still at a low level.  This is comparable to other similar lakes in the area.  The size stucture is generally small with a few preferred size fish.  Yellow perch are at historical levels and provide both an excellent forage base for the predator fish and a good fishery of their own.  Thirty three percent of the yellow perch measured were over 8 inches and fish up to 11 inches were sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kabekona Lake is located three miles south of Laporte in northeastern Hubbard County.  Kabekona has a surface area of 2,252 acres and a maximum depth of 133 feet.  A county-owned public access is located on the west shore of the lake.  Kabekona Lake is known for its walleye fishery and exceptional water quality.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Kabekona Lake is in lake class 22.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Sand, Potato, and Long Lake.Walleye were sampled at their highest abundance ever on Kabekona with the gillnet catch rate of 10.0 walleye/net above the management goal of 4.0 walleye/net and above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  The walleye population in Kabekona has benefited from an aggressive and successful walleye fingerling stocking program by the DNR.  After the 1998 survey when walleye were sampled at their lowest recorded levels (0.9 walleye/gillnet), Kabekona was identified as a lake requiring \"quick\" action under the DNR's accelerated walleye management program.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked consecutively for three years (1999-2001) then switched to every other year stocking in 2003.  Walleye fingerlings were marked with an extremely small coded wire tag in the cheek before stocking.  The presence of a tag can be checked with a detector.  The 2003 survey estimated that stocked walleye fingerlings contributed 58 to 78% of the 1998 through 2001 year classes.  The remainder of those year classes consisted of fish that were naturally produced.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 7.6 to 28.8 inches.  Walleye exhibited good growth rates when compared to area lakes.  Fall electrofishing has been conducted annually since 1998 to evaluate natural reproduction of walleye.  Electrofishing catch rates for young-of -the-year walleye have been very low.  Kabekona has excellent walleye spawning habitat of large wind-swept rubble areas as well as inlet and outlet stream areas.  It is hoped that by building back the walleye numbers to a large enough point, that eventually natural reproduction by walleye will contribute significantly to the walleye population in Kabekona Lake.  Yellow perch, an extremely important forage species for walleye, were sampled at their highest levels in 2003 (37.6 perch/gillnet).  Like walleye, yellow perch were sampled at their lowest levels (5.9 perch/gillnet) in 1998.Due to its physical characteristics of deep, oxygenated water, Kabekona was identified as a lake that might support a lake trout population.  Yearling lake trout were stocked for three consecutive years from 2000 to 2002.  A special survey targeted towards sampling lake trout was conducted in September of 2002 and only one lake trout was sampled.  Angler reports as of this time have been scarce.  Any information from anglers on lake trout in Kabekona would be appreciated.Northern pike abundance in Kabekona has generally remained at low levels, composed of medium to quality-sized fish.  The 2003 northern pike gillnet catch rate of 3.7 pike/net is at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have had similar northern pike abundance.  An abundant tullibee (cisco) and white sucker population provide and excellent forage base for northern pike. Kabekona Lake has a low sunfish population.  Kabekona does not have the habitat that sunfish species prefer, such as shallow bays with submerged aquatic vegetation.  Bluegill, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass were all sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Rock bass and pumpkinseed were the only species sampled in higher numbers.  Other species sampled included moderate numbers of yellow bullhead and low numbers of bowfin (dogfish), black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and common shiner.  In addition to tullibee (cisco), Kabekona also has a whitefish population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kabekona Lake is located three miles south of Laporte in northeastern Hubbard County.  Kabekona has a surface area of 2,252 acres and a maximum depth of 133 feet.  A county-owned public access is located on the west shore of the lake.  Kabekona is known for its walleye fishery and exceptional water quality. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Kabekona is in lake class 22.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Sand, Potato, and Long Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at their second highest abundance ever on Kabekona with the gillnet catch rate of 5.4 walleye/net above the current management goal (4.0 walleye/net) and within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Walleye were sampled at their highest abundance (10.0 walleye/gillnet) in the 2003 survey.  The walleye population in Kabekona has benefited from an aggressive and successful walleye fingerling stocking program by the DNR.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 18.9 inches and 2.7 lbs, with fish measured up to 30.3 inches.  Fall electrofishing catch rates for young-of-the-year walleye have been very low.  Kabekona has excellent walleye spawning habitat of large wind-swept rubble areas as well as inlet and outlet stream areas.  It is hoped that if walleye abundance is increased that eventually natural reproduction may contribute significantly to the walleye population in Kabekona Lake.  A protected slot length limit for walleye is currently in place on Kabekona, that requires the release of all walleye between 18.0 and 26.0 inches, with only one walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The possession limit for walleye on Kabekona is four.  The 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot length limit for walleye should help in protecting spawning size fish in Kabekona.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in good numbers (29.2 perch/gillnet).  Yellow perch and walleye abundance has fluctuated together in past surveys.  Anglers will find a few yellow perch of an acceptable size for angling, with perch measured up to 11.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nDue to its physical characteristics of deep, oxygenated water, Kabekona was identified as a lake that might support a lake trout population.  Yearling lake trout were stocked for four consecutive years from 2000 to 2003.  It appears that the stockings haven't been successful in establishing a lake trout population.  No lake trout have been sampled in recent surveys, and angler reports have been scarce.  Any information from anglers on lake trout in Kabekona would be appreciated. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in Kabekona has generally remained at low levels, composed of medium to quality-sized fish.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 2.3 pike/net is below the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.  An abundant tullibee (cisco) and white sucker population provide an excellent forage base for northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish have typically been sampled in low numbers in Kabekona, however, recent surveys have seen some changes.  Bluegill abundance has been increased the past two surveys, with the 2008 catch rate of 11.4 bluegill/trapnet within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Prior to 2003, bluegill were sampled in very low numbers.  Anglers will find bluegill and pumpkinseed to be small in size, with few fish over 7 inches in length.  Largemouth bass and smallmouth bass were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of rock bass, and low numbers of yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), and common shiner. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

A county owned public access is located on the west shore of the lake off MN Highway 64.  Kabekona provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass and Tullibee. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Kabekona Lake is in lake class 22.  Class 22 lakes generally are very large, very deep, with very irregularly shaped shoreline with clean and hard water and a low littoral area (depth under 15 feet).  Other class 22 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Lower Bottle, Long, Potato, and Big Sand.  <br> \nThere is a special Walleye regulation on Kabekona Lake.  All Walleye 20-26 inches must be immediately released, with a possession limit of 4.  Walleyes abundance is very high and most are a great size for anglers of 12-16 inches. The average length was 16.5 inches, with the largest sampled at 28.5 inches.  Yellow Perch are important forage for Walleyes and Northern Pike, and their abundance was on the high end of past samples.  Perch were an average size of 6.7 inches and fish sampled up to 10.5 inches. <br> \nNorthern Pike were present in low numbers with an average size of 22.5 inches.  Most fish were 17 to 27 inches, with the largest sampled at 32 inches. <br> \nKabekona Lake has been designated as a Tullibee (Cisco) refuge lake.  This lake has deep water that stays cold and oxygenated through the summer allowing Tullibee to thrive.  Lake Whitefish are also found in Kabekona, another species that need cold and oxygenated water. <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Kabekona. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the west shore of the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Kabekona is in lake class 22.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Sand, Potato, and Long Lake.  Kabekona Lake is a deep-water lake known for its walleye fishery and exceptional water quality.Walleye were sampled in low numbers (0.9/gillnet), far short of the management goal of 4.5/gillnet and the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  While walleye gillnet catch rates have never been extremely high on Kabekona Lake, this is the lowest catch rate in seven surveys dating back to 1963.  Historical walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 1.8/net (1983) to 4.8/net (1993).  Kabekona is capable of producing big walleye as fish up to 30.5 inches were sampled.  Walleye displayed good growth rates when compared to other lakes in this class. Yellow perch and an abundant tullibee (cisco) population provide an excellent forage base for  walleye and northern pike.  Evaluation of walleye stocking success or natural reproduction has been difficult in the past due to annual stockings.  From 1982 to 1993 walleye stockings alternated from fry to fingerlings.  Stocking was changed to alternate year fry stockings starting in 1995 as it was felt that fry stockings could sustain a walleye population.  No walleye from either the 1995 or 1997 fry stockings were sampled in the survey, suggesting that fry stockings may not be capable of sustaining a consistent walleye population in Kabekona Lake.  Fall electrofishing was conducted for the first time on Kabekona to assess the abundance of young walleye produced through natural reproduction.  Catch rates were low (2.8 walleye/hour) with eleven walleye from the 1998 year class sampled.  While walleye natural reproduction is occurring in Kabekona Lake, it seems to be limited as no strong year classes have been observed in recent years.  Due to the decline in the walleye population, Kabekona is designated as a lake requiring quick action under the DNR's \"accelerated walleye management program\".  Kabekona will be stocked annually with walleye fingerlings for several years in an attempt to improve walleye abundance. Northern pike abundance in Kabekona Lake has generally remained at low levels, composed of quality-sized fish.  The 1998 gillnet catch rate of 2.7/net is below the \"normal range\" for this lake class, but similar to the 1988 and 1993 surveys.  Size of northern pike was large, averaging 23.4 inches and 3.6 pounds.  Northern pike up to 34.8 inches were sampled.  Good growth rates were observed in the northern pike, probably aided by the tullibee (cisco) forage base.  The yellow perch population in Kabekona Lake not only provides a forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations but are of an acceptable size to provide a limited fishery.  Though average size was small (7.8 inches), yellow perch up to 11.6 inches were sampled.Kabekona Lake has a low sunfish population.  Kabekona does not have the habitat that sunfish species prefer, such as shallow bays with submerged aquatic vegetation. Bluegill, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass were all sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Rock bass and pumpkinseed were the only sunfish species in moderate abundance.Other species sampled in low abundance include: yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, black bullhead, and  bowfin.  White sucker were sampled in moderate numbers.  In addition to tullibee (cisco), Kabekona also has a whitefish population.  Several whitefish were observed during fall electrofishing.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Kabekona Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",
