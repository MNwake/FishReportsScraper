Youth Pond has been managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2001 and has been stocked with Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring the July 2015 survey of Youth Pond, Northern Pike abundance was above the third quartile for this lake type. Northern Pike measured from 18.4-25.0 inches in length.  Bluegill abundance has decreased since the 2009 survey and the average length of Bluegill has also decreased, now at 5.2 inches. Black Crappie abundance has increased from the 2009 survey but the average length of Black Crappie decreased from 7.2 to 4.6 inches. Other species sampled were Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Largemouth Bass, and Shortnose Gar. <br> \n <br> \nThe USFWS Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge has many amenities in addition to Youth Pond.  The Refuge is a great place to spend a day fishing, birdwatching, and hiking.  More information about the Refuge can be found at: www.fws.gov/midwest/MinnesotaValley. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at: www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Youth Pond is a 4.6-acre, class 40 lake located within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge in the City of Bloomington.  Youth Pond has been managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2001 and has been stocked with bluegill, channel catfish, largemouth bass and northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring the August 2009 survey of Youth Pond, northern pike abundance was above the median level for this lake type, which is likely due to natural reproduction. Northern pike measured from 13.4 to 28.4 inches in length.  Bluegill abundance has decreased from the 2004 survey but average length has increased to 5.4 inches. Black crappie abundance was 3.2 fish per net and ranged from 4 to 10 inches in length.  Other species sampled were green sunfish, hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe USFWS Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge has many amenities in addition to Youth Pond.  The Refuge is a great place to spend a day fishing, birdwatching, and hiking.  More information about the Refuge can be found at: www.fws.gov/midwest/MinnesotaValley. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at: www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin. <br> \n</p>",
