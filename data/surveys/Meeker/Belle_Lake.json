                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Belle in 2016 to monitor the lake's fish population.  This was the sixth assessment (2008-2016) in the Sentinel Lake, Long Term Monitoring project (formerly known as Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment), of which Belle was a tier two lake.  A total of 15 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets, trap nets, and by spring night-time electrofishing.  The lake was well mixed, on 6/06/16, with the dissolved oxygen concentration being 8.7 mg/l just off the bottom (24.1 feet of water), allowing fish to use all depths of the lake.  Water clarity was only fair, with a secchi disk reading of 5.5 feet, due to an algae bloom.  A small fishing pier was available for anglers at the Piepenberg County Park on the east side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Northern Pike (62) for a catch rate of 5.2/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake or what we would expect for lakes similar to Belle.  The 2013 catch rate was similar at 7.2/net.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2016 (n=21) were generally low, ranging from 0.0 to 9.1/net with an average of 2.5.  Historically, recruitment could be classified as low (<5/net) at Belle, but since 2011 (n=3 assessments) the lake averaged 5.8/net (double the historical average).  A shift seems to have occurred between the 1957 to 2001 time period and the 2003 to 2016 span.  The average gill net catch rate from the latter time period (n=13) was 1.4/net while the average from recent years (n=8) was 4.3/net (three times higher).  In 2016, gill netted Northern Pike were 19.7 to 32.4 inches long with an average of 24.4.  Approximately 97% of the gill net catch was 21 inches or longer, while 10% were 28 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Northern Pike were age-2 to age-6, with four year classes being present.  Age-2 and age-3 fish made up 61% and 32% of the gill net aged fish, respectively.  Growth was fast.       <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers (231) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 19.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2013 catch rate was 30.4/net.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2016 (n=19) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 85.2/net with an average of 21.4.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 3.5 to 14.4 inches long with an average of 4.7.  Only 1 trap netted Black Crappie was over 8 inches in length.  Gill nets sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (45) for a catch rate of 3.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2013 gill net catch rate was 14.9/net.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2016 (n=21) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 20.3/net with an average of 7.3.  Gill netted black crappie were 4.1 to 12.6 inches long with an average of 7.0.  Only 5 of the gill netted fish were 8 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure.  Black crappie were age-1 to age-6, with five year classes present.  Age-1 and age-2 fish made up 76% and 23%, respectively of the trap net aged fish.  Strong year classes were produced in 2014 and 2015, but several weak or missing year classes (2012-2013) indicated sporadic recruitment.  Growth was fast.  Anglers should expect better crappie fishing within a year or two.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Walleye (39) for a catch rate of 3.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  This was the lowest catch rate, going back 26 years, since 1990 (1.8/net).  The 2013 catch rate was 5.6/net.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2016 (n=21), under various stocking regimes, were highly variable ranging from 1.8 to 29.8/net with an average of 10.1.  In 2016, gill netted Walleye were 7.3 to 25.3 inches long with an average of 14.3.  Approximately 49% of the gill net catch was 16 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Walleye were estimated to be age-1 to age-15 with ten year classes present.  Skip years (non-stocked) in the stocking regime accounted for 13% of gill net aged walleye, indicating that natural reproduction was occurring.  The contribution from natural reproduction during fry stocked years was unknown.  Growth was fast.  The current stocking regime (383,000 fry every other year) was initiated in 1993.  Catch rates from 1995 to 2016 (n=11) ranged from 3.3/net (2016) to 29.8/net (1995) with an average of 10.0.  Increasing Northern Pike catch rates (4.3/net during the 2003 to 2016 time period versus 1.4/net for the 1957 to 2001 period) may be having negative impacts on Walleye recruitment at Belle Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Bluegill (99) for a catch rate of 8.3/net which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2013 catch rate was very similar at 7.0/net.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2016 (n=19) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 18.0/net, with an average of 5.9.  In 2016, trap netted Bluegill were 2.5 to 8.5 inches long with an average of 5.2.  Approximately 4% of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure with few fish at sizes preferred by anglers.  Although no plant surveys were done in 2016, anecdotal observations indicated that submergent vegetation was sparse during netting week.  Bluegill were likely being limited by the lake's marginal submergent plant habitat, which is typical for Belle.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 29 Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 17.4/hr., which was the highest on record for Belle Lake.  The 2013 catch rate was 7.2/hr.  Catch rates (n=10) from 1993 to 2016 were mostly low, ranging from 0.6 to 17.4/hr. with an average of 5.4.  Largemouth Bass were 5.3 to 13.4 inches long with an average of 9.6.  Approximately 17% of the electrofishing catch was 12 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure.  Largemouth Bass (all gears) were age-1 to age-4 with four year classes present.  Growth was fast.  Data indicated inconsistent recruitment for this species.  Largemouth Bass were likely not doing well for the same reasons that the Bluegill were not flourishing (marginal submergent vegetation habitat).  Observations during Belle's fall electrofishing assessment indicated that longer (up to 15 inches in length) Largemouth Bass were present in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Yellow Perch (290) for a catch rate of 24.2/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2013 catch rates was 16.0/net.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2016 (n=21) were highly variable ranging from 0.5 to 59.8/net with an average of 15.5.  Yellow Perch were 4.9 to 9.5 inches long with an average of 6.0.  A total of 4 fish were 9 inches or longer, indicating that a few keepers were available for anglers.  Yellow Perch were age-1 to age-3 with three year classes present.  Approximately 87% of the gill netted fish were from the 2014 year class.  The 2015 year class could also be strong, but they may not have fully recruited to the gear at sampling time.   Yellow Perch were an important forage species at Belle Lake. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (20) for a catch rate of 1.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates (n=19) from 1957 to 2016 were mostly low, ranging from 0.1 to 5.2/net with an average of 1.8.  Trap netted Common Carp were 6.1 to 10.8 inches long with an average of 7.8.  Gill nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (11) for a catch rate of 0.9/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic gill net catch rates (n=21) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 14.2/net with an average of 3.3.  Gill netted Common Carp were 7.7 to 29.3 with an average of 15.7.  Common Carp would be difficult to control, at Belle Lake, due to a highly connected and large watershed. <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Black Bullhead (9) for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2013 catch rate was also low (0.3/net).  Historic catch rates from 1957 to 2016 (n=21) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 217.2/net with an average of 42.4.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 4.9 to 9.3 inches long with an average of 7.9.  Trap nets sampled low numbers of Black Bullhead (58) for a catch rate of 4.8/net which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Trap netted Black Bullhead were 4.6 to 13.5 inches long with an average of 7.3.  Only 6 fish were 9 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure.  In recent years, some area lakes have experienced declines in Black Bullhead abundance and a similar shift seems to have occurred at Belle (2006 to 2016 time period).  Since 2006, the average gill net catch rate (1.4/net) was much lower (45 times) than the average from the 1957 to 2003 time period (62.9/net).  The exact reason for the drop was unknown, but a decreased winterkill frequency in connected Cedar Lake, and subsequent bullhead migrations, could partially explain the decline.  The last big Black Bullhead catch rate occurred at Belle in 2003 (79.1/gill net), two years after the severe 2001 winterkill in Cedar Lake.  Black Bullhead often spawn a large year class immediately after a severe winterkill, due to the large decrease in the lake's predator species (Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, Walleye, etc.). <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included; Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Tadpole Madtom, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nCatch data was compared to lake class 34 medians.  Gamefish species sampled in the gillnets were walleye, yellow perch, black crappie, white crappie, largemouth bass and bluegill.  The walleye gillnet catch has increased over the past two years from 1.75 per net in 1990 and 12.4 in 1991, to 20.0 per net in 1992, which is well above the lake class median of 3.0 per gillnet.  Walleye trapnet catches of 5.7/set were above the normal range for this lake class.  Size composition in trapnets was similar to that taken in gillnets.  A high percentage of the fish sampled were age 2 fish, with an average length at capture of 13.8 inches, and may be the result of a 1990 fry stocking.  These fish appeared to be acceptable to anglers, as Belle Lake received high fishing pressure during the early part of the season and many anglers harvested these fish.  The most frequently sampled walleye were age 1 fish.  Very few older walleye were sampled.  Growth was good for all ages of walleye sampled.  Fall electrofishing revealed a catch of 30 out of 42 fish to be age 0, (larger fish were not aged - total catch was 77 walleyes).  These could not be accounted for by stocking records.  These fish appear to be the result of natural reproduction.  Further assessment is needed to quantify the contribution to the fishery through natural reproduction.  The median length group of all walleye sampled was 13 to 13.9 inches.  Black crappie numbers in the gill (2.0/lift) were below the normal range.  The trapnet catch of 3.2/set was within the normal range, but well below the median value of 8.6/set.  Most fish sampled were age 1 and 2 fish.  The black crappie population in Belle Lake has fluctuated widely over time and has been at low levels recently, which prompted stocking of black crappie from Little Mud Lake.  Yellow perch numbers of 12.8/gillnet were slightly above the median value.  Nearly two-thirds of the perch were age 1, with the rest nearly equally divided between age 2 and 3 fish.  The older fish ranged in size from 6.5 to 10 inches in length.  Gillnet catches for white crappie and largemouth bass were both below the normal range.  No northern pike were sampled in either type net.  Very little submerged vegetation exists for in-lake spawning of northern pike in Belle Lake and the barriers at the outlet to Cedar Lake and between Belle and Stahls Lakes probably keeps northern pike numbers low.  Trapnet catches for bluegill, at 16/set, were near the lake class median (19.7/net).  Almost one-half of the sample were age 1 fish, with most of the remaining fish being age 2 and 3.  The age 3 bluegill ranged in size from 4.5 to 7.9 inches, but more than three -fourths of these were over 6 inches long.  Five age classes of bluegill were present in the sample.  Bluegill trapnet catches have fluctuated widely on Belle Lake in the past.  Largemouth bass were taken in trapnets at a rate of 0.2/set, which is below the median, but within the normal range.  White crappie numbers were well below the median value.  Only six white crappie were sampled in trapnets and five of these were greater than12 inches long and were ages 5 through 7.  Black bullhead and carp seemed to be abundant.  Although bullhead numbers for the gillnet catch were well below the median value, the trapnet catch (133/set) was above the normal range.  The trapnet catch shows an increase from last year, when numbers were within the normal range.  As typical of area lakes, bullhead number in Belle Lake have fluctuated over time.  Carp number in the trapnets were near the median, but gillnet catches (14.2/set) were above the normal range.  Nighttime electrofishing was conducted on Belle Lake in both spring and fall.  Spring electrofishing sampling collected only largemouth bass.  In the fall, bass and walleye were captured.  Catch per effort (CPUE) for bass was similar for both samples (12.6/hour in spring vs. 12.1/hour in fall).  Both samples consisted almost entirely of age 1 fish (one age 2 bass was sampled in the spring).  Springtime lengths ranged from 5.5 to 8.4 inches.  This same age class, sampled again in the fall ranged in size from 7 to 10.9 inches.  Walleye CPUE for the fall electrofishing was 40.5 fish/hour.  As discussed earlier, 30 of the walleye sampled were young of the year fish.  The remaining 12 were age 1 fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Belle Lake was conducted on June 23 and 24, 2022 by Hutchinson Area fisheries staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen sampling stations.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 12 stations and a 15-foot seine was used for 1 station. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Iowa Darter) and three species (i.e., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish) that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Belle Lake is impaired as indicated by an FIBI score of 32. Belle's FIBI score is below the impairment threshold of 45 for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the South Fork of the Crow River Watershed intensive monitoring in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Belle Lake, Meeker County is an 826-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet.  Net catch data was compared to that of other lakes within its ecological classification.  The lake management plan lists walleye and northern pike as primary management species and black crappie as a secondary species.A population assessment conducted on Belle Lake during the week of June 1, 1998, sampled 14 species of fish.  The assessment utilized standard lake survey gill nets, trap nets, and shoreline seining.  Spring, night-time, electrofishing was conducted to assess largemouth bass.  Other sampling included spring trapnetting to mark walleye for estimating the totalf walleye population.  Fall electrofishing was conducted to assess walleye natural reproduction.  The four most abundant species in gill nets were yellow perch, black bullhead, walleye, and black crappie.  The four most abundant species in trap nets were black crappie, yellow perch, black bullhead, and yellow bullhead.Trap nets sampled black crappies, for a catch rate of 31.4 per lift.  This catch rate is considered high for a lake of this type.  Black crappies ranged in length from 3.5 to 11.7 inches, with an average length of 7.9 inches.Gill nets sampled 24 northern pike, for a catch rate of 2.0 per lift.  This net catch is lower than most lakes in this lake class.  Northern pike ranged in length from 14.0 to 26.3 inches, with an average length of 20.5 inches.Gill nets sampled 224 walleyes, for a catch rate of 18.7 per lift.  This catch rate is considered high for a lake of this type.  Walleyes ranged in length from 6.0 to 24.1 inches, with an average length of 16.1.Fall electrofishing was conducted on October 20, 1998.  A total of 394 walleyes were collected of which 14 were young-of-the-year fish.  Young-of-the-year walleyes were sampled in 1994, 1996, and 1998 when no stocking took place.  This indicates that natural reproduction of walleyes is occurring in Belle Lake.  The relative contribution of natural reproduction to the walleye population has not been determined.  The present lake management plan calls for an every other year stocking regime of walleye fry (1,000/littoral acre.  The stocking schedule was begun in 1993 and actually constituted a reduction in the freqency of walleye stocking.  Prior to 1993, Belle was stocked on nearly an annual basis.  Though a complete evaluation of the effects of the present stocking program has not been evaluated, it initially appears that the net catch of walleyes has risen following the reduction of stocking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Belle Lake in 2013 to monitor the Lake's fish community.  The current Lake Management Plan listed Walleye and Black Crappie as primary management species while Northern Pike were listed as a secondary species.         <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 67 Walleye for a catch rate of 5.6/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this type.  The 2013 catch rate was similar to the 2011 catch rate (4.1/net).  Catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=19), under various stocking regimes, ranged from 1.8 to 29.8/net with an average of 10.8.  The current stocking regime (1,000 fry/littoral acre every-other-year) was initiated in 1993 and catch rates from 1995 to 2013 (n=10) ranged from 4.1 to 29.8/net with an average of 10.7.  Gill netted Walleye were 11.3 to 26.1 inches long with an average of 18.5, in 2013.  Approximately 72% of the gill net sample was 17 inches or longer.  Trap nets sampled Walleye up to 28.8 inches in length.  Gill netted Walleye were age-2 to age-15 with 9 year-classes being present.  Years when fish were not stocked made up 31% of the aged Walleye, indicating that natural reproduction was occurring.  Growth would be considered fast.  The 2009 and 2011 year-classes would be considered to be moderate in size.  A fall electrofishing assessment, conducted in October, indicated that an exceptionally strong year-class of Walleye had been produced in 2013.    <br> \n  <br> \nGill nets sampled 86 Northern Pike for a catch rate of 7.2/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this type.  The 2013 catch rate was the second highest on record for Belle Lake.  The 2011 catch rate was 5.1/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=19) were variable ranging from 0.0 to 9.1/net with an average of 2.3.  The latest four catch rates indicated a possible increasing trend for Northern Pike at Belle Lake.  In 2011, gill netted Northern Pike were 18.4 to 33.8 inches long with an average of 24.4.  Trap nets sampled 6 fish that were 28 inches or longer, with the longest being 35.6 inches.  Northern Pike were age-2 to age-8 with seven year-classes present.  Age-3 fish accounted for 47% of the gill net sample.  Growth was moderate.  Good numbers of Northern Pike, along with quality sized fish should provide anglers plenty of action on Belle Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 192 Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 16.0/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this type.  Yellow Perch were the most abundant fish gill netted in 2013.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=19) were highly variable ranging from 0.1 to 59.8/net with an average of 15.3.  The latest three catch rates (2010, 2011, and 2013) may have indicated a downward trend in abundance.  Gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.2 to 9.5 inches long with an average of 6.1.  Only 1 fish was 8 inches or longer.  Yellow Perch were age-3 and age-4.  Age-3 fish made up 99% of the gill net sample.  The stronger age-3 year-class correlated with the record high gill net catch (59.8/net) in 2010.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 179 Black Crappie for a catch rate of 14.9/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this type.  The 2011 catch rate was (1.9/net).   Gill net catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=19) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 20.3/net with an average of 6.8.  In 2013, gill netted Black Crappie were 4.1 to 8.8 inches long with an average of 6.4.  Trap nets sampled 365 Black Crappie for a catch rate of 30.4/net, which was above the normal range.  Black Crappie were the most abundant fish sampled with trap nets in 2013.  The 2011 trap net catch rate was also high at 35.0/net.  Trap net catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=17) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 85.2/net with an average of 18.9.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 2.9 to 11.2 inches long with an average of 6.7.  Less than 1% of the trap net catch was 9 inches or longer.  Data indicated that the population was currently dominated by smaller sized fish.  Black Crappie were age-1 through age-6 with six year-classes present.  Age-2 and age-3 were the dominant year-classes, accounting for 97% of the trap net sample and 99% of the gill net catch.  Growth was moderate. <br> \n  <br> \nTrap nets sampled 84 Bluegill for a catch rate of 7.0/net, which was below the normal range for a lake of this type.  The 2011 catch rate was also low (4.4/net).  Catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=17) were almost all low, ranging from 0.0 to 18.0/net with an average of 5.5.  In 2013, trap netted Bluegill were 1.3 to 7.3 inches long with an average of 4.8.  Only 1 fish was 7 inches or longer.   Belle's lack of submergent vegetation was likely a major limiting factor for Bluegill.  Occasionally, Belle will produce some nicer Bluegill, but not very often.    <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 12 Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 7.2/hr of electrofisher on-time.  The catch rate in 2011 was 1.8/hr.  Catch rates from 1993 to 2013 (n=9) were mostly low, ranging from 0.6 to 16.2/hr of electrofisher on-time with an average of 4.1.  Electrofished Largemouth Bass were 8.2 to 16.5 inches long with an average of 12.9.  Largemouth Bass were age-2 through age-6 with five year-classes present.  Belle's lack of submergent vegetation was likely a major limiting factor for Largemouth Bass.  Most years, the Largemouth Bass fishing would be catagorized as being fair at Belle Lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 3 Black Bullhead in 2013 for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the normal range for a lake of this type.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=19) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 217.2/net with an average of 45.9.  The 2013 trap net catch rate was 0.3/net and the lowest ever measured at Belle Lake.  Trap net catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=17) were highly variable, ranging from 0.3 to 217.9/net with an average of 55.2.  In 2013, trap netted Black Bullhead were 11.8 to 14.3 inches long with an average of 13.1.  Black Bullhead have not been sampled in high numbers at Belle Lake since 2003 (79.1/gill net).     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 0 Carp in 2013, which was the lowest catch rate ever recorded at Belle.  The 2011 catch rate was 0.08/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=19) were variable ranging from 0.0 to 14.2/net with an average of 3.6.  Trap nets also sampled low numbers (4) of Carp in 2013 (0.3/net).  The 2011 catch rate was 0.2/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=17) ranged from 0.08 to 5.2/net with an average of 1.8.  Trap netted Carp were 18.5 to 28.5 inches long in 2013.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Belle, located near Hutchinson, is one of the bigger Lakes (864 acres) in Meeker County and it can get rough on a windy day.  A large County owned access, with a double cement boat ramp, is present on the southeast shore and a medium sized state owned access with a cement ramp is available on the east shore.  Belle has 5.53 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Belle is a class 24 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area include Collinwood and Big Swan.  Piepenberg County Park on the lake's southeast shore offers many amenities, including a couple shore fishing spots. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye anglers know that Belle typically offers some good fishing throughout the open water and ice fishing seasons.  Historic gill netting assessments, indicated variable numbers of Walleye being present from survey to survey, but numbers were up in 2020.  Most of the 2020 catch was in the 13 to 19 inch length range, averaging a respectable 16 inches.  Lindy rigs and bottom bouncers with a spinner and crawler are tough to beat if you are after Walleye.  Historically speaking, Northern Pike are rarely overabundant at Belle, and this was again the case this year.  Maximum pike length was 27 inches.  Spinner baits, spoons, sucker minnows, and trolling cranks will all catch pike.  Black Crappie net catches were down in 2020, but fish up to 10 inches were sampled.  Occasionally, anglers will stumble upon some nice gills at Belle, but the lake is not known for its consistent sunfish angling.  Largemouth Bass anglers know that there are typically not high numbers of fish present at Belle, but some decent fish can be found for those who want to put in the time.  Bulrush and some rocks are present, along with a fair number of docks to cast around if you are after bass.  Submergent vegetation is usually sparse at Belle, but it can be a little more abundant on the north end of the lake.  High numbers of Yellow Perch can slow the Walleye bite at any lake, and perch were fairly abundant at Belle in 2020. <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter include Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.      <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Eurasian watermilfoil is present at Belle Lake.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.  Thanks and good fishing! <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nIn 1990, net catches for all species, except carp and black bullhead, decreased compared to 1988.  Black bullheads were very abundant (above the normal range for the lake class) in both gill net and trap net samples, averaging 212.2 and 139.8 fish per lift, respectively.  In previous investigations, black bullhead gill net catch has ranged from 1.71 fish per lift in 1947, to 217.17 fish per lift in 1975.  In 1983, gill net catch for black bullhead was 9.00 fish per lift.  Apparently, bullhead abundance in Belle Lake, for whatever reason, is cyclical.  In 1975, when black bullhead abundance was high, net catches of gamefish species, similar to 1990, were low.  Gill net catches for walleye in 1990 averaged 1.75 fish per lift, still within the normal range for the lake class, but considerably below the 1988 catch of 15.50 fish per lift.  Walleye in the sample ranged from 11.5 to 27.9 inches.  White and black crappie trap net catches decreased to their lowest levels since 1975.  Trap net catch for white crappies was 0.50 fish per lift and 0.00 fish per lift for black crappie.  Average trap net catch for white and black crappie for years surveyed 1947 through 1990 was 9.51 and 15.58 fish per lift, respectively.  In 1990, all white crappie sampled measured 8.0 inches or larger, and in 1988, 94% of the white and 92% of the black crappie were 7.0 inches and larger, indicating that failure of young fish to recruit to the population may have caused the decline in the crappie population.  A possible, although speculative, reason for recruitment failure of crappie is the low water levels in Belle Lake.  During years with ordinary to high lake levels, fish can pass between Belle and Cedar.  Cedar is a shallow, fertile, weedy lake that winterkills annually, but produces a good nursery area for young of the year (YOY) fish.  Few YOY of any species have been recorded from Belle Lake in previous investigations, but in surveys in 1990 and 1983, yearling white and black crappies compromised a significant portion of the catch.  Submerged aquatic macrophytes are rare in Belle Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Belle Lake has a history of being one of the more consistent walleye producing lakes in the Hutchinson Management Area.  It is a moderate size lake (826 acres), with a maximum depth of 25 feet.  Belle Lake is a hardwater lake with high turbidity and very little submerged vegetation.  There are two public accesses on the east side of the lake.  Piepenberg Park (McLeod County), located on the southeast end of the lake, has a campground and picnic shelters.     DNR survey crews assessed the fish population in 1993 using trapnets, gillnets and electrofishing.  Walleye abundance in gillnets remained high with an average of 22.2 per net.  This is approximately seven times the average for similar lake types.  Age two and three walleye made up 90% of the catch.  Growth was good, with two year olds ranging from 12 to 14 inches and three year olds being from 16 to 18 inches.  The average length of walleye captured in gillnets was 15.3 inches.  Past walleye stocking practices on Belle Lake included fry, fingerling and yearling stocking.  Through recent evaluations, it was determined that natural reproduction many contribute to the walleye population.  To further evaluate natural reproduction, the current management plan calls for walleye fry stocking on a alternate year basis.    Bluegill numbers taken in trapnets during the survey were near average for lakes of this type.  Most of the bluegill were from 2 to 4 years old.  Nearly 70% of the bluegill were longer than 6 inches, but only 10% were longer than 7 inches.  With an additional year of growth many of these bluegill should be a desirable size to anglers in 1994.       Black crappie numbers were also near average.  The average length of the black crappie was 7.4 inches, but many of the fish sampled were only two years old.  Only four white crappie were sampled in trapnets, but all were large, older fish.  The average length of white crappie was 13.7 inches.     Yellow perch may provide good fishing in 1994.  A gillnet catch of 20 per net was twice the average for this lake type and nearly 70% were longer than eight inches.  Northern pike numbers remain low in Belle Lake and only one northern pike was captured during this survey.</p>",

The principal gamefish is the walleye and the population appears adequate at 9.5 per gillnet lift.  Growth is good and age classes II-VII are represented.  Fry stocking in 1976 and fingerling stocking in 1979 appear as a supplement to natural reproduction.  Northern pike populations appear at low levels at 2 per gillnet and yellow perch are abundant as forage at 19/lift.  White and black crappies of a small size, age 1 and 5.5 inches total length (TL), were vulnerable to the nets.  Older crappies observed in the creel apparently were not sampled.  Small numbers of yellow perch, shiners and carp (1) were taken in shoreline seining.  Angler complaints of small black bullheads have subsided for the time being.  Walleye and crappie fishing has been excellent at times.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Belle Lake in 2009 for the SLICE long term monitoring project.  A total of 14 different species of fish were sampled, plus hybrid sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 68 walleye for a catch rate of 5.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was 7.8/net.  Walleye were 7.8 to 22.0 inches long averaging 18.8 inches.  Gill netted walleye were 1 to 13 years old with 9 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate.  Walleye fry are stocked every-other-year at Belle Lake.  Non-stocked years accounted for 21% of the gill net sample, indicating that natural reproduction was occurring at Belle.  Anglers should expect fair numbers of average sized fish.  A fall electrofishing survey in 2009 captured high numbers of fingerling walleye at Belle Lake.  This strong year class could provide better fishing in several years.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 10 northern pike for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was 2.4/net.  Northern pike were 17.9 to 33.9 inches long averaging 27.8 inches.  Northern pike were 1 to 5 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.  As usual, anglers may expect to find low numbers of above average size northern pike at Belle.      <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 154 yellow perch for a catch rate of 12.8/net, which was within the normal range for Belle Lake.  The 2008 catch rate was 2.8/net.  Yellow perch were 5.0 to 9.2 inches long averaging 6.1 inches.  Yellow perch were 1 to 5 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate.  Most fish were too small to be of interest to anglers, with only 3% of the gill net catch being 8 inches or longer.  Yellow perch are likely a preferred forage for walleye. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 29 carp for a catch rate of 2.4/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was 1.6/net.  Carp were 20.5 to 27.9 inches long averaging 24.6 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 75 black crappie for a catch rate of 6.3/net, which was within the normal range for Belle Lake.  The 2008 catch rate was similar, at 6.8/net.  Black crappie were 3.7 to 10.9 inches long averaging 6.9 inches.  The gill net catch rate was 7.2/net with fish averaging 6.3 inches in length.  The 2008 gill net catch rate was 7.0/net, with fish averaging 7.5 inches in length.  Black crappie were 1 to 4 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Only the 2007 year-class appeared to be moderately strong, accounting for 81% of the gill net catch.  Growth was moderate.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 23 bluegill for a catch rate of 1.9/net, which was below the normal range for Belle Lake.  The 2008 catch rate was 0.6/net.  Bluegill were 2.8 to 7.4 inches long averaging 5.2 inches.  Bluegill were 1 to 4 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.  Bluegill anglers shouldn't expect great action at Belle Lake, during most years.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 1 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 0.6/hour of electrofisher on-time.  This tied the lowest catch rate ever measured at Belle Lake, which occurred in 2008.  Catch rates from 1993-2009 (n=6) ranged from 0.6/hr to 16.2/hr, averaging 4.5/hr.  The 2009 fish was 15.7 inches long.  The largemouth bass was 6 years old.  Growth was moderate.  Anglers should expect marginal bass fishing at Belle Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Belle Lake in 2011 to monitor the Lake's chemical, physical, and biological characteristics.  Belle's lakeshed (5,206 acres) was dominated by row crop agriculture.  Forest, mostly a thin fringe plus a few larger lots, made up the largest type of shoreline use in 2011.  The lake to lakeshed ratio was 1:6.  All varieties of submergent vegetation (9) were officially ranked as rare at Belle Lake in 2011.  Anecdotal observations indicated that submergent vegetation was much more abundant in 2011 compared to recent years.  The maximum depth at which submergent vegetation was sampled was 11.1 feet.  For shoalwater substrates, sand was abundant.  Most of the shoreline that could be developed was, with 51 homes/cabins/farms being counted.  Several areas of the shoreline experienced erosion in the spring of 2011, due to high water levels.  Most anglers fishing Belle Lake are typically after black crappie or walleye.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 49 walleye for a catch rate of 4.1/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2011 catch rate was the lowest recorded in the last two decades.  The 2010 catch rate was 6.0/net.   Catch rates from 1975 to 2011 (n=18), under various stocking regimes, ranged from 1.8 to 29.8/net with an average of 11.1.  The current stocking regime (1,000 fry/littoral acre every-other-year) was initiated in 1993 and catch rates from 1995 to 2011 (n=9) ranged from 4.1 to 29.8/net with an average of 11.2.  Gill netted walleye were 9.2 to 24.1 inches long with an average of 15.6, in 2011.  Approximately 76% of the gill net catch was 14 inches or longer.  Walleye were 2 to 14 years old with 9 year-classes being present.  Years when walleye were not stocked accouted for 41% of the aged walleye.  These fish were the result of natural reproduction and/or immigration.  A fall electrofishing assessment in 2011 sampled 144 young-of-the-year walleye, which indicated that a fairly strong year-class had been produced.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 61 northern pike for a catch rate of 5.1/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2011 catch rate was the second highest on record for Belle Lake.  The 2010 catch rate was 1.6/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2011 (n=18) were variable ranging from 0.0 to 9.1/net with an average of 1.98. In 2011, gill netted northern pike were 11.3 to 34.6 inches long with an average of 21.7.   Quality sized fish were present in 2011, with approximately 49% of the gill net sample being 21 inches or longer and 18% being 28 inches or longer.  Northern pike were 1 to 7 years old with 7 year-classes present.  The age 1 year-class was strong, accounting for 45% of the gill net catch.  The 2010 year-class averaged 16.9 inches in length at time of capture.  Growth was fast.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 295 yellow perch for a catch rate of 24.6/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2011 catch rate was the third highest on record and yellow perch were the most abundant fish gill netted in 2011.  The 2010 catch rate was even higher at 59.8/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2011 (n=18) were highly variable ranging from 0.1 to 59.8/net with an average of 15.3.  Gill netted yellow perch were 5.1 to 9.5 inches long with an average of 6.5.  Approximately 10% of the gill net catch was 8 inches or longer, but only 1% of the catch was 9 inches or longer.  Yellow perch a likely an important forage base for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 23 black crappie for a catch rate of 1.9/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was (14.7/net).   Gill net catch rates from 1975 to 2011 (n=18) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 20.3/net with an average of 6.3.  In 2011, gill netted black crappie were 3.9 to 8.5 inches long with an average of 7.1.  Trap nets sampled 420 black crappie for a catch rate of 35.0/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Black crappie were the most abundant fish sampled with trap nets in 2011.  The 2010 trap net catch rate was also high at 85.2/net.  Trap net catch rates from 1975 to 2011 (n=16) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 85.2/net with an average of 18.2.  Trap netted black crappie were 3.5 to 11.7 inches long with an average of 6.8.   Approximately 20% of the sample was 8 inches or longer while 2% was 9 inches or longer.  Anecdotal fishing reports suggest that winter anglers often target black crappie at Belle Lake. <br> \n         <br> \nTrap nets sampled 53 bluegill for a catch rate of 4.4/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was similar at 5.8/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2011 (n=16) were almost all low, ranging from 0.0 to 18.0/net with an average of 5.4.  In 2011, trap netted bluegill were 3.9 to 8.1 inches long with an average of 6.1.  Approximately 26% of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer.   Belle Lake's lack of submergent vegetation was likely a major limiting factor for bluegill.    <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 3 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 1.8/hr of electrofisher on-time.  The catch rate in 2010 was 0.6/hr.  Catch rates from 1993 to 2011 (n=8) were mostly low, ranging from 0.6 to 16.2/hr with an average of 3.7.  Electrofished largemouth bass were 7.5 to 13.4 inches long with an average of 9.9.  Largemouth bass were 2 and 3 years old with 2 year-classes being present.  This indicated that recruitment was very low.  Growth was moderate.  Belle's lack of submergent vegetation was likely a major limiting factor for largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets did not sample any black bullhead in 2011. Catch rates from 1975 to 2011 (n=18) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 217.2/net with an average of 48.5. The 2011 trap net catch rate was low at 0.7/net.  Trap net catch rates from 1975 to 2011 (n=16) were highly variable, ranging from 0.4 to 217.9/net with an average of 58.6.  Black bullhead have not been sampled in high numbers at Belle Lake since 2003 (79.1/gill net).  In 2011, trap netted black bullhead were 5.8 to 13.3 inches long with an average of 11.3.     <br> \n   <br> \nGill nets sampled 1 carp for a catch rate of 0.08/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2011 catch rate was the lowest ever recorded at Belle.  The 2010 catch rate was also low at 0.8/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2011 were variable ranging from 0.1 to 14.2/net with an average of 3.8.  Trap nets also sampled low numbers of carp in 2011 (0.2/net) and in 2010 (0.1/net).  Trap net catch rates from 1975 to 2011 (n=16) ranged from 0.1 to 5.2/net with an average of 1.9.  Trap netted carp ranged from 22.9 to 26.3 inches long in 2011.   <br> \n</p>",

The northern population is still low at 3.7 per lift, though this is up slightly from 2.0 per lift in 1980.  There are good populations of black and white crappies.  There were good numbers of perch at 19 per lift.\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Belle is a moderate-sized lake (864 acres) located north of the City of Hutchinson on the Meeker/McLeod County border. A modest sized state-owned access with a single cement boat ramp is present on the east shore. A large county-owned access with a double cement plank ramp is located on the southeast shore. Belle has 5 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 25 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Belle is a class 24 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Erie and Big Swan in Meeker County. Adjacent to the lake's southeast shore is Piepenberg County Park, which offers camping and hiking trails. Although no formal plant survey was completed this year, rooted aquatic vegetation is typically sparse at Belle Lake. Water clarity is usually poor due to planktonic algae. Boaters need to be aware during periods of low water (as seen during the 2021 and 2022 droughts) that various rock hazards are present at Belle and launching larger vessels at Belle's shallow boat ramps can be difficult. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in moderate numbers in 2022, with gill netted fish averaging just over 14 inches in length. The longest Walleye sampled was 25 inches. Approximately 40% of the gill net catch was 15 inches and longer, indicating that a fair number of quality-sized walleye are present. Naturally reproduced Walleye contributed substantially to the 2022 catch, with approximately 98% of the gill net aged fish coming from non-stocked years.  <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Northern Pike were gill netted this year, but fish averaged an impressive 26 inches in length. The longest pike captured was 31 inches. Northern pike regulations were revised at a statewide level beginning in 2018 to better accommodate regional differences in pike habitats and population abundance and size structuring. Three zones were established for northern pike with their own bag and length limit restrictions. In the north-central zone where Belle Lake is located, anglers can keep up to 10 northern pike, but no more than two pike larger than 26 inches; and all pike from 22 to 26 inches must be released. This zone regulation is meant to reduce small pike abundance by shifting population size structure back to more medium to large pike. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Yellow Perch were netted in the assessment and all were small. Yellow Perch provide important forage for the lake's predator species. Low numbers of Largemouth Bass were sampled during spring nighttime electrofishing, with the longest fish being 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Black Crappie were netted in the 2022 summer nets. Gill netted crappie averaged almost 8 inches, while trap net crappie averaged 9 inches. The longest Black Crappie captured was 11.5 inches. The northern lagoon within Piepenberg County Park is a popular fishing spot immediately after ice-out.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes that anglers may encounter include Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Belle Lake has the AIS - Eurasian Watermilfoil. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local MNDNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the MNDNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

Walleye in gill net samples were comprised mainly of two age classes, age I and II.  Bluegill and black crappie were present in trap net samples at 7.0 and 6.3 fish per lift, respectively.  Both net catches for bluegill and black crappie were below their respective lake class medians.  The abundance of black bullheads in both gill net and trap net samples has decreased from 1990 when respective catches were 212.2 and 139.8 fish per lift to 11.1 and 68.3 fish per lift in 1991.  Water levels in Belle Lake returned to normal in 1991 and consequently, conditions for natural reproduction of centrarchids (bluegill and crappie) had improved.  Seine catches of young of the year bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass increased between 1990 and 1991 from 0.0, 0.0 and 0.7 fish per haul, respectively to 77.2, 1.2 and 4.2 per haul.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment, using gill nets and trap nets, was conducted at Belle Lake in 2006 to monitor the fish community.  Water clarity was 3.5 feet during the week of netting. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of walleye were gill netted (13.3/net) in 2006.  The 2003 catch rate was similar at 9.2/net.  Gill netted walleye were 9.1-27.4 inches long, averaging 13.8 inches.  Approximately 74% of the gill net catch was 13 inches or longer.  Fry stocking (every other year), along with natural reproduction maintains the walleye population at Belle.  Low numbers of northern pike were gill netted (2.8/net), but this is not unusual at Belle Lake.  Pike were 20.7-35.5 inches long averaging 25.6 inches.  High numbers of black crappie were trap netted (45.4/net).  Trap netted black crappie were 3.6-13.1 inches long averaging 5.9 icnhes.  Only 18%  of the crappie trap netted were 8 inches or longer.  Low to fair numbers of bluegiil were trap netted and nice sized fish were present.  Trap netted bluegill were 2.9-9.3 inches long, averaging 5.9 inches.  Approximately 22% of that sample was 8 inches or longer.  High numbers of yellow perch were gill netted (23.2/net), averaging 6.4 inches.  Only 4% of the perch gill netted were 8 inches or longer.  Low numbers of black bullhead were sampled in gill and trap nets.  Gill netted black bullhead averaged 10.3 inches.  Low numbers of carp were sampled in both gill and trap nets.  Gill netted carp averaged 24.1 inches.  </p>",

Their ages range from I-VI with most falling in the II and III age classes.  Growth is good and spawning areas are fair.  Three northern pike (age III) were taken during the survey.  Also, two largemouth bass were taken (ages I and III).  There were three pumpkinseeds and two bluegills taken, ranging from III to VI years.  The population of black crappies was about average for lakes in the area.  There is however, a large number of white crappies.  In Belle, there were 21.83 white crappies per gill net set, whereas the local median is 6.02 per set.  There is a large population of black bullheads (5 times the local median). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Belle Lake is an 826 acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet.  Belle Lake offers a variety of angling opportunities.  A fishery survey conducted in 1995 sampled fifteen species of fish.  A McLeod County Park is located on the southeast side of the lake and has a boat ramp and camping facilities.  Black crappie and bluegill are present and net catches of both species have been within the normal range for this lake class in recent years.  The average length of black crappie sampled in trapnets was only 8 inches, but many were young fish that should provide good angling over the next several years.  Belle Lake is also known to produce large crappie at times.  Nearly all of the bluegill sampled were over 6 inches long and average length was over 7 inches.  Black bullhead can also provide good angling for nice size fish.  The panfish that has provided the best angling in the past several years is the yellow perch.  Gillnet catches were above the normal range for this lake class.  The average length was just over 7 inches, but perch up to 10 inches were sampled.  Anecdotal reports indicate that the best perch angling occurs during the ice-fishing season.  Northern pike are present but net catches were below the expected range for this lake class.  Although net catches were low, the northern pike were nice size and average length was nearly 25 inches.  Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers during spring electrofishing.  Belle Lake is best known as a consistent producer of walleye.  Walleye are abundant and the gillnet catch rate was well above the expected range.  A wide size range of walleye were sampled and the average length was nearly 14 inches.  Strong year classes of age 2 and 3 walleye should provide good angling for the next several years.  Natural reproduction is evident, though we are uncertain to what extent it contributes to the fishery.  Until more is learned, alternate year walleye fry stocking combined with natural reproduction should continue to produce good walleye angling on Belle Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Belle Lake in 2010 for the Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE) long term monitoring project.  Near-shore seining and backpack electrofishing were conducted for a state-wide Index of Biotic Integrity initiative.  That analysis was done by Fisheries Research.  The water clarity was relatively good with a secchi disk reading of 5.7 feet on 6/15/10.      <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 72 walleye for a catch rate of 6.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2009 catch rate was similar at 5.7/net.  The average catch rate from 1975 to 2010 for all assessments (n=17), under various stocking regimes, was 11.5/net. Walleye were 7.1 to 28.5 inches long with a mean of 17.9, in 2010.  Approximately 63% of the gill net catch was 18 inches or longer.   Walleye were 1 to 11 years old with 11 year-classes present.  Age 2 fish made up the largest portion (35%) of the sample.  Years when walleye were not stocked accounted for 41% of the aged walleye, indicating that natural reproduction can be significant.  The latest stocking regime (1,000 fry/littoral acre every-other-year) was initiated in 1993.  Catch rates from 1998 to 2010 (n=7) ranged from 5.7 to 18.7/net averaging 9.6.  Growth was moderate to fast.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 19 northern pike for a catch rate of 1.6/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2009 catch rate was also low (0.8/net).  Catch rates from 1975 to 2010 (n=17) were generally low ranging from 0.0 to 9.1/net averaging 1.8.  Northern pike were 19.5 to 34.6 inches long with a large average length of 27.7 inches.  Northern pike were 1 to 6 years old with 6 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate.   <br> \n   <br> \nGill nets sampled 717 yellow perch for a catch rate of 59.8/net, which was above the normal range and the highest ever measured at Belle.

This assessment was completed for the Long Term Monitoring project, of which Belle was included.    <br> \nElectrofishing sampled 85 Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 42.5/hour, which was the highest on record for Belle Lake.  The 2016 catch rate was 17.4/hour.  Historic catch rates from 1993 to 2017 (n=11) were mostly low, ranging from 0.6 to 42.5/hour with an average of 8.8.  The most recent five catch rates may indicate an increasing trend for Belle Lake Largemouth Bass.  Largemouth Bass were 5.6 to 18.7 inches long with an average of 10.9.  Unfortunately, 85% of the catch was less than 12 inches in length, indicating a poor size structure.  Largemouth Bass were age-2 to age-11 with eight year classes present.  Age-2 and age-3 fish accounted for 60% and 24% of the catch, respectively.  Data indicated inconsistent recruitment for this species.  At this time, anglers could expect to catch mostly small to medium sized fish, but an outside chance of a trophy was possible. <br> \n</p>",

It has a maximum depth of 28 feet, and a median depth of 16 feet, and 48 percent is shallower that 15 feet.  No thermocline is present, but low oxygen contents were found near the bottom.The lake, as indicated by the 1957 survey, contains high population levels of black bullheads and black crappies; average levels of carp, perch, walleye, bluegill, northern pike, and brown and yellow bullheads; low level of largemouth bass.  Growth appears fast on northern pike and walleyes, average for bluegills and slow for crappies.  Natural reproduction appears good for bluegill and bullheads.  Age distribution is consistent for walleyes and black crappies and missing age groups are found occasionally in the bluegill population.  There appears to be some correlation between the stocking of about 20 northern pike per acre in 1956 with a large year-class.  The above information indicates the lake is a warm-water game fish lake, which contains very high bullhead populations.  Sufficient game and panfish are present to warrant management for panfish and walleyes. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fall night-time electrofishing was conducted at Belle Lake on 9/25/19 to evaluate young of the year Walleye (YWAE) and yearling Walleye (YRLWAE) abundance.  Electrofishing sampled 16 YWAE for a catch rate of 8.0/hour of electrofishing on-time.  By electrofishing indexing, the 2019 YWAE year class appears weak.  In 2019, the average length for YWAE was 6.8 inches, indicating fast growth for Belle Lake YWAE.  A new Walleye fry stocking regime (383,000 fry every third year) was initiated in 2017.  Fry were not stocked in 2016, 2017, or 2019, but were stocked in 2018. To gauge if stocked fry may be suppressing natural year classes, a reduction in stocking frequency was implemented to determine if natural reproduction along with the reduced stocking regime could sustain the population.  Fisheries Research also began a Walleye genetic strain investigation on Belle Lake in 2018 to investigate how many different strains were present in Belle Lake and which, if any, were dominant.  Historic Walleye fall electrofishing catch rates from 1993 to 2019 (n=26) ranged from 1.2 to 322.3/hour with an average of 78.0.  Catch rates from fry stocked years (n=12) ranged from 7.8 to 251.4/hour with an average of 105.6.  Catch rates from non-stocked years (n=14) ranged from 1.2 to 322.3/hour with an average of 54.3.  Fry stocked years accounted for 5 out of 7 (71%) of the highest YWAE catch rates measured from Belle Lake.  Of interest, the three lowest catch rates all occurred during non-stocked years, but so did the all-time high (322.3/hour in 1996).  Natural reproduction during non-stocked years was documented 14 out of 14 times (100%), and two of those YWAE year classes (1996 and 2016) were considered to be exceptionally strong (>100 YWAE/hour).  In 2019, electrofishing sampled 36 YRLWAE for a catch rate of 18.0/hour, which by indexing suggests that the 2018 year class is weak to moderate in abundance.  Historic YRLWAE fall electrofishing catch rates (n=3) ranged from 3.0 to 51.2/hour at Belle Lake averaging 24.1/hour.  The 2019 YRLWAE average length was 10.9 inches, which indicated slower growth.  In 2019, age-0 Walleye were 6.1 to 7.5 inches long, age-1 fish were 9.7 to 12.7 inches long, and age-2 Walleye were 12.7 to 13.3 inches long.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Belle Lake in 2008 for the Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE) long term monitoring project.  A total of 12 different species of fish were sampled, plus hybrid sunfish.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 94 walleye for a catch rate of 7.8/net, which was above the normal range for this classification of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 13.3/net.  Gill net catch rates (n=9) have been above the normal range since 1991.  Walleye were 11.7 to 21.1 inches long averaging 16.6 inches.  Gill netted walleye were 2 to 7 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Growth was slightly slow overall.  Trap nets sampled walleye as old as 12 years.  The current stocking regime (1,000 fry/littoral acre every-other-year) was initiated in 1993.  Years when walleye fry were not stocked accounted for 19% of the gill net sample, indicating that natural reproduction continues to occur at Belle Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 29 northern pike for a catch rate of 2.4/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was similar at 2.8/net.  Northern pike were 22.3 to 32.1 inches long averaging 26.2 inches.  Trap nets sampled pike up to 32.8 inches in length.  Northern pike were 2 to 5 years old with 4 year-classes present.   Net catches typically show low numbers of larger sized northern pike at Belle Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 33 yellow perch for a catch rate of 2.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 23.2/net.  Yellow perch were 5.4 to 7.6 inches long averaging 6.5 inches.  Yellow perch were 2 to 4 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Yellow perch are likely an important food fish for walleye and northern pike at Belle Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 19 carp for a catch rate of 1.6/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 0.9/net.  Carp were 21.1 to 27.8 inches long averaging 24.2 inches.  The trap net catch rate was 1.5/net.  The 2006 trap net catch rate was 0.4/net. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 53 black bullhead for a catch rate of 4.4/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 4.3/net.  Black bullhead were 9.6 to 13.1 inches long averaging 11.6 inches.  Approximately 98%  of the gill net catch was 10 inches or longer.  The trap net catch rate was 11.9/net.  The 2006 trap net catch rate was 3.6/net.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 82 black crappie for a catch rate of 6.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 45.4/net.  Black crappie were 3.4 to 8.9 inches long averaging 7.5 inches.  The gill net catch rate was 7.0/net with fish averaging 7.5 inches in length.  The 2006 gill net catch rate was 20.3/net, with fish averaging 5.0 inches in length.  Black crappie were 1 to 4 years old with 4 year-classes present, but only the 2005 year-class appeared to be moderately strong.  Growth was slow. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 7 bluegill for a catch rate of 0.6/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 8.5/net.  Bluegill were 4.7 to 7.7 inches long averaging 6.0 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 1 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 0.6/hour of electrofisher on-time.  This was the lowest catch rate ever measured at Belle Lake.  The catch rate in 2004 was 16.2/hr.  Catch rates from 1993-2008 (n=5) ranged from 0.6 to 16.2/hr, averaging 5.3/hr.  The fish was 12.6 inches long.  The largemouth bass was 3 years old.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye and black crappie typically provide the best fishing opportunities at Belle lake, while other species occasionally offer good action.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fall night-time electrofishing was conducted at Belle Lake on 9/27/18 to evaluate young of the year Walleye (YWAE) and yearling Walleye (YRLWAE) abundance.  Electrofishing sampled 59 YWAE for a catch rate of 29.5/hour.  By electrofishing indexing, the 2018 YWAE year class appears weak.  In 2018, the average length for YWAE was 5.27 inches, a substandard size and indicative of slow growth for Belle Lake YWAE.  A new stocking regime (383,000 fry every third year) was initiated in 2017.  Fry were not stocked in 2016 or 2017, but were stocked in 2018.  It was speculated that stocked fry may be suppressing natural year classes, so a reduction in stocking frequency was implemented to determine if natural reproduction along with the reduced stocking regime could sustain the population.  Fisheries Research began a Walleye genetic strain investigation on Belle Lake in 2018.  Historic fall electrofishing catch rates from 1993 to 2018 (n=25) ranged from 1.2 to 322.3/hour with an average of 80.8.  Catch rates from fry stocked years (n=12) ranged from 7.8 to 251.4/hour with an average of 105.6.  Catch rates from non-stocked years (n=13) ranged from 1.2 to 322.3/hour with an average of 57.9.  With an average catch rate that was nearly twice as high during stocked years, it appears that fry stocking is having a positive influence on YWAE abundance at Belle Lake.  A definitive answer cannot be reached because of the inability to differentiate stocked fish from naturally reproduced fish during years when Walleye fry are stocked.  Fry stocked years accounted for 5 out of 7 (71%) of the highest YWAE catch rates measured from Belle Lake.  Of interest, the three lowest catch rates all occurred during non-stocked years, but so did the all-time high (322.3/hour in 1996).  Natural reproduction during non-stocked years, was documented 13 out of 13 times (100%), and two of those YWAE year classes (1996 and 2016) were considered to be exceptionally strong (>100 YWAE/hour).  In 2018, electrofishing sampled 6 YRLWAE for a catch rate of 3.0/hour which likely indicated that the 2017 year class (8.1 YWAE/hour) had remained weak.  Historic YRLWAE fall electrofishing catch rates (n=2) ranged from 3.0 to 51.2/hour at Belle Lake.  The 2018 YRLWAE average length was 11.4 inches, which indicated slow growth.  In 2018, age-0 Walleye were 3.9 to 9.1 inches long, age-1 fish were 10.8 to 11.6 inches long, and age-2 Walleye were 11.5 to 15.0 inches long.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Belle is a moderate sized lake (864 acres) located north of the City of Hutchinson on the Meeker/McLeod County border. Belle has 5.5 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 25 feet. A state-owned public access with a cement boat ramp and a fair amount of parking is present on the eastern shore. A county-owned access within Piepenberg Park has two cement boat ramps with a large amount of parking and is located on the southeast shore. The county park also offers camping, hiking trails, picnic areas, shore fishing, and a swimming beach. Water clarity is typically poor to moderate and submergent vegetation is often sparse in abundance at Belle Lake. A spring trap netting survey was conducted during mid-May 2022. Trap nets were used to target Black crappie and Bluegill. Spring trap net data should not be compared to historical summer trap net data as summer nets often do a poor job of representatively sampling Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nVery low numbers of Bluegill were collected and the one fish that was captured was 6.5 inches long. Anglers seeking to catch Bluegill may want to try a different lake as bluegill abundance at Belle is low. Low abundance of submergent vegetation is likely a limiting factor on Bluegill at Belle lake. <br> \n <br> \nLow to moderate numbers of Black Crappie were collected, averaging 9 inches in length. The longest crappie collected was almost 15 inches. Approximately 55% of the crappie sampled were 9 inches or longer. The northern lagoon in Piepenberg County Park can be a popular shore fishing area following ice-out. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Belle Lake has the AIS Eurasian Watermilfoil in it. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",
