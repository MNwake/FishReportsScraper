Fish ranged in size from 24-30 inches.  Growth was good for all ages.  Yellow Perch abundance was low (2.3/gill net) and declined significantly from 1985 (43.0/gill net).  Average length of Yellow Perch was 6.0-6.4 inches long.  \n\nImportant species taken in the trap nets were Black Crappie, White Crappie, Bluegill, and Black Bullhead.  Black Crappie were abundant (123/trap net), and increased significantly from 1985 (11.3/trap net).  Lengths ranged from 5.5-8.0 inches and the average length was 7.0-7.4 inches.  Growth was good for all ages. White Crappie abundance was also high (52.5/trap net) and had increased significantly from 1985 (5.3/trap net). The average length was 7.5-7.9 inches and growth was good for all ages.  Bluegill numbers were low (7.5 trap net) and had declined significantly from 1985 (26/trap net).  The average length group was 7.0-7.4 inches and growth was good for all ages. Black Bullhead numbers (16.3/trap net) were similar to 1985 (19.5/trap net).

Most year classes (to age 8) are present in low, but fairly uniform abundance. Sunfish species have increased from low abundance in 1971 to trap net catch rates above their local averages. Bluegill (26/trap net) show strong 1980 and 1982 year classes within the 8 age classes sampled. Pumpkinseed abundance is now high (24.7/trap net). White (5.2/trap net) and Black Crappie (11.2/trap net) numbers are above their local averages but show sporadic spawning success. Largemouth Bass (0.7/trap net) were not sampled in 1971. A few Walleye (0.3/gill) from French Lake are also present. Yellow Perch abundance (43/gill net) is now high. Golden Shiners (2/gill net) now provide additional forage for game species. Common Carp (4/trap net) continue their presence in high numbers, with several age classes apparent. Black Bullhead (19.5/trap net) are also abundant, while Yellow Bullhead (4/trap) show average abundance. White Sucker (0.3/ gill net) and Bowfin (0.2/trap net) numbers were low. </p>",
