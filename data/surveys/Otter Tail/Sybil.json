                "narrative": "<p>     Sybil Lake is a 706-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles south of Vergas, MN.  Sybil Lake is connected to Loon Lake via an unnavigable inlet along the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Sybil Lake has a maximum depth of 74 feet; however, 60% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.   The secchi disk reading during the 2021 survey was 16.3 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 10.8 to 18.0 feet.    <br> \n     Moderate development exists along the shoreline of Sybil Lake.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned public access is located on the south shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel with some areas of rubble.  Emergent vegetation (common cattails and hardstem bulrush) is located primarily in the southwest basin.  These areas provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality in the lake.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their important ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling this lake has to offer it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Sybil Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-Walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present.  <br> \n    The Walleye population is abundant.  Several strong year classes are present and should provide good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes ranged in length from 10.2 to 23.9 inches with an average length and weight of 16.2 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.1 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance is low to moderate.  Northern Pike size structure has consistently remained poor.  Pike ranged in length from 16.4 to 29.5 inches with an average length and weight of 20.0 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 21.6 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     The Bluegill population is moderately abundant. A quality size structure exists as 51% of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length, while 11% were 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.5 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     The Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie populations have also been historically abundant with excellent size structures, consistently good reproduction, and average growth. <br> \n     The Minnesota state record Tullibee was caught from Sybil Lake in 2015.  It weighed 5 pounds and 13 ounces. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  <br> \n     Sybil Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2016.   Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.    <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike recruitment appears to be consistent as the sample was composed of pike ages I+ through V+.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance declined from 92.3 per trap net lift in 1986 to 36.3 per net.  The size structure of the bluegill population appears to have improved as 22% of the fish measured greater than 7.0 inches in length compared to 7% in 1986. <br> \n     Black crappie abundance was 3.2 per trap net lift, which is three times the area median.  Black crappie recruitment appears to be consistent as the sample was composed of fish ages I+ through VI+.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance declined from 2.8 per gill net lift in 1986 to 1.8 per net, which is the lowest level recorded for this lake.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance declined slightly from 3.5 per gill net lift in 1986 to 3.0 per net, while the average weight increased from 1.3 pounds to 1.9 pounds.  Ageing data shows little evidence of natural reproduction; however, previous surveys indicate limited reproduction does occur. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Sybil Lake is a 706-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles south of Vergas, MN.  Sybil Lake is connected to Loon Lake via an unnavigable inlet along the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Sybil Lake has a maximum depth of 74 feet; however, 60% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.   The secchi disk reading during the 2008 lake survey was 16.3 feet, indicating excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 10.8 to 18.0 feet.    <br> \n     Moderate development exists on Sybil Lake.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located on the south shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel with some areas of rubble. Emergent (cattails and hardstem bulrush) vegetation is located primarily in the southwest basin.  These areas provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality in the lake.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their important ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     The walleye test-net catch rate has remained stable during recent lake surveys and within the normal range for this class of lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.7 to 25.4 inches with an average length and weight of 14.5 inches and 1.1 pounds.    Walleye attain an average length of 13.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     The northern pike test-net catch rate has also remained stable and is within the normal range.  Northern pike size structure has consistently remained poor.  Pike ranged in length from 15.5 to 25.8 inches with an average length and weight of 19.3 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Northern pike growth is slow with an average length of 19.0 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     The bluegill test net catch rate was within the normal range.  Thirty-one percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.1 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a moderate density largemouth bass population exists.  Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 7.1 to 18.6 inches with an average length and weight of 11.4 inches and 1.0 pound.  Bass attain a mean length of 12.9 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that black crappies are abundant.  Age data indicate that black crappie reproduction is consistently good.  Size structure is also good with 69% of the crappies measuring 10.0 or greater in length.  Black crappies attain an average length of 10.4 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing this lake presently has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the fish habitat. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    <br> \n</p>",

Bluegill numbers exceed both sets of net medians.  Bluegill catch per net has increased sharply and is maintaining a larger average weight per fish compared to past surveys.  Northern pike, yellow perch and walleye numbers have been in a downward trend with the average weight remaining relatively constant.  All year classes of walleye are represented through age VII+.  Age I+ and VI+ are skip years in the stocking program, indicating limited natural reproduction is occurring.  Although net catches appear low, anglers have been successful in the 1986 angling year, especially during the spring and early summer.  A program of walleye fingerling stocking should be continued and the yellow perch population should be monitored closely.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sybil Lake is a 706-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles south of Vergas, MN.  Sybil Lake is connected to Loon Lake via an unnavigable inlet along the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Sybil Lake has a maximum depth of 74 feet; however, 60% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.   The secchi disk reading during the 2004 lake survey was 13.0 feet, indicate excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 10.8 to 18.0 feet.  Sybil Lake is included in class 25 of the Minnesota DNR lake classificationscheme.      Moderate development exists on Sybil Lake.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located on the south shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel with some areas of rubble. Emergent (cattails and hardstem bulrush) vegetation is located primarily in the southwest basin.  These areas provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality in the lake.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown chemical pollutants.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, black crappie, bluegill and largemouth bass.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their important ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     The walleye test-net catch rate has remained stable during recent lake surveys and is within the normal range for class 25 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.1 to 24.6 inches with an average length and weight of 15.8 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Age data from recent assessments indicate that walleye stocking is supplementing limited natural reproduction because the strongest year classes have consistently corresponded to years of stocking.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.2 inches at four years of age.     The northern pike test-net catch rate has also remained stable and is within the normal range.  Northern pike size structure has consistently remained poor.  Pike ranged in length from 12.6 to 29.2 inches with an average length and weight of 19.6 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 21.3 inches at four years of age.     The bluegill test net catch rate was within the normal range.  Twenty-three percent of the bluegill were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 6.9 inches at six years of age.     The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing this lake presently has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the fish habitat.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  Sybil Lake is a 706-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles south of Vergas, MN.  Sybil Lake is connected to Loon Lake via an unnavigable inlet along the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Sybil Lake has a maximum depth of 74 feet; however, 60% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.   The secchi disk reading during the 2013 lake survey was 12.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 10.8 to 18.0 feet.    <br> \n     Moderate development exists along the shoreline of Sybil Lake.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned public access is located on the south shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel with some areas of rubble.  Emergent vegetation (common cattails and hardstem bulrush) is located primarily in the southwest basin.  These areas provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality in the lake.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their important ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling this lake has to offer it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has increased from previous surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.2 to 28.5 inches with an average length and weight of 14.8 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.9 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike size structure has consistently remained poor.  Pike ranged in length from 15.5 to 25.8 inches with an average length and weight of 19.8 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 21.6 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys and size structure has increased.  Forty-three percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.1 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a moderate density Largemouth Bass population exists.  Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 4.5 to 18.8 inches with an average length and weight of 12.7 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 12.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that Black Crappies are abundant.  Age data indicate that Black Crappie reproduction is consistently good.  Size structure is also good with 80% of the Black Crappies measuring 10.0 or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.6 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Sybil Lake is a 706-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles south of Vergas, MN.  Sybil Lake is connected to Loon Lake via an unnavigable inlet along the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Sybil Lake has a maximum depth of 74 feet; however, 60% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.   The secchi disk reading was 14.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 10.8 to 18.0 feet.    <br> \n     Moderate development exists along the shoreline of Sybil Lake.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned public access is located on the south shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel with some areas of rubble.  Emergent vegetation (common cattails and hardstem bulrush) is located primarily in the southwest basin.  These areas provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality in the lake.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their important ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling this lake has to offer it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     A moderate density Walleye population exists.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.7 to 27.0 inches with an average length and weight of 14.9 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike size structure has consistently remained poor.  Pike ranged in length from 16.2 to 28.5 inches with an average length and weight of 20.0 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 22.2 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Fifteen percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.9 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a moderate density Largemouth Bass population exists.  Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 6.5 to 16.5 inches with an average length and weight of 12.2 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 12.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  <br> \n     Sybil Lake is listed as an infested water.  The presence of zebra mussels was documented in 2016.   Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.   Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sybil Lake is a 706 acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County, approximately four miles south of Vergas, MN.  It has a maximum depth of 74 feet and 60% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand/gravel with some areas of rubble and muck mixed in.  Secchi disk readings, a measure of water clarity, have been taken during fish population assessments since 1972.  Past readings have been between 10.8 and 18.0 feet.  The reading in 1999 was 13.5 feet.  A public access is located on the south shoreline.     Moderate development exists on Sybil Lake.  Emergent (cattails and bulrush) and submerged aquatic vegetation are located primarily in the southwest basin.  These areas provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality in the lake.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown chemical pollutants.  Emergent plans provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, black crappie, bluegill and largemouth bass.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their important ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Sybil Lake contains good populations of black crappie, largemouth bass, bluegill and northern pike.  Black crappie sampled from a spring trap net assessment had a mean length and weight of 10.0 inches and 0.62 pounds with 67% greater than 10.0 inches in length.  The walleye population appears to be in good condition.  Mean length and weight of walleye sampled was 14.0 inches and 0.96 pounds with 38% greater than 15.0 inches in length.  Although walleye natural reproduction exists in Sybil Lake, walleye stocking is necessary to help maintain the walleye population at management goals.</p>",
