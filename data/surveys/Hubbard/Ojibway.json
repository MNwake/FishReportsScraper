                "narrative": "<p>Ojibway Lake is located in south-central Hubbard County, five miles north of Dorset.  Ojibway has a surface area of 184 acres and a maximum depth of 22 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the southwest shore of the lake.  Ojibway is connected to Dead Lake by a small channel.  Boating between the two lakes is dependent upon water levels in the lakes.  During the high water period of the late 1990s boating between the two lakes was easy, however during the summer of 2017 the channel was very shallow and boating was limited to small craft, with dragging and push poling in several spots.  Ojibway has excellent water quality and clarity, and supports good populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Ojibway is in lake class 25.  Class 25 lakes have the characteristics of hard water, good water clarity, and an irregular shaped shoreline.  Other class 25 lakes in the area include Bad Axe, West Crooked, Spider, and Third Crow Wing Lake.  <br> \n  <br> \nOjibway supports a healthy Largemouth Bass population both in numbers and size.  Anglers will find good numbers of Largemouth Bass in the 12 to 16 inch size range and bass up to 19.7 inches were sampled during the survey.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass in Ojibway.  Present and past surveys have shown the panfish population in Ojibway to fluctuate from moderate to high numbers and can provide good fishing for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Pumpkinseed.  The panfish population in Ojibway is known more for numbers than size of fish.  Anglers will find Black Crappie in the 9-11 inch size range, and Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-7 inch size range.  Northern Pike are abundant in Ojibway with the population dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 19.6 inches and 1.5 pounds, with pike measured up to 30.9 inches. An abundant Yellow Bullhead population is also present in Ojibway. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Ojibway.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the lake. <br> \n</p>",
