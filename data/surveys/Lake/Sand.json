                "narrative": "<p>Sand Lake has had an experimental regulation (5 bluegill limit) in place since May 2006.  The intent of the regulation was the protection of the maturing bluegill population, after the species was re-introduced in 2000.  The early trap net assessment in 2008 was one tool used to measure the spawning population of adult bluegills.  High quality bluegill fisheries are rare in the Finland Management Area and providing a year-around angling opportunity was one goal of the special regulation. <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill numbers were above average in this assessment, the average length was 8.8 inches with fish up to 10.6 inches measured.  The seven consecutive year-classes sampled indicating a self-sustaining bluegill population may be developing.  Three additional investigations in August 2008, 2011 and 2014 will be conducted before the regulation evaluation is complete and a new lake management plan is written. <br> \n <br> \nThe designated public access to Sand Lake is a carry-in, suitable for small boats or canoes, at the U.S. Forest Service campground on the east side of the lake.  There is a second access off of Lake County Road 2 on the northeast portion of the lake.  This access is an unmarked road (poor condition) and there is little room for parking vehicles at the lake.  <br> \n</p>",

Mean size of Walleye is small averaging 12.1\" which is consistant with sizes in previous assessments. Walleye reproduction is occurring, however it may be sporadic, as strong year classes are associated with both stocked and unstocked years. The Northern Pike catch declined from the previous assessment and was below that of similar types of lakes. Northern Pike averaged 1.25 lbs with individuals over 6.0 lbs uncommon. Yellow Perch numbers have remained fairly stable over the past 3 assessments but gillnet catches are about 50% of the catches in the early 1980's. Gillnet catches of White Suckers have been increasing during recent assessments however densities are not particularly high.</p>",

The bluegill numbers were below average for this newly established population; however, there are indications that natural reproduction will produce good numbers of bluegill.    Sand Lake has a special regulation (bag limit 5) for bluegill to protect the breeding stock and allow the population to become established.  Northern pike were present in numbers slightly below the average for this lake class. The average length was 18 inches; the largest northern pike in the sample was 35 inches.  Yellow perch were found in below average numbers for this lake class.  The average length of yellow perch was 7.6 inches with the largest being fish 11.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe designated public access (carry-down) to Sand Lake is located at the U.S. Forest Service campground on the east side of the lake.  There is a second access off of Lake County Road 2 on the northeast portion of the lake.  This access is an unmarked road (poor condition) and there is little vehicle parking at the lake. <br> \n</p>",

There are three intermittent inlets to the lake, and the Sand River is the outlet. There are 26 cottages on the lake, indicating that this is one of the more heavily used lakes in the vicinity.     At the time of the survey, dissolved oxygen was plentiful at all depths, and aquatic vegetation was moderately abundant in depths to six feet. most of the fish caught in test netting were Walleyes, Northern Pike, White Suckers , and Yellow Perch. Both Walleyes and Northern Pike were taken in numbers greater than either state-wide or watershed gillnet catch averages for these species. Walleyes ranged in size between 6.0\" and 24\", most of which were below 15.0\" in length. Anglers also reproted that small fish were predominant in their catches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Lake is located about fifteen miles west of Isabella on the west side of Lake Co Hwy 2 and is 486 acres in size with a maximum depth of 11 feet. The primary access is a carry in at the Sand Lake rustic campground maintained by the Forest Service. A second access is located at the end of Forest Service 941, a 0.4 mile spur that originates on Hwy 2. A small boat and trailer can be turned around by hand to launch, but space for parking is limited. This trail is narrow, rough, and a four-wheel drive vehicle with good ground clearance is recommended. Walleye have been the primary management species in Sand Lake since the first Lake Management Plan in 1987. The lake was stocked with Walleye fry for many years. In 2016 the decision was made to end stocking due to consistent strong year classes produced in non-stocked years. In 2000, adult Bluegill of various sizes were stocked in the lake and have since established a self-sustaining population with excellent size structure. The lake currently has a special regulation of a reduced bag limit on Bluegill of 5 daily and 20 in possession to help preserve this quality fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Walleye gill net catch of 14.44/lift was higher than average compared to similar lakes and was the highest catch on Sand Lake since 1961. The average weight was 0.65 pounds, which is below the normal range compared to similar lakes. The average length was 11.9 inches with the largest fish sampled measuring 25.6 inches long. Analysis determined over 85% of Walleye were from non-stocked years with several strong year classes produced since stocking was discontinued. Survey results suggest that Walleye 12-15 inches long currently provide good opportunities for anglers. With the highest catch in 60 years and most of the fish naturally reproduced it is apparent that the decision to end Walleye stocking was a sound one at this time. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap net catch of 3.33/lift with an average weight of 0.21 pounds was within the normal range compared to other similar lakes. Growth was also average for the area. While there are some very nice Bluegill present, most anglers report catching an occasional keeper while fishing for Walleyes and Perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch of 3.44/lift with an average weight of 1.60 pounds was within the normal range of other similar lakes. Average length was 19 inches long. The largest fish sampled was 33 inches long with just 10% of the catch at least 24 inches. Survey results suggest than most of the Northern Pike are small, but there is a reasonable chance at catching a memorable sized fish.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch of 6.22/lift with an average weight of 0.24 pounds is average compared to other similar lakes. Most of the catch was between 6.5-9.5 inches long with 21% longer than 9 inches and the largest fish measuring 10.9 inches long. These results suggest that the lake currently supports a perch population with decent opportunities for angler harvest.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Lake is a 486 acre, 100% littoral lake with a maximum depth of 11 feet.  The designated public access (carry-down) to Sand Lake is administered by the U.S. Forest Service at the campground on the east side of the lake.  This access is suitable for small boats or canoes. There is a second access off of Lake County Road 2 on the northeast portion of the lake.  This access road (0.4 mile) is U.S. Forest Service Road #941 (poor condition) and there is little vehicle parking or turn around area at the end of the road.   <br> \n <br> \nSand Lake has had an experimental regulation (5 Bluegill limit) in place since May 2006.  The intent of the regulation was the protection of the maturing Bluegill population, after the species was re-introduced in 2000.  The early spring trap net assessment of Bluegill in 2008, 2011 and 2014 was used to measure the spawning population of adult Bluegill.  High quality Bluegill fisheries are rare in the Finland Management Area, providing a year-around angling opportunity was one goal of the re-introduction of Bluegill in Sand Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers and size were above average in this assessment for this lake class; the average length was 8.7 inches and weight of 0.8 pounds with fish up to 10.9 inches measured.  With only one year-class missing between 2004 and 2012 indicates a self-sustaining Bluegill population has developed.  Growth was above average with the 2010 year class representing 32% of the catch, 2005 was also a strong year class representing 25% of the catch.  Evaluation of the special regulation will be made after the 2014 population assessment, and a new lake management plan will be written by March 2016.  Fishermen should show restraint harvesting the big Bluegills as it takes about 10 years to grow to 1 pound, they can be easily caught at times and reproduction in this area is usually very sporadic. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Lake is characterized as a lake class 12 lake and is located 15 miles west and two miles south of Isabella in the Superior National Forest.  Public access is a carry down at the campground on the east side of the lake.  A second access is present at the narrows leading to the north rice bay.  From 5.9 miles south of State Hwy. 1 on Lake Co. Rd. 2 go west 0.4 miles on USFS Rd. #941 to Sand Lake.  This access road is narrow and brushy with little parking and a poor turn around area.  Light boats on trailers can be launched but trailers must be disconnected and turned around by hand.  The lake is 486 acres with a maximum depth of 11 feet and a Secchi disc reading of three feet in dark brown bog stained water. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 Walleye gill net catch of 11.1/lift was above average for lake class 12.  Historically, Sand Lake Walleye catch was higher than average with smaller than average size fish.  Of 105 fish sampled only five were greater than 15 inches with the largest fish 24.2 inches and weighed five pounds.  The Walleye population appears to be heavily supported by stocking as 78% of the fish caught were from stocked years.  Walleye fry are stocked two consecutive years out of every four.  Growth was slower than average for the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch of 0.3/lift was well below average and the lowest catch on record. Historically the Northern Pike catch is near 3/lift.  Mean weight of 1.2 pounds was below average, but similar to the past four investigations.  The largest fish sampled was 21.3 inches and weighed 1.7 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch of 3.7/lift was below average.  The mean weight of 0.15 pounds was average, but the smallest in all past investigations.  Catch the past four investigations ranged from 3.3-15.6/lift.  Yellow Perch in the past were caught in much higher numbers and size. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catch of 0.3/lift was below average and the lowest catch in summer assessments after the Bluegill reintroduction in 2000, the highest catch was 2/lift in 2011.  Mean weight of 0.3 pound was above average.  A special regulation of decreased bag limit of five daily and in possession is in effect on Sand Lake.  As part of the regulation evaluation, spring trap net assessments were done targeting Bluegills while they are in the shallows searching for spawning sites.  During these investigations a few Bluegills were documented in the 10 inch size range, weighing around a pound each.  Anglers should show some restraint harvesting numbers of big Bluegills as it takes about 10 years to grow to one pound, they can be easily caught at times and reproduction in this area is usually very sporadic. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2005 assessment sampled walleye in average numbers compared to other lakes in this class.  Walleye up to 20.4 inches (2.9 lb) were collected, as well as a number of fish between 14-18 inches; however, the overall size was fairly small (0.84 lb/fish).  Sand Lake is stocked in odd numbered years with walleye fry.Northern pike were sampled in average numbers, which is normal for this lake.  The size of northern pike collected in past assessments has usually been below average and this was the case in this assessment where the average size was less than 1.0 lb/fish.  Northern pike up to 26.1 inches (3.5 lb) were collected; however, most of the fish were smaller than 20 inches.Bluegill were recently introduced in Sand Lake to provide additional angling opportunities in the Finland area where the number of lakes supporting quality bluegill populations is limited.  In order to protect the new introduction from over-harvest and allow development of high quality populations and fisheries special regulations will be implemented in May 2006.  The regulation will limit the daily bag and possession limit of bluegill to five.  Bluegill were sampled in average numbers in this assessment and averaged 8.2 inches with a few fish between 9-10 inches collected, indicating relatively fast growth.  Because this is a recently introduced population growth rates may decline as the population becomes better established.  Some bluegill natural reproduction has occurred since the introduction, although it did not appear to be substantial.  Bluegill have not been in Sand Lake long enough to determine long term growth rates or sustainabilty.Yellow perch were sampled in above-average numbers and the quality was above average as well.  Average size was 8.6 inches with approximately 40% of the sample between 9-11.5 inches and a few 12-inch individuals collected.</p>",

The designated public access (carry-down) to Sand Lake is administered by the U.S. Forest Service at the campground on the east side of the lake.  There is a second access off of Lake County Road 2 on the northeast portion of the lake. This access road (0.4 mile) is U.S. Forest Service Road #941 (poor condition) and there is little vehicle parking or turn around area at the end of the road.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in Sand Lake were above average for the lake class in 2011.  The average size of the walleye sampled was 12.7 inches (0.8 pound), below average for this type of lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill numbers were about average in the 2011 sample when compared to other lakes with the same characteristics.  The average weight of bluegill collected was 0.4 pound, influenced by 56% of the sample that was over 8 inches.  Scale ageing indicates natural reproduction success was sporadic for bluegills.  Sand Lake has had a special regulation (bag limit 5) since May 2006, to protect the bluegill breeding stock and allow the population to become better established. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were present in numbers slightly below the average for this lake class.  The average length was 17.2 inches (1.2 pounds); the largest northern pike sampled was 31.7 inches (6.6 pounds).   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers and size were above average. Twenty-five percent of the yellow perch sampled were greater than 9 inches, the largest was 12.9 inches.</p>",

The species was reintroduced into the lake in 2000 and have since established a naturally reproducing population. An experimental regulation that reduced the daily limit to 5 Sunfish was placed on the lake beginning in 2006 and continues today in the form of a special regulation. The purpose of the regulation has been to protect the newly established population from overharvest because fish generally grow slowly and require many years to reach a size harvested by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 spring trap net survey was the fourth assessment specifically targeting adult Bluegill in the lake. The catch rate of 8.83 fish per trap net was the highest to date and the 159 adult fish sampled was significantly more than the previous spring survey. Size structure was impressive with more than 80% of the Bluegill between 8 and 10 inches long and the largest fish measuring 10.5 inches. Analysis of scale samples collected during the survey determined Bluegill as old as twelve years old were sampled, and fish age-8 to age-10 accounted for a majority of the catch. Relatively few smaller, younger fish were sampled in 2021 which is not entirely unexpected for this type of survey and is similar to previous results from this lake. <br> \n</p>",
