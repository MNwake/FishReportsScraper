Muskies ranged from 33.0 - 41.0 inches in total length. Yellow Perch gillnet catches increased from 0.5 fish/net in 1986 to 34.5 fish/net.  The majority of the Yellow Perch were less than 7.5 inches and the mean weight was 0.13 pounds each.  Yellow Perch were not detected prior to 1986. No Walleye were sampled during the population assessment. Bluegill trapnet catches have increased from 3.0 fish/net in 1986 to 17.0 fish/net at present, but density remains well below relative abundance indices recorded in 1978 and 1965 surveys. Largemouth Bass were captured during the spring trapnetting survey.  Five age-classes were represented. Golden shiners have not been observed since the 1978 survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indian Lake is a small, moderately fertile lake located north of Garfield.  Water quality was good with an August secchi reading of nine feet.   Water levels are higher than normal and it has impacted the access slightly.  Although emergent vegetation is limited, submergent vegetation is abundant and can become dense enough to prohibit boating in the bays on the west side.  This vegetation does create a well defined weed line which can aid in locating fish.Northern pike were abundant with a gillnet catch of 9.0 fish per net.  Mean weight of the sampled fish was 2.3 pounds and the mean length was 20.9 inches.  Two and three-year-old fish made up 74% of the total sample.  These fish should provide fast action now and quality fishing opportunities in the near future.Largemouth bass are abundant with a day-time electrofishing survey resulting in a catch rate of 53.3 fish per hour.  1996 and 1998 were good years for bass natural reproduction on the lake as these fish made up over 60% of the sampled fish.  The mean length of the sampled fish was just over 12 inches with the largest individual measuring 18.6 inches.Black crappie trapnet catches averaged 2.5 fish net.  This is an increase from the previous survey's catch rate.  These fish measured between 7.7 and 9.8 inches in length and averaged 0.4 pounds.  1996 was a good year for black crappie reproduction as 75% of the sample resulted from that year.Bluegill were not abundant as evidenced by a catch rate of 5.5 fish per trapnet.  The majority of the fish (98%) were the result of natural reproduction in 1998 and 1999.  These fish measured between 3.9 and 7.4 inches in length and averaged 0.2 pounds. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indian Lake is a small, mesotrophic (moderately fertile) bass-panfish lake located between the towns of Garfield and Leaf Valley in northern Douglas County.  The lake is relatively shallow with the majority of its area being comprised of water less than 15 feet deep.  Water clarity is generally good year round and submergent vegetation is quite abundant.  This is a relatively peaceful lake that is not highly developed and has minimal angling and recreational pressure.  Pressure is typically highest on windy days when anglers seek a calm refuge from adjacent lakes that are larger and more wind swept.  Bass and sunfishes are the primary management species in Indian Lake.  Walleye and northern pike are species of secondary management importance.  The fish community assemblage is typical of most bass-panfish lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Largemouth bass are abundant and size structure of this population is good.  The largest bass captured during the 2005 electrofishing survey was 19.1 inches with average size being 12.8 inches.  Northern pike and bluegill numbers have increased in recent years.  Although abundance of these two species is high, their size tends to be relatively small.  Black crappie are present but abundance of this species is relatively low.  Walleye are also present in low numbers.  No walleye were sampled in previous surveys dating back to 1986.  However, a fry stocking in 1997 and initiation of biennial fingerling stockings in 2003 have led to the establishment of a limited fishery.  Other fish species sampled during the 2005 survey included golden shiner, white sucker, black and brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch.  Perch numbers have declined substantially in recent years, likely due to the increase in northern pike abundance and the establishment of a limited walleye fishery.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indian Lake is a small (99 acre), fertile basin located in north-central Douglas County between the towns of Garfield and Leaf Valley.  The basin has a maximum depth of 38.0 feet.  Water clarity was poor (3.5 feet) at time of the August survey.   <br> \n <br> \nA standardized fish community assessment was completed on Indian Lake, August 17-20, 2015.  A combination of three gill nets and nine trap nets were used.  The netting component of the survey was preceded with an electrofishing survey to gain estimates of abundance and size structure of the Largemouth Bass population.  This survey was completed on May 22, 2015.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass proved to be moderately abundant.  Length of bass captures ranged from 11.1 to 18.7 inches.  Age distribution of the population sample extended from age 5 to age 11.  Due to lack of young bass captures, average size of Largemouth Bass caught during the spring electrofishing survey was 16.0 inches.  Old bass grow slowly.  Few captures exceeded 18.0 inches in total length.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike continue to be abundant, but most captures were small with an average length of 21.5 inches.  Two 28.0-inch pike were recorded in the gill net catch.  Only two Walleyes were caught during the netting survey.  This low catch was disappointing given fingerling stocking investments.  Survival of stocked Walleye fingerlings and yearlings appeared very poor.    <br> \n <br> \nIndian Lake supports a fair panfish fishery.   Bluegills and Black Crappies are abundant, but growth rates are too slow to optimize fishing potential.  Bluegill captures averaged 6.3 inches.  The largest caught measured 8.8 inches.  These larger fish were eight- or nine-years-old.  Black Crappie catches increased in 2015 in response to elevated and fairly consistent natural recruitment in 2010, 2011, and 2012.  Another strong year class was established in 2014.   Due to the high proportion of young fish making up the population sample and slow growth, few crappie captures exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Cohorts of a strong 2010 year class should approach 10.0 inches in length in 2017.  Yellow Perch abundance has declined in Indian Lake.  None of the perch measured during the 2015 survey exceeded 8.0 inches, thus the population contributes very little to the recreational fishery.  They do constitute a very important food base for predatory gamefishes, namely Northern Pike, Walleye, and Largemouth Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are encouraged to harvest moderate-sized (< 21.0 inches) Northern Pike in an effort to reduce surplus pike densities and improve survival, growth, and yields for other sport fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nA DNR public access is located on the northern shoreline of Indian Lake just off of Indian Lake Road. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indian Lake is a small, fertile lake with relatively dark stained water.  Submergent vegetation growsto a depth of 8.0 feet and is dense in several shallow areas.  The abundance and distribution ofemergent vegetation is limited.  This may be the result of a dramatic increase in water levels duringthe mid 1980's.  An apparent partial winterkill occurred in 1994.  The fish kill was reported by ariparian landowner after ice-out.  The report included nine muskellunge, two black crappie, twowalleye, and one largemouth bass.  A field investigation by fisheries staff found seven badlydecomposed muskellunge, but no other fish.  The structure of the fish community and age classdistribution from the limited number of gamefish captured in 1995 also indicate a partial winterkill. There are no historical records of winterkill or partial winterkill in years prior to that 1994 event. Indian Lake was designated for muskellunge management in 1985, however stocking was discontinued afterthe 1994 partial winterkill.Northern pike catches averaged 3.3 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have been highly variable in pastsurveys; averaging 3.5 fish/net in 1990, 0.5 fish/net in 1986, and 16.0 fish/net in 1978.  Mean weightof fish captured was 3.0 pounds.  Fish ranged from 17.6 to 29.9 inches in total length.  Bluegillcatches averaged 1.1 fish/trapnet compared to 17.0 fish/trapnet in 1990.  Trapnet catches averaged 3.0fish/net in 1986 and 98.0 fish/net in 1978.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1995 was 0.1 pounds.  Fishranged from 4.1 to 8.1 inches in total length.  Bluegill abundance is likely to rebound from thepartial winterkill.  Age-1 fish comprised 80% of the fish captured in trapnets and shoreline seiningyielded 28.3 age-0 bluegill per haul.  Electrofishing yielded 6.0 stock-size largemouth bass per hour. Mean weight of fish captured was 1.0 pounds.  Fish ranged from 9.5 to 14.8 inches in total length. Yellow perch catches averaged 16.3 fish/gillnet.  Yellow perch first appeared in survey catches in 1986averaging 0.5 fish/gillnet.   Gillnet catches increased to 34.5 fish/net in 1990.  Mean weight of fishcaptured in 1995 was 0.1 pounds.  Bullhead abundance has increased.  Bullhead catches averaged 37.3fish/gillnet and 46.0 fish/trapnet in 1995.  In comparison, catches averaged 10.5 fish/gillnet and 7.5fish/trapnet in 1990.             </p>",

The Bluegill, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass numbers are all low both for quantity and size. The mean size of Black Bullheads was 1.3lbs and Brown Bullheads was 0.9 lbs.</p>",
