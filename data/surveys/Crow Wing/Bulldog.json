These species catch rates exceed the third quartile of the area median the northern pike age groups from 4 to 8 years were represented with the average weight around 2.25 lbs per fish. The growth rates were below average for all age groups. The average weight for bowfin was 4.0 lbs. The yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, bluegill, wall- eye and yellow perch net catches show an average population status for these species of fish. The yellow bullheads average around 0.7 lbs per fish. The pumpkinseeds and bluegills are small in size with length groups 3.0-6.9 being represented. The bluegill age groups from 3 to 7 years old were represented with growth rates for all age groups slow. The walleye age groups 5 and 6 years old were represented. The walleyes averaged close to 4 lbs per fish for the three fish netted. The growth rates for the 6 year old walleyes were below average, while the 7 year old walleye showed above average growth rate. The yellow perch age groups 3 and 4 years old were represented with 87.5 being 4 years old. Two length groups were represented 5.5-5.9 inches and 6.0-6.4 inches. Growth rates were below average for both age groups. The white suckers, brown bullhead, rock bass, largemouth bass and black crappie net catches indicate a below average population, with the catch rate below the first quartile of the area median. The white sucker weighed 3.0 lbs. The brown bullheads average 1 lbs per fish, only three fish were netted. The rock bass averaged around 0.5 lbs per fish, two fish were netted. Two largemouth bass were netted, averaging 0.75 lbs per fish. Age groups 2 and 5 years old were represented. Growth rates were below average for both age groups. The black crappie age groups 3,4,5,6 and 7 year old were represented with 3 and 4 year olds accounting for 70% of the fish. The average weight was around 0.75 lbs per fish. The growth rates were slow for all age groups.</p>",
