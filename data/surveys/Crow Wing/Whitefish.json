                "narrative": "<p>Whitefish (or Little Whitefish) Lake is 696 acres in size and is located several miles south of Garrison in Crow Wing and Mille Lacs Counties.  In 1997 there were 52 homes/cabins and one resort located along the six miles of shoreline.  There is no designated public access present.  The lake is within the 1837 treaty boundaries.The lake is 62 feet deep and about 61% of the surface area is less than fifteen feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with moderate phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity was above average for the area in 1997.  Bottom soils in water less than four feet deep are primarily sand or muck, with mixed areas of gravel, rubble sized (3-10\") rock and marl also present.A fairly diverse aquatic plant community is present.  Emergent species help cycle nutrients and protect shorelines from excessive wave action.  Species like bulrush enhance the quality of spawning areas for bass and panfish, while species like wild rice can provide spawning habitat for northern pike.  Submerged and floating leafed species provide cover and food sources for a wide variety of aquatic organisms.The 1997 test netting showed a varied fish population.  When compared to similar type lakes, catches of walleye, yellow perch and largemouth bass were in the \"low\" category.  Northern pike, bluegill, pumpkinseed and rock bass catch rates were in the \"average\" category.  Black crappies and tullibees were caught in \"high\" numbers.Northern pike sampled by gillnets ranged from 16-33 inches long and averaged 20 inches and 2.4 lbs. in size.  Walleyes were sampled for the first time in 1997.  Although only six fish were sampled, five age classes were represented.  Size averaged 21 inches and 2.8 lbs..Largemouth bass were also caught in \"low\" numbers, but a variety of age classes were present and bass up to 19 inches were caught.  Bluegill numbers were \"average.\"  The 1994 and 1991 year classes were the strongest among the seven age classes sampled.  Although bluegills were slow growing, about 15% were at least 7.0 inches long at capture.  Black crappie numbers were \"high.\"  Five age classes were sampled and growth rate was good.  The strongest year class was from 1993.  Other panfish species sampled included pumpkinseeds, rock bass and hybrid sunfish.Important forage species included yellow perch, tullibee and white sucker.  The perch catch was in the \"low\" category.  Four age classes were sampled and young perch were common.  Perch growth was slow.  The tullibee catch was in the \"high\" category and a variety of sizes were present.  The white sucker catch was in the \"average\" category.Other species sampled in 1997 included bowfin (dogfish), yellow bullhead and black bullhead.  Their catch rates were all in the \"low\" category.  Common carp were present in both the 1980 and 1985 nettings in low to moderate numbers.  Carp were not sampled in the 1997 netting.</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 16 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 18.9 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 18.9?C (66.0?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values warmer than 17.2?C for Lake Whitefish indicate that the oxythermal conditions were unfavorable for Lake Whitefish. Oxythermal conditions are likely adequate for Cisco. Data collected in 1997-2017 indicate marginal oxythermal habitat for Lake Whitefish, but suitable for Cisco, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2017. When  inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, coldwater fishes are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>(Little) Whitefish is a 696 acre lake located six miles south of Garrison in southeastern Crow Wing County.  Whitefish reaches depths of 62', with 61% of the lake being 15' deep or less.  Water clarity is good, with an average secchi disk reading of 13'.  No public access is located on Whitefish, although in 2017 a resort allowed access for a fee.  Wild rice and bulrush surround the majority of the lake.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life.  In addition wild rice provides food for waterfowl.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers, when compared to similar lakes, at 8.4/gillnet.  Average length was 21.5\".  Northern pike at least 24\" in length made up 14% of the catch, with fish up to 37.7\" sampled.  New northern pike regulations effective March 1st, 2018 include a possession limit of 10 fish.  Only 2 may be over 26\" and all fish between 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the harvest opportunity for pike and improve the fish community composition. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by spring electrofishing at a rate of 28.5/hr run time.  Average length was 11.9\", with 53% measuring at least 12\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nTrapnets sampled bluegills in average number when compared to similar lakes at 8.8/net.  Average length was 5.8\", with 38% measuring at least 7\" in length.  Bluegills up to 9.0\" were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in average number in trapnets at 1.4/net.  Average length was nice at 9.3\".  The gillnet black crappie catch of 0.3 was low compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 7.8\".  For both net types combined 69% measured at least 8\" in length.  <br> \n <br> \nFour walleyes were sampled in gillnets and trapnets combined, including one which had been tagged in a Mille Lacs Lake study.  Fish can swim freely between Mille Lacs and Whitefish Lake through Whitefish Creek.   An additional yearling walleye was sampled during the spring bass electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Whitefish Lake, but they are located in the area.   Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers, as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
