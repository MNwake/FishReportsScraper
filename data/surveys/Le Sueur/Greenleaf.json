Green Leaf Lake also supports large populations of bluegill and black crappie, although both populations are currently composed of a large proportion of small individuals.  Given the relatively young average age of these panfish (<age-5), quality fishing may exist in the near future.  Despite frequent stocking, northern pike and walleye were captured at low levels.  Pike up to 36 inches and walleye up to 23 inches were captured, however, indicating a potential to catch a large fish.  Largemouth bass occur in moderate numbers with large bass present.  Given the current structure of the fish community, reclamation or winterkill may be required to increase gamefish production.</p>",

NORTHERN PIKE WERE REPRESEN- TED BY I-IV AGE CLASSES IN 87' COMPARED TO II-VI AGE CLASSES SAMPLED IN '86. MARKED NORTHERNS WERE STOCKED IN '85 AND IN THE SPRING OF 87. NO MARKED NORTHERNS HAVE BEEN SAMPLED IN '86 OR '87 NETTING. IT APPEARS NORTHERNS HAVE HAD GOOD NATURAL REPRODUCTION IN RECENT YEARS. WALLEYE CATCH RATES REMAIN LOW, AVERAGING 1.00/GILLNET COMPARED TO 0.75/GILLNET IN '86. WALLEYES ARE REPRESENTED BY OLDER FISH AND APPARENTLY SOME NATURAL REPRODUCTION HAS TAKEN PLACE WITH ONLY ONE WALLEYE FRY STOCKING MADE IN 79'. BLACK CRAPPIE CATCH RATES IMPROVED FROM 8.75/TRAPNET IN '86 TO 20.25/TRAPNET IN '87. BLACK CRAPPIES ARE FAIRLY EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG I-V AGE CLASSES. THE '86 CRAPPIE POPULATION WAS DOMINATED BY II AGE CLASS FISH WITH FEWER I,III, AND IV AGE CLASS FISH. WHITE CRAPPIE WERE NOT SAMPLED IN '87 COMPARED TO TWO  CAPTURED IN '86 NETTING. THE BLUEGILL NET CATCH WAS GREATLY REDUCED FROM 80.00/TRAPNET IN '86 TO 3.25/TRAPNET IN '87. THE PRESENT POPULATION IS MADE UP OF OLDER VI AND VII YEAR OLDS. THE BLUEGILL POPULATION IN '86 WAS WELL REPRESENTED BY IV-VI YEAR OLDS. THE SUNFISH POPULATION APPEARS TO BE SHIFTING TOWARD PUMPKIN- SEEDDS WITH AN INCREASE FROM 3.00/TRAPNET IN '86 TO 94.75/TRAPNET IN '87 NET CATCHES. STRONG III - V AGE CLASSES WERE SAMPLED IN '87 COMPARED TO THE DOMINATE II AGE CLASS IN '86. PERCH CATCH RATES IMPROVED FROM 7.75/GILLNET IN '86 TO 29.00/GILL- NET IN '87. PERCH ARE WELL DISTRIBUTED AMONG I-IV AGE CLASSES COMPARED TO II AND III AGE CLASSES SAMPLED IN 86. BLACK BULLHEADS CONTINUE TO BE VERY ABUNDANT, AVERAGING 162.00/TRAPNET COMPARED TO 225.75/TRAPNET IN '87. IT APPEARS THE SAME DOMINATE AGE CLASS OF BULLHEADS IS PRESENT AS IN '86, AND THEY CONTINUE TO GROW SLOWLY. OTHER SPECIES SAMPLED IN RELATIVELY LOW ABUNDANCE IN- CLUDE WHITE SUCKER, CARP, GOLDEN SHINER, AND HY- BRID SUNFISH.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Greenleaf Lake is a small, shallow, hypereutrophic lake, located in LeSueur County near the Town of Doyle.  A population assessment was conducted the week of June 27, 2011 to assess the status of the fish community.  High levels of phosphorous have contributed to poor water quality and extensive algae blooms that often reduce water clarity to 12 inches or less.  Additionally, historically high densities of common carp and black bullheads have led to increased turbidity, which prevents the growth of aquatic vegetation.  The shoreline of Greenleaf Lake is relatively undisturbed, as housing density around the lake is low.  A thin riparian buffer zone is present around the perimeter of the lake which separates the lake from surrounding agricultural fields.  A DNR-owned boat ramp is located on the east side of the lake which provides public access.  The sport fish community is dominated by panfish including bluegills and black crappies, but also contains walleye, northern pike, and yellow perch.  Northern pike and walleye spawning habitats are extremely limited; therefore their populations are maintained through stocking. The current management plan calls for stocking of walleye fry in odd years beginning in 2009, and for adult northern pike to be stocked annually, depending on availability.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite frequent stocking, northern pike have been sampled in low abundance during the last two decades (less than 0.9/trap net and 1.3/gill net).  The trend of low abundance continued as no northern pike were sampled in 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye relative abundance has historically been low in Greenleaf Lake, with catch rates never exceeding 0.8/trap net and 2.5/gill net.  Gill net catch rates of walleyes in 2011 remained consistent with historical catches at 2.0/gill net.  Trap net catch rates in 2011 were the highest recorded in Greenleaf Lake's survey history (4.6/trap net).  Trap-netted walleyes were small, ranging from 6.6 to 15.4 inches in total length and averaging 10.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies in Greenleaf Lake have historically occurred in above average numbers relative to similar lakes.  Black crappies were extremely abundant in 2011 with a catch rate of 127.7/gill net, well above the catch rate observed in 2006 (81.0/gill net).  Black crappies were small ranging from 3.9 to 8.7 inches in total length and averaging 7.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of bluegills increased from 53.2/trap net in 2006 to 142.0/trap net in 2011.  Bluegills ranged in length from 3.3 to 8.9 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  Approximately 74% of bluegills sampled were between 6.0 and 8.0 inches long, with 2% being greater than 8.0 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were present, but occurred in low numbers, with 2011 catch rates being 2.3/gill net and 2.0/trap net.  Catch rates of yellow perch in both sampling gears were greater than in 2006 when just two yellow perch were sampled during the survey.  Trap-netted yellow perch were small ranging from 4.8 to 8.4 inches in length and averaging 6.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance decreased from 87.7/gill net in 2006 to 46.0/gill net in 2011, which is slightly above average for similar lakes.  Common carp catch rates decreased from 48.3/gill net and 11.8/trap net in 2006 to 9.0/gill net and 9.8/trap net in 2011; however, common carp catch rates continued to be well above average compared to similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth buffalo, golden shiners, white suckers, and hybrid sunfish were observed during the 2011 assessment but occurred in low numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Greenleaf Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nGreenleaf Lake is a 302 acre lake located approximately 3.5 miles southwest of the town of Montgomery in Le Sueur County. The DNR-owned public access is located on the northeast shore off of County Road 140. It has a maximum depth of 19 feet, with approximately 87% of the lake classified as littoral area. It is placed in Lake Class 38, which includes other Waterville Area lakes such as Ballantyne Lake (Blue Earth County), Bass Lake (Faribault County), Hunt Lake (Rice County), and Horseshoe Lake (Le Sueur County). Greenleaf Lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass. The management plan calls for stocking Walleye fry at a rate of 1,000 fish/littoral acre in odd years. Recent stocking events include a mix of fry, fingerlings, yearlings, and adults in 2011 and fry only in 2013 and 2015. Periodic winterkills were common before the installation of an aerator in 1983. Since that time, winterkills have not been a factor. High levels of phosphorus have contributed to poor water quality and extensive algae blooms that result in poor water quality. The lack of aquatic vegetation remains a challenge for managing stable game fish populations. Greenleaf Lake was surveyed the week of June 27, 2016 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 6 gill nets and 7 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nA total of 67 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 9.6/net. Since 1984, catch rates have varied from 3.3/net in 1987 to 142.0/net in 2011 with an average of 34.2/net. Lengths ranged from 2.8 to 7.9 inches with an average of 3.9 inches. Fish ranged from 1 to 4 years old with 4 year-classes present. The 1 year old year-class accounted for approximately 88% of the sample. The lack of larger and older fish was concerning but the presence of a large age-1 year-class suggests that the Bluegill population will recover without interference. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nA total of 26 Walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.3/net. Walleye numbers have increased in recent years and this represents the highest catch rate since 1984. Before 2013, catch rates averaged just 1.0/net. Lengths ranged from 10.1 to 23.1 inches with an average of 17.4 inches. Seven additional Walleyes ranging from 9.8 to 11.7 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 7 years old with 4 year-classes present. On average, fish reached 15.0 inches around 2 years old, indicating fast growth relative to other area lakes. Collectively, the 2013 and 2015 year-classes that represent fry-stocked years comprised 94% of the sample. Overall, fry stocking events in 2013 and 2015 appeared to be responsible for the increase in Walleye numbers in recent years.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers reached an all-time low in 2016 with 5 fish sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.8/net. Since 1984, catch rates have been erratic with 4 samples below 5.0/net and 4 samples above 40.0/net with an overall average of 28.7/net. Black Crappie populations are notoriously unstable and the wide range in catch rates collected from Greenleaf was considered typical. One 13.0 inch fish was 5 years old, indicating fast growth potential. That potential coupled with the displayed resilience in past surveys, suggests that the Black Crappie population will rebound without supplementation. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \nA boat electrofishing sample targeting Largemouth Bass was postponed until 2017 due to time constraints. Despite their ability to avoid capture in net gears, a total of 39 Largemouth Bass were sampled with gill and trap nets in 2016. Lengths ranged from 5.0 to 20.6 inches with an average of 10.0 inches. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 15 years old with 4 year-classes present. Only one fish was older than 3 years old. The electrofishing sample scheduled for 2017 will more effectively sample the Largemouth Bass population and likely provide a larger sample size to analyze. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nYellow Perch were the most common non-bullhead species sampled with gill nets in 2016. A total of 59 fish ranging from 4.6 to 9.6 inches were sampled for a catch rate of 9.9/net. Since 1984, Yellow Perch numbers have been unstable with 5 samples falling below 1.0/net and 5 samples exceeding 9.0/net with an overall average of 7.3/net. An additional 52 fish ranging from 4.2 to 6.2 inches were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 7.3/net. Yellow Perch remained an important prey species in Greenleaf Lake in 2016. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead <br> \nBlack Bullheads dominated the gill and trap net catches in 2016. A total of 1,619 were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 269.8/net. Since 1984, catch rates have varied from 8.0/net in 1994 to 274.0/net in 1985 with an average of 103.1/net. Lengths ranged from 4.5 to 14.4 inches with an average of 7.2 inches. Black Bullheads thrive in unstable and hypereutrophic systems like Greenleaf Lake. Even with the aerator, the fish community will likely remain dominated by tolerant species such as Black Bullheads and Common Carp. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp <br> \nCommon Carp were the second most abundant species in the gill nets. A total of 31 fish ranging from 7.5 to 26.5 inches were sampled for a catch rate of 5.2/net. Since 1984, catch rates have varied from 0.0/net in 1985 to 48.3/net in 2006 with an average of 13.0/net. Like Black Bullheads, Common Carp are adept at surviving in lakes like Greenleaf. To demonstrate this point, approximately 80% of the total weight of fish sampled with gill nets was Black Bullheads and Common Carp. Unfortunately efforts to reduce populations of Common Carp and Black Bullhead have largely been unsuccessful in lakes similar to Greenleaf. It is also possible that aeration allows them to remain at high numbers when they would otherwise suffer high losses during winterkills. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nThe only other species sampled in 2016 was White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION DUE TO RECENT STOCKING, BUT ONE YY NORTHERN WAS CAPTURED IN SHORELINE SEINING. BLUEGILLS ARE PRESENT IN MODERATE NUMBERS WITH THREE YR OLDS DOMINATING THE THREE YEAR CLASSES SAMPLED. BLACK CRAPPIES HAVE BEEN DOING RELATIVELY WELL FOR THE SHORT TIME SINCE BEING INTRODUCED. THREE YEAR CLASSES WERE SAMPLED WITH ONE YEAR OLDS DOMINATING THE CATCH. PERCH ARE PRESENT IN VERY LOW NUMBERS AND MAY REFLECT THE RECENT NORTHERN PIKE STOCKING.

                "narrative": "<p>Greenleaf Lake is a 302-acre lake located approximately 3.5 miles southwest of the town of Montgomery in Le Sueur County. The DNR-owned public access is located on the northeast shore off County Road 140. Greenleaf Lake has a maximum depth of 19 feet, with approximately 87% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. Greenleaf Lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass. The management plan calls for stocking Walleye fry at a rate of 1,000 fish/littoral acre in odd years. Recent stocking events include fry in 2019 and 2021. Periodic winterkills were common before the installation of an aerator in 1983. Since that time, winterkills had not been a factor until 2019 when a near complete winterkill took place. High levels of phosphorus have contributed to poor water quality and extensive algae blooms that result in poor water quality. The lack of aquatic vegetation remains a challenge for managing stable game fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nGreenleaf Lake was surveyed the week of 28 June 2021 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 5 gill nets and 9 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 135 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 15.0/net. Since 1984, catch rates have varied from 3.3/net to 142.0/net with an average of 31.4/net. Bluegills ranged from 3.3 to 8.3 inches with an average of 4.7 inches. Bluegills were aged using scales and otoliths and ranged from 1 to 7 years old with 5 year-classes present. The 1 year old age-group accounted for approximately 67% of the sample. Bluegill sampled were likely the result of fish stocked in 2021. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 25 Walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 5.0/net. Trap net catches of Walleye were very high at 26.1/net. Walleyes were believed to be eating the young of the year Black Bullheads in shallow water which caused the high trap net numbers. Walleyes ranged from 7.8 to 14.5 inches. All Walleye sampled were from the 2019 fry stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the most common non-bullhead species sampled with gill nets in 2021. A total of 382 Yellow Perch ranging from 5.5 to 9.8 inches were sampled for a catch rate of 96.4/net. Broodstock Yellow Perch were stocked in 2019. It appears that Yellow Perch have had successful spawns in 2019 and 2020 as there are high numbers of fish in these year classes. These large year classes should provide food as the 2019 year class of Walleyes continues to grow. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads dominated the gill and trap net catches in 2016. A total of 1,619 were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 269.8/net. Since 1984, catch rates have varied from 8.0/net in 1994 to 274.0/net in 1985 with an average of 103.1/net. Lengths ranged from 4.5 to 14.4 inches with an average of 7.2 inches. Black Bullheads thrive in unstable and hypereutrophic systems like Greenleaf Lake. Even with the aerator, the fish community will likely remain dominated by tolerant species such as Black Bullheads and Common Carp. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were the second most abundant species in the gill nets. A total of 31 fish ranging from 7.5 to 26.5 inches were sampled for a catch rate of 5.2/net. Since 1984, catch rates have varied from 0.0/net in 1985 to 48.3/net in 2006 with an average of 13.0/net. Like Black Bullheads, Common Carp are adept at surviving in lakes like Greenleaf Lake. To demonstrate this point, approximately 80% of the total weight of fish sampled with gill nets was Black Bullheads and Common Carp. Unfortunately, efforts to reduce populations of Common Carp and Black Bullhead have largely been unsuccessful in lakes similar to Greenleaf Lake. It is also possible that aeration allows them to remain at high numbers when they would otherwise suffer high losses during winterkills. <br> \n <br> \nThe only other species sampled in 2016 was White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

THEY APPEAR TO BE OF CATCHABLE SIZE, RANGING FROM 17.0' (SMALLEST) TO 31.9 WELL DISTRIBUTED IN AGE  CLASSES, RANGING FROM 1984 TO 1980. THEY APPEAR TO HAVE SLOWER THAN AVG GROWTH. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT 670 ADULT NORTHERN WERE STOCKED IN 85 AND ALL HAD A PELVIC FIN CLIP; NONE OF THE NORTHERNS NETTED SHOWED A CLIPPED PEL- VIC FIN. WALLEYES APPEARED TO BE LOWER IN THIS ASSESSMENT THAN IN THE LAST (0.75/GILLNET IN 86 VERSUS 2.50/GILLNET IN 85). THE STATE MEDIAN FOR WALLEYES IS 3.60/GILLNET AND THE LOCAL IS 2.33/ GILLNET. THE FEW FISH CAUGHT WERE OF CATCHABLE SIZE RANGING FROM 17.0 TO 22.9 TL. THE 1979 200,000 FRY. THE YELLOW PERCH ARE DOMINATED BY A STRONG 1984 YEAR CLASS. THEIR MODAL LENGTH IS 5.5- 5.9 TL, WHICH IS SMALL. FISHERMEN MAY NOT ACCEPT PERCH THIS SMALL. THEY APPEAR TO HAVE SLOWER THAN AVERAGE GROWTH. BLUEGILLS ARE MUCH HIGHER IN RELA- TIVE ABUNDANCE IN THIS ASSESSMENT THAN LAST (80.00/TRAPNET VERSUS 9.50/TRAPNET), BUT IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THEY WERE REPRESENTED BY A YEAR CLASS PRESENT IN THE LAST SURVEY, SO THE NUMBERS MAY REFLECT NETTING EFFICIENCY. THE 1985,1983, 1981, AND 1980 YEAR CLASSES WERE REPRESENTED, WITH THE 1981 YEAR CLASS BEING DOMINATE. THE BLUEGILLS HAVE SLOWER THAN AVERAGE GROWTH. BLACK CRAPPIES ARE DOMINATED BY A 1984 YEAR CLASS. THEY HAVE AVERAGE GROWTH. THEY ARE CATCHABLE SIZE, WITH 6.0- 6.4 TL BEING THE MODAL LENGTH. BLACK CRAPPIES AVERAGED 8.75/TRAPNET IN 86 COMPARED TO THE STATE MEDIAN OF 2.67/TRAPNET; THE LOCAL MEDIAN IS 15.00/TRAPNET. PUMPKINSEEDS, WHITE CRAPPIES, AND A FEW PUMPKINSEED,BLUEGILL,HYBRID AND GREEN BLUEGILL HYBRID SHOWED UP IN THE SURVEY. BLACK BULLHEADS ARE HIGH IN NUMBERS AND CONTINUE TO BE DOMINATED BY ONE SIZE CLASS. THE STATE MEDIAN FOR BLACK BULLHEADS IS 2.60/TRAPNET AND THE LOCAL MEDIAN IS 24.75/TRAPNET. GILLNETS AVGD 46.00/GILLNET COMPARED TO THE STATE MEDIAN OF 1.50 GILLNET AND THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 46.25/GILLNET. THEIR MODAL LENGTH IS 6.0-6.4 TL. CARP WERE PRE- SENT IN LOW NUMBERS.</p>",
