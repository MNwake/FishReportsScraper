                "narrative": "<p>Pointon is a 171 acre lake located about ten miles east of Brainerd, in Crow Wing County.  There is no public access.  Development is light, with about 1.9 homes/cabins per shoreline mile.  Maximum depth is fourteen feet.  Pointon has moderately hard water and low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity was about average for the area and the water was slightly bog-stained in '98.The aquatic plant community was fairly diverse and plants grew to a depth of ten feet in 1998.  Wild rice is a dominant emergent plant in Pointon.  It was found around much of the lake in '98 and was especially abundant on the south side and near the outlet.  Wild rice can provide good spawning habitat for northern pike.  Hardstem bulrush also occurred around much of the lake, but plant density was not high.  Bulrush provides good spawning habitat for a variety of fish, including bass and panfish.Test netting was done in 1998.  Northern pike was the most abundant ganefish.  Numbers were high and size small, when compared to similar type lakes.  Although size averaged 15 inches and 1.2 lbs., fish as large as 31 inches were caught, and pike growth was good.  Largemouth bass is a gamefish which is poorly sampled in stationary nets.  The bass catch was, predictably, low in '98 but a variety of sizes appeared to be present.  Black crappie is a popular panfish.  Its abundance continued to be low in '98 and fish tended to be small.  This condition has existed for a number of years.  Bluegill numbers, however, were \"average\" when compared to similar type lakes and about 38% of them were at least 7.0 inches long.  Yellow perch, an important food source for gamefish, continued to be present in low numbers.</p>",
