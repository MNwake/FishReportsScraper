                "narrative": "<p>     Sewell Lake a 338-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles southeast of Dalton, MN.  Sewell Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  Land use in the immediate watershed is primarily agricultural.  The maximum depth of Sewell Lake is 52 feet; however, 50% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2018 survey was 5.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.0 to 17.0 feet.  Water clarity in this lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton/algae blooms. <br> \n     A large majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  It is primarily composed of agricultural crops.  The shoalwater substrates are composed primarily of sand and gravel.  A state owned public water access is located along the north shoreline of the lake.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are located along the south shoreline.  Common cattail is also prevalent along various shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Sewell Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.         <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance is moderate and has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 20.1 to 35.2 inches with an average length and weight of 23.4 inches and 3.0 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 24.0 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that the Largemouth Bass population is abundant and has a good size structure.  Bass ranged in length from 6.7 to 19.3 inches with an average length and weight of 15.6 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 13.9 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     A slot length limit regulation for Largemouth Bass is in effect for Sewell Lake.  The regulation is a 14.0 to 20.0 inch protected slot with one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain or improve the size structure of the Largemouth Bass population.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance and size structure fluctuates considerably due to inconsistent reproduction.  In this assessment, all Bluegills were under 6.0 inches in length.   Bluegills attain an average length of 4.4 inches at three years of age.      <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 11.6 to 26.9 inches with an average length and weight of 19.1 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.3 inches at three years of age.  <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality fishing that this lake has to offer by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n     Sewell Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Sewell Lake a 338-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles southeast of Dalton, MN.  Sewell Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  Land use in the immediate watershed is primarily agricultural.  The maximum depth of Sewell Lake is 52 feet; however, 50% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2023 survey was 8.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.0 to 17.0 feet.  Water clarity in this lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton and algae blooms. <br> \n     A large majority of the shoreline is undeveloped and is primarily composed of agricultural crops.  The shoalwater substrates are composed primarily of sand and gravel.  A state owned public water access is located along the north shoreline of the lake.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are located along the south shoreline.  Common cattail is also prevalent along various shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Northern Pike and Walleye populations. <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has decreased over the recent series of surveys.  The decline in abundance can be attributed to an outlet structure which was installed in 2016.  Resulting lower water levels decreased the amount of available spawning habitat for Northern Pike.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 16.5 to 29.6 inches with an average length and weight of 21.8 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 23.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has remained stable at a moderate level over the recent series of surveys. Walleyes ranged in length from 7.0 to 24.9 inches with an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 12.2 inches at two years of age.  <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing survey conducted in 2018 indicated that the Largemouth Bass population is abundant, exhibits consistently good reproduction, fast growth rates, and has a good size structure.  A spring electrofishing survey is proposed to be conducted in the spring of 2024 to provide data for an updated analysis of the Largemouth Bass population.     <br> \n     A slot length limit regulation for Largemouth Bass is in effect for Sewell Lake.  The regulation is a 14.0 to 20.0 inch protected slot with one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain or improve the size structure of the Largemouth Bass population.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality fishing that this lake has to offer by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n     Sewell Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Sewell Lake was conducted on June 21, 2018 by Fergus Falls Area Fisheries Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, and a 15-foot seine was used at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Pugnose Shiner) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \n     The nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \n     Data from this survey indicates Sewell Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pomme de Terre Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   Sewell Lake a 338-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles southeast of Dalton, MN.  Sewell Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  There are eight intermittent inlets located around the lake and one outlet.  Land use in the immediate watershed is primarily agricultural.  The maximum depth of Sewell Lake is 52 feet; however, 50% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 4.0 feet.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.6 to 17.0 feet in previous surveys.  Water clarity in this lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton-algae blooms. <br> \n     The shoreline of Sewell Lake is primarily composed of agricultural crops.  The shoalwater substrates are composed primarily of sand and gravel.  A public water access is located along the north shoreline of the lake.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are located along the south shoreline.  Common cattail is also prevalent along various shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Sewell Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike,   Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.        <br> \n     A high-density Northern Pike population exists.  Northern Pike abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.9 to 34.3 inches with an average length and weight of 21.8 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 24.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     A spring electrofishing assessment was conducted to analyze the Largemouth Bass population.  Data indicate that the Largemouth Bass population is abundant and has a good size structure.  Bass ranged in length from 5.9 to 19.8 inches with an average length and weight of 14.5 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 13.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     A special regulation for Largemouth Bass was implemented in 2005.  The regulation is a 12-inch maximum size limit with one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain or improve the size structure of the Largemouth Bass population.  The regulation will be reviewed and will either be dropped, extended, or modified in the fall of 2014.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance and size structure fluctuates considerably due to inconsistent year class strength.  In this assessment, 7% of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.   Bluegills attain an average length of 6.7 inches at five years of age.      <br> \n     Walleye are moderately abundant in this lake.  Walleye size structure is good.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.3 to 28.5 inches with an average length and weight of 15.3 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.1 inches at three years of age.  <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality fishing that this lake has to offer by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike and bluegill numbers continue to be well above state and local medians. Yellow perch numbers are up considerably since the 1982 survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sewell Lake is located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles southeast of Dalton, MN.  Sewell Lake is a 338-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake that is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  There are eight intermittent inlets located around the lake and one outlet.  Land use in the immediate watershed is primarily agricultural.  The maximum depth of Sewell Lake is 52 feet; however, 50% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading at the time of the assessment was 17.0 feet compared to the 1999 reading of 5.6 feet.  Water clarity in this lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton-algae blooms.     The shoreline of Sewell Lake is primarily composed of agricultural crops.  A small number of cabins (8) are scattered around the shoreline.  The shoal water substrates are composed primarily of sand and gravel.  A public water access is located along the north shoreline of the lake.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are located along the south shoreline.  Common cattail is also prevalent along various shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  Submerged aquatic plants grow to a depth of 18 feet.  Muskgrass (chara) and coontail are the most abundant types of submergent aquatic plants.     Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  Test-net data indicate that walleye abundance is down slightly but that the size structure is still good.  Walleyes ranged in length from 11.7 to 28.3 inches with an average length and weight of 18.2 inches and 2.7 pounds.  The 1998, 1999, and 2000 year classes have recruited to the fishery and should provide good angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.5 inches at four years of age.     It is difficult to assess walleye natural reproduction occurrence from the 2003 data because since 1999, both yearling and adults have been stocked on a biennial basis; however, data from past surveys indicate that fingerling stocking was supplementing limited natural reproduction.  Fingerlings will be stocked on a biennial basis and this stocking sequence will be evaluated during the next lake survey.     Northern pike abundance and size structure is very good.  A high-density northern pike population exists, most likely due to the large amount of suitable spawning habitat that is available.  Pike abundance has remained stable since the 1982 lake survey.  Northern pike ranged in length from 18.6 to 32.4 inches withan average length and weight of 22.8 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Pike exhibit good growth rates in this lake with an average length of 19.3 inches at three years of age.     Catch data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a high-density largemouth bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 4.8 to 20.4 inches with an average length and weight of 13.9 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 12.3 inches at four years of age.           Sewell Lake is also a popular lake for bluegill anglers.  Data from the test-netting indicate that bluegills are abundant and have a good size structure.  Twenty-five percent of the bluegills sampled were > 7.0 inches.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.6 inches at six years of age.     Anglers can maintain the quality fishing that this lake has to offer by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Sewell Lake a 338-acre eutrophic (fertile) located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles southeast of Dalton, MN.  Sewell Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  There are eight intermittent inlets located around the lake and one outlet.  Land use in the immediate watershed is primarily agricultural.  The maximum depth of Sewell Lake is 52 feet; however, 50% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 7.5 feet.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.6 to 17.0 feet in previous surveys.  Water clarity in this lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton-algae blooms. <br> \n     The shoreline of Sewell Lake is primarily composed of agricultural crops.  The shoalwater substrates are composed primarily of sand and gravel.  A public water access is located along the north shoreline of the lake.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are located along the south shoreline.  Common cattail is also prevalent along various shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  Test-net data indicate that the walleye catch rate was in the normal range for this class of lake; however, it is the lowest ever recorded for this lake.  Walleye size structure is good. Walleyes ranged in length from 7.0 to 27.6 inches with an average length and weight of 20.9 inches and 3.7 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 14.5 inches at three years of age.  <br> \n     Northern pike abundance and size structure is very good.  A high-density northern pike population exists due to the large amount of suitable spawning habitat that is available.  Northern pike abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Northern pike ranged in length from 19.1 to 36.9 inches with an average length and weight of 24.0 inches and 3.2 pounds.  Forty- two percent of the pike were 24.0 inches or greater in length.  Northern pike attain an average length of 22.5 inches four years of age. <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate declined significantly from previous surveys; however, it is within the normal range for this class of lake.  Bluegill size structure has also declined.  Only 2% of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.3 inches at five years of age.      <br> \n     A special regulation for largemouth bass was implemented in March of 2005.  The regulation is a 12-inch maximum size limit with one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain or improve the size structure of the largemouth bass population.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality fishing that this lake has to offer by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",
