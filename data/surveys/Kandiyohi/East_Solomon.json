East Solomon is a moderate sized (658 acres), shallow (14 feet maximum depth), turbid, aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in East Solomon had been due primarily to fry stockings as documented by past surveys. Walleye fry are generally stocked every other year in East Solomon Lake. Walleye fry were stocked recently during 2019 (501,661 fish) and 2018 (1,200,673 fish) in East Solomon. Walleye fry were also stocked (approximately 700,000-820,000 fish per stocking) into East Solomon during 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017. Walleye fingerlings (24,000-35,000 fish per stocking) were last stocked during even years from 1994-1998. Fingerling stocking results were mixed or inclusive due to fry stocking occurring during the same years.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate YOY Walleye numbers (48.00 YOY/hour, 6.84 inches) were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. No YOY or Yearling Walleye were captured in the 2018 or 2017 fall night electrofishing surveys. Moderate numbers of small YOY Walleye were captured (49.09 YOY/hour, 5.23 inches average) in the 2015 fall night electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of moderate sized YOY Walleye were captured (360.00 YOY/hour, 6.26 inches average) in the 2013 fall night electrofishing survey. The highest fall night electrofishing catch rate of YOY Walleye occurred in 2007 (563.99 YOY/hour, 5.46 inches average) for a fry stocked year.  <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye abundance (11.50 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range for East Solomon, but within the normal range for similar lakes in the most recent 2014 survey. The 2014 Walleye average weight and length were 2.14 pounds and 17.44 inches from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 2.34 pounds from gillnets. The 2011 and 2009 year classes (fry stocked years) comprised 32% and 18% respectively of the 2014 Walleye catch.  <br> \n <br> \nThe East Solomon Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2020 summer for all fish species. Walleye fry will be stocked in 2021. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A summer resurvey was conducted on East Solomon Lake in June of 2004. East Solomon is a moderate sized (706 acres), multi basin, aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. East Solomon is connected to several other shallow aerated and non-aerated lakes via inlets (Long Lake) and outlets (West Solomon Lake). The immediate shoreline area is composed primarily of undeveloped hardwood areas. Submergent vegetation densities are moderate to low consisting mostly of sago pondweed, water moss, filamentous algae, and coontail. Emergent vegetation densities are moderate consisting of primarily hardstem bulrush, cattail species, and reed canary grass. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, detritus, and boulder in East Solomon. Water clarity was excellent during June of 2004 (secchi=12.0 feet), however water clarity usually decreases substantially by mid summer due to frequent blue-green algae blooms. East Solomon is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie. Walleye fry are generally stocked into East Solomon every other year. If a fry stocking is a failure, then the lake will generally be stocked again with fry the following spring. Walleye fingerling stocking is contingent in East Solomon after successive fry stocking failures.Yellow perch numbers were low to moderate in 2004 (4.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 7.88 fish/gillnet for East Solomon. The 2004 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.17 pounds and 6.61 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight and length is 0.15 pounds from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates for East Solomon were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. Northern pike numbers were low in 2004 (1.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical catch rate is 1.38 fish/gillnet for East Solomon. The 2004 northern pike average size was moderate to large (5.52 pounds and 28.92 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 5.12 pounds from gillnets. The largest northern pike captured in the 2004 resurvey was 31.69 inches. Northern pike growth rates for East Solomon were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. Bluegill numbers were low in 2004 (2.40 fish/trapnet), but within the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical catch rate is 1.98 fish/trapnet for East Solomon. The 2004 bluegill average size was moderate (0.28 pounds and 5.95 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.29 pounds from trapnets. The largest bluegill captured in the 2004 resurvey was 10.35 inches. Bluegill growth rates for East Solomon were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. Black crappie numbers were low in 2004 (1.30 fish/trapnet), but within the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical catch rate is 0.33 fish/trapnet for East Solomon. The 2004 black crappie average size was small (0.12 pounds and 5.06 inches) from trapnets. Walleye numbers were moderate in 2004 (7.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 8.94 fish/gillnet for East Solomon. The 2004 walleye average size was moderate (2.23 pounds and 18.00 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 2.81 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of walleye 15.00 inches and larger was high (6.50 fish/gillnet) in 2004. Walleye growth rates for East Solomon were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 2-8. The 2000 walleye year class comprised 52% of the 2004 walleye resurvey catch. Walleye natural reproduction in East Solomon is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. However, a moderate naturally produced walleye year class (2001 walleye year class) comprised 19% of total walleye catch in the 2004 resurvey. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate a 2004 spring walleye fry stocking (707,988 fry). There were abundant young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (204.00 YOY/hour, 4.50 inches average length) captured in 2004. Other area walleye fry stocked lakes had generally low YOY walleye catch rates in 2004 fall electrofishing surveys. The East Solomon Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 52.14 YOY/hour and 7.01 inches respectively. Walleye fry have been stocked recently into East Solomon during 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002. Black bullhead numbers were low in 2004 (1.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 13.38 fish/gillnet for East Solomon. The 2004 black bullhead average size was large (0.56 pounds and 8.59 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.30 pounds from gillnets.Carp numbers were moderate in 2004 (1.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 1.38 fish/gillnet for East Solomon. The 2004 carp average size was large (8.86 pounds and 26.50 inches) from gillnets. The carp historical average weight is 5.52 pounds from gillnets.Current fish management activities on East Solomon include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the county with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The East Solomon fishery will be sampled in the 2008 summer for all fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on East Solomon Lake during September 12, 2018 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. East Solomon is a moderate sized (658 acres), shallow (14 feet maximum depth), turbid, aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in East Solomon had been due primarily to fry stockings as documented by past surveys and analysis. Walleye fry are generally stocked every other year in East Solomon Lake. In 2018, 1,200,673 Walleye fry were stocked in East Solomon. Walleye fry were also stocked recently (approximately 700,000-820,000 fish per stocking) into East Solomon during 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017. Walleye fingerlings (24,000-35,000 fish per stocking) were last stocked even years from 1994-1998. Fingerling stocking results were mixed or inclusive due to fry stocking occurring during the same years.  <br> \n <br> \nNo YOY or Yearling Walleye were captured in the 2018 or 2017 fall night electrofishing surveys. Moderate numbers of small YOY Walleye were captured (49.09 YOY/hour, 5.2 inches average) in the 2015 fall night electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of moderate sized YOY Walleye were captured (360.00 YOY/hour, 6.3 inches average) in the 2013 fall night electrofishing survey. The highest fall night electrofishing catch rate of YOY Walleye occurred in 2007 (563.99 YOY/hour, 5.5 inches average) for a fry stocked year. Other fish species observed included abundant numbers of YOY Largemouth Bass, YOY Yellow Perch, Bluegill and shiners during the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Perhaps these abundant sight feeding YOY fish species are preying upon the stocked fry and negatively affecting survival. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye abundance (11.50 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range for East Solomon in the most recent 2014 survey. The 2014 walleye average weight and length were large (2.14 pounds and 17.4 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 2.34 pounds from gillnets. The 2011 and 2009 year classes (fry stocked years) comprised 32% and 18% respectively of the 2014 walleye catch. <br> \n <br> \nThe East Solomon Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2020 summer for all fish species. Walleye fry will be stocked in 2019. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Solomon Lake is located about 4 miles northwest of Willmar, MN. East Solomon is amoderate size lake (706 acres) with a maximum depth of 14 ft. Nutrient levels are often high.Water clarity is variable on East Solomon depending upon the presence or absence of algaeblooms. Secchi disk readings were 1.3 ft on 7/17/57, 8.5 ft on 6/23/88 and 12.0 ft on6/12/95. Winterkill was a common occurrence in East Solomon Lake prior to the 1987-88 winter.An aeration (6 helixors) system was first installed in the winter of 1987-88 and has been inoperation to the present time. The aeration system was moved from the SW point in the early1990's to a better location (mid north shore). East Solomon was opened to unlimited fishingduring partial winterkill years of 1982 and 1990-91. There is a large double-crestedcormorant rookery located nearby on Long Lake and also scattered nesting along East SolomonLake. The most commonly occurring emergent vegetation species include hardstem bulrush,common cattail, and reed canary grass. Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are most abundantin the NE bay and adjacent marsh areas. Submergent vegetation is most abundant in the NE bayarea and low to moderate around the remaining shoreline and bay areas. The most commonsubmergent species include sago pondweed, claspingleaf pondweed, coontail, water moss, andnorthern watermilfoil. Blue-green algae blooms are a common occurrence on East Solomon Lake.Filamentous algae was also abundant on the shoalwater substrates. The shoalwater substratesare mostly sand, detritus, muck, and gravel. There are several marsh areas that connect orare adjacent to the lake. Two inlets enter East Solomon Lake. One inlet connects East Solomonto Long Lake via a USFWS Waterfowl Production Area (beaver dam present upstream) and anotherintermittent inlet that connects to a shallow marsh area on the southeast side of the lake.The outlet connects to West Solomon Lake (shallow waterfowl lake). In 1953, a concrete damwas constructed downstream of the West Solomon Lake outlet to prevent undesirable fish (carp,bullhead) movement into the West and East Solomon Lakes from St. John's Lake and Hawk Creek.Residential development is limited to several farms and homes (10 homes total in 1995). EastSolomon was managed primarily as a game/waterfowl lake prior to the late 1980's. The fisheryconsisted mostly of black bullhead, carp, and minnow species prior to aeration (Game LakeSurvey 1957). Gamefish were limited due to frequent winterkill conditions. A northern pikespawning area was operated in 1975 and 1976, but production was limited (5,600 fingerlingproduced in 1975, 0 in 1976). Presently, East Solomon Lake is managed for walleye as theprimary species and black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and largemouth bass as secondaryspecies. Walleye fry were first stocked in 1986. Walleye fry are currently scheduled to bestocked (about 700,000 fry) after one documented poor year class as determined by fallelectrofishing. East Solomon was a popular walleye angling lake during the 1987 winter.Presently, walleye numbers are abundant and angling success has been fair to good duringrecent years (early ice conditions during the winter, May and June in the summer).     Walleye abundance in 1995 (20.8 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (3.2 - 15.3fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and above the 1988 survey (0 fish/gillnet). It is oftentypical for gamefish populations to first boom several years after aeration systems areinstalled in productive lakes, then decrease to moderate levels. The average size was 17.6inches in 1995 The average weight of walleye captured in the gillnets was 2.5 lbs in 1995.The largest walleye caught was 23.2 inches. Growth rates appear good/excellent the first fouryears. A strong 1991 year class (68% of the total walleye catch) was probably the result ofa 1991 fry stocking (735,000 fry). Low numbers of walleye young of year \"YOY\" were documentedin 1995 (6.9 YOY/hour) and 1994 (12.0 YOY/hour). The average YOY sizes were large in 1995(8.6 inches) and 1994 (7.9 inches). Both 1995 and 1994 year classes were probably a resultof fry stockings. About 17% (16 fish) of the summer walleye net catch was from the 1994 yearclass (6-9 inches) and 8% was from the 1993 year class (15-17 inches). No yearling walleyewere documented during the 1995 or 1994 fall electrofishing surveys, however, electrofishingmay be size selective for smaller fish and may not adequately sample large yearling walleye.     Northern pike abundance in 1995 (3.5 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (1.2 -7.8 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but above the 1988 survey (0.0 fish/gillnet). The 1995catch rate of quality size plus fish was 3.8 fish > 21 inches/net. The 1995 average lengthwas 25.9 inches. The average weight was 4.7 lbs in 1995. The largest northern pike caught was32.0 inches. Growth rates appear good to excellent for the first three years. Most of thenorthern pike captured were from the 1993 (50% of the catch) and 1992 (39% of the catch) yearclasses. There were no northern pike YOY captured during the 1995 and 1994 fallelectrofishing surveys.     Yellow perch abundance in 1995 (19.5 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.0 -22.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but above the 1988 survey (2.0 fish/gillnet). The 1995average size (7.1 inches) was above the 1988 survey (5.6 inches). The largest yellow perchcaught was 11.2 inches. Growth rates appear excellent. About 59% of the fish captured werefrom the 1994 year class. Many small (YOY/YRL) yellow perch were seen during the 1995 fallelectrofishing survey. The yellow perch appear fast growing, but with a short life duration.     Bluegill abundance in 1995 (0.6 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (1.0 - 14.9fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and below the 1988 survey (1.8 fish/trapnet). The 1995average size (6.9 inches) was above the historical average (6.1 inches). The largest bluegillcaptured in the survey nets was 10.4 inches. Growth rates appear fair/slow the first threeyears and average/good for older fish. Many YOY bluegill were caught during the 1995 Augustseining (72.3 fish/seine haul, average size=1.5 inches). Many small sunfish (YOY/YRL) werealso seen during the 1995 fall electrofishing survey. Many YOY hybrid sunfish (Green/Bluegill?) were also caught in the seine hauls (109.7 fish/seine haul). Green sunfish abundance in1995 (0.4 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range for similar lakes (0.1 - 0.7fish/trapnet), but above the 1988 survey (0.0 fish/trapnet). It appears that spawning habitatis adequate for sunfish species to reproduce, but poor water clarity (caused by blue-greenalgae blooms) is probably limiting the survival of one-two year old fish due to reducedsunfish feeding efficiency and low numbers of preferred zooplankton present in watersdominated by blue-green algae.     There were no largemouth bass or black crappie captured in the 1995 or 1988 summersurvey gillnets or trapnets. Largemouth bass are present within the lake, however, summergillnets or trapnets are not effective sampling gears for this species. Largemouth bassyearlings were prevalent in the 1995 summer seine hauls (3.3 fish/seine haul) and the fallelectrofishing survey (YOY and YRL).      Black bullhead abundance in 1995 (5.0 fish/gillnet, 2.4 fish/trapnet) was within thenormal range (4.6 - 83.0 fish/gillnet, 1.3 - 78.1 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but belowthe 1988 survey (18.5 fish/gillnet, 4.4 fish/trapnet). The 1995 average size (7.7 inches) wasabove the 1988 survey (6.4 inches). Black bullhead are an important forage species forwalleye in many productive/shallow lakes in southwestern Minnesota. Commercial fishermenremoved 1,600 lbs of black bullhead in 1986 (winter/spring), 61,600 lbs in 1988, and 1,800lbs in 1993 from East Solomon. Commercial fishermen removed 900 lbs of black bullhead in 1986(winter/spring), 35,900 lbs in 1987, 15,300 lbs in 1990, 1,800 lbs in 1991, 2,400 lbs in1992, and 1,560 lbs in 1993 from nearby West Solomon Lake. A combination of factors probablyresulted in the black bullhead population decline which includes high predator fish (walleye)abundance during the late 1980's, high local pelican and cormorant numbers, and commercialremoval. Black bullhead numbers throughout Kandiyohi County lakes have significantly declinedin the last five years.     Carp abundance in 1995 (1.5 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (0.7 - 5.1fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but above the 1988 survey (0.0 fish/trapnet). The 1995average size was 4.3 lbs. There appears to be moderate/abundant carp numbers throughout thechain of Ringo, Long, and East Solomon lakes.     The lake habitat (variable water clarity, blue-green algae blooms common, submergent andemergent vegetation restricted to bay areas) has remained relatively the same since the1950's (Game Lake Survey 1957) with the exception of fluctuating water levels during droughtconditions. However, East Solomon Lake has undergone dramatic changes in the fish communitystructure since the start of winter aeration in 1987-88. Walleye numbers are presently high.The initial boom and subsequent decline of gamefish numbers is typical after aeration systemsare first operated for several years in productive lakes. It appears that a strong walleyeyear class was recruited into the fishery after a 1991 fry stocking following the 1990-91winterkill. The aeration system was moved after 1991 to a better location where wind and waveaction was more prevalent (promotes mixing). There have been no recorded winterkills sincethe aeration system was moved. Non-gamefish such as black bullhead (important forage forwalleye in some lakes) have steadily decreased since aeration was initiated in 1987-88.However, other non-gamefish such as carp have not declined, but these fish grow rapidly andmay be in a predator's \"window of opportunity\" for only a short period of time. The abundantcarp numbers are probably increasing turbidity in the lake (stirring up the bottom duringfeeding), thus inhibiting submergent vegetation growth. Although, increase turbidity maybenefit species such as black crappie or walleye, it will continue to limit abundance ofspecies such as bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike. Black crappie numbers are notabundant which may be due to high walleye numbers resulting in competition for limitedresources with crappies. There appears to be no significant walleye natural reproduction inEast Solomon Lake during 1995 or 1994. The abundant numbers of adult walleye and moderatenumbers of northern pike presently are probably limiting the survival in part of smallwalleye in East Solomon due to the low/moderate numbers of forage present (blackbullhead/yellow perch). In addition, it is unknown what influence abundant local pelican andcormorants (federally protected species) populations are having on local lakes (forage andgamefish numbers), especially when preferred species (black bullhead) of these birds havedeclined significantly throughout the area. Future management activities include monitoringfish populations through lake population assessments and electrofishing surveys, stockingwalleye fry as needed, protecting emergent vegetation habitat from increasing developmentpressures, and encouraging the implementation of best management practices within thewatershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Solomon is a moderate sized, shallow, and productive lake located in KandiyohiCounty. A six unit subsurface helixor aeration system is operated each winter to preventwinterkill of gamefish in East Solomon. Aeration was first operated in East Solomon duringthe 1987-88 winter. Aquatic vegetation stands (hardstem bulrush, pondweeds, etc.) are commonin East Solomon. Blue-green algae blooms can become common during the late summer months. Amajority of East Solomon is still undeveloped. The surrounding shoreland characteristicsinclude hardwood and cedar trees, adjacent or connected wetlands, and pastures. Walleye fryor fingerlings are stocked into East Solomon every even year. Approximately 700,000 walleyefry were stocked in the spring of 2000. In recent years, anglers have reported good fishingsuccess for walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.     Walleye numbers were moderate in 2000 (7.75 fish/gillnet), but below the 1995 abundance(20.75 fish/gillnet). The 2000 walleye average size was large (3.69 lbs. and 20.54 inches,gillnets). Walleye growth rates in East Solomon were above normal compared to other arealakes. Walleye natural reproduction is generally limited in East Solomon, but low to moderatesuccess was documented for 1997.     Northern pike numbers were low in 2000 (1.00 fish/gillnet). The 2000 northern pikeaverage size was large (5.15 lbs. and 26.36 inches, gillnets). The largest northern pikecaptured was 38.70 inches.      Yellow perch numbers were low to moderate in 2000 (5.50 fish/gillnet). The 2000 yellowperch average size was small (0.13 lbs. and 6.11 inches, gillnets).     Bluegill numbers were low in 2000 (3.10 fish/trapnet), but above the 1995 survey (0.60fish/trapnet). The 2000 bluegill average size was small (0.12 lbs. and 5.12 inches,trapnets).     Largemouth bass numbers were moderately abundant in the 2000 spring electrofishingsurvey (44.40 fish/hour) and similar to the area average (45.76 fish/hour). The 2000 springlargemouth bass average size was large (2.33 lbs. and 14.61 inches). The largest basscaptured in the 2000 spring electrofishing survey was 17.36 inches. The 1997 year classcomprised 76% of the total 2000 spring electrofishing largemouth bass catch. Largemouth bassgrowth rates were above normal compared to other area lakes. Local anglers had good successcatching largemouth bass in 2000.     Carp numbers were moderate in 2000 (4.00 fish/gillnet) and above the 1995 survey (0.25fish/gillnet). The 2000 carp average size was large (4.93 lbs. and 21.31 inches, gillnets).     Black bullhead numbers were abundant in 2000 (181.90 fish/trapnet). The 2000 blackbullhead average size was small (0.07 lbs. and 5.80 inches, trapnets).     Future development may have negative impacts on the fishery and water quality of EastSolomon. Presently, the lake's water quality is fair to moderate. Blue-green algae blooms cansometimes become a problem in the late summer. Although, these blooms are more a product ofthe lake's morphology (shallow depth, large fetch, frequent mixing of internal nutrients)than low nutrient inputs from external sources (row crop/septic/lawn runoff). The fisheryappears to be healthy for a variety of fish species. A night electrofishing survey will beconducted in the spring of 2001 in order to determine the success or failure of the 2000walleye fry stocking. A population assessment will be conducted in 2004 to assess adultgamefish abundance, size, and growth.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted on East Solomon Lake during June of 2009. East Solomon is a moderate sized (706 acres), multi basin, shallow (14 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. East Solomon is connected to a shallow aerated lake (Long Lake) via an inlet and a non-aerated lake (West Solomon Lake) via an outlet. The immediate shoreline area is composed primarily of undeveloped hardwood areas. Submergent vegetation densities are moderate to low consisting mostly of sago pondweed, water moss, filamentous algae, and coontail. Emergent vegetation densities are moderate consisting of primarily hardstem bulrush, cattail species, and reed canary grass. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, detritus, and boulder in East Solomon. Water clarity was poor during June of 2009 (secchi=2.0 feet). Water clarity usually decreases substantially by mid summer due to frequent blue-green algae blooms. East Solomon is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie. Walleye fry are generally stocked into East Solomon every other year. If a fry stocking is a failure, then the lake will generally be stocked again with fry the following spring. Walleye fingerling stocking is contingent in East Solomon after successive fry stocking failures. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were abundant in 2009 (9.25 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches, but moderate compared to similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 8.15 fish/gillnet. The 2009 yellow perch average size was large to moderate (0.27 pounds and 7.80 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight was 0.18 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality (8.00 inches and larger) size yellow perch was moderate (4.75 fish/gillnet) in the 2009 assessment.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2009 (3.25 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches, but moderate compared to similar lakes. The northern pike historical catch rate is 1.75 fish/gillnet. The 2009 northern pike average size was moderate (4.47 pounds and 25.93 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 4.96 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality (21.00 inches and larger) size northern pike was high (2.75 fish/gillnet) in the 2009 assessment. Northern pike growth rates for East Solomon were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2007 and 2004 year classes each comprised 36% of the 2009 assessment northern pike catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2009 (6.70 fish/trapnet) compared to historical catches, but moderate compared to similar 41 lakes. The bluegill historical catch rate is 2.92 fish/trapnet. The 2009 bluegill average size was large (0.33 pounds and 6.87 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.30 pounds from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2009 (20.90 fish/trapnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes (75th=12.33 fish/trapnet). The black crappie historical catch rate is 4.44 fish/trapnet. The 2009 black crappie average size was moderate (0.43 pounds ) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.28 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of preferred (10.00 inches and larger) size black crappie was high (3.30 fish/trapnet) in the 2009 assessment. Black crappie growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2006 and 2005 year classes comprised 61% and 22% respectively of the 2009 black crappie assessment catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2009 (10.50 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches, but moderate compared to similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 9.25 fish/gillnet. The 2009 walleye average size was moderate to small (1.10 pounds and 13.37 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 2.38 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality (15.00 inches and larger) size walleye was low (2.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2009 assessment. Walleye growth rates for East Solomon were within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 2-8. The 2007 and 2000 year classes (fry stocked years) comprised 68% and 20% respectively of the 2009 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Walleye natural reproduction in East Solomon is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate a 2009 spring walleye fry stocking (706,799 fry). There were abundant young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (102.00 YOY/hour, 5.86 inches average length) captured in 2009. The East Solomon Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 108.76 YOY/hour and 6.67 inches respectively. Walleye fry have been stocked recently into East Solomon during 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2009. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye occurred in 2007 (563.99 YOY/hour, 5.46 inches average length) for a fry stocked year. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were low in the 2009 spring electrofishing survey (16.00 fish/hour) compared to a previous 2000 spring electrofishing survey (44.58 fish/hour, 2.33 pounds average weight). The Spicer Area lakes largemouth bass average catch rate is 47.01 fish/hour. The largemouth bass average size was moderate (2.00 pounds and 12.60 inches) from the 2009 spring electrofishing. The 2009 catch rate of preferred (15.00 inches and larger) size largemouth bass was high (8.00 fish/hour) from spring electrofishing. Largemouth bass growth rates were within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2007 and 2005 year classes comprised 31% and 25% respectively of the 2009 spring electrofishing catch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were moderate in 2009 (10.75 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches, but low compared to similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 12.85 fish/gillnet for East Solomon. The 2009 black bullhead average size was large to moderate (0.77 pounds and 10.51 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.38 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were abundant in 2009 (5.75 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 2.25 fish/gillnet for East Solomon. The 2009 carp average size was large (5.94 pounds and 22.68 inches) from gillnets. The carp historical average weight is 5.62 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on East Solomon include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the county with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The East Solomon fishery will be sampled in the 2014 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A re-survey was conducted on East Solomon Lake during late June of 2014. East Solomon is a moderate sized (658 acres), multi basin, shallow (14 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. East Solomon is part of the Hawk Creek Watershed. East Solomon is connected to a shallow aerated lake (Long Lake) via an inlet and a non-aerated lake (West Solomon Lake) via an outlet. The immediate shoreline area is composed primarily of undeveloped hardwood trees. Submergent vegetation densities are moderate to low consisting mostly of sago pondweed, clasping-leaf pondweed, Canada waterweed, curly-leaf pondweed, water moss, filamentous algae, and coontail. Emergent vegetation densities are moderate consisting of primarily hardstem bulrush, cattail species, arrowhead group, and reed canary grass. There are two large mid-water bulrush stands. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, rubble, silt, and boulder in East Solomon. Total phosphorus levels were high (0.086 ppm) on June 9, 2014. Water clarity was excellent on June 9, 2014 (secchi=9.2 feet). Water clarity usually decreases substantially by mid summer due to frequent blue-green algae blooms. Water levels were high during June and July of 2014 from inlets due to rain events, but low by fall. A slow no-wake zone was put in place for lakes in Kandiyohi and Stearns Counties during June thru early July of 2014. An extensive fish kill of black crappie occurred during the late summer/early fall of 2012. Low water levels and hot air temperatures were the norm during late summer and early fall of 2012. The black crappie kill was probably due to a combination of factors such as a bacterial disease (i.e. Columnaris) and/or low dissolved oxygen conditions. The 2012-13 winter was harsh and protracted resulting in partial winterkills on some waters. However, this was not the case for East Solomon because adequate numbers of gamefish were captured in follow up ice out test netting during 2013. East Solomon is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, bluegill, yellow perch, largemouth bass, and black crappie. East Solomon has been a popular fishing lake especially for black crappie, bluegill, walleye and quality largemouth bass in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were moderate (7.50 fish/gillnet) in 2014 and similar to the historical average (8.04 fish/gillnet). The yellow perch average size was small (0.07 pounds and 5.15 inches) from gillnets. All of the yellow captured in 2014 were from the 2013 year class.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2014 (3.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (2.04 fish/gillnet). The northern pike average size was moderate (4.87 pounds and 27.78 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 4.94 pounds from gillnets. There were abundant numbers of larger (28.00 plus inches) northern pike (1.50 fish/gillnet) in the gillnets. Northern pike growth rates are excellent. The largest northern pike captured was 35.6 inches from a gillnet in 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2014 (5.70 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (3.38 fish/trapnet), but moderate compared to similar lakes. The bluegill average size was large (0.49 pounds and 7.75 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.33 pounds from trapnets. There were abundant numbers of larger (8.00 plus inches) bluegill (3.20 fish/trapnet) in the trapnets. Bluegill growth rates are excellent. The largest bluegill captured was 10.5 inches from a trapnet in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low in 2014 (0.50 fish/trapnet). The black crappie historical catch rate is 3.78 fish/trapnet. The black crappie average size was large (0.69 pounds and 10.43 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.42 pounds from trapnets. Black crappie growth rates were moderate to excellent. The 2010 and 2009 year classes comprised all of the 2014 black crappie catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderately abundant in 2014 (11.50 fish/gillnet) and slightly above the historical average (9.63 fish/gillnet). The 2014 walleye average size was moderate to large (2.14 pounds and 17.44 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 2.34 pounds from gillnets. There were abundant numbers of moderate sized and larger (15.00 plus inches) walleye (10.50 fish/gillnet). The largest walleye captured was 28.5 inches from a trapnet in 2014. Approximately 700,000 walleye fry are stocked every other year in East Solomon. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate a 2013 spring walleye fry stocking (706,799 fry). There were abundant young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers captured in 2013 (360.00 YOY/hour, 6.26 inches average length) and 2009 (102.00 YOY/hour). Approximately 65% of the walleye captured in 2014 gillnets were from the combined 2011 (15 inches) and 2009 (19 inches) walleye year classes. Walleye growth rates were moderate to excellent. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance was low (11.47 fish/hour, 1.82 pounds average weight) in the 2014 spring electrofishing survey. The spring electrofishing historical average is 24.02 fish/hour. Previous spring electrofishing surveys were conducted in 2009 (16.00 fish/hour, 2.00 pounds average weight) and 2000 (44.58 fish/hour, 2.33 pounds average weight). Average numbers of moderate sized (12 plus inches) largemouth bass (10.59 fish/hour) were captured in the 2014 spring electrofishing survey. Largemouth bass abundance was also low in the 2014 trapnets (0.20 fish/trapnet, 4.05 pounds average weight). Largemouth bass growth rates were moderate to excellent. Local anglers often have success catching quality size largemouth bass in East Solomon. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2014 (5.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (11.63 fish/gillnet). The 2014 black bullhead average size was large (1.42 pounds and 13.35 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.56 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were abundant in 2014 (5.60 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (2.88 fish/trapnet). The 2014 carp average size was large (8.15 pounds and 25.65 inches) from trapnets. The carp historical average weight is 6.31 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on East Solomon include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the county with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The East Solomon fishery will be sampled in the 2015 for young of year walleye by fall electrofishing and 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on East Solomon Lake during late June of 2020. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nEast Solomon is a moderate sized (658 acres), multi basin, shallow (14 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. East Solomon is part of the Hawk Creek Watershed. East Solomon is connected to a shallow aerated lake (Long Lake) via an inlet and a shallow non-aerated lake (West Solomon Lake) via an outlet. The immediate shoreline area is composed primarily of undeveloped hardwood trees. Aquatic vegetation densities are moderate to low consisting mostly of sago pondweed, clasping-leaf pondweed, Canada waterweed, curly-leaf pondweed, water moss, filamentous algae, and coontail. Emergent vegetation densities are moderate consisting of primarily hardstem bulrush, cattail species, arrowhead group, and reed canary grass. There are two large mid-water bulrush stands. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, rubble, silt, and boulder in East Solomon. Total phosphorus levels were high (0.086 ppm) on June 9, 2014. Water clarity was fair on July 6, 2020 (secchi=3.7 feet). Water clarity usually decreases substantially by mid-summer due to blue-green algae blooms. Water levels were low during 2020. Low winter oxygen levels were documented during February of 2019 despite the operation of the aeration system, but no winterkill was noted. An extensive fish kill of Black Crappie occurred during the late summer/early fall of 2012. Low water levels and hot air temperatures were the norm during the late summer and early fall of 2012. The Black Crappie kill was probably due to a combination of factors such as a bacterial disease (i.e. Columnaris) and/or low dissolved oxygen conditions. The 2012-13 winter was harsh and protracted resulting in partial winterkills on some waters. However, this was not the case for East Solomon because adequate numbers of gamefish were captured in follow up ice out test netting during 2013. East Solomon is managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie. East Solomon has been a popular fishing lake especially for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Walleye and quality Largemouth Bass. Walleye fishing has been relatively poor on East Solomon during recent years. <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were abundant (14.70 fish/trapnet), but the average size was small (0.07 pounds and 4.95 inches) in 2020. The Black Crappie historical catch rate is 5.34 fish/trapnet. Abundant numbers of small sized Black Crappie were also present in the 2020 gillnets (10.33 fish/gillnet). The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.33 pounds from trapnets. Black Crappie growth rates were excellent for ages 1-3. The 2019 year class comprised 96% of the 2020 Black Crappie catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2020 (51.90 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill historical catch rate is 10.31 fish/trapnet. The 2020 Bluegill average size was small (0.13 pounds and 5.34 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.30 pounds from trapnets. The largest Bluegill captured was 8.98 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass spring electrofishing survey was not conducted in 2020. Largemouth Bass abundance was low (11.47 fish/hour, 1.82 pounds average weight) in the previous 2014 spring electrofishing survey. Largemouth Bass numbers were abundant in the 2020 trapnets (2.60 fish/trapnet). The 2020 Largemouth Bass average size was small (0.68 pounds and 7.78 inches) from trapnets. A 20.87 inch Largemouth Bass was captured in the 2020 trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were abundant in 2020 (8.33 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike historical catch rate is 2.94 fish/gillnet. The 2020 Northern Pike average size was small (2.34 pounds and 21.45 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 4.51 pounds from gillnets. The largest Northern Pike captured was 36.22 inches in the 2020 survey. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for East Solomon in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2020 (5.00 fish/gillnet). The Walleye historical catch rate is 8.96 fish/gillnet. The 2020 Walleye average size was large (3.72 pounds and 21.76 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 2.57 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were excellent for ages 1-6. The 2015 and 2013 year classes (fry stocked years) comprised 44% and 17% respectively of the 2020 Walleye catch. Walleye natural reproduction in East Solomon is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nFall electrofishing surveys have been conducted to evaluate Walleye fry stockings in East Solomon. Walleye fry have been stocked (500,000-1,200,000 fish per stocking) recently into East Solomon during 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017-2019. Moderate young of year \"YOY\" Walleye numbers (48.00 YOY/hour, 6.84 inches) were captured in the most recent 2019 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye were absent in 2018 and 2017 fall electrofishing surveys. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (49.09 YOY/hour, 5.23 inches) were captured in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (360.00 YOY/hour, 6.26 inches) were captured in 2013 fall electrofishing survey. The East Solomon Lake fall electrofishing Walleye historical average catch rate and length are 102.57 YOY/hour and 6.52 inches respectively.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were abundant in 2020 (24.00 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 10.32 fish/gillnet. The 2020 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.11 pounds and 6.17 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight was 0.15 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were moderate in 2020 (17.67 fish/gillnet). The Black Bullhead historical average catch rate is 12.49 fish/gillnet for East Solomon. The 2020 Black Bullhead average size was large (1.19 pounds and 12.32 inches) from gillnets. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.65 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers were low in 2020 (0.70 fish/trapnet). The Common Carp historical average catch rate is 2.57 fish/trapnet for East Solomon. The 2020 Common Carp average size was large (10.13 pounds and 27.76 inches) from trapnets. The Common Carp historical average weight is 6.94 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on East Solomon include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the county with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The East Solomon fishery will be sampled in the 2025 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",
