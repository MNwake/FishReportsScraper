                "narrative": "<p>Barrett Lake is a 544-acre basin located on the Pomme De Terre River near the town of Barrett in Grant County.  The river transports excessive nutrients and sediment from its large and predominately agriculture watershed.  Water quality and clarity in Barrett Lake are strongly influenced by river flows and climatic conditions.  The lake is susceptible to intense algal blooms during summer months.  Hot weather, calm winds, and low flow conditions in the river tend to trigger these algal blooms.Barrett Lake can be a popular spot for walleye anglers.  Gill net catches normally exceed the expected range for this type of lake.  Natural reproduction has resulted in strong year classes of walleye in Barrett Lake, as well as other lakes along the Pomme De Terre River. Walleye fry and fingerlings are stocked to supplement the walleye population.  Bluegill abundance has increased in recent years and could provide additional angling opportunities.  Most of the fish captured in test nets were 6 inches in length or less.  However, these fish are experiencing rapid growth rates and may provide quality angling in the near future.  Several large black crappie were also captured in test nets.  The Department of Natural Resources installed an 84 foot handicapped accessible fishing pier on Barrett Lake in the City Park Pavilion.  The park and fishing pier are maintained by the City of Barrett.  Anglers have reported good catches of bluegill and crappie from the pier.  Log cribs filled with christmas trees were placed within casting distance of the pier in 2000 to attract fish and increase angling success.  A local Eagle Scout completed the project.  The city park was also the site of a shoreline restoration project in 2000.  The Barrett Lake Improvement Association, City of Barrett, Grant County Water Plan, and Department of Natural Resources combined to replace the existing turf grass with native grasses, flowers, and shrubs.  Hardstem bulrush was planted in shallow water along the shoreline to provide wave protection and fish habitat.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Barrett Lake is a 544-acre basin located on the Pomme de Terre River near the town of Barrett in Grant County. The river transports excessive nutrients and sediment from its large and predominately agricultural watershed. Water quality is strongly influenced by river flow and climatic conditions. The lake is susceptible to intense algal blooms during summer months. Hot weather, calm winds, and low flow can trigger intense algae blooms. Curly-leaf pondweed die-off may exacerbate these conditions. Water clarity at time of the 2007 survey was 2.5 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches during the 2007 survey were much higher than typical for similar lakes.  Gillnet catches averaged 13.7 fish/net.  A high proportion of the total walleye catch was made up of 11-year-old fish.  These large fish stemmed from exceptional natural reproduction throughout those basins on the Pomme de Terre River in 1996. Two-year-old walleye produced in 2005 were also prevalent in the population sample.  These fish will reach a harvestable-size in 2008.  Cohorts of the strong 2005 year class may be the product of natural reproduction or a fry stocking.  Eight other age groups were represented in the population sample.  Walleye size structure was atypical due to the presence of old fish.  Forty-three percent of walleye measured exceeded 20 inches in length. Mean weight was 2.5 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches averaged 6.8 fish/gill net.  Fishing quality in terms of average size caught can be described as good.  Two-thirds of the pike measured exceeding 21 inches. The largest northern pike captured exceeded 35 inches. Mean weight of northern pike was 2.8 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nSeasonally poor water clarity and limited vegetation limit abundance of largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish.  Lack of nursery and escape cover exposes young sunfish to excessive predation and limits survival.  Bluegill catches averaged 2.2 fish/trapnet. Average size of bluegill caught in gillnets was 0.3 pounds.  Largemouth bass catches was also limited.   Electrofishing efforts yielded only 10.3 bass/hour.  Average weight was 1.0 pound.   <br> \n <br> \nBarrett Lake supports a modest crappie fishery.  Black crappie catches averaged 5.8 fish/gillnet, which is within the range of normal catches for similar lakes.  No white crappie were observed.  The population sample was predominately comprised of one- and two-year-old fish.  The two-year-old individuals were approaching 9.0 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch proved to be moderately abundant, but the population had little fishery value.  Very few caught were larger than 8.0 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Department of Natural Resources installed an 84-foot handicapped accessible fishing pier on Barrett Lake near the City Park Pavilion. The park and fishing pier are maintained by the City of Barrett. Anglers have reported good catches of bluegill and crappie from the pier. The Department of Natural Resources, Grant County and the City of Barrett also restructured the outlet to Barrett Lake. A fish ladder was constructed by strategically placing boulders to create slack water areas. Fish are now free to move through the river from the dam at Morris to the outlet of Pomme de Terre Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Barrett Lake is a 544-acre basin located on the Pomme de Terre River near the town of Barrett in Grant County. The lake is subject to excessive nutrient loading and sediment delivery from the river and its large, predominantly agricultural watershed.  Water quality is strongly influenced by river flow and climatic conditions.  Hot weather, calm winds, and low flow can trigger intense algae blooms.  Die-offs of curly-leaf pondweed can exacerbate these conditions.  Water clarity at time of the 2011 survey was 3.2 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches during the 2011 survey were much higher than typical for similar lakes.  Gillnet catches averaged 26.8 fish/net.   The catch was generally comprised of 2- and 3-year-old fish from fry stocking and natural recruitment.   These 2- and 3-year old fish were approximately 12.0 and 16.0 inches in length.  Walleye grow fast in Barrett Lake.  Older fish captured during the survey averaged 18.8 inches at age 4.   There is also a high probability of catching large walleye.   Nearly 14% of captures in gillnets exceeded 20.0 inches.  Five memorable-size walleye exceeding 25.0 inches in total length were measured. <br> \n <br> \nBarrett Lake supports a moderately abundant northern pike population.  Fishing quality is reasonably good fishery due to size distribution of the population.   Gillnet captures ranged from 16.0 to 35.0 inches in length.  Seventeen percent of captures exceeded 28.0 inches in total length.  These large pike likely migrate throughout the river during the spawning period.  <br> \n  <br> \nBoth white and black crappie coexist in Barrett Lake.  Black crappie catches exceeded those of white crappie.  Some hybrid crappie also exist.  Abundance varies greatly due to inconsistent annual reproductive success and recruitment into the fishery.  Neither population could be described as abundant in 2011.   Even though crappie were not abundant, size distribution of the trapnet catch proved exceptional.    Forty-two percent of black crappie captured were 10.0 inches or larger.  Four captures exceeded 12.0 inches in total length.  One trophy-size crappie measuring 15.2 inches was recorded in the catch. <br> \n  <br> \nSeasonally poor water clarity and sparse aquatic vegetation limit abundance of largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish.  Lack of nursery and escape cover exposes young sunfish to predation and limits survival.   Only three largemouth bass were captured during the spring electrofishing survey.  The twelve bluegills caught in trapnets ranged from 3.0 to 7.7 inches.  Sunfishes can grow large, but until habitat conditions are more suitable, they are best described as a bonus catch. <br> \n <br> \nThe Department of Natural Resources installed an 84-foot handicapped accessible fishing pier on Barrett Lake near the City Park Pavilion. The park and fishing pier are maintained by the City of Barrett.  Anglers have reported catches of bluegill, crappie, and walleye from the pier. The Department of Natural Resources, Grant County and the City of Barrett also restructured the outlet of Barrett Lake. A fish ladder was constructed by strategically placing boulders to create slack water areas. Fish are now free to migrate into Barrett Lake from downstream waters. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Barrett Lake is a 530-acre impoundment of the Pomme de Terre River.  The earliest available records of dam construction date back to 1936. The City of Barrett developed along the west and south shorelines.  Maximum depth of the lake is 28.0 feet. Average depth is estimated at 8.5 feet.  Water quality measurements describe Barrett Lake as eutrophic. The Pomme de Terre River carries sediments and nutrients from an expansive, well drained, and largely cultivated watershed area extending well north into Otter Tail County. Algae blooms and suspended sediments impair water clarity during summer months. Water transparency at the time of the late-July fish survey measured 3.0 feet. Poor water clarity limits diversity and distribution of submergent plants. Primary management efforts on Barrett Lake are directed towards Walleye. Natural reproduction sustains this fishery but Walleye fry are stocked every other year to supplement the population. <br> \n <br> \nA fisheries survey was completed on Barrett Lake, July 31 through August 3, 2023. A combination of six gill nets and eight trap nets were used to sample the fish community. Netting was preceded by electrofishing on May 31 to gain estimates of Largemouth Bass abundance and population size structure.  Walleye catch rates (24.5 fish/gill net) were high during the 2023 survey. Lengths of those Walleye ranged from 9.8-28.3 inches but averaged only 13.8 inches. Most of the Walleye in the system at the time of the survey were younger fish. Survival of young Walleye has been above average recently and multiple year classes were present from stocked and non-stocked years. Walleye fry are stocked in odd-numbered years to supplement natural reproduction, but in the last several surveys, it appears naturally produced fish may make up a majority of this population. Walleye grow fast in Barrett Lake, reaching 15 inches around age 3, so the small fish will quickly grow to harvestable sizes. Walleye fishing is expected to be very good for at least the next several years. Northern Pike abundance was moderate for Barrett Lake. Average size was 22.2 inches and the largest pike observed was 31.3 inches. Barrett Lake also supports both Black and White Crappie. Black Crappie are more common than White Crappie. Many of the Black Crappie caught in this survey were large, average length was 10.1 inches and the largest crappie was 13.4 inches. Bluegill catch rates were low, but some large fish over 9 inches were sampled. Spring electrofishing efforts caught only a few Largemouth Bass. Low water made electrofishing difficult and habitat conditions are less than ideal for bass. Only 10 Largemouth Bass were observed. Yellow Perch abundance was also low for Barrett Lake. Perch occasionally get large enough to keep, but the few observed in this survey averaged 6.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAbundance of most underutilized species declined from the previous survey. Abundance of Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, and White Sucker was lower than previous surveys. Freshwater Drum is one species that has been increasing. First recorded in the 2017 survey, they are now increasing in abundance. Freshwater Drum are native to the Pomme de Terre River system, but have only recently been recorded in lakes above Crissy Dam in Morris, MN. They are thought to have expanded above Crissy Dam in 2012 during flood conditions.  <br> \n <br> \nBarrett Lake was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2018. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Water quality measurements describe Barrett Lake as eutrophic.  The Pomme de Terre River carries sediments and nutrients from an expansive, well drained, and largely cultivated watershed area extending well north into Otter Tail County.  Algae blooms and suspended sediments impair water clarity during summer months.  Water transparency at time of the late-July fish survey measured 4.0 feet.  Poor water clarity limits diversity and distribution of submergent plants. <br> \n <br> \nA standard fish survey was completed in 2017 to gain updated estimates of abundance and size structure of gamefish populations.  Survey protocol included an electrofishing survey completed on May 24 to sample Largemouth Bass.  A netting survey utilizing trap nets and gill nets was conducted July 31 through August 3 to assess other gamefish populations. <br> \n  <br> \nWalleyes are well adapted to existing habitat conditions and are moderately abundant, particularly when compared to similar lakes.  Gill net catches did decrease from the exceptionally high catch rate that occurred in 2011, but through the contributions of natural reproduction and fry stockings during odd-numbered years, the gill net catches averaged 8.3 Walleyes/net and the catch was made up of 10 age classes (ages 2-12).  Size of captures ranged from 12.4 to 28.4 inches.  Average length at capture was 18.2 inches.  Nearly half of the Walleye catch was made up of three-year-old fish.  These young fish were growing fast and averaged 16.0 inches when captured in late-July. <br> \n   <br> \nThe Northern Pike population has expanded.  The gill net catch rate of 10.3 pike/net was the highest catch rate recorded among surveys.  Pike catches averaged 24.1 inches in length.  The population can offer fair to good quality fishing experiences.  Nine captures exceeded 28.0 inches in length.  The largest measured was 31.5 inches.  Fish exceeding 34.0 inches have been captured during prior surveys. <br> \n <br> \nBarrett Lake supports both Black Crappie and White Crappie populations.  Black Crappies are more abundant than White Crappies.  Some hybridization is also likely.  A modest increase in Black Crappie catches occurred in 2017 with enhanced success of spawning and survival of young crappies in 2014 and 2015.  Five age groups were represented in the Black Crappie catch.  Two- and three-year-old fish made up 80% of the fish that were aged.  Mean length of Black Crappie captures in trap nets was 8.3 inches.  Fishing quality will improve as these young fish grow to exceed 10.0 inches.  Many of the three-year-olds, cohorts of the 2014 year class, should approach 10.0 inches early in 2018.  The largest crappie capture was a White Crappie measuring 12.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Bluegill population densities have been modest and variable in response to habitat limitations such as water level fluctuations during the spring spawning season, seasonally poor water clarity, and limited distribution and diversity of aquatic plants.  Largemouth Bass catches during the spring electrofishing survey were greater than anticipated due to the addition of many two- and three-year-olds to the population.  These young fish made up over 80% of total bass captures.  The largest bass capture measured 14.3 inches.  With the high proportion of young fish and few older, larger fish in the population sample, average size of bass captures was 7.4 inches.  Bluegill catches also increased due to enhanced reproductive success and survival of young fish in 2014 and 2015.  Age distribution of Bluegill captures only extended to age 5.  Similar to Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass catches, the majority of Bluegill captures were three-years-old or younger. <br> \n   <br> \nYellow Perch are abundant, yet few grow large enough to harvest.  This population is important prey supporting Walleye and Northern Pike abundance and growth. <br> \n   <br> \nBlack Bullheads are abundant and many are large enough to support harvest.  The largest bullhead capture measured 14.9 inches.  Other underutilized or unique fishes captured included Bigmouth Buffalo, Longnose Gar, Shorthead Redhorse, White Sucker, and Common Carp.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Barrett Lake is a 544-acre basin located on the Pomme de Terre River near the town of Barrett in Grant County.  The river transports excessive nutrients and sediment from its large and predominately agricultural watershed.  Water quality and clarity in Barrett Lake are strongly influenced by river flows and climatic conditions.  The lake is susceptible to intense algal blooms during summer months.  Hot weather, calm winds, and low flow conditions in the river tend to trigger these algal blooms.  Secchi clarity during the 2005 survey was 4.5 feet.Barrett Lake can be a popular destination for walleye anglers.  Gillnet catches normally exceed the expected range for this type of lake.  An average catch of 8.0 fish/net was recorded in 2005.  Natural reproduction has resulted in strong year classes of walleye in Barrett Lake, as well as other lakes along the Pomme de Terre River.  Walleye fry and fingerlings are stocked to supplement the walleye population.  Walleye size structure is favorable.  Sampled walleye averaged 21.4 inches and the largest fish measured 28.4 inches.  Mean weight of sampled walleye was 3.7 pounds.Northern pike abundance has increased.  Gillnet catches averaged 6.2 fish/net in 2005.  Sampled fish averaged 24.9 inches.  The largest fish measured 33.2 inches.  Mean weight of sampled northern pike was 3.4 pounds.Bluegill abundance continues to increase in recent years.  Trapnet catches averaged 36.2 fish/net in 2005.  Most fish captured in test nets were 6.0 inches in length or less.  However, these fish grow rapidly and may provide quality angling in the near future.  Several large black crappie were also captured in test nets.The Department of Natural Resources installed an 84-foot handicapped accessible fishing pier on Barrett Lake in the City Park Pavilion.  The park and fishing pier are maintained by the City of Barrett.  Anglers have reported good catches of bluegill and crappie from the pier.  Log cribs filled with christmas trees were placed within casting distance of the pier in 2000 to attract fish and increase angling success.  The city park was also the site of a shoreline restoration project in 2000.  The Barrett Lake Association, City of Barrett, Grant County Water Plan, and DNR combined to replace existing turf grass with native grasses, flowers and shrubs.  </p>",

The one and two year olds dominate the walleye population and because of this, the average size is small. Northern pike are low in numbers (similar to past surveys). The low numbers may be a result of Barrett Lake being on a river system and the northern pike migrating upstream. Yellow perch are abundant and should provide an excellent forage base for the walleyes. The bluegills stocked in 1981 and 1982 have grown and should now be providing an excellent bluegill fishery. Very few small bluegills were seen in the nets, suggesting limited reproduction. Black and white crappies were also present. The bullheads are of a quality size and should be utilized by anglers or commercial fishermen.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catch rates have been declining since the 1980 survey. Eighteen walleye were captured per gillnet set in the 1980 assessment while a catch rate of 4.80 fish/gillnet set was recorded in 1989. Mean size of walleye captured increased from 1.35lbs in 1980 to 1.6lbs/in 1989. The percentage of preferred-size increased from 0.0 percent in the 1975 survey to 17.0 percent in 1989. This would suggest a shift in size-distribution from large numbers of small walleye to a less abundant population with a greater range in length frequency distribution and larger individuals. Both fry and fingerling stockings have been successful in producing a year class. Growth rates appear to be slower than morphometry and fertility of the lake would suggest is possible. Four year old walleyes averaged 15.5 inches in total length. Yellow perch catch rates decreased significantly from the 1985 survey, but were similar to CPUE values recorded in 1975 and 1980. Most are too small to provide a sport fishery. Despite a moderate abundance of forage-size yellow perch, northern pike numbers remains low suggesting recruitment or lack or suitable spawning habitat is probably a limiting factor in abundance. A strong year class of largemouth bass was established in 1986. Eighty-four percent of the bass captured came from this year class. Growth rates are excellent. Fish measured 12.3 came from this year class. Growth rates are excellent. Fish measured 12.3 inches in total length in three growing seasons. Crappie catch rates have fluctuated considerably from survey to survey. Netting records indicate some instability in crappie populations. Numbers of black crappie captured in 1989 increased from CPUE values recorded in previous surveys; however, fewer white crappie were caught. A large length group of 8.0-10.0 inch black crappie were captured in the 1989 assessment. These fish should recruit to the angler's creel in 1990. Ninety-seven percent of crappie captured measured 8.0 inches in total length or larger. Bluegills were stocked in 1981 and 1985 because none were observed during the 1980 assessment. The stockings appear to have been successful in re-establishing or at least augmenting the existing population. The average size of bluegill captured decreased in comparison to those caught in 1985; however, there are adequate numbers of large bluegills in Barrett Lake to provide quality angling opportunities. Black and brown bullhead are numerous, but too small to have any sport or commercial value. Yellow bullhead may be large enough to have commercial value. Carp catches were relatively high and most are large enough to have commercial value.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting June 26, 2017. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with two sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample ten sites and soft sediments with abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 27 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and four species that are tolerant of disturbance (Bigmouth Buffalo, Fathead Minnow, Green Sunfish, and Orangespotted Sunfish). The high number of species collected is likely influenced by the Pomme de Terre River flowing through this lake.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Barrett Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar shallow lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pomme de Terre River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Barrett lake is a relatively shallow and windswept basin on the Pomme De Terre River.  Excessivenutrient and sediment loading from the river as well as wind driven resuspension of nutrients andsediment results in poor water quality and clarity.  Accordingly, the abundance and diversity ofaquatic plants in Barrett Lake is limited.   Walleye gillnet catches averaged 48.5 fish/net in 1995.   Gillnet catches ranged from 4.8 - 18.0fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1980.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.0 pounds. Approximately 75% of the walleye were 15 inches or less.  The elevated gillnet catches are a result oftwo extraordinary year classes in 1994 and 1993.  Age-1 and age-2 fish comprised 49% and 33%,respectively, of the walleye captured in gillnets.  The age-1 fish correspond to a walleye fry stockingin 1994, while the age-2 fish correspond to a year of no stocking.   Northern pike catches averaged 2.0fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have been low in past years, ranging from 0.0 - 2.0 in previous surveysdating back to 1980.  Yellow perch gillnet catches averaged 3.8 fish/net compared to 92.5 fish/net in1991.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.  The decrease in abundance is likely a result ofincreased walleye biomass.  Bluegill catches averaged 0.2 fish/trapnet.  Trapnet catches averaged 8.0,4.6, and 6.6 fish/net in 1991, 1989 and 1985, respectively.  Adult bluegill were stocked in 1993 tosupplement the population, however trapnet catches still declined.  Black crappie catches averaged 0.7fish/net and two white crappie were captured in the gillnets.  No largemouth bass were captured inapproximately one hour of daytime, DC electrofishing.  One largemouth bass measuring 17.8 inches intotal length and weighing 3.4 pounds was captured in a trapnet.            </p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 14 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Barrett Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Pomme de Terre River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nTwenty-one species were collected during this survey.  Three species (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Logperch) were considered \"intolerant\" and three species (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Fathead Minnow) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes. \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Barrett Lake.</p>",
