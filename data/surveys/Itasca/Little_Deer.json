                "narrative": "<p>Little Deer Lake is a 67-acre lake in Itasca County within the Mississippi River watershed.  Little Deer Lake is located 4 miles northeast of Deer River, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 39 ft and 39 littoral acres.  There is a carry-in access on the southeast shore.   The northern pike gill-net catch was 13.0/net, higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 4.0 to 12.0/net.  Fish varied in length from 13 to 26 inches, however, only five fish were greater than 24 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching 24 inches by age 5.  The bluegill trap-net catch was 29.4/net, within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 4.3 to 38.5/net.  Size structure was good with fish over 8 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching 8 inches by age 7.  The black crappie trap-net catch was 0.8/net, similar to the lower end of the expected range.  Catch rates in past assessments have generally been low, varying from 0.3 to 2.5/net.  Size structure was good with fish up to 11.5 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching 10 inches by age 5.  No yellow perch were sampled in this assessment.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0.3 to 26.0/net.  There appears to be an inverse relationship between northern pike and yellow perch, when northern pike abundance was high, yellow perch abundance was low.  Two largemouth bass were sampled, one from each gear type.  The two fish were 13 and 16 inches.  Other species include bowfin, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass.    In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment, which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Deer Lake is a 67 acre lake located 8 miles northeast of Deer River, MN.  Little Deer Lake is relatively deep for its small size and has a maximum depth of 39 feet.  The lake does not have a defined inlet but has one outlet flowing into Deer Lake.  At times, the culvert at the outlet can be plugged with debris that could prevent fish migration.  Little Deer Lake has good water quality.  Water transparency readings have varied from 9.0 to 17.0 feet in DNR assessments from 1978 to 2018.   <br> \n <br> \nLittle Deer Lake supports warmwater and coolwater fish communities.  The lake is best suited for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie.  Largemouth Bass are present, but have not been sampled well enough to characterize the population.  Other species sampled include Bowfin, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, shiner spp., White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in 2018 to determine the status of the fish community.  This survey consisted of 3 gill net and 9 trap net sets.   <br> \n <br> \nSimilar lakes produce a wide range of catch rates for Bluegill.  In 2018, the trap net catch rate was typical compared to similar lakes, but below average for Little Deer Lake.  Lower Bluegill catches are often desirable, however.  Growth is slow and size quality is poor if Bluegill are overly abundant.  Bluegill size structure has been good in the past and remained favorable in 2018. Bluegill ranged from 3.3 to 9.3 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  Age and growth analysis identified 9 year classes but year class strength varied, suggesting inconsistent production.  A strong 2012 year class made up 44% of the sample.  Fish averaged 6.4 years old, suggesting low adult mortality.  Growth was average compared to similar lakes, with fish growing to 8 inches in 7 years.  Lakes with quality Bluegill are vulnerable to overharvest of large fish resulting in size quality decline.  Anglers are encouraged to voluntarily limit their harvest of Bluegill over 8 inches to maintain a quality fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nIn general, Black Crappie catch rates have remained low after the initial survey in 1978.  Too few crappie were captured in 2018 to characterize the fishery.  Crappie populations in northern Minnesota often display inconsistent recruitment, resulting in \"boom and bust\" fisheries. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch rates increased from 1978 to 2003, and the catch was high compared to similar lakes.  High pike densities are undesirable, however. High pike numbers are often undesirable, however.  Growth is slow and size quality is typically poor when pike occur in high numbers.  High pike numbers may also limit production of other gamefish.  The catch rate was more typical for the lake type in 2018.  Size quality remained poor, despite the apparent reduction in numbers.  Pike ranged from 14.7 to 27.8 inches and averaged only 17.9 inches.  Only three year classes were present and most fish belonged to the 2015 year class, suggesting inconsistent recruitment in recent years.  Growth was near the statewide average and pike achieved 22 inches by age 4.  It appears that variable recruitment has a strong influence on numbers and size quality in Little Deer.  Quality may improve in the near future, as individuals from the 2015 year class grow to larger size.  Pike management changed in 2018 when the north central pike zone regulation was implemented.  This regulation requires anglers to release pike from 22-26 inches, but allows increased harvest of small pike by allowing a 10 fish bag limit.  Only two pike exceeding 26 inches may be in possession (note-regulations for spearing differ, please consult the fishing regulations synopsis for more information).  It is hoped that this regulation will result in improved size quality of pike. <br> \n <br> \nInvasive species are species that are not native to Minnesota and cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health.  Little Deer Lake is not known to contain any invasive species.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
