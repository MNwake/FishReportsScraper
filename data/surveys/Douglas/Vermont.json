Gillnet catcheshave been significantly higher in previous years, ranging from 14.0 - 23.0 fish/net in surveys datingback to 1979.  The size structure of the northern pike population has not changed despite the apparentdecrease in abundance.    Mean weight of fish captured was 1.8 pounds.  Daytime, DC electrofishingyielded 23.0 stock-size largemouth bass per hour.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.1 pounds. Approximately one-half of the fish sampled were between 12 and 16 inches in total length.  Bluegilltrapnet catches averaged 41.6 fish/net which is similar to the catch rate of 51.0 fish/net recorded in1989.  Trapnet catches averaged 111.2 fish/net in 1984 and 233.0 fish/net in 1979.  The normal rangeof mean catch rates for similar lake types is 5.6 to 42.3 fish/trapnet.  Forty percent of the bluegillcaptured were 6.0 inches in length or greater, however no fish exceeded 8.0 inches.  Yellow perchcatches averaged 6.0 fish/gillnet in 1994 after being absent from gillnets in 1989.  Gillnet catchesaveraged 12.2 fish/net in 1984 and 4.0 fish/net in 1979.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1994 was 0.1pounds.  Black crappie trapnet catches averaged 0.4 fish/net.  Catches have ranged from 1.3 to 3.8fish/trapnet in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  The normal range of mean catch rates for similarlakes is 0.7 - 3.2 fish/trapnet.  Five walleye were captured in gillnets which equates to a catch rateof 0.6 fish/net.  These fish were between 19.0 and 25.0 inches in total length.  Mean weight of fishcaptured was 3.9 pounds.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Vermont Lake is a 307-acre, clear water lake located in northern Douglas County.  Maximum depth is 59.0 feet.  Average depth is estimated at 12.0 feet.  While the lake is relatively small and has relatively low water fertility, the lake has significant bottom relief and a diverse mix of fish habitat along its irregularly shaped shoreline and many bay areas.  Water transparency averages 15.0 feet during summer months.  Aquatic vegetation can be found growing as deep as 20.0 feet, thus most of the lake area less than 15.0 feet in depth supports aquatic plant life.  The lake becomes thermally stratified during summer months.  A thermocline was noted near 36.0 feet at the time of the late-June survey.  Dissolved oxygen levels below the thermocline were too low to support sport fish species.    <br> \n <br> \nPhysical and biological attributes of the lake are most characteristic of \"bass-panfish\" lakes.  Largemouth Bass and Bluegill are abundant or even overly abundant.  Due to elevated population densities, growth rates are slow.  Even though life spans of these gamefish can extend beyond age 10, anglers can anticipate high catches of small- and medium-size fish.  Bass captures in 2014 ranged from 5.2 to 16.4 inches in length and averaged 10.4 inches.  Bluegill catches averaged 6.0 inches.  Size structure of the catch in 2014 was better than that of past surveys.  Twelve percent of captures in trapnets exceeded 8.0 inches.  The largest Bluegill capture measured 9.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are also abundant in Vermont Lake.  Pike catch rates during 2008 and 2014 surveys have exceeded expectations for lakes of similar habitat attributes.  Gillnet catches during the 2014 survey averaged 14.2 fish/net.  Average size of captures was 17.0 inches.  The largest pike caught measured 31.9 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLake Vermont supported low-density populations of Black Crappie and Walleye at time of the 2014 survey.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked, but early survival and recruitment of young Walleye into the fishery has been poor.  Annual recruitment of young Black Crappie has also been irregular.  Six Black Crappie and seven Walleye were captured during the 2014 survey.  The largest Walleye captured measured 21.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nGeneralist anglers should take advantage of a harvestable surplus of Yellow Bullheads.  This under-utilized fish is moderately abundant.  Twelve-inch captures were common during the survey.  <br> \n <br> \nProductivity of the fishery is diminished due to limited fertility of the lake and a predator/prey imbalance.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small- and moderate-sized Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill to reduce abundances and improve growth rates of remaining individuals.  Harvest of numerous small Northern Pike may also improve success of Walleye stockings. <br> \n <br> \nLake Vermont does not currently support any of the most common invasive plant (Eurasian watermilfoil) or animal species (Common Carp, zebra mussels).  Anglers are encouraged to drain water from boats and gear to minimize the risk of introducing these invasive species into this unique lake. <br> \n <br> \nOne public access is located on the east side of Lake Vermont.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Vermont is located seven miles northwest of Miltona.  This moderately developed lake has maintained good water quality and clarity.  Secchi disk transparency was 13.5 feet at the end of June.  The lake supports an  abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Emergent vegetation is common in protected bays and in the shallow, flat area along the southwest shore.  Submergent vegetation is plentiful around the entire lake and forms a well-defined weedline at 13 feet.  Aquatic vegetation is a vital component of the lake ecosystem.  It helps to maintain good water quality by competing with nuisance algae for available nutrients in the lake.  Aquatic plants also provide critical spawning andnursery habitat for fish.Lake Vermont can provide good angling opportunities.  Northern pike are abundant, but averaged  only about 17 inches in length.  The largest fish captured during the lake survey was almost 29 inches in length.  Bluegill are also abundant,  but average size also tends to be small.  Most of the fish sampled were between 4 and 7 inches in length.  Larger fish are present,  but they may be difficult to locate.Largemouth bass can provide quality angling opportunities.  They are relatively abundant and over one-third of the fish sampled were between 15 and 20 inches in length.  Anglers fish boat docks around the lake as well as a sunken stump field on the southwest side.  Pitching jigs and plastic worms can be very productive.   A largemouth bass measuring over 22 inches was captured through the ice in 1999.  This fish was only five ounces shy of the current state record. Walleye fingerlings were first stocked in 1997 to provide a bonus fishing opportunity on Vermont Lake.  There were no walleye captured during the lake survey in 1999.  The Lake Management Plan prescribes fingerling stocking in one of every three years.  Thus, future stockings will occur in 2000, 2003, and 2006.  </p>",

Mean size of the Bluegill increased to 0.26 lb. Size structure has shifted to comprise a greater percentage of quality size fish. PSD values increased from approximately 50.0 percent to 92.0 percent in the 1989 survey. Very few preferred size fish were captured. Growth is very slow. Age 6 fish averaged 6.6 inches long. No age 4 Bluegill were sampled and very few age 2 or 3 were captured. Growth rates of the age 2 and 3 Bluegill would appear to be faster. The apparent failure of several year classes may have been beneficial towards improving the quality of this fishery. Northern Pike relative abundance continues to be quite high as demonstrated by a catch rate of 14.50 fish/gillnet. Mean weight of the Northern Pike sampled was 1.78 lbs.  PSD was calculated at 23.0 percent. Growth rates of the Northern Pike are slow. Age 3 Northern Pike averaged 17.4 inches in total length. Length frequency information indicates Northern Pike are capable of obtaining a desirable size. Largemouth Bass were not adequately sampled. However, angler observations suggest a good population of Largemouth Bass. Black Crappie were captured but numbers recorded may not be indicative of population density. Catch rate averaged 1.25 fish/trap net. No quality size fish were captured. The 1966 assessment indicated White Crappie were present. It is possible there may have been an error in identification. No Black or Brown bullhead were netted during the survey. Yellow Perch abundance had been 12.2 fish/gill net in the 1984 assessment. None were captured in the 1989 assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted in spring 2022 to assess the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  This was the first targeted spring panfish survey on Lake Vermont and will be used as a baseline to evaluate the effects of the new Quality Sunfish Initiative (QSI) regulation.  On March 1, 2022, a special regulation was implemented that reduced the daily limit of sunfish from 20 to 10.  The goal of the new regulation is to maintain or increase the average size of Bluegill.  This survey also offered the opportunity to sample larger Black Crappie, which can be difficult to sample in standard summer surveys. <br> \n <br> \nLake Vermont supports a quality Bluegill and Black Crappie fishery.  Survey results suggest both populations exhibited moderate abundance and good size structure.  Almost 55% of Bluegill sampled exceeded 8 inches and almost 29% of Black Crappie sampled exceeded 10 inches.  The largest fish measured was just over 10 inches for Bluegill and almost 12 inches for Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish anglers fishing Lake Vermont are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of this fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help maintain fish community balance as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore and littoral fish species in Vermont Lake was conducted beginning on June 22nd, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions (soft sediment and deep water) prevented the use of seines at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted the week of June 22nd, 2021 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and biomass. Bluegill count per net was between the 50th and 75th quartile, while the Bluegill mean weight was above the 75th quartile for similar Lake Class 25 lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish, Fathead Minnows, and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Vermont is a 337-acre, low fertility lake located approximately 15 miles north of Alexandria in Douglas County.  Mean and maximum depths are 12 and 59 feet, respectively.  Approximately 65% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep and these shallow areas support abundant aquatic plant growth.  Water quality and clarity are good.  Water transparency often exceeds 15 feet during summer months.  Much of Lake Vermont's shoreline is undeveloped.  To help protect sensitive shoreline habitat, a no-wake zone is located along the narrows area that separates the north and south basins.  A concrete public access is located on the eastern shoreline off Vermont Access Road NE.    \n\nA standard fisheries survey was completed during summer 2020 to provide updated information on the fish community of Lake Vermont.  Standard survey components typically include spring electrofishing, gill nets, and trap nets.  However, due to safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, gill nets were the only component used in 2020.   \n\nLake Vermont supports abundant populations of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike.  Black Crappie and Yellow Perch are less abundant but offer quality panfishing opportunities.  Walleye numbers have increased in recent years.  Bluegill collected from gill nets averaged 7.7 inches in length, with the largest individual measuring 9.6 inches.  To help protect this high-quality resource, a special regulation (10-fish daily bag limit) is being proposed as part of the Quality Sunfish Initiative.  Reduced harvest limits allow Bluegills to live longer and grow larger, which should help maintain or possibly improve size quality of this population.  Public input opportunities for this proposed regulation will occur during fall 2021.  Largemouth Bass are common in Lake Vermont.  Twenty-four bass were collected with gill nets in 2020.  The largest bass measured 18.9 inches in length.  Northern Pike remain highly abundant (11.5 pike/gill net) and small fish continue to dominate this population.  Over 87% of pike collected were less than 22.0 inches in length.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike to help keep this population in check and to reduce predation pressure on other gamefishes.  New pike zone regulations were implemented in 2018.  Lake Vermont falls in the North-central Zone where all pike 22-26 inches must be immediately released.  Anglers can keep up to 10 pike, but no more than two can be longer than 26 inches.  Record-high Walleye abundance (3.2 Walleye/gill net) was documented in 2020.  Average size was 18.2 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Black Crappie and Yellow Perch catches were low but average size was high.  Mean length for both species exceeded 10.0 inches.\n\nOther species recorded in the 2020 survey included hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Brown and Yellow Bullhead.  The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2026.  \n\nNo aquatic invasive species have been found in Lake Vermont.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment and remove all aquatic vegetation from trailers to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species.\n</p>",

Northern Pike net catch indices (14/set) indicate a high population of small to medium size fish and are the dominate predator. Yellow Perch provide the primary forage base and, although the Northern Pike population is high, it does not appear to be impacting the perch population (12/set). Little is known about the Largemouth Bass population, however angler reports indicate large bass being caught and do provide adequate angling opportunities.</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Vermont.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nFourteen species were collected during this survey.  Three species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter) were considered \"intolerant\" and one species (Green Sunfish) was considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes. \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Vermont.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Vermont Lake is a moderately developed 307-acre basin located about 15 miles north of Alexandria on the northern edge of Douglas County.  Water quality and clarity are exceptional for lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Secchi disk transparency normally exceeds 13 feet during the entire summer.  The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Submergent vegetation is present throughout shallow areas of the lake and can be found at depths up to 20 feet.  Emergent vegetation is common in protected bays and in the shallow, flat area along the southwest shore.  Wild rice and yellow water lily are also present in several areas.  These aquatic plants help to maintain the exceptional water clarity by competing with algae for the available nutrients in the lake.  Aquatic plants also provide spawning habitat and cover for many fish species, especially bass and panfish.  The fish community in Lake Vermont is typical of relatively small, clear, and densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota.   Largemouth bass and bluegill are both abundant.  Size structure of these species should appeal to most anglers.  Two-thirds of the bass captured exceeded 12 inches in length and one-third exceeded 15 inches.  Almost ninety percent of the bluegill were 6 inches or greater and a few exceeded 8 inches.  Northern pike are also sought after by anglers on Lake Vermont. Average size of pike tends to be small. Black crappie are also an important component of the fishery, but are not well represented in standard survey net catches during summer months.Walleye numbers are limited.  Walleye fingerlings were first stocked into Lake Vermont in 1997, however success appears to be limited.  Lake Vermont is included in an ongoing research project aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of different walleye stocking strategies in Minnesota lakes.  The study will continue through 2008.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Vermont is a moderately developed 307-acre basin located about 15 miles north of Alexandria.   A state owned public access is located on the east side of the lake. Water quality and clarity are exceptional for lakes in west-central Minnesota. Secchi disk transparency normally exceeds 13 feet during the summer. The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community. Submergent vegetation is present throughout shallow areas of the lake and can be found at depths to 20 feet. Emergent vegetation is common in protected bays and in the shallow, flat area along the southwest shore. Wild rice and yellow water lily are also present in several areas. These aquatic plants help to maintain the exceptional water clarity by competing with algae for the available nutrients in the lake. Aquatic plants also provide spawning habitat and cover for many species, especially bass and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community of Lake Vermont is typical of relatively, small, clear and densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota. Bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie, and northern pike are abundant. Bluegill size structure should appeal to most anglers. Ninety percent of bluegill were 6.5 inches or greater in length.  A few exceeded 8.0 inches.  Exceptional water clarity diminished effectiveness of largemouth bass sampling.  Previous assessments have documented an abundant largemouth bass population.  Most black crappie were young fish and as yet too small to satisfy most anglers.  Lake Vermont supports an excess number of hammer-handle size northern pike.  Most captured in surveys were less than 20.0 inches in length. Walleye abundance is limited. Walleye fingerlings were first stocked into Lake Vermont in 1997. Subsequent  fingerling and fryling stockings have contributed little to population abundance. <br> \n <br> \nLake Vermont's fish community structure and predator/prey relationships are presently unbalanced, which results in slower than normal growth rates.  Anglers can contribute to improving community balance by practicing selective harvest.  There is need to harvest small northern pike, largemouth bass, and intermediate-size bluegill. <br> \n</p>",
