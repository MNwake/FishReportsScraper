                "narrative": "<p>NORTHERN PIKE WERE CAPTURED AT A RATE OF 11.60/GN LIFT.  THIS WAS  ABOVE THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 3.3-7.3.  IT WAS ALSO APPARENT THAT THE GN LIFT HAS BEEN INCREASING EACH ASSESSMENT SINCE 1969 (1969-3.3, 1980-5.2, 1988-7.3, AND 1989-11.6).  THIS WAS ALSO ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE FOR LAKE CLASS 22.  THE LENGTH OF THESE NORTHERN PIKE RANGED FROM 11.5 TO 32 INCHES, WITH A MODE OF 18.0-18.9 INCHES, FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY 15.0-15.9 INCHES.  THE BULK OF THE CATCH WERE AGE 2-4 YEAR FISH (83%), RANGING FROM 15-20 INCHES.  THE MEAN LENGTH OF MALE NORTHERN PIKE WAS 17.2 INCHES, AS COMPARED TO FEMALES AT 18.9 INCHES.  THE GROWTH (BOTH SEXES COMBINED) WAS GOOD FOR ALL AGES.  AFTER THE FIRST YEAR OF GROWTH, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN GROWTH BETWEEN THE SEXES.THERE SEEMS TO BE GOOD DIVERSITY IN THE FORAGE AVAILABILITY.  MOST OF THE NORTHERN PIKE AND WALLEYE THAT WERE CAUGHT IN THE GILLNETS CONTAINED SHINERS.  CISCO ABUNDANCE (4.90/GN LIFT) WAS DOWN FROM 1988 (9.8/LIFT) AND 1980 (13.9/LIFT).  THE YELLOW PERCH CATCH RATE OF 15.90/GN LIFT WAS SIMILAR TO 1988 (11.9/LIFT).  THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 5 TO 8.5 INCHES, WITH A MODE OF 5.5-5.9 INCHES.WALLEYE WERE CAUGHT AT A CATCH RATE OF 5.1/GN LIFT, WHICH TYPIFIES CATCHES IN PAST SURVEYS (5.0-5.7).  THIS ALSO TYPIFIES THE LAKE CLASS 22 MEDIAN FOR WALLEYE (5.40).  THE MEAN WEIGHT FOR WALLEYE IN 1991 WAS 1.45 POUNDS COMPARED TO 1.12 POUNDS IN 1988.  THE PSD FOR WALLEYE WAS UP IN 1991 AT 72 AS COMPARED TO 45 IN 1988 AND 46 IN 1980.  THE WALLEYE RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 9 TO 23 INCHES, WITH A MODE BEING SHARED BY 16.0-16.9 AND 17.0-17.9 INCHES.  GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR ALL AGES.  THE TWO STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES OF WALLEYE WERE AGES 1987 AND 1986.  THERE WAS NO OBVIOUS CORRELATION BETWEEN YEAR CLASS STRENGTH AND WALLEYE STOCKING WHEN LOOKING AT PRESENT AND PAST SURVEYS. NIGHT ELECTROFISHING SAMPLED YOY WALLEYE.BLUEGILL ABUNDANCE (7.4/TRAPNET LIFT) WAS TYPICAL OF PAST SURVEYS (0.8-24.5).  EXTENSIVE SHOAL WATER AND STANDS OF BULRUSH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SAMPLE THE BLUEGILL.  THE FISH RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 3 TO 8 INCHES, WITH THE MODE BEING 5.0-5.4 INCHES.  THE PSD FOR BLUEGILL IN 1991 WAS 29.  IN 1988 THE PSD WAS 61.  THE GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR ALL AGES.FEW LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE CAUGHT BY NETTING.  FALL NIGHT ELECTROFISHING PRODUCED 13 BASS (CPE=5.1) THAT RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 6 TO 15 INCHES.  GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR ALL AGES.TWO MUSKELLUNGE WERE CAPTURED BY NIGHT ELECTROFISHING IN THE FALL.  ONE WAS A YOY (8.5 INCHES), INDICATING THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION WAS OCCURRING. THE OTHER MUSKIE WAS 22 INCHES LONG.NO BLACK CRAPPIE WERE CAUGHT.  ALL THREE SPECIES OF BULLHEADS WERE CAUGHT IN LOW NUMBERS. GREATER REDHORSE WERE CAUGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN INGUADONA.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Inguadona Lake (DOW # 11-120; Lake Class 25) is a 1,116-acre lake located near Longville, Minnesota.  There is a state-owned public access on the southeast shore.  Inguadona Lake has 565 littoral acres, 11.10 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 79 feet. Much of the shoreline has extensive bulrush stands or wild rice beds. Experimental regulations of ten sunfish and five black crappies in possession went into effect on April 1, 2009.  The goals of the sunfish regulation are to increase the number of bluegills 7 and 8 inches or greater in length. The goals of the black crappie regulation are to increase the number of fish 10 and 12 inches or greater in length. Inguadona Lake has a high quality and diverse fishery. Northern pike are abundant and average 20 inches in length. Northern pike up to 35 inches were sampled during the 2009 assessment. Large muskie are noted to be present in Inguadona Lake and muskie anglers frequently visit the lake. The walleye gill net catch rate was high when compared to the average for similar lakes.  Most of the walleye in the 2009 sample were between 12 and 16 inches in length. There was a good distribution of walleye in the sample that were between 17 and 28 inches in length. The average length and weight of sampled walleye in 2009 were 15 inches and 1.5 pounds. Good to excellent angling for largemouth bass exists on Inguadona Lake. Thirty-two largemouth bass sampled in the spring of 2009 had an average length of 16 inches and the lengths ranged from 9 to19 inches. Ice anglers heavily target bluegills and black crappies. Excellent angling opportunities exist during the open water season, as well. Bluegill sampled in the spring of 2009 had an average length of 6.4 inches and the lengths ranged from 3 to 9 inches. Black crappies sampled at the same time as the bluegills had an average length of 10.6 inches and the lengths ranged from 7.4 to 13.5 inches. Smallmouth bass are known to be in Inguadona Lake, but none were sampled in the 2009 survey. Yellow perch are moderately abundant, but small. No yellow perch 10 inches or greater in length were sampled in 2009. Other fish species sampled were black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, greater redhorse, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, tullibee (cisco), white sucker, and yellow bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Inguadona Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water surface and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Inguadona Lake (DOW # 11-120; Lake Class 25) is a 1,133-acre lake located near Longville, Minnesota.  There is a state-owned public access on the southeast shore. Inguadona Lake has 565 littoral acres, 11 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 79 feet. Much of the shoreline has extensive bulrush stands or wild rice beds. Experimental regulations for Sunfish and Black Crappie went into effect on April 1, 2009. A daily limit of five Black Crappie (ten in possession) and ten Sunfish (twenty in possession) is allowed. These regulations are intended to increase the number of large Sunfish and Black Crappie in the population. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Inguadona Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in the class are generally deep, clear, hard-water lakes with irregular shorelines. Other Lake Class 25 lakes in the Walker area include Boy, Birch, Long and Swift lakes. The purpose of this survey was to assess how effective the experimental regulations have been at improving Black Crappie and Bluegill populations. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate and average length was higher than all previous surveys. Sampled Bluegill averaged 7 inches long with fish from 3 to 10 inches sampled. Bluegill growth was above average. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates were higher than previous surveys. Black Crappie averaged 9 inches with fish from 5 to 14 inches in length sampled. Growth was above average. Management goals for Black Crappie were not met in this survey.   <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. <br> \n <br> \nHarvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Inguadona Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

A total of fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.  Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Nearshore sampling captured 26 species of fish including nine species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Muskellunge, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) ().  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with data collected during a gill net and trap net survey conducted the week of August 12, 2019 to calculate a FIBI score for the lake. The FIBI Tool-2 was used for scoring and resulted in an FIBI score of 91, which is above both the impairment threshold (45) and the exceptional threshold (64) for this tool.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

THIRTY-EIGHT PERCENT OF THE SAMPLE WAS 6.5 TO 8.5 INCHES IN LENGTH.  PAST ASSESSMENTS HAD SIMILAR NET CATCHES AND LENGTH FREQUENCIES.THE NORTHERN PIKE GILLNET CATCH IS SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN DURING PREVIOUS SURVEYS (1988-7.3; 1980-5.2; 1969-3.3).  FISH UP TO 28 INCHES WERE SAMPLED.  THE MAJORITY OF NORTHERN PIKE RANGED FROM 17 TO 20 INCHES IN LENGTH.LAKE INGUADONA HAS A NATURAL POPULATION OF MUSKELLUNGE.  VERY FEW ARE SAMPLED DURING A STANDARD LAKE POPULATION ASSESSMENT.  SAMPLING DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY TOWARD THE MUSKELLUNGE NEEDS TO BE INSTITUTED TO ASSESS THE POPULATION.THE 1988 TRAPNET CATCH OF BLUEGILL IS LOW (6.9/TN). PREVIOUS TRAPNET CATCHES WERE 0.8 AND 24.5 PER TRAPNET IN 1969 AND 1980 RESPECTIVELY.  OVER 30 PERCENT OF BLUEGILL MEASURED WERE GREATER THAN 7 INCHES IN LENGTH.  THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE 1969 AND 1980 LENGTH FREQUENCIES.  BLUEGILL MAY BE SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO NET IN INGUADONA DUE TO THE ABUNDANCE OF EMERGENT AQUATIC VEGETATION.FEW LARGEMOUTH BASS OR BLACKCRAPPIE WERE SAMPLED PRESUMABLY DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY IN SAMPLING THESE SPECIES WITH TRAPNETS AND GILLNETS, ESPECIALLY DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS.  BLACK CRAPPIE UP TO 13 INCHES AND LARGEMOUTH BASS TO 18 INCHES WERE SAMPLED.  SPRING ELECTROFISHING NEEDS TO BE CONDUCTED TO BETTER ASSESS THESE POPULATIONS.THE YELLOW PERCH GILLNET CATCH (11.9/GN) IS LOWER THAN PREVIOUS CATCHES (1969-39.4; 1980-39.7).THE WALLEYE GILLNET CATCH FOR ALL THREE YEARS OF ASSESSMENTS HAVE BEEN VERY CONSISTENT AT 5.0 TO 5.5 WALLEYE PER NET.  THIS NET CATCH COMPARES VERY FAVORABLY WITH OTHER LAKES IN THE WALKER MANAGEMENT AREA.  THE LENGTH FREQUENCIES FROM ALL THREE ASSESSMENTS HAD FISH IN ESSENTIALLY ALL INCH GROUPS FROM 7 TO 20 INCHES ALONG WITH SOME 20 PLUS INCH FISH.  WALLEYE SCALE AGING CONDUCTED FROM SAMPLES COLLECTED IN 1988 AND 1980 SHOWED ALL YEAR CLASSES OF WALLEYE WERE WELL REPRESENTED.  WALLEYE FRY STOCKING DOES NOT APPEAR TO INCREASE YEAR CLASS STRENGTH.  WALLEYE NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS EXCELLENT EVEN THOUGH THE 1969 LAKE SURVEY LISTS WALLEYE SPAWNING CONDITIONS AS POOR (SHOAL WATER SOILS 70 PERCENT SAND, 15 PERCENT MUCK, 15 PERCENT CLAY.</p>",

Species fished for include northern pike, muskellunge,walleye, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.Northern pike are abundant and generally small in size although good sized fish are present.  Ample spawninghabitat exists within the lake as well as in the Boy River.  The number of walleye found in Inguadona was typicalof other area lakes of the same type.  Sampled walleye were good size with the average fish captured measuring18 inches and weighing 2.2 pounds.  Muskellunge offer the angler another fishing opportunity.  Bluegill is another species showing good size with fish over 8 inches sampled.  Few black crappie  and largemouthbass were sampled during this assessment. Both of these species are difficult to sample using traditional methods.As a result, spring trapnetting and/or electrofishing should be employed to increase sample size of thesesimportant components of the fish community.  The shoreline on Inguadona Lake is quickly being developed.  In 1969 there were 75 homes/cabins on the lake. However, by 1994 homes/cabins had increased to 158.  To maintain and promote a healthy fish population onInguadona, lake shore residents and other users of the lake should protect fish habitat by preserving naturalshoreline, aquatic vegetation, and lake bottom. Lake shore residents can also help preserve Inguadona's waterquality by such actions as having a properly built and maintained septic system; by avoiding the use of lawn orgarden chemicals near the lake; and by establishing a buffer strip of natural vegetation along their shoreline.Anglers can help maintain fishing quality by practicing \"Catch and Release\" of larger fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Inguadona Lake is an 1116-acre lake located near Longville, MN that has 11.2 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 79 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public access on the southeast shore of the south basin.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Inguadona Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are deep, clear, and irregularly shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike, muskellunge, walleye and largemouth bass and secondarily for bluegill, smallmouth bass, black crappie, cisco, and yellow perch. Northern pike are abundant in Inguadona Lake and the catch rate has been historically high compared to other Lake Class 25 lakes.  The mean length for northern pike was 20 inches and fish up to 31 inches were sampled.  One muskellunge was sampled during the spring netting.  Sampling directed at muskellunge would sample more.  Walleye are abundant in Inguadona Lake when compared to other Lake Class 25 lakes.  The catch rate has been consistent when compared to previous surveys completed on Inguadona Lake.  The walleye mean length and weight are 17 inches and 2 pounds and fish up to 30 inches are present.  Twenty-three percent of the walleye sampled were greater than 20 inches which showed that the large and small fish are present in Inguadona Lake.  The walleye population is a result of natural reproduction.  Largemouth bass are present in Inguadona Lake with fish up to 18 inches sampled.  Other fish species sampled include: black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, cisco, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Inguadona Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Temperature-dissolved oxygen profiles were collected in the deepest basins on Inguadona Lake on August 3rd, 2022, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile from the deepest basin, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 23 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 24.0 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 19.4?C (66.9?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values near 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are marginal for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations near the thermocline indicate that oxythermal habitat was adequate for Cisco at limited depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2022. However, low dissolved oxygen concentrations (i.e., less than 3 mg/L) below the thermocline and warm surface temperatures would likely limit available Cisco habitat within the water column to an extent. Data collected in 1969-2012 further indicate marginal oxythermal habitat in most years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2012. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and experience higher levels of stress. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Inguadona Lake is a 1,116-acre lake located near Longville, Minnesota that has 11.10 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 79 feet.  There is a state-owned public access on the southeast shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Inguadona Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in the class are generally deep, clear, hard-water lakes with irregular shorelines.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant in Inguadona Lake.  The average length of this species sampled in MNDNR test nets was 20 inches and fish ranged from 15 to 30 inches.  No muskellunge were caught in MNDNR test nets in 2007, however no sampling (such as spring trapping) was done to target this species.  Walleye from 7 to 27 inches were found. Walleye abundance was lower than in previous years.  Largemouth bass from 5 to 18 inches were sampled in 2007.  Abundance of bluegill in Inguadona was similar to that found in other Lake Class 25 waters.  Average length of bluegill in 2007 sampling was about 6 inches, though there were a few fish in the 7-, 8-, and 9-inch categories.  Black crappie from 4 to 11 inches were caught.  A small number of cisco (tullibee), ranging from 11 to 13 inches, were collected during MNDNR sampling, and yellow perch in the 4 to 7 inch range were found as well.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species available for anglers include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, greater redhorse, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Inguadona Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Inguadona Lake (DOW # 11-120; Lake Class 25) is a 1,132-acre lake located near Longville, Minnesota.  There is a state owned public access on the southeast shore.  Inguadona Lake has 565 littoral acres, 11 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 79 feet. Much of the shoreline has extensive bulrush stands or wild rice beds. Experimental regulations of ten sunfish and five Black Crappies in possession went into effect on April 1, 2009.  These regulations are intended to increase the number of larger Bluegill and Black Crappie in the population. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Inguadona Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in the class are generally deep, clear, hard-water lakes with irregular shorelines.  Other Lake Class 25 lakes in the Walker area include Boy (DOW# 11-0143), Birch (DOW# 11-0412), Long (DOW# 11-0142) and Swift (DOW# 11-0133) lakes. The purpose of the survey was to assess status of gamefish populations and the how well the experimental regulations have been at improving Black Crappie and Bluegill populations. <br> \n <br> \nInguadona Lake has a high quality and diverse fishery. Northern Pike are abundant and average 20 inches long with fish up to 36 inches long sampled. Large Muskellunge are present in Inguadona Lake and anglers hoping to catch these fish frequently visit the lake. Walleye abundance is generally moderate and Walleye ranged in length from 9 to 27 inches with an average length of 18 inches. The 2019 survey Walleye catch rate did not meet the management goal of five fish per gillnet although, fingerling stocking appears to be bolstering the population. Targeted sampling for Black Crappie and Bluegill was done in the spring of 2019. Both crappie and sunfish have reduced possession limits aimed to improve size structure and spread harvest among anglers. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 8 to 14 inches with an average length of 11 inches.. Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to over 9 inches and averaged 6 inches.  A total of twelve Largemouth Bass were sample during the summer netting and the lengths ranged from 6 to 16 inches. Smallmouth Bass are present in Inguadona Lake but were not sampled in 2019. Yellow Perch are moderately abundant, but small. Other fish species anglers may encounter are Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Greater Redhorse, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Inguadona Lake are the Rusty Crayfish, Banded Mystery Snail, Chinese Mystery Snail, and Purple Loosestrife.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Inguadona Lake is a 1116-acre lake with a maximum depth of 79 feet.  Approximately 51% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth. The lake is located three miles east of Longville in upper Cass County.  It is one many lakes located on the Boy River. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Inguadona Lake is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include: Birch, Blackwater, Girl, and Long (by Longville) Lakes.  There is a DNR public access on the southeast side of the south basin of the lake.  Inguadona Lake provides good fishing for a variety species. The lake is managed primarily for northern pike, muskellunge, walleye, and largemouth bass.  Due to the excellent habitat that still exists, no fish stocking occurs in Inguadona Lake.There is an abundant walleye population present that is the result of natural reproduction.  No walleye stocking has been done since 1987.  The 1994 through 1996 year classes were well represented in the 1998 fish population assessment.  Northern pike are abundant; however most are relatively small.  Anglers could do a lot to improve northern pike angling by releasing all fish over 24 inches long and keeping the smaller ones for      eating.  Angler catch rates of muskellunge are as good as other muskellunge lakes within Cass County.Though they do not appear to be abundant, there are quality size smallmouth and largemouth bass and black crappie present.Bluegill are fairly abundant and are good size.  However, due to excessive harvest of larger sizes by anglers, the quality of bluegill present in Inguadona Lake has decreased considerably during the last 10 to 15 years.  In 1969 of bluegill sampled, 64% were seven inches or longer in length; this decreased to 15% in 1998.  Anglers often complain about the disappearance of large bluegill.  All anglers combined are the cause of this decrease in large fish.  The number of large bluegill harvested needs to be reduced.  Much of the bluegill harvest on Inguadona appears to take place during ice-fishing season.There has been much lakeshore development on Inguadona Lake.  From 1969 to 1994, lake homes have increased from 75 to 158.  This development has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  Lakeshore that is not currently developed is some of the most sensitive and important shoreline for maintaining water quality and fish habitat.  These shorelines and shallow water areas with their aquatic plants, help protect the lakeshore  from erosion and absorb nutrients and pollutants as well as provide excellent places for wildlife and fish to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Inguadona Lake is also needed to maintain water quality.  Based on the increasing value of lakeshore in this area, there will be much demand to develop the remaining lakeshore on Inguadona Lake.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Inguadona and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Also large fish help maintain balance in the fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Inguadona Lake (DOW # 11-120; Lake Class 25) is a 1,132-acre lake located near Longville, Minnesota.  There is a state owned public access on the southeast shore.  Inguadona Lake has 565 littoral acres, 11 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 79 feet. Much of the shoreline has extensive bulrush stands or wild rice beds. Experimental regulations of ten sunfish and five Black Crappies in possession went into effect on April 1, 2009.  These regulations are intended to increase the number of larger Bluegill and Black Crappie in the population.  <br> \n <br> \nInguadona Lake has a high quality and diverse fishery. Northern Pike are abundant and average 19 inches in length. Northern Pike up to 27 inches were sampled during the 2016 assessment. Large Muskellunge are present in Inguadona Lake and anglers hoping to catch these fish frequently visit the lake. The Walleye gill net catch rate was high when compared to the average for similar lakes. Most Walleye sampled were between 11 and 20 inches in length with Walleye up to 25 inches present.  The average length and weight of sampled Walleye in 2016 were 14 inches and 1.2 pounds. Targeted sampling for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, or Black Crappie was not done in 2016. Nine Largemouth Bass with lengths ranging from 6 to 19 inches were sampled from summer gill and trap nets combined. Bluegill averaged 6 inches and lengths ranged from 5 to 9 inches. Black Crappie had an average length of 9 inches and lengths ranged from 4 to 12 inches. Smallmouth Bass are known to be in Inguadona Lake, but none were sampled in 2016. Yellow Perch are moderately abundant, but small. Other fish species anglers may encounter are Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Greater Redhorse, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Inguadona Lake are the Rusty Crayfish, Banded Mystery Snail, Chinese Mystery Snail, and Purple Loosestrife.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
