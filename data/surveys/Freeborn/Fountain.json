                "narrative": "<p>The fish population of Fountain Lake has historically been dominated by black bullheads and common carp.  Since installation of aerators in 1980, bullhead numbers have increased with each subsequent survey.  In 1990 an average of 199 bullheads were caught per trapnet.  Bullhead numbers declined in 1993 to just 19 per trapnet.  Carp numbers however increased from 6/net in 1990 to 23/net in 1993.  This is far less than the 51/net collected in 1979 and similar to the rate in 1982.     Walleye stocking continues to prove successful.  Catch rates increased from 0.7/net in 1990 to 1.6/net in 1993.  Average weight was 1.9 lbs and average length 16.2 inches.  Walleye ages 1-6 were collected indicating good survival of stocked fingerlings.     Channel catfish catch unexpectedly declined in 1993.  Yearlings were stocked in both 1992 and 1993.  Catch averaged 6.6/net in 1990 declining to 2.3/net in 1993.  Average weight remained at 0.5 lbs indicating that the size structure of the population was similar between years.  Due to high water levels and turbidity in 1993, trapnet catches may have been reduced.  Therefore, the declines in catch of channel catfish and black bullheads may not be as large as indicated.     A total of 19 largemouth bass were collected trapnetting and electrofishing.  Fountain Lake has historically had limited numbers of largemouth bass.  Fish ranged from 10 to 18 inches in length averaging 13 inches.  The average weight was 1.5 lbs with the largest bass weighing 3.6 lbs.  Limited natural reproduction is occurring as an average of 2 YOY largemouth bass were collected per seine haul.     The black crappie population is increasing.  Catch rates improved from 5.7/net in 1990 to 12.1/net in 1993.  Most were from 6-9 inches with a mean length of 7.6 inches.  Age 1-5 black crappie were collected.     Bluegill numbers have fluctuated between past surveys.  In 1990 catch averaged 22/net.  This declined to 8/net in 1992.  the population was dominated by 4-year-old bluegills with few fish ages 1-3.  Few young-of-year (YOY) bluegill were collected seining indicating poor reproductive success.     Northern pike abundance has declined since stocking of winter rescue fish was discontinued in 1983.  No northern pike were collected in 1993.  Stocking was eliminated because northern pike would likely prey on stocked walleye fingerlings.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was completed on Fountain Lake, Freeborn County the first week of August in 2003.  Twelve standard trap nets were set in the southern 2 basins of the lake along with an electrofishing assessment that was completed in october, which sampled 4 seperate stations (1 on the upper basin and 3 on the lower basin).  The electrofishing sampling targeted mainly largemouth bass, walleye, and channel catfish.  A dissolved oxygen profile, temperature profile, and a secchi disc reading were also completed on August 5, 2003.     The current stocking recommendations for Fountain Lake includes walleye fingerlings every other year and channel catfish fingerlings yearly.  Stocking continues to provide consistent, multiple year-classes of adult fish for both species.  The walleye population in 2003 contained numerous fish of favorable size for anglers (greater than 12 inches long).  The average length of all walleyes sampled was 17.3 inches long with 7 fish exceeding 20 inches in length; the largest fish captured measured 23.8 inches in length and weighed 4.2 pounds.  Abundance and average size of the walleyes in Fountain Lake is slightly below the 75% quartile for lakes of this type.  The channel catfish population also looked very good in 2003; their numbers have bounced back from the historic low that was seen in 1999 to a level that is near the upper end of their historical range. As was the case with the walleyes, numerous fish were sampled that were greater than 12 inches in length, along with 4 fish that exceeded the 20 inch mark.  The catfish sample in 2003 averaged 13.2 inches long and weighed 1.05 pounds, the largest fish sampled measured 26.2 inches long and weighed 7.0 pounds.       The abundances of largemouth bass, black crappies, and bluegills were at all time highs in 2003.  The black crappie abundance is currently over twice the 75% quartile for this class of lake while the bluegill abundance falls just under the 75% quartile.  The bass sampled in 2003 averaged 11.7 inches long and weighed 1.24 pounds, the largest fish captured was 17.5 inches long and weighed 3.1 pounds.  The crappie and bluegill populations were both dominated by 3-year old fish, thus only 2% of the crappies sampled were over 10 inches long and no bluegills exceeded 8 inches in length.  The average individual weights for both species falls about midway between the 25% and 50% quartiles for lakes of this type.  The presence of northern pike and yellow perch continues to be very low in 2003 as has been the case in the previous assessments.  The yellow perch size structure is not very favorable from a sport fishing point of view due to the fact that only 2 fish sampled exceeded 8 inches in length.  Conversely, the northern pike population does contain harvestable size fish although in limited numbers; the largest fish captured in 2003 measured 33.9 inches long and weighed 9.0 pounds.  Green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, orangespotted sunfish and white crappie were also sampled in 2003, all of these species were found in very limited numbers.     Common carp, white sucker, and black bullhead abundances haven risen slightly since the previous assessment (1999).  Even though the carp abundance is at the low end of the range seen over the previous 4 assessments it still remains almost twice as high as the 75% quartile for lakes of this type.  A similar situation exists for the white suckers in Fountain Lake in 2003.  The bullhead population, although up slightly, has remained pretty stable over the past 10 years, their levels fall just under the 75% quartile.  Prior to this period (1979 to 1990) the population was anywhere from 2 to 3 times the 75% level, indicating the population has leveled out to one more reasonable for a class 42 lake.</p>",

Walleye catch remains above average and should continue to provide good angling as a strong 2004 year-class recruits to the population.  Black crappies are abundant and the size structure is favorable to anglers with a good number of fish exceeding 8 inches in length.  The channel catfish population features a well-balanced size structure, providing excellent opportunity for this species.  Although carp and bullhead continue to affect the turbidity of Fountain Lake, black bullhead numbers are at an all time low.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fountain Lake is a 521-acre urban impoundment in the City of Albert Lea that forms the head water of the Shell Rock River.  Much of the shoreline and riparian zone of the lake has been modified for residential and municipal development with most of the natural shoreline remaining around the large, shallow northern basin.  City owned parks located at the narrows between the main basin and the northern basin and at the northwest end of Edgewater Bay provide public water access.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, channel catfish, northern pike, walleye, yellow perch, and largemouth bass.  Fountain Lake has been stocked extensively to maintain sport fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nFingerling channel catfish were stocked in 2002, 2004, and 2005.  The current management plan calls for northern pike fry stocking in even years since 2008, and walleye fry stocking in odd years since 2007. <br> \n <br> \nFountain Lake has maintained a consistent walleye population since stockings began in the 1980s.  The 2011 gill net catch rates of walleyes (6.0/gill net) were down from 2006 catch rates (11.3/gill net) but catch rates were still above average for similar lakes.  A quality sized walleye population exists ranging from 15.8 to 27.2 inches in total length and averaging 20.6 inches.  All of the walleyes sampled were 15.0 inches long or greater. <br> \n <br> \nFountain Lake appears to support an abundant, quality channel catfish population with fish ranging from 13.8 to 30.7 inches in total length and averaging 20.7 inches.  Trap net catch rates of channel catfish increased from 5.3/trap net in 2006 to 13.8/trap net in 2011.  Approximately 89% of channel catfish sampled were greater than 16 inches in length.  Stocking of channel catfish fingerlings was suspended after 2005 to observe if the population could sustain itself via natural reproduction.  The presence of channel catfish less than 8.0 inches in the gill nets indicates that natural reproduction is occurring in this population, however, the magnitude of natural reproduction is not known.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of northern pike in gill nets increased from 0.0/gill net in 2006 to 14.0/gill net in 2011 which is well above average for lakes similar to Fountain Lake.  Northern pike sampled in gill nets tended to be small ranging in total length from 19.3 to 25.7 inches and averaging 21.7 inches.  Approximately 94% of northern pike were less than 24.0 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nPast surveys have shown that Fountain Lake supports abundant panfish populations which include bluegills and black crappies.  Bluegills increased in abundance from the all-time low in 2006 (3.8/trap net) to 28.0/trap net in 2011.  Gill net catch rates in 2011 (22.7/gill net) increased drastically from catch rates in 2006 (1.7/gill net).  Bluegills ranged in total length from 3.0 to 8.5 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  Eighty-six percent of bluegills captured in trap nets were between 6 and 8 inches long.  Fountain Lake has historically supported an abundant black crappie population with trap net catch rates being greater than 15.3/trap net since 1993.  Catch rates of black crappies in gill nets increased from 27.7/gill net in 2006 to 82.0/gill net in 2011.  Black crappie catch rates in trap nets decreased from 41.6/trap net in 2006 to 10.3/trap net in 2011.  Gill netted black crappies ranged from 4.7 to 10.3 inches and averaged 7.1 inches in total length.  Nearly all of the black crappies sampled were less than 10 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 1993, the fish community was dominated by black bullheads with trap net catch rates consistently exceeding 100.0/trap net.  The black bullhead population continues to decline with catch rates going from 24.9/trap net in 2006 to a new observed low, 1.1/trap net in 2011.  Common carp relative abundance also decreased from 11.3/trap net in 2006 to 3.1/trap net in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were present in Fountain Lake as three were sampled during the survey, ranging from 7.6 to 13.9 inches in length.  Numbers of largemouth bass were likely underestimated because trap nets and gill nets do not effectively sample them. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, and a goldfish were sampled but occurred in low numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Fountain Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Fountain Lake was conducted on August 20-21, 2018 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations with four sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, 15-foot seine was used to sample five stations, and four sampling stations had conditions that prevented the use of seines.  Nearshore sampling captured nine native species of fish including no species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance and three tolerant species (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Fountain Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Shell Rock River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fountain Lake is a 521 acre lake located within the town of Albert Lea in Freeborn County. Two city-owned public accesses are located on the northwest side of Edgewater Bay off State Hwy 13 and in the narrows off State Hwy 20 in Brookside Park. The maximum depth is 14 feet. The lake is considered eutrophic with generally poor water clarity and frequent algae blooms caused by elevated nutrient levels. The lake is primarily managed for Channel Catfish, Northern Pike, and Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass. The management plan calls for stocking 521,000 Walleye fry in odd years and 521 pounds of Walleye fingerlings contingent upon fall electrofishing catch rates of less than 15/hour on-time in fry stocked years. It also calls for stocking Northern Pike fry in even years into the upper watershed. Recent stocking events include Walleye fry in 2013, 2015, and 2017; Walleye fingerlings in 2013 and 2017; and Northern Pike fry in 2014, 2016, and 2018. Fountain Lake is designated as a Tier-1 Lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program at a frequency of every 3 years.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 standard survey was completed the week of August 20, 2018 using 8 gill nets, 12 trap nets, and 60 minutes of boat electrofishing. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 32 Channel Catfish were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.0/net, which was the lowest catch rate since 2006. In four samples from 2006 to 2018, catch rates varied from 17.0/net to 4.0/net with an average of 8.4/net. Lengths ranged from 11.8 to 30.1 inches with an average of 22.4 inches. Most of the fish were greater than 16 inches and almost 40% were greater than 24 inches. An additional 19 fish ranging from 11.4 to 28.9 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish were not aged but the length frequency distribution supports the assumption that multiple year classes were present.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 51 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 6.4/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. From 2006 to 2018, catch rates varied from 0.0/net to 17.0/net with an average of 6.9/net. Lengths ranged from 19.1 to 36.2 with an average of 27.2 inches. Approximately 80% of the sample exceeded the legal minimum length limit of 24 inches. Another 13 Northern Pike ranging from 15.9 to 33.6 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 7 years old with 7 year classes present. Most of the fish were 3 or 4 years old with just over half the sample born in non-stocked years. The presence of strong non-stocked year classes suggests the possibility of natural reproduction. Growth was fast with fish reaching 24 inches by their third year.  The new Southern Zone regulations for Northern Pike are in effect.  The limit for Northern Pike is now 2 and all fish less than 24 inches must be returned to the lake immediately.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 33 Walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.1/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. This was the lowest of four surveys since 2006 and continued an overall declining trend in Walleye catch rates. Catch rates averaged 6.9/net during that time. Lengths ranged from 10.3 to 26.3 inches with an average of 20.9 inches. Approximately 94% of the sample were greater than 15 inches and 73% were greater than 20 inches. An additional 3 fish ranging from 10.9 to 22.1 inches were sampled with the trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 13 years old with 5 year classes present which all coincide with fry or fingerling stocking. Just over half the sample were 3 years old. Growth was fast with fish exceeding 17 inches by their third year. Stocking appears necessary to create a consistent Walleye population and further analysis should be done to assess whether fry or fingerlings are more appropriate <br> \n <br> \nA total of 66 Largemouth Bass were sampled with boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 66.0/hour, which represented a slight increase from the 2015 catch rate of 57.7/hour. Lengths ranged from 4.4 to 18.8 inches with an average of 11.2 inches. Over half the catchable population were larger than 12 inches and approximately 15% were larger than 15 inches. One 14.4 inch fish was also caught with the gill nets. Largemouth Bass were not aged in 2018 but the size structure shows evidence of multiple strong year classes. Like most Waterville Area lakes, Fountain Lake supports a strong population of Largemouth Bass that consistently produces year classes and good numbers of fish that are desirable to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were well represented in the trap net sample with a total of 311 caught for a catch rate of 25.9, indicating high numbers were present. In seven samples since 1996, only once has the catch rate failed to exceed 15/net. Lengths in 2018 ranged from 5.0 to 12.1 inches with an average of 8.5 inches. Most of the fish were larger than 8 inches and approximately 11% were larger than 10 inches. Black Crappies were also one of the most abundant fish in the gill nets with a total of 377 (47.0/net). Black Crappie sampled in gill nets ranged from 5.3 to 11.3 inches long. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 9 years old with 8 year classes present. Most fish were 2 years old. Growth was fast with fish reaching 8 inches by their third year and 10 inches by their fifth year. Black Crappie are a prominent part of the Fountain Lake fishery and will likely remain that way. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill was the most abundant fish species in the trap nets with a total of 316 sampled for a catch rate of 26.3/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Catch rates have varied since 1996 with a range of 3.8/net to 28.0/net and an average of 18.9/net. Lengths ranged from 3.4 to 8.4 inches with an average of 6.6 inches. Most of the fish were larger than 6 inches but few were larger than 8 inches. Bluegills were also well represented in the gill nets with a total of 109 ranging from 5.6 to 8.9 inches sampled for a catch rate of 13.6/net. Ages from both gears ranged from 1 to 5 years old with 6 year classes present. Most of the fish were 2 to 4 years old. Fish grew to 6 inches by their third year, indicating fast growth. The Fountain Lake Bluegill population is fast growing and plentiful, yet efforts to increase the number of 8 inch fish should be considered. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 147 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 18.4/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. This was the highest catch rate from 2006 to 2018 during which catch rates increased in each survey and averaged 9.6/net. Lengths ranged from 5.7 to 9.8 inches with an average of 6.8 inches. Just 5% of the sample exceeded 8 inches in length and most of the fish were 2 years old. Yellow Perch are an important prey species in Fountain Lake and strong numbers should help with managing Walleye and other predator species. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads were abundant in 2018. A total of 467 were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 58.4/net. This was by far the highest gill net catch rate seen from 2006 to 2018. Before 2018, catch rates averaged just 10.3/net. Black Bullhead were also common in the trap net samples with a catch rate of 22.9/net. Looking at pre-2006 trap net numbers, Black Bullheads can be abundant in Fountain Lake. In four surveys from 1996 to 2006, trap net catch rates ranged from 24.9/net to 50.5/net with an average of 41.1/net. Yellow Bullheads were present at lower numbers with catch rates of 7.9/gill net and 5.4/trap net. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were rare in 2018 with just 1.0/gill net and 0.5/trap net. Trap net catch rates have been declining since 2006 when 11.3/net were sampled. A huge investment of effort and resources has been made to eradicate or control Common Carp in the Shellrock River Watershed in which Fountain Lake resides. At least in Fountain Lake, Common Carp numbers have been relatively benign over the last 10 years or so. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2018 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Orangespotted Sunfish, White Crappie, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements included water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and secchi depth. Water clarity was poor with a secchi depth of 2.0 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 10.0 ppm and 78.3 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 8.9 ppm and 77.9 degrees Fahrenheit at 29 feet. No thermocline was detected. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Fountain Lake was conducted on June 25, 2018 by Waterville Area Fisheries staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen stations, with a number of stations sampled by boat. Seining was completed at 10 stations using a 50-foot seine and at 4 stations using the 15-foot seine. Nearshore sampling captured 12 native species of fish including seven species that are tolerant of habitat disturbance (Brook Stickleback, Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, Green Sunfish, hybrid Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in August 2018 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Fountain Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 1983 and 1984 year-classes of Black Crappies and White Crappies were very abundant. These fish were too small to provide quality angling in 1985 but they were growing well in spite of the large numbers in the lake. Good fishing for half pound crappies should result in 1986 if the rate of growth continues. Bluegills remained scarce, similar to the 1982 survey. Walleyes weighing an average of 1.2 pounds were quite abundant which was the result of stocking 3,000 walleye fingerlings in 1983. The number of northern pike per net set exceeded the state wide average and the average weight was 4.6 pounds, indicating a quality population. Channel catfish were present at 6.7 times the statewide average and the average weight was 1.2 pounds. Electrofishing results in October, 1984 verified that a good population of adult Largemouth Bass had been established with the 1981 fry stocking. The trap net catch of carp decreased from 21.4/set in 1982 to 3.5/set in 1985 and 23.0 pounds/set in 1982 to 7.5 pounds/set in 1985. Black Bullheads increased in 1985 from 108/set to 225/set and from 14.5 pounds/set to 45.5 pounds/set. The primary forage species for Walleye and Northern Pike was Yellow Perch which decreased from 20/trap net set to 0.83/set. Orangespotted Sunfish decreased from 62.2/set to 0.5/set. Green Sunfish decreased from 1.9/set to .05/set. Other species were about equally scarce during both surveys. To sum up the fish population situation, there has been a substantial increase in the numbers and pounds of game fishes in the lake and a large decrease in the numbers and pounds of undesirable fishes. Lake aeration and heavy stocking of predatory fishes have had a major beneficial impact on the sport fishery in Fountain Lake. Whether carp removal and fish barriers had an impact on the total fish population would be speculative at best. Black Bullheads must be controlled, which should be achieved by maintaining good numbers of larger Channel Catfish and Walleyes in the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Fountain Lake was conducted in 1996.  This assessment consisted of trap-netting tweleve shoreline areas from June 24 through June 27.  In addition, Fountain Lake was sampled with an electrofishing boat, using pulsed DC, on September 18.  This survey was scheduled according to the most recent DNR lake management plan (1994).  All fish captured during this assessment were returned to the lake, except for ten channel catfish which were collected for a fish contaminants monitoring program.  The results of this testing are not yet available.The walleye and channel catfish stocking programs have been highly successful in Fountain Lake in terms of providing an adult population comprised of several age groups.  Populations of both species have been increasing over the last ten years.  Stocked fingerlings are surviving and growing to desirable, even trophy sizes.  The largest walleye captured was 27.8 inches long and weighed 7.25 pounds, and the largest channel catfish was 25.2 inches long and weighed 6.46 pounds.  Larger fish are certainly possible; for instance, a lucky angler reportedly caught a 30.5 inch walleye weighing 11.75 pounds in October of 1996.  Northern pike and largemouth bass were not well represented in either summer trap net samples nor the fall electrofishing catch.  The abudance of northern pike has been decreasing in the lake since 1979, and zero pike were captured during the previous survey (1993).  Conversely, the low catch of largemouth bass in the fall electrofishing sample may have been due to the dense bloom of green algae occurring in the lake during late summer and early fall of 1996.  Therefore, the observed low abundance of northern pike is probably real, but the low catch of largemouth bass does not necessarily mean that the overall population has declined; it simply means that we had poor sampling conditions.Yellow perch and bluegill populations are following similar trends in Fountain Lake.  Relative abundance for both species has increased since the mid 1980's, and growth rates are above average for most age-classes.  Both numbers and sizes of both species are about what we would expect for lakes of this type.In contrast, black crappie numbers are higher and white crappie numbers are lower than what we would expect for lakes like Fountain Lake.  The preponderance of black crappie over white crappie in this turbid lake is somewhat unique.  Black crappie normally do better in clearer waters, whereas white crappie tend to dominate in muddy or more turbid waters.  However, black crappie have always been more abundant in Fountain Lake than white crappie.  Growth rates for both species are nearly identical.Rough fish populations are also doing well in Fountain Lake.  Carp numbers are higher than normal for this type of lake.  Black bullheads, though decreasing in numbers, are still within the normal range expected for lakes like Fountain Lake.</p>",

No age-0 Walleyes were observed. In six surveys since 2011, catch rates have fallen below 5.0/hour on-time four times with only modest catch rates of 11.0 and 24.4/hour on-time during the other two surveys. All six surveys were conducted during fry-stocked years to determine the need for supplemental fingerling stocking. The very limited return of age-0 Walleye in the electrofishing surveys suggests fry stocking has been ineffective in producing strong year classes. Additionally, the 2021 Standard Survey sampled an all-time high 14.3 Walleyes per gill net, suggesting either fingerling stocking was responsible or less likely, fall electrofishing surveys are failing to detect a high abundance of age-0 fish. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fountain Lake is a 521-acre lake located within the town of Albert Lea in Freeborn County. Two city-owned public accesses are located on the northwest side of Edgewater Bay off State Hwy 13 and in the narrows off State Hwy 20 in Brookside Park. The maximum depth is 14 feet. Fountain Lake is considered eutrophic with generally poor water clarity and frequent algae blooms caused by elevated nutrient levels. Fountain Lake is primarily managed for Channel Catfish, Northern Pike, and Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass. The management plan calls for stocking 521,000 Walleye fry in odd years and 521 pounds of Walleye fingerlings in even years. The management plan also calls for stocking Northern Pike fry in even years into the upper watershed. Recent stocking events include Walleye fry in 2017, 2019, and 2021; Walleye fingerlings in 2019 and 2021; and Northern Pike fry in 2016 and 2018. In recent years, a dredge has been operated throughout Fountain Lake with the goal of increasing depth and removing sediment. The resulting changes in the fish community should be tracked closely. Fountain Lake is designated as a Tier-1 Lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program at a frequency of every 3 years. The 2021 survey was completed the week of 9 August 2021 using 8 gill nets, 12 trap nets, and 80 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \n <br> \nJust 10 Channel Catfish or 1.3/net were sampled with gill nets in 2021. This continued a downward trend that began in 2006 with 17.0/net. Subsequent Channel Catfish catch rates were 8.3/net in 2011, 4.3/net in 2015, and 4.0/net in 2018. Channel Catfish in 2021 ranged from 18.9 to 25.4 inches with an average of 22.8 inches. Seven more Channel Catfish were sampled with trap nets and ranged from 20.0 to 27.6 inches. Although sampled in low numbers, the size structure of the Channel Catfish population in Fountain Lake offers great opportunity for those that wish to target them. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 42 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 5.3/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. After a high of 14.0/net in 2011, Northern Pike catch rates have fallen in 3 surveys since with a long-term average of 6.6/net. Northern Pike ranged from 15.4 to 33.5 inches with an average of 24.9 inches. Northern Pike size structure was good with approximately 50% of the sample exceeding the legal minimum length limit of 24 inches. Eleven more Northern Pike were sampled with trap nets and ranged from 19.8 to 37.4 inches. Northern Pike from both gears were 1 to 9 years old with 9 year classes present. The 2019 year class (age-2) was the most abundant, making up 42% of the sample. Three year old (2018) and four year old (2017) Northern Pike were also well represented. Northern Pike growth was moderate to fast with an average length of 19.4 inches at year 2. Approximately 70% were from years when Northern Pike fry were not stocked, suggesting that a self-sustaining population exists. Similarly, 88% of Northern Pike from the 2015 survey and 52% from the 2018 survey were assigned to years without stocking. Fountain Lake is in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. In order to harvest a Northern Pike, the fish must be over 24.0 inches in length.  The daily bag limit in this zone is 2 Northern Pike per day. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were abundant in the 2021 survey with a total gill net catch of 114 fish. The Walleye catch rate of 14.3/net was the highest among surveys since 2006. The 2018 Walleye catch rate was just 4.1/net. Walleye length in 2021 varied from 11.7 to 25.6 inches with an average of 17.0 inches. Over 60% of Walleyes were larger than 15 inches. Eight more Walleyes were sampled with trap nets and ranged from 13.1 to 21.7 inches. Collectively, Walleyes ranged from 2 to 8 years old with 6 year classes present. The two- and four-year-old age groups, which were years when both fry and fingerlings were stocked, accounted for 93% of the sample. Walleye growth was fast with fish reaching 16 inches before year 3. The results of the 2021 survey show a drastic increase in Walleye numbers in Fountain Lake and continue to support the current management plan of stocking Walleye every other year. Further evaluation is needed to determine the relative contribution of fry versus fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 95 Largemouth Bass were sampled with boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 70.9/hour. This was the highest Largemouth Bass catch rate of the three electrofishing surveys on record. The 2015 and 2018 Largemouth Bass catch rates were 57.7 and 66/hour and the three-year average was 61.9/hour. Largemouth Bass ranged from 4.2 to 20.1 inches with an average of 12.5 inches. An additional 15 Largemouth Bass up to 18.2 inches were sampled with the net gears. Largemouth Bass from all gears ranged from 0 to 13 years old with 13 year classes present. Largemouth Bass recruitment appeared consistent with many year classes well represented in the sample. Largemouth Bass growth was moderate with an average length of 11.7 inches at year 3. The Largemouth Bass population in Fountain Lake remains a consistent and quality option for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie dominated the trap net sample in 2021 with a total catch of 669 fish for a rate of 55.8/net. This was also the highest on record from 8 surveys dating back to 1996. During that time, Black Crappie catch rates have ranged from 1.1/net to 55.8/net with an average of 29.3/net. Black Crappies ranged from 5.3 to 11.7 inches with an average of 8.7 inches. Black Crappie size structure was good with a majority over 8 inches. Another 419 Black Crappie ranging from 5.6 to 11.3 inches were sampled with gill nets. Black Crappie from both gears were 1 to 7 years old with 7 year classes present. Two year old Black Crappie accounted for more than half the sample. An average Black Crappie length of 8.5 inches at year 3 indicates a moderate growth rate relative to other Waterville Area lakes. The Black Crappie population, largely driven by the abundant 2 year old year class, should provide an excellent fishing opportunity in the coming years. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 157 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 13.1/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. The 2018 survey yielded 26.3/net and the long-term average catch rate was 18.2/net. Bluegills ranged from 5.4 to 8.8 inches with an average of 7.3 inches. Approximately 90% of Bluegills sampled were over 6 inches and 26% were over 8 inches. Another 37 Bluegills ranging from 5.6 to 8.8 were sampled with the gill nets. Ages from both gears varied from 2 to 7 with 6 year classes present. All six year classes were equally represented in the sample, indicating consistent natural reproduction and recruitment. Bluegills growth was somewhat slow with an average length of 5.7 inches at year 3. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers soared in 2021 to an all-time high catch rate of 93.6/net. The previous high was 18.4/net in 2018. Yellow Perch ranged from 5.4 to 7.9 inches with an average of 6.7 inches. Out of 749 aged Yellow Perch, only 8 were assigned an age over 2. The average Yellow Perch growth to year 2 was 5.3 inches. The abundance of young and small Yellow Perch in Fountain Lake was strongly correlated with increased Walleye numbers in 2021. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers dropped to 14.3/gill net in 2021 after posting a long-term high of 58.4/net in 2018. Black Bullheads were larger with a maximum length of 13.5 inches and an average of 10.4 inches. Yellow Bullheads remained moderately abundant with a gill net catch rate of 6.9/net and an average length of 11.3 inches. Overall, bullhead numbers were modest in 2021 and is indicative of the relatively stable state of the Fountain Lake fish community. <br> \n <br> \nOne discouraging result from the 2021 survey was the significant increase in Common Carp numbers. A total of 77 Common Carp were sampled with gill nets for a rate of 9.6/net. The previous two catch rates were just 1.0/net in 2018 and 0.8/net in 2015. All but one Common Carp were under 8.5 inches with an overall average length of just 6.6 inches. Another 56 Common Carp were sampled with the trap nets and ranged from 4.1 to 31.7 inches with an average of 10.9 inches. The large increase in Common Carp abundance was driven by an influx of small 4 to 9 inch fish. Based on their size and known Common Carp growth rates, these were likely age-1 fish. Hopefully this was just an anomaly and not the start of a trend. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2021 include Goldfish, Green Sunfish, White Crappie, and White Sucker and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis spp.) <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fountain Lake is a 534 acre lake located in Freeborn County. Most of the lake is within the city of Albert Lea and much of the shoreline has been modified for residential and municipal development. The city of Albert Lea maintains two public accesses on the lake; one located at North Edgewater Bay on the northwest end of the lake and one in the narrows on the northeast end of the lake. Fountain Lake has a maximum depth of 14.0 feet and is classified in Lake Class 42 based on limnological variables and lake characteristics. Other lakes in this classification include Kohlmeier Lake (Steele County), Swede's Bay (Le Sueur County), and Louise Mill Pond (Mower County). Fountain Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, Channel Catfish, and Northern Pike and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass. The base stocking plan for Fountain Lake included stocking Walleye fry on odd-numbered years and Northern Pike fry on even-numbered years. If fall electrofishing surveys reveal low catch rates of Walleye fingerlings, the previous spring fry stocking is deemed unsuccessful and Walleye fingerlings are stocked that same fall. Aeration systems on Fountain Lake limit the occurrence of severe winterkills, but in the event of a winterkill all managed game fish are stocked to boost the fish community. Fountain Lake was surveyed the week of August 3, 2015 by the MN DNR as part of a regular scheduled monitoring program. This survey included deploying seven gill nets and twelve trap nets to assess the fish community, as well as recording water quality parameters. Since Largemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in nets, a night electrofishing survey was also conducted on May 27, 2015 to assess the Largemouth Bass population.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate in 2015 was 6.2 fish/gill net, which was consistent with the previous Fountain Lake survey conducted in 2011 (6.0 fish/gill net). The total length of Walleyes in gill nets ranged from 11.8 to 25.5 inches and averaged 15.7 inches. This size structure was smaller than that of the 2011 Fountain Lake survey when the average length was 20.6 inches and the largest Walleye was 27.2 inches. Walleyes were aged using otoliths and scales. Two year classes dominated the catch; age-2 (2013 year class) and age-4 (2011 year class). The average length at capture was 14.9 inches at age-2 and 18.9 inches at age-4. Walleye fry were recently stocked in Fountain Lake in 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015. Walleye fry will be stocked next in spring of 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in 2015 at a rate of 7.3 fish/gill net, which was less than the 2011 survey rate (14.0 fish/gill net) and near the long-term average for Fountain Lake (8.2 fish/gill net). The length of Northern Pike ranged from 15.2 to 35.4 inches, but 89% of the catch was less than 24.0 inches. The population consists of a young age structure with fast growth. Average length at capture was 16.3 inches at age-1, 20.1 inches at age-2, 24.9 inches at age-3, 28.9 inches at age-4, and 32.7 inches at age-5. Northern Pike fry are stocked in Fountain Lake every other year. The next stocking will take place in spring of 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2015 was 13.4 fish/gill net, which was the highest gill net catch rate on record for Fountain Lake and exceeded the long-term average (8.1 fish/gill net). The size structure of Yellow Perch was moderate, as 59% of the catch measured 8.0 inches or longer and the largest individual was 10.5 inches. About 65% of the aged fish were age-1 or age-2, so the population was composed primarily of young individuals. Yellow Perch averaged 6.5 inches at age-1, 8.3 inches at age-2, 9.0 inches at age-3, and 9.9 inches at age-4. Yellow Perch have not been stocked in Fountain Lake, so the population exists by natural reproduction. In the event of a severe winterkill in Fountain Lake, adult Yellow Perch would be stocked to boost the population. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nBlack Crappies were sampled at a rate of 29.5 fish/trap net, which was greater than the long-term average for Fountain Lake (21.5 fish/trap net). The gill net catch rate was 42.3 fish/net, which was also greater than the long-term average (38.3 fish/gill net). The size structure of Black Crappies was moderate, ranging from 4.7 to 11.8 inches. About 39% of the Black Crappies sampled in trap nets measured 7.5 inches or longer. Black Crappies averaged 5.6 inches by age-1, 6.8 inches by age-2, 9.3 inches at age-3, 9.7 inches by age-4, and 10.3 inches by age-5. Black Crappies are not stocked in Albert Lea Lake, so the population exists from natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate was 13.3 fish/trap net in 2015, which was right at the long-term average for Fountain Lake. The Bluegill population was composed of mostly catchable-sized individuals, as about 83% of the trap net catch measured 6.0 inches or longer. The largest Bluegill measured was 9.2 inches. Bluegills were aged using scales and averaged 3.8 inches by age-1, 5.7 inches by age-2, 6.6 inches by age-3, 7.9 inches by age-4, 8.1 inches by age-5, and 8.9 inches by age-6. Bluegills are not stocked in Fountain Lake unless a severe winterkill occurs.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \nSince Largemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in gill and trap nets, a targeted survey was conducted on May 27, 2015 to assess the population in Fountain Lake. This survey involved night electrofishing near shore along established transects for about an hour to specifically target Largemouth Bass. A total of 57 Largemouth Bass were sampled (57.7 fish/hour), which ranged in total length from 3.1 to 14.2 inches. Only 21% of the fish measured 12.0 inches or longer, suggesting a small size structure. Most fish (68%) were age-1. Mean length was 5.0 inches at age-1, 9.7 inches at age-2, 12.8 inches at age-4, and 13.6 inches at age-5. Only 5 fish were sampled from gill nets (N = 4) and trap nets (N = 1). The Largemouth Bass population in Fountain Lake is completely self-sustaining. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish <br> \nChannel Catfish have been stocked in Fountain Lake since the 1980s to serve as an additional recreational fishing opportunity. However, stocking ceased in 2005 to observe if the population could sustain itself through natural reproduction. In 2015, Channel Catfish were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 4.3 fish/net, which was less than the previous survey conducted in 2011 (8.3 fish/net). Trap nets yielded 1.9 fish/net, which was also lower than the 2011 survey (13.8 fish/net) and below the long-term average for Fountain Lake (3.8 fish/trap net). The size structure of Channel Catfish was large, as 53% of the overall catch measured over 20.0 inches. The largest individual measured over 30.0 inches and weighed over 10.0 pounds. With a quality Channel Catfish population and numerous shore angling locations available, Fountain Lake offers a unique fishing opportunity in a south-central Minnesota lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead <br> \nThe Black Bullhead population in Fountain Lake has remained relatively stable throughout the survey history, ranging from 27.5 fish/gill net in 1979 to 9.9 fish/gill net in 2015, and averaging 16.3 fish/gill net. The 2015 catch rate (9.9 fish/gill net) barely reached the interquartile range for Lake Class 42 (9.6 - 91.4 fish/gill net). Black Bullheads from both gear types ranged in length from 4.8 to 13.4 inches, with 59% measuring 9.0 inches or longer. Although bullheads are not targeted by anglers as often as years past, Fountain Lake still offers quality bullhead angling opportunities.  <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nCommon Carp were sampled at rates of 0.8 fish/gill net and 1.1 fish/trap net, both of which were the lowest catch rates on record for Fountain Lake. Common Carp averaged 18.0 inches in length and the largest fish was 30.0 inches. White Suckers were common throughout the survey, as 115 fish were sampled in both gear types. White Suckers averaged 17.4 inches in length. Other fish species sampled throughout the survey included White Crappie (N = 6), Bigmouth Buffalo (N = 2), Yellow Bullhead (N = 48), and hybrid sunfish (N = 1).  <br> \n <br> \nAngling Summary <br> \nAt the time of the 2015 survey, Fountain Lake offered quality fishing opportunities for numerous gamefish species, particularly Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Channel Catfish. With numerous year classes present and plans to continue stocking the lake with Walleye and Northern Pike, Fountain Lake should continue to offer great multi-species angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Kip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

Older age groups were scarce. Bluegills were well established but not abundant. Other species which were abundant, with large increases noted since the last survey included: Black Bullhead, Yellow Perch, Orange-spotted Sunfish, and Green Sunfish. A significant decrease was observed in Common Carp and White Suckers. Seasonal growth for age much less than in Beaver Lake.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Fountain Lake was conducted in the summer of 1999.  This assessment was completed by using overnight trap-net sets along twelve shoreline areas and two nights of shoreline electrofishing.  This survey was scheduled accroding to the most recent DNR lake management plan for Fountain Lake (1997).This assessment, as well as some of the more recent past surveys, showed that the walleye and channel catfish stocking programs are working well in Fountain Lake.  A multiple age, adult population has been developed for both species.  Growth rates for all gamefish species, including largemouth bass, and panfish species (comprised chiefly of black crappie and bluegill) are above statewide averages for each species.  These relatively rapid rates of growth allow fish in Fountain Lake to reach desirable and even trophy sizes.  For example, in this assessment, we captured a largemouth bass that measured 19.5 inches and weighed about 4.5 pounds.  In addition, during previous surveys we have observed walleye up to 28 inches long (7.25 lbs) and channel catfish up to 25 inches long (6.5 lbs).  One lucky angler reportedly landed a walleye measuring 30.5 inches in length that weighed 11.75 pounds in 1996.Fountain Lake also has fewer numbers of northern pike, white crappie and yellow perch.  Bluegill abundance is also considered to be low to average for this type of lake.  Most of these species depend upon the presence of submersed aquatic plants for reproduction.  Turbid water, extensive algae blooms and the relative scarcity of submerged plants are all interrelated factors that limit the abundance and distribution of those species dependent upon aquatic vegetation.  Rough fishes, such as black bullhead and carp, have recently declined in abundance.  However, Fountain Lake still has a relatively large population of both species.Fish tissue sampling has indicated that there is a fish consumption advisory for women of child-bearing age and young children for consuming channel catfish, northern pike, bluegill, walleye, white sucker and carp.  The limitation is one meal per week for those persons who consume fish from the lake on a year round basis.  This limitation is suggested due to mercury and PCB residues found in the above listed species.  Please see the Minnesota Fish Consumption Adivsory published each May by the MN Department of Health for further information.       </p>",
