                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is located approximately 8 miles north of Correll in eastern Big Stone County.  A minimum maintenance road divides the 335 acre lake into north (196 acres) and south (173 acres) basins.  Anglers access the lake from road right-of-ways that border the lake's surface; there is no improved public boat access. This standard survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets and trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Long Lake.  Netting was only conducted in the north basin.   <br> \n <br> \nLong Lake is managed for Walleyes, Black Crappies and Yellow Perch.  The lake is subject to occasional winterkill, most recently in 2011 and 2014 when winterkill eliminated a large portion of the game fish population.  Partial winterkills occurred in 2001 and 2003.  Low winter oxygen levels occurred in 2015, but the game fish population appeared to be unaffected. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were abundant in 2017 and most measured 12-14 inches with some fish up to 19 inches.  The Walleye population has been maintained by fry stocking.  Black Crappie numbers were relatively low and most of them were 8-9 inches.  Yellow Perch numbers were also low.  Black Bullhead and Common Carp numbers were high.  These species are tolerant of low oxygen levels and often thrive in winterkill lakes.  Although, small carp and bullheads can serve as important prey for Walleyes.  <br> \n <br> \nManagement activities for Long Lake include Walleye fry stocking, winter dissolved oxygen monitoring and fish surveys. <br> \n</p>",

A minimum maintenance road divides the lake into north (196 acres) and south (173 acres) basins.  No boat ramp exists and anglers access the lake from roadways.  Fish sampling was only conducted in the north basin.  The south basin is not actively managed for fish.  <br> \n <br> \nThe north basin of Long Lake is managed for walleyes, black crappies and yellow perch.  Low water, drought, early ice and a thick snowpack resulted in low oxygen and winterkill in Long Lake during 2022-2023.  Many dead fish were present at ice out.  Walleye fry were stocked in the spring of 2023 and black crappie and yellow perch will be stocked when available.  In 2023, an assessment was conducted to determine the status of the fish community.  No adult game fish were caught.  Black bullheads, fathead minnows and young-of-the-year walleyes were the only species present.  High numbers of fast-growing young walleyes were found which are expected to provide good fishing within two years. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long is a 335 acre lake that is located approximately 8 miles north of Correll in eastern Big Stone County.  This special assessment was intended to evaluate the extent of winterkill that may have occurred and the survival of 101,648 walleye fry that were stocked in spring 2008.  Two, quarter-inch trap nets and two, three-quarter-inch trap nets were set overnight as the ice was leaving the lake in the spring of 2008.  Although several dead walleye and black crappie were collected from the lake in the spring, the winterkill must not have been complete.  The trap nets caught several species of fish, including black bullhead, walleye, and yellow perch.  However, although black crappie were abundant in trap nets in the fall of 2007, only two were captured by trap nets in the spring of 2008.  Seasonal differences of sampling may explain the differences between the results.  Fall electrofishing for young-of-year (YOY) walleye resulted in a catch rate of 905.5 per hour of electrofishing.  Prior to stocking, walleye fry were marked with oxytetracycline (OTC).  Evaluation of the marks indicated that 100% of the 2008 year class was the result of the stocking.  The YOY walleye had an average length of 7 inches and were in good physical condition (Wr=96).  Oxygen testing throughout the winter of 2008-2009 showed oxygen levels were likely sufficient for the fish populations to survive.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long is a shallow productive lake located in northeast Big Stone County.  Access can be gained in the right-of-way of a Big Stone County road on the west side of the lake.  Water levels of Long Lake increased from approximately 5 feet in the 1980's to 15 feet in the mid-1990's.  An outlet was installed to lower lake levels to a maximum of 10 feet.  Dry conditions in 2002 and 2003 have further lowered lake levels.  A maximum of 8.5 feet was found during the survey in 2003.  A minimum maintainance road now separates the lake into a north and south basin.  A cement culvert would allow for fish passage if water levels increased by a minimum of one foot.  Due to its productive nature, winterkill potential exists for Long Lake, particularily in the south basin.  Monitoring indicated winterkill may have occurred in the south basin during the winter of 2003/2004.  An ice-out investigation will evaluate the extent of winterkill.      Moderate numbers of black crappie and yellow perch were sampled in the north basin in 2003.  Crappie and perch were not sampled in the south basin.  Although individual crappie measured over 13 inches, the vast majority were less than six inches.  All yellow perch sampled measured nine inches or less with most less than six inches.  Black bullhead were abundant and most measured less than eight inches.  Small mesh trap netting, conducted to evaluate natural reproduction in 2003, revealed moderate numbers of young-of-year black crappie, and abundant young-of-year black bullhead and yellow perch.  Other fish species sampled included moderate numbers of common carp and orangespotted sunfish and abundant fathead minnows.     The 2003 Long Lake fishery was considerably different than the one sampled in 1998.  In 1998, yellow perch were abundant and many measured over nine inches.  Black crappie were also abundant and most measured 6-7 inches.  Black bullhead were moderately abundant and mostly measured 9-12 inches.  Bluegill and walleye were caught in 1998 but not in 2003.  Reported high angler success during 1998-2000 reduced abundance of yellow perch, and to a lesser extent black crappie.  According to the 2003 survey, black crappie and yellow perch have not maintained quality populations.  In an attempt to create a more stable and higher quality fishery, walleye fry will be stocked in the spring of 2004.  Fry will be stocked at an icreased rate in the south basin and fingerlings harvested in the fall as part of the accelerated walleye program.  In addition to the fry stocking, other fisheries management activities scheduled for Long Lake include an ice-out evaluation in 2004 to evaluate potential winterkill, annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen, fall evaluation of walleye fry stocking and fisheries population assessment in 2006.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long is a 335 acre lake that is located approximately 8 miles north of Correll in eastern Big Stone County.  During the 1990\u0019s, water levels increased to a depth of 15 feet, resulting in an outlet being placed in the northeast corner of the lake to decrease water levels to 10 feet.  In 2003, a maximum depth of 8.5 feet was recorded.  A minimum maintenance road now divides the lake into north (196 acres) and south (173 acres) basins.  Sampling for this survey was only conducted in the north basin. <br> \n <br> \nLong Lake is primarily managed for yellow perch and black crappie, but in the spring of 2004, walleye fry were stocked to provide additional angling opportunities.  The stocking was successful, and walleyes are abundant.  All of the fish were two years old, with an average length and weight of 12.3 inches and 0.6 lb., respectively.  Walleye were almost 6 inches long after the first year (5.9 inches) and over 11 inches by the second year (11.2 inches).  No young-of-year walleye were sampled in quarter-inch trap nets, indicating no natural reproduction has occurred.  Walleye fry (100,000) are scheduled to be stocked into Long Lake again in the spring of 2007. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were the second-most abundant game fish sampled during the survey.  Yellow perch were quality-sized, averaging a half-pound and almost 10 inches (9.7 inches).  Most of the perch were from the 2003 and 2004 year classes, with fish reaching over 9 inches by age-3.  No young-of-year perch were sampled in quarter-inch trap nets, indicating a missing year-class of perch in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nIn previous years, black crappie have been abundant and provided decent fishing.  However, almost no black crappie were captured during this survey.  Young-of-year black crappie were abundant in 2006.  Future assessments will continue to monitor the success of these fish. <br> \n <br> \nGill net catches of common carp and black bullhead decreased substantially since the last survey in 2003.  The increase in the walleye population may have affected these populations through predation.  Many of the walleyes sampled in 2006 were found to have carp in their stomachs.  Future management activities for Long Lake include winterkill assessments, sampling winter dissolved oxygen, monitoring fishing pressure, and evaluating fish stocking. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is located approximately eight miles north of Correll in eastern Big Stone County.  A minimum maintenance road divides the lake into north (196 acres) and south (173 acres) basins.  No boat ramp exists and anglers access the lake from road right-of-ways. This 2020 Targeted Survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets.  These data can be compared to historical Standard and Targeted Survey data from Long Lake.  Netting was only conducted in the north basin.  The south basin is not actively managed for fish.  <br> \n <br> \nThe north basin of Long Lake is managed for Walleyes, Black Crappies and Yellow Perch.  The lake is subject to occasional winterkill.  Low winter oxygen levels occurred in 2018-2019, but the game fish population appeared to be unaffected. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were abundant in 2020 from a wide range of sizes up to 21 inches.  Four year classes of Walleyes were caught.  Fry stocking has maintained the Walleye population.  Black Crappie numbers were relatively low and most of them were 7-9 inches.  Yellow Perch numbers were low, but some perch larger than 9 inches were present.  Black Bullheads and Common Carp were caught in low numbers.  Small carp and bullheads can be important prey for Walleyes.  <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities for Long Lake will include Walleye fry stocking, winter dissolved oxygen monitoring and fish surveys. <br> \n</p>",

Although public access can be gained through a township road right-of-way, no public boat ramp exists.      Long Lake was less than five feet deep in the late 1980s, and it probably experienced frequent winterkills.  Several years of high precipitation in the 1990s and no outlet resulted in the lake's maximum depth exceeding 15 feet.  This flooded roads along its north end.  To alleviate the flooding, an outlet ditch was constructed at the lake's northeast corner which reduced its maximum depth to approximately 10 feet.     Long Lake had an extremely high yellow perch population in 1998.  Perch have exhibited extremely good natural reproduction in Long Lake and six year classes of them were present.  Moderate numbers of black crappie and black bullhead were present, as were low numbers of bluegill.     Anglers \"discovered\" the yellow perch fishery of Long Lake during the winter of 1998-99.  Extremely high fishing pressure occurred, and anglers harvested high numbers of yellow perch.  Some crappies were also reported caught.</p>",

The most recent assessment in 2017 indicated quality Walleye and Yellow Perch populations were present. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is subject to occasional winterkill, most recently in 2011 and 2014 when winterkill eliminated a large portion of the gamefish population.  Partial winterkills were documented in 2001 and 2003.  Low winter oxygen levels occurred in 2015, but no significant loss of gamefish was apparent. <br> \n <br> \nNear record amounts of snow fell in the area during the winter of 2018-2019.  By late February, dissolved oxygen was less than 1.5 ppm in most of the water column, indicating potential winterkill conditions.  At ice-out, some dead gamefish were observed along shore.   <br> \n <br> \nIn spring, three trap nets were set to check for the presence of gamefish.  Gamefish were abundant in the nets as various sizes of Walleye, Yellow Perch and Black crappie were caught.  Though some dead fish were observed at ice-out, it did not appear winterkill had a large effect on gamefish populations in Long Lake.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a 335 acre lake located approximately 8 miles north of Correll in eastern Big Stone County.  A minimum maintenance road divides the lake into north (196 acres) and south (173 acres) basins.  Sampling was only conducted on the north basin in this investigation.  Although there is not a public boat access on the Long Lake, anglers can gain access to the lake from a county road on the west shore. <br> \n <br> \nLong Lake is primarily managed for walleye, with secondary emphasis on black crappie and yellow perch.   Infrequent winterkill has occurred on Long Lake.  An investigation in 2011 indicated that a severe winterkill had eliminated a large percentage of the game fish population, especially walleye.  Partial winterkills were also noted in 2001 and 2003.  Winter dissolved oxygen concentrations of less than two parts per million were measured in 2013/14 and an ice-out investigation will be conducted to evaluate winterkill severity. <br> \n <br> \nThe Long Lake walleye population has been maintained through stocking.  Walleye were moderately abundant in 2013 and most measured 13 - 15 inches.   One individual walleye over 20 inches was also caught in test nets, but the abundance of larger fish is likely low due to the 2010/11 winterkill.  Black crappie were also moderately abundant with most measuring 6 - 8 inches.  Considering current growth rates for crappie, anglers could expect good numbers of crappie to measure 10 to 11 inches by fall of 2014.  Yellow perch were in low abundance and fairly small, measuring 8 inches or less.  Perch abundance will likely remain low as zero young-of-year perch were caught in 2013 indicating a missing year class. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead and carp abundances were the highest recorded for Long Lake.  The length frequencies of each suggest that their abundances increased following the 2010/11 winterkill.  Predation by walleye may have been controlling recruitment of young-of-year bullhead and carp.  Stomach content analysis of walleye in 2006 indicated small carp were a major food source.   Winterkill eliminated most large walleye and likely allowed for increased recruitment and higher abundances of both bullhead and common carp.  Future assessments will continue to monitor the predator/prey interactions of walleye with bullhead and carp.  Young-of-year black bullhead and carp were not sampled in 2013, indicating weak or missing year classes. <br> \n <br> \nManagement plans for Long Lake include a 2014 ice-out winterkill investigation, 2014 spring stocking of 100,000 walleye fry, fall night electrofishing to evaluate walleye stocking success,  and winter dissolved oxygen monitoring as needed. <br> \n</p>",
