The other was probably a two or three-year-old fish, based on its length.  A change in the weather during the assessment may have contributed to the low 2003 catch.  Wee Lake is entirely inside the BWCAW, and can be difficult to locate.  Fishing pressure is thought to be low to moderate, compared to other stream trout lakes in the area.</p>",
