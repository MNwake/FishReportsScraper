Test nets in 1997 found brook trout abundance in Norway Lake about average when compared to other brook trout lakes in this lake class in the Finland Management Area.  Brook trout averaged 10.6 inches with a maximum size of 12.0 inches.  Normally the larger brook trout in lakes are 3 year old fish, however due to the stocking cycle there were none in the lake at the time of this survey.  Norway Lake has produced brook trout in the 14 to 15 inch range in the past.  Brook trout are stocked every other year.     Splake were sampled in relatively low numbers in 1997 although their size was respectable, ranging from 15.6 inches to 17.9 inches.  Splake are stocked in opposite years of brook trout.</p>",

The lake is open to angling during the stream trout season (lakes) only and possessing live minnows or using them for bait on designated stream trout lakes is prohibited.  Only one line is permitted at any time.  All stream trout must have head, tail, fins and skin intact when being transported.Test nets in 2005 sampled brook trout in average numbers compared to other lakes in this class.  All brook trout were age-1 fish and had a mean length of 8.6 inches.  The largest brook trout sampled was 9.6 inches.  This year class would be expected to spend another season in the lake resulting in some larger fish in 2006.  The majority of the brook trout caught by anglers in NE Minnesota lakes are usually one and two year old fish.  They are relatively short-lived fish and seldom live to 4 years of age in lakes in NE Minnesota.Splake were sampled in average numbers in 2005 and the catch included a few larger fish.  Splake up to 18.8 inches were sampled but the most common size was between 12-14 inches.</p>",

Public access is a 200 yard trail from the parking area at the end of USFS Rd 388.  The maximum lake depth is 19 feet and water clarity is about six feet in brown bog-stained water.  Norway Lake is considered a very soft water lake of low fertility.  During the summer a thermocline is present below five feet and dissolved oxygen is sufficient to about 11 feet.  Muck and decaying organic matter are the most common bottom substrates followed by boulder, ledge rock, rubble and a very limited amount of gravel and sand.  The lake is completely surrounded by US Forest Service land and the shoreline consists of mainly pines.   <br> \n <br> \nNorway Lake receives annual stocking of Splake fingerlings.  The 2015 catch rate of Splake was above average for similar lakes in the Finland Area, with an average weight of 0.65 pounds.  Three year classes were sampled in 2015 with age-2 fish representing 61% of the catch.  Growth for Splake is average compared to other Finland Area Lakes.  The largest fish sampled was 17.4 inches long and weighed 1.9 pounds. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNorway Lake is a fairly popular lake for those angler who like to fish for Splake.  Open water angling is most suitable for anglers with a canoe or float tube.  Shoreline angling available along a majority of the lakeshore as travel is easy through the mature pines.  There is one US Forest Service campsite present about 100 yards north of the access.

                "narrative": "<p>Norway Lake is a 12 acre designated stream trout lake located approximately 18 miles east of Babbitt. The access is located at the end of Forest Service 388 and has a small parking area for two or three vehicles. This road is rough and brushy, a four wheel drive vehicle with good ground clearance is recommended. The access trail is approximately 600 feet long from the parking area to the lake. There is a remote campsite located north of the access on the east shore of the lake. Norway Lake is managed for Splake with 1,000 fingerlings stocked each fall. <br> \n <br> \nA fisheries survey was completed in fall of 2022 to monitor the Splake population and evaluate stocking success. Splake were captured in higher numbers than in the last survey, but the average length was small at approximately 10 inches with the biggest fish measuring 18 inches long. Splake ranged in age from one to four years old with more than 50 percent of the sample estimated to be age-1. At the time of the survey, the average length of age-1 fish was about eight inches, age-2 fish average 11 inches, and age-3 fish ranged from 12 to 15 inches long. Overall, Splake had normal growth relative to other populations in the area. At this time, the lake supports a good population of Splake for anglers to target and the stocking regime appears to be effective. <br> \n</p>",

A survey was completed in 2022 to monitor the amount of cool, well oxygenated habitat available for trout during the summer. Automated temperature loggers were suspended at depths of three, six, eight, and ten feet below the surface over the deepest spot in the lake to record water temperatures hourly throughout the summer. In addition, temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles were collected on several occasions to determine how deep well oxygenated water occurred. <br> \n <br> \nSurvey results indicate summer dissolved oxygen concentrations and water temperatures likely caused stress to the trout in Norway Lake in 2022. Similar surveys completed previously suggest periods of stress are common in summer months, but the lake currently maintains suitable habitat for stream trout throughout the open water season. Habitat conditions will continue to be monitored to evaluate the suitability of Norway Lake for stream trout management. <br> \n</p>",
