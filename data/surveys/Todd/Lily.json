                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey consisting of summer trap netting and nearshore fish sampling was conducted on June 15, 2016 by Fisheries Lake IBI Program staff. Trap netting consisted of three locations on Lily Lake and six locations on Long Lake. Nearshore fish sampling consisted of four stations on Lily Lake and six stations on Long Lake that were evenly spaced apart. Each nearshore fish sampling station was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including species intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Least Darter) as well as two tolerant species (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). Trap nets captured a representative sample of the fish community and Bluegill were the most abundant species. <br> \n <br> \nData from Lily Lake and adjoining Long Lake were combined to calculate a single Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) with data from a standard game fish surveys completed in August 2016 that describes the overall health of the fish community. The combined FIBI score for Lily and Long lakes based on this data is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and indicates a healthy fish community. Data from this survey will be included as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Sauk River watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Panfish provide an important fishery in Lily Lake.  A spring panfish assessment was conducted in early June to evaluate black crappie and bluegill populations in the lake.   Standard summer lake surveys typically do not sample many larger panfish in a lake.  Six lake survey trapnets were set and lifted twice for a total of 12 net lifts.    The two target species as well as gamefish were measured with scales taken from the panfish for age data.  All other fish species were identified and counted. <br> \n      The 2009 panfish assessment netted 60 black crappie (5/trapnet) between 4 and 13 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 8.3 inches with a modal length of 8 - 8.5 inches.  Crappie exceeding 9 inches in length accounted for 23% (n=14) of the catch with 8% (n=5) of the fish more than 10 inches.  The 2003 panfish assessment caught fewer crappie (n=41; 3.4/trapnet) but the sample size structure was more desirable.  Fish measured between 5.7 and 11 inches with a mean length of 8.6 inches.  Modal length was 9 - 9.5 inches with 46% (n=18 exceeding 9 inches and 10% (n=4) more than 10 inches in length.  Although the proportion of larger crappie was less in the 2009 sample, the number of quality crappie caught was about the same in both assessments.  Ages 2 and 4 thru 7 were represented in the 2009 aged sample.  Age 2, 4, and 5 crappie displayed normal growth while the older fish showed fast growth.  The majority of crappie appeared to come from a strong 2005 year class. <br> \n       Bluegill was the most abundant species in the 2009 panfish assessment with 466 (38.8/trapnet) netted.  The length range was from 3 to 9 inches with a mean length of 7.3 inches.  The modal length was an impressive 7.5 - 8 inches.  The majority of the fish in the assessment (63%; n=297) were over 7 inches while 18% of the bluegill (n=84) exceeded 8 inches.   The 2003 panfish assessment caught 963 bluegill (80.3/trapnet) between 3 and 9.9 inches in length.  The size structure of 2003 was not as desirable as the 2009 assessment.  Mean length for the sample was almost an inch less, 6.5 inches, and the modal length was 6.5 - 7 inches.  Smaller bluegill dominated the catch as only 36% (n=346) of the fish exceeded 7 inches in length with 9% (n=84) more than 8 inches.  Although the proportion of larger bluegill was much less in the 2003 spring assessment, the number of bluegill exceeding 7 inches was higher due to the larger sample size.  Ages 2 thru 7 were represented in the 2009 aged sample.  All of the bluegill age groups exhibited fast growth.   Most of the bluegill appeared to be from two strong year classes (2004 and 2005). <br> \n       Spring trapnetting has proven to be an effective method to monitor panfish populations in Lily Lake and this method will continue to be used as a means of assessing panfish quality. <br> \n      An area mean back-calculated length table was used to compare growth rates for the two panfish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Trap netting was performed May 24-26 to provide pre-regulation data on the Bluegill size structure.   A bag limit of 5 sunfish was implemented on March 1, 2021 as Lily Lake was selected for participation in the statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  The objective of the lowered bag limit is to reduce sunfish harvest and allow for more fish to attain larger sizes (8-10 inches).  Data collected during this survey is considered pre-regulation data due to the short time period since the inception of the reduced bag limit. Spring trap netting is the preferred method for evaluating panfish populations and has been conducted on the lake four previous times since 2003.  Several future evaluations relating to the 5 sunfish bag limit are planned over the 10 year evaluation period and will incorporate trap netting to provide proper comparisons. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting in 2021 captured 544 Bluegill.  Sample sizes for Bluegill in Lily Lake have ranged from 323 to 963 fish over the five historical efforts.  Bluegill in 2021 ranged from 3.5 - 10.63 inches and mean length was 7.12 inches.  The Bluegill sizes desired by anglers of fish over 7 inches comprised 62% of the catch and fish greater than 8 inches made up 11% of the sample.   Eight fish over 9 inches were measured (1.3% of sample).  Bluegill 10 inches or greater were last observed in 2016.    Bluegill size structure goals developed for the Quality Sunfish Initiative aim for at least 50% of the sample to exceed 7 inches, 20% to exceed 8 inches, 5% over 9 inches and the persistent presence of fish 10 inches or longer.   Whether voluntary or required due to the reduced bag limit, release of larger sunfish, especially fish over 9 inches will be important if the lake is to realize its potential in reaching management goals.  Additional criteria that may be used to measure success of the reduced sunfish bag limit include: mean size, catch rate of fish over 8 inches, and mean length of top 10% of fish.  When combining the five pre-regulation spring trap net surveys, mean size is 6.96 inches, mean catch rate of fish over 8 inches is 6.5/net, and mean length of the top 10% is 8.59 inches.  Otoliths were extracted during spring electrofishing in 2020 with aging of these structures indicating that Bluegill grow well, attaining 7.1 inches at Age 5 and 8.3 inches at Age 7.   <br> \n   <br> \nSpring trap nets have produced Black Crappie catches that have ranged from 41 to 132 fish since this type of sampling began in 2003.  The 2021 effort provided a sample of 108 fish ranging from 4.4 to 13.2 inches in length.   Fish 10 inches or longer comprised 28% of the catch and mean length was 8.73 inches.  Crappies 12 inches or better have been sampled in each spring trap net assessment since 2009.  The crappie bag limit remains at 10 fish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Lily is a small lake which is part of the Fairy Lake chain north of Sauk Centre.  The lake is best known for its bluegill fishery.  Anglers access the lake via the outlet from the township road between Fairy and Lily Lakes.  Parking can at times be a concern when the fish are biting.  Water clarity was good and submergent vegetation grew to a depth of 15 feet.  Flatstem pondweed was the most abundant submergent species and filamentous algae was common on the vegetation.  Sand was the most common shallow water substrate.  Lily Lake lies within an agricultural watershed, but the lake does have some buffering along its shoreline in the form of deciduous forests and marshes.  Part of the lakeshore is in cattle pasture which has lead to some bank erosion and nutrient loading. <br> \n       Angling opportunities in the lake exist for species such as bluegill, black crappie, northern pike, and largemouth bass as well as three species of bullhead.  Although the summer gillnet survey had less than expected species diversity and numbers, there does appear to be enough northern pike that it should not be a challenge to catch one.  A variety of sizes were recorded in the survey with a fair number of the fish being over 24 inches.  A panfish  assessment was conducted in early June of 2009 which targeted bluegill and black crappie.   Bluegill over 7 inches were common in the assessment with some over 8 inches.   While the black crappie were not as plentiful as the bluegill in the panfish assessment, there were a fair number caught.   Average size of crappie was 8 inches in both the summer survey and spring assessment, although the spring assessment showed the presence of fish over 11 inches.  Spring electrofishing indicates the lake has a moderate number of largemouth bass.  Average size was about 12 inches which is what most anglers catch, but there were some bass over 15 inches observed.   <br> \n       A single tullibee or cisco was netted which likely was a migrant from Fairy Lake.  Yellow bullhead was the most numerous of the three bullhead species which could be a indicator of good water clarity.  Yellow bullhead are much less tolerant of turbid water than black bullhead.   Many of the yellow bullhead caught were over 11 inches in length.  Some additional fish species caught in the panfish assessment included bowfin or dogfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n       Although there is some development on the lake, most of the homes are set back from the shoreline.  Long Lake to the north of Lily appears to filter most of the run-off resulting from the agricultural and dairy land practices in the watershed.   Maintaining the emergent vegetation stands around the lake as well as the dense submergent vegetation beds should help to preserve the water quality in Lily Lake.   With the small size of the lake, land use practices in the immediate watershed around the lake could have a negative impact on water quality.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small northern pike under 24 inches and release the larger fish to improve quality in the population as well as work toward a more balanced fish community.  Voluntarily limiting harvest of the large panfish will also help sustain the quality and balance of those populations.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Panfish provide an important fishery on Lily Lake all year-round.   Lily shares a broad connection with Long Lake with similar species of fish present, but differing size structures.  A spring panfish assessment was conducted in mid-June to evaluate populations of the two primary management species; Black Crappie and Bluegill.  Standard summer lake surveys typically do not sample many larger panfish which may be present.  Six lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice for a total of twelve net lifts in the spring assessment.  The two target species as well as game fish were measured and scales collected from the panfish for age data.  All other fish species were identified and counted.  Similar assessments were conducted during early June in 2009 and 2003. <br> \n       The 2013 panfish assessment netted 64 Black Crappie (5.3/TN) between 6.6 and 12.7 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 8.6 inches with a modal length of 7.5 - 8 inches.  Fish exceeding nine inches comprised 25% (n=16) of the sample with 20% (n=13) more than ten inches and 6% (n=4) over twelve inches in length.  Sixty crappie were caught in the 2009 panfish assessment.  The fish measured from four to thirteen inches with a mean length of 8.4 inches and modal length of 8 - 8.5 inches.  Fish more than nine inches accounted for 23% (n=14) of the catch with 8% (n=5) more than ten inches and 5% (n=3) over twelve inches in length. <br> \n       Fewer Black Crappie (n=40; 3.4/TN) were caught in the 2003 panfish assessment but fish over nine inches were more prevalent.   Those more than nine inches in length comprised 44% (n=18) of the catch with 10% (n=4) exceeding ten inches.  Both the 2013 and 2009 panfish assessments met the lake management goal of five or more crappie per trap net and the 2013 and 2003 assessment met the goal of 10% of the spring catch exceeding ten inches in length. <br> \n      Ages 3 through 8 were represented in the 2013 spring trap net assessment.   The 2010 year class accounted for 53% of the sample strongly influencing mean and modal lengths.  Growth rates were normal for most of the age groups when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  The low number of crappie over four years of age suggests high mortality once the fish reach four years old.   <br> \n      Bluegill was the most abundant species in the 2013 panfish assessment with 324 (26.9/TN) netted.   The fish were between 3.4 and 9.8 inches in length with a mean length of 6.4 inches and modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches for the sample.  Bluegill exceeding seven inches in length accounted for 36% (n=116) of the sample with 8% (n=28) more than eight inches and 1% (n=5) over nine inches.  More Bluegill (n=466; 38.8/TN) were caught in the 2009 panfish assessment and the sample size structure was more desirable.  Although the longest Bluegill was only 9.1 inches, the mean length for the sample was 7.3 inches and modal length was 7.5 - 8 inches.  Fish more than seven inches comprised 64% (n=297) of the catch with 18% (n=84) exceeding eight inches and 1% (n=5) over nine inches. <br> \n       The 2003 panfish assessment had the highest Bluegill catch of the three panfish assessments in Lily Lake.  A total of 963 Bluegill (80.2/TN) ranging from 3.3 to 9.9 inches in length were caught.  A sample size structure similar to 2013 was displayed by the 2003 catch; a mean length of 6.5 inches and modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches.  Also 36% (n=346) of the fish exceeded seven inches in length with 9% (n=84) more than eight inches and 1% (n=10) over nine inches.   <br> \n       The 2003 panfish assessment was the only assessment to produce a trap net catch which met the lake management goal of forty or more Bluegill per trap net while the 2009 panfish assessment was the only one to meet the goal of at least 50% of the fish caught being more than seven inches in length.  All of the assessments met the third goal of having the presence nine inch Bluegill in the catch. <br> \n       Ages 2 through 8 and 10 were represented in the 2013 spring panfish assessment.   Three year classes from 2010 to 2008 accounted for the majority of the fish (82%), the highest number from 2009 (31%).  All of the age groups displayed fast growth with the Bluegill reaching eight inches in length by age 6.  Year class strengths suggest consistent recruitment. <br> \n       Two game fish species were also netted in the 2013 panfish assessment, fifteen Northern Pike and one Largemouth Bass.   The pike measured from 12.2 to 24.8 inches in length while the lone bass was just over thirteen inches.  Other fish species caught included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lily Lake is a small (62 acre) bass/panfish lake located near Sauk Centre, MN.   Access facilities are somewhat limited as launching is done off of a gravel road and no dock or concrete ramp is present.   A five (5) fish bag limit on sunfish is scheduled for implementation on March 1, 2021 as Lily Lake has been selected for participation in the statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  The lower bag limit is intended to reduce the harvest of sunfish while improving the sizes of sunfish available to anglers.  The goal is to have the lake produce more 7 to 9 inch sunfish which are most desired by anglers.  Evaluations of lakes that have had similar reduced bag limits for several years have shown that most respond favorably and produce larger sunfish.  Spring trap netting is the preferred method for evaluating Bluegill populations, however electrofishing was employed due to staff/time shortages resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.  Daytime electrofishing was performed on May 27, 2020 to provide pre-regulation data on the Bluegill size structure.  Future evaluations relating to the 5 sunfish bag limit will incorporate trap netting to provide proper comparisons. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing appeared to be a highly efficient sampling method with 197 fish captured in just over 11 minutes of on-time.   Bluegills appeared to be just in the initial phase of spawning or pre-spawn and were in the shallows in large, highly visible schools.  Electrofished Bluegill ranged from 3.3 - 9.0 inches in length with most length groups well represented up to 9 inches.   Fish over 7 inches comprised 47% of the catch and quality size Bluegill were present with fish over 8 inches making up 9% of the sample.  Otoliths were extracted from a sample of Bluegills for aging purposes.  Ages 2-9 were found in the sample with Age 5 comprising over 60% of the catch.  Lily Lake Bluegills displayed good growth with 5 year old fish averaging 7.1 inches and sustained growth through 9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPrevious spring trap net surveys were conducted in 2003, 2009, 2013 and 2016.  Trap nets have provided larger sample sizes of 323 to 963 fish.  The 2016 spring trap net assessment results showed the most impressive Bluegill size structure with 74% of the catch over 7 inches, more than 32% greater than 8 inches and nearly 5% over 9 inches.  Maximum length was 10.16 inches.  Bluegill over 7 inches in previous trap net efforts comprised 30-64% of the catch and fish over 9 inches have been observed in all spring sampling efforts. <br> \n <br> \nWhile fishing for sunfish it is best to limit your take of the large individuals, especially the males.  The large males exhibit the best growth rates and also inhibit smaller and slower growing males from spawning.  Studies have shown that it is important for sunfish to use their resources for growth instead of reproduction at younger ages and smaller sizes.  Male Bluegill can usually be discerned from females by their brighter coloration and darker orange bellies. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were spawning in good numbers in several locations and would have made easy sampling targets if warranted.     <br> \n</p>",

AGES I THROUGH VII WERE PRESENT IN THE CATCH EXCEPT FOR AGE VI.  AGES I AND II SHOWED FAST GROWTH WHILE AGES III THROUGH VII DEMONSTRATED AVERAGE GROWTH.  AGE II FISH REPRESENTED 59% OF THE CATCH IN 1991.  YEP WHICH WERE LOW IN NUMBER IN 1986 (.5/SET), WERE NOT REPRESENTED IN THE 1991 CATCH INDICATING THE POPULATION REMAINS LOW.  THIS PROBABLY IS DUE TO THE HIGH NUMBERS OF NOP IN THE FISH COMMUNITY. BLC TRAPNET CATCHES INCREASED FIVE-FOLD FROM 1/SET IN 1986 TO 5.33/SET IN 1991.  MEAN WEIGHT DECREASED SLIGHTLY FROM .37 LBS/FISH TO .29 LBS/ FISH.  AGES II THROUGH V WERE REPRESENTED IN THE CATCH WITH AGE II FISH (48%) AND AGE III FISH (39%) DOMINATING.  ONE 13.6 INCH BLC, AGED BY OTOLITH, WAS FOUND TO BE 16 YEARS OLD.  ONE LMB (13 WERE OBSERVED IN THE 1986 SURVEY.  FOUR YOUNG-OF- YEAR WERE SAMPLED IN THE NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECK, INDICATING NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS OCCURRING.  TRAPNET CATCHES FOR BLG INCREASED TEN- FOLD FROM 2.33/SET IN 1986 TO 23.33/SET IN 1991. MEAN WEIGHT DECREASED FROM .26 LBS/FISH IN 1986 TO .14 LBS/FISH.  PMK TRAPNET CATCHES DECREASED FROM 3.33/SET IN 1986 TO 0.33/SET IN 1991.  CATCH RATES FOR YEB INCREASED TEN-FOLD FROM .33/SET IN 1986 TO 3.33/SET IN 1991 WHILE MEAN WEIGHT WAS UNCHANGED AT .7 LBS/FISH.  BRB AND BOF WERE NOT REPRESENTED IN THE TRAPNET CATCHES IN 1991 INDICATING THEIR NUMBERS REMAIN LOW.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lily Lake is part of the Fairy Lake chain north of Sauk Centre best known forits bluegill fishing.  Anglers access the lake via the outlet from the townshiproad between Fairy and Lily Lakes.  Water clarity was excellent for a lake incentral Minnesota and vegetation grew out depths of 17 feet.       Angling opportunities in the lake include such species as northern pike,bluegills, black crappies, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullheads. Northern pike numbers have declined some from the last survey, but continue to highfor the lake.  Most of the fish sampled were from 20 to 23 inches in length. Yellow perch appear to have disappeared or are extremely low in numbers.  Perch arean important prey species for northern pike and walleye.  With no perch available,northern pike will use bluegill and black crappies as food.  Typically, pikepopulations with a main prey base of panfish tend to show slower growth.  Thelargemouth bass population appears to be moderate in numbers with an average sizeof 12 to 14 inches.  Bluegill abundance appears normal for the lake type.  Theaverage size caught during the survey was 5 to 6 inches, while anglers were findingplenty of fish from 6 to 7 inches.  Pumpkinseeds were less numerous and smallerthan the bluegills.  Black crappies are common and while most are less than nineinches in length, the lake will occasionally give up one over eleven inches. Hybrid sunfish were low for the lake type.  Bowfin or dogfish and yellow bullheadnumbers were at normal levels.  Many of the yellow bullheads were around 12 inchesin length with some measuring up to 14 inches.     Many of the northern pike and bluegills were infested with neascus.  Neascusis a black trematode or parasite. The life cycle goes from snails to fish tomaturing in fish-eating bird, such as herons. Humans cannot be infested.  Skinningthe fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.     Lily Lake is a small lake with light development.  The major source of watercomes from the north through Long Lake.  Although agriculture and dairy farming areprimary land use practices in the watershed, most of the nutrients appear to befiltered out by Long Lake before reaching Lily Lake.  Because of the small size ofLily Lake, land use practices in the immediate watershed around the lake could havea direct impact on water quality.  Harvest of small northern pike and release ofthe larger fish is encouraged to improve quality in the population and a morebalanced fish community.</p>",
