                "narrative": "<p>Boedigheimer Lake is a 176-acre moderately fertile lake located in central Otter Tail County, approximately five miles south of the city of Perham, MN.  It has a maximum depth of 26 feet and 53% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 13.5 feet.  Readings from previous surveys ranged from 8.0 to 14.0 feet.  An inlet from Marion Lake is located on the west end of the lake and an outlet to Rush Lake is located on the east end.  A public access is located on the south shoreline.     Moderate development exists around Boedigheimer Lake.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattail, and wild rice) is present in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They are also important nursery areas for all fish species.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Boedigheimer Lake contains good populations of game fish.  Northern pike are abundant with some fish approaching thirty inches in length.  Pike ranged in length from 13.4 to 29.5 inches with an average length and weight of 18.4 inches and 1.4 pounds.  The bluegill population is abundant and well balanced; nine year classes were sampled.  Size structure is excellent with 46% of the bluegills seven inches or greater in length.  The black crappie population is also well balanced; eight year classes were sampled with 43% of the population ten inches or greater in length.  Largemouth bass sampled from a spring electrofishing assessment ranged in length from 8.4 to 16.7 inches, indicating consistent year classes are produced.  The average length and weight of bass was 10.0 inches and 0.6 pounds.  Walleye have never been stocked in Boedigheimer Lake.  The walleye population present in the lake is maintained by fish migration via an inlet from Marion Lake and an outlet to Rush Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 15.9 to 20.5 inches.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant small fish.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boedigheimer Lake is a 176-acre moderately fertile lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately five miles south of the city of Perham, MN.  It has a maximum depth of 26 feet and 53% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 10.0 feet.  Readings from previous surveys ranged from 8.0 to 14.0 feet.  An inlet from Marion Lake is located on the west end of the lake and an outlet to Rush Lake is located on the east end.  A public access is located on the south shoreline.     Moderate development exists around Boedigheimer Lake.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattail, and wild rice) is present in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They are also important nursery areas for all fish species.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Boedigheimer Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present in the lake.     A high-density northern pike population exists.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 12.9 to 27.6 inches with an average length and weight of 18.0 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 18.8 inches at four years of age.       The bluegill population is abundant and well balanced.  Five year classes were sampled and age data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Size structure has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Forty-six percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age.     Largemouth bass sampled from a spring electrofishing assessment ranged in length from 6.2 to 14.9 inches.  Age data indicate that consistent year classes are produced.  Bass attain an average length of 13.5 inches at four years of age.       Walleye have never been stocked in Boedigheimer Lake.  The walleye population present in the lake is maintained by fish migration via an inlet from Marion Lake and an outlet to Rush Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 16.2 to 24.2 inches.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant small fish.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",
