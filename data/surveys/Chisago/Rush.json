Eighteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by electrofishing, and/or seining. Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish; Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Green Sunfish, Muskellunge, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Spotfin Shiner, Banded Killifish, Bowfin, Central Mudminnow, Yellow Bullhead, and Tadpole Madtom. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from the June 2019 lake survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for East Rush Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. East Rush Lake is located in the Lower St. Croix River Watershed. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Rush Lake is a 1,480-acre lake located in northern Chisago County.  Much of the lake is less than 15 feet (1,033 acres or 70%), and the maximum depth is 24 feet.  Water clarity is low, with visibility to only 2 feet.  A high amount of shoreline development is present.  Primary management species include Walleye, Muskellunge, and Northern Pike, while Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass are secondary management species. To assess the current fish population and stocking efforts, a lake survey was conducted in August with gill and trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gillnet catch rate was 3.3 per net, an increase from the 2019 catch rate of 2.6 per net, and the same as the average.  Sampled Walleye (gill and trap nets combined) ranged from 12.2 to 27.0 inches and had an average length of 19.2 inches.  Currently the Walleye population is average in number and size. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gillnet catch rate was 6.5 per net, compared to 4.0 per net in 2019.  The pike population is presently at a high level.  The 2023 gillnet catch of 78 pike was the highest number sampled dating back to 1972.  Sampled pike (gill and trap nets combined) ranged from 15.3 to 37.0 inches and had an average length of 27.1 inches.  The current regulation (26 to 40-inch protected slot, one over 40 inches, 3 fish bag limit) appears to have increased the number of fish over 30 inches.  Thirty-two percent of pike were 30 inches or longer.  Pike over 40 inches are rare, as only one has been sampled between all lake surveys. Thirty-one percent of the pike sampled were below 26 inches, which indicates there is a good number of harvestable sized pike. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, primary prey species for both Northern Pike and Walleye, have historically had high catch rates. The 2023 gillnet catch rate was lower than previous surveys, and one of the lower catches dating back to 1972.  The gillnet catch rate was 19.4 per net, compared to 31.1 per net in 2019.  However, the average length improved and was 8.2 inches.  Sampled perch ranged from 4.7 to 11.3 inches. There remains a good number of perch to provide prey for game fish.  Overall, 64% of perch were 8 inches or larger, so there is also a high percentage of harvestable size fish. <br> \n <br> \nGill net catches of Black Crappie indicated numbers were high.  The 2023 catch was the highest, both by rate and number.  A total of 670 crappie were sampled, which resulted in a catch rate of 55.8 per net.  The catch rate was above the average of 23.3 per net.  Sampled crappie (trap and gill nets combined) ranged in length from 4.3 to 11.4 inches, with 5.0 to 5.5 inch crappies most commonly sampled.  The average length was 6.6 inches.  Although crappie numbers are high, the average size is currently low. <br> \n <br> \nThere was a total of 135 Bluegill caught in the trap nets, which resulted in a catch rate of 11.3 per net.  This was slightly below the average catch rate for the lake.  Sampled Bluegill (trap and gill nets combined) ranged from 2.2 to 9.4 inches and had an average length of 6.3 inches.  The most commonly sampled lengths were 7.0 to 8.0 inches.  Nineteen percent were over 8 inches, while only one was over 9 inches.  Currently, the Bluegill population is fairly balanced. <br> \n <br> \nNo spring electrofishing was conducted for Largemouth Bass.  There were two bass sampled in gill nets and three in trap nets.  The two bass from gill nets were 13.4 and 13.5 inches, while the three from trap nets were 12.6, 17.0, and 17.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA Muskellunge spawning survey scheduled for spring 2023 was rescheduled to spring 2024 due to the lack of staff capacity. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the fishing on East Rush Lake for many species should be good.  The Walleye population appears to be near the long-term average with a good average size. Northern Pike numbers are currently up, and a good percentage are 30 inches and longer.  Good numbers of nice sized perch are present.  There is a very high number of crappie although they are currently small.  Bluegill number and size is average.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Rush is a 1,359-acre lake managed for walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge.  East Rush is assigned to lake class 24.  Lakes in class 24 are moderately deep and highly fertile.  Muskie and walleye populations are maintained through stocking, although walleye natural reproduction is common.  Biennial fall fingerling stocking is conducted for both species but in alternate years.  Additionally, walleye fry were stocked annually in the spring from 2000 to 2004.  The long-range population goals for walleyes and northerns, as indexed by test netting, are 5 and 2 per gillnet lift respectively with a 4 pound mean for northerns.  Muskellunge are indexed in separate spring trapnetting assessments.  In order to assess population goals and the current stocking protocol, East Rush Lake was surveyed in August of 2007. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 5.1 per lift with an average weight of 3.6 pounds.  The catch exceeded the management goal and the 2002 value.   Abundance was normal for lake class 24 but the mean size was high.  Sampled northerns ranged from 18.4 to 37.0 inches with a 25.4 inch mean.  The 2007 catch was slightly higher than the 30 year average for East Rush Lake.  The nine trapnetted northerns averaged 29.4 inches and ranged from 15.5 to 41.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were sampled at a rate of 5.3 per gillnet which is in the normal range for lake class 24.  The walleye catch increased since 2002 and met the lake management goal.  Fish were acceptable size having a mean weight of 2.1 pounds and a 19.5 inch modal length.  The 30 year average for East Rush Lake is 2.7 walleyes per gillnet lift.  Night electrofishing in October failed to sample any walleye hatched in 2007.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, a primary forage for both northerns and walleyes, have historically been moderate in abundance. The 2007 catch was no exception with the catch rate, 21.8/set, falling within the lake class norm. However perch in East Rush were larger than in most class 24 lakes.  One third of the sample exceeded 8 inches. These fish should provide additional harvest opportunity for anglers, while a fairly even distribution of perch between 5 and 7 inches should provide ample forage for game fish. <br> \n  <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was normal in the trapnets but high in the gillnets.  Sampled crappie were smaller on average than in the past assessment with relatively few fish over 9 inches.  Overall crappie averaged 6.9 inches and 0.2 pounds with a range from 4.1 to 10.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were normal in both abundance (13.5/trapnet) and size (0.2 pounds) for lake class 24.  The 2007 catch was down from the unusually high catch in 2002.  Sampled bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 8.5 inches.  One fourth of the sample exceeded 7 inches, an acceptable size to some anglers. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance was first indexed in 1997 using night electrofishing.  In 2007, bass abundance was once again moderate, at 27.3 per hour of sampling.  Although abundance was similar to the 2002 assessment, size slipped some with an average of 11.3 inches and 1 pound.  Lengths ranged from 7.3 to 17.9 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Rush Lake is a large (1480 acre) lake in northern Chisago County. It is connected by a navigable channel to West Rush Lake, but the two lakes are very different in structure. East Rush is shallower, with a maximum depth of 24 feet, and more windswept. Algae blooms can result in low water clarity in late summer. The two lakes are managed primarily for walleye, muskellunge, and northern pike, with black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass as the secondary species. A fish population assessment was conducted in 2011 using large trap nets, electrofishing, and gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the fishing on East Rush Lake for many species should be quite good.  There are good numbers of yellow perch, black crappie, bluegill, walleye, largemouth bass, and northern pike based on sampling with gill nets, trap nets, large trap nets, and electrofishing.  Muskies are present in low numbers, but a good proportion of large (>40 inch) muskies are present. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch in 2011 was down from the last assessment in 2007, but numbers were still within the normal range for this lake type and above the long term average for East Rush Lake. A variety of sizes are present, with even an occasional 30\" and larger walleye. Although some spawning takes place, the walleye population is primarily a result of stocking. <br> \n <br> \nMuskie were sampled using large trap nets set in early spring after ice out. Total numbers of muskie sampled were up from 2006 but the overall catch rate (number per net) was down. Muskies up to 52 inches were sampled. A 48 inch minimum length regulation appears to be working to increase the numbers of muskie over 40 inches in the lake. Muskie fingerling stocking, which had been every other year in the past, was recently changed to allow for annual stocking, with an increase in the overall number of fish stocked.  <br> \n <br> \nA 24-36 inch protected slot regulation for northern pike has been in place since 2005 on East Rush Lake. This regulation is intended to increase the numbers of larger pike. Numbers of northern pike in gill nets were down from 2007 but still good for this lake type. The average length of northern pike was 25 inches in gill nets and 29 inches in large trap nets, which also sampled northerns up to almost 40 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe number of largemouth bass sampled by electrofishing at night in late spring has been increasing since electrofishing was first used in 1997. The 2011 catch was 49 per hour, which is good although less than the numbers seen in some other Chisago County lakes. Lengths up to 20 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were abundant in gill nets in 2011. Sizes tend to run small, with few fish over 9 inches present. Bluegill numbers were moderate, with some good size bluegills in the 7-8 inch range. Other fish species sampled included bigmouth buffalo, bowfin, common carp, freshwater drum, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and smallmouth bass. Yellow perch are abundant and provide a good food supply for larger predator fish.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Rush Lake is one of two distinctly different basins that make up Rush Lake.  This moderately shallow (maximum depth = 24 feet) 1359 acre lake is managed primarily for muskellunge and walleye and secondly for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill and northern pike.       During the winter of 1995/1996 and the summer of 1996, an angler survey (creel survey) was conducted on East Rush Lake (MN DNR 1998).  A creel survey is a type of survey that counts the number of anglers along with their catch and time spent fishing to estimate the fishing pressure on a lake and the total harvest of fish.  Total fishing pressure during the 1995/1996 winter (December 1 - March 31) creel survey was 21,668 angler hours (15.96 angler hours/acre).  Total pounds of all fish species harvested was calculated at 8266 pounds (6.08 lbs./acre).  The 1996 open water season (May 1 - September 30) had a total of 31,200 angler hours (23.0 angler hours/acre), while the total pounds harvested of all species combined was determined to be 4958 pounds (3.65 lbs./acre).  Northern pike followed by walleye and sunfish were the most frequently sought after species   during the open water season survey of 1996.         Fish stocking in East Rush Lake dates back to the early 1900's, which consisted of sporadic stocking of such species as northern pike, largemouth bass, crappie, sunfish, walleye, and muskellunge.  Annual walleye fingerling stocking began in 1972 and extended to 1993 with the exception of 1976, 1985 and 1988.  In 1993, the lake management plan was amended to include alternate year walleye fingerling stocking, since allowing gaps in stocking frequency is necessary to evaluate natural reproduction success.  Muskellunge fingerling or yearling stocking began in 1968 with the Shoepac strain and continued through 1982.  From 1983-1985, the Wisconsin strain were stocked and all subsequent stocking (1989 to present) consisted of Leech Lake strain.  A few gaps occurred during the above years, but annual stocking is now in place.     A population assessment was conducted on East Rush Lake during the week of August 25, 1997 to assess the fish population status.  Standard sampling gear utilized during the survey included ten gillnets, eight trapnets, night electrofishing (May 29, 1997) and shoreline seining (September 17, 1997).       Walleye numbers have increased since 1992, but were considered to be at a normal level for this type of lake.  The average size, at 2.1 pounds, was also within the normal range.  Walleye lengths ranged from 8.3 to 25.9 inches with an average length 17.0 inches.  East Rush Lake showed normal growth when compared to statewide averages.  Age determination from scale samples indicate that fish ages ranged from 1-9 years old.  During the 1997 survey, walleye (4 fish) from non-stocked years were present.  Previous surveys also reported the presence of walleye during non-stocked years.  Hence, the walleye population in East Rush Lake is composed of both stocked and natural fish, which remains consistent with earlier evaluations of the fishery.  Further information will be necessary to assess the contribution of natural fish to the population.  The northern pike were average in abundance, but above average in weight (4.2 lbs.).  The 1997 abundance was the highest recorded since 1957, while above average weight has been common during the past.  Total lengths ranged from 19.4 to 38.9 inches with an average length of 26.4 inches.  The largest fish captured, at 38.9 inches (approx. 16.8 lbs.), was 8 years of age.  Of the 52 fish measured 67% were 25 inches or greater in length.  Northern pike in East Rush Lake showed above average growth for ages 2-4 and 6-8, while growth at ages 1 and 5 were normal.      Largemouth bass numbers appear to be moderately low.  The average weight was 1.9 pounds, while lengths ranged between 9.8 and 18.1 inches with an average length of 13.9 inches.  Bluegill numbers were below normal for this type of lake, however, this was the highest ever documented abundance.  Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 5.7 inches and the average length was determined to be 3.8 inches.     The black crappie abundance along with average weight (0.1 lbs.) during the 1997 survey was within the normal range when compared to similar lakes.  Sizes ranged from 4.3 to 10.0 inches in length and an average length of 5.9 inches was calculated.      Yellow perch numbers and average weight (0.2 lbs.) were within the normal range.  The yellow perch collected ranged from 5.2 to 9.6 inches in length with an average length of 7.0 inches.      In addition to the above species, eight other species were also collected during the 1997 assessment (common carp, freshwater drum, golden shiner, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow, brown and black bullhead).  Of these species, the common carp and pumpkinseed sunfish catch were within the normal range, while freshwater drum, golden shiner, white sucker, and yellow, brown and black bullhead abundance were below normal for this lake type. Freshwater drum abundance has been decreasing since 1985 and continues to decline.        Shoreline seining for young-of-the-year fish showed that natural reproduction for bluegill was very successful in 1997 and some success was found for yellow perch and largemouth bass.

                "narrative": "<p>East Rush is a 1,359 acre lake managed for walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge.  East Rush is assigned to lake class 24.  Lakes in class 24 are moderately deep and highly fertile.  Muskie and walleye populations are maintained through stocking, although walleye natural reproduction is common.  Biannual fall fingerling stocking is conducted for both species but in alternate years.  Additionally, walleye fry will be stocked annually through the spring of 2005.  The long range population goals for walleyes and northerns, as indexed by test netting, are 5 and 2 per gillnet lift respectively with a 4 pound mean for northerns.  Muskellunge are indexed in seperate spring trapnetting assessments.  In order to assess population goals and the current stocking protocal, East Rush Lake was surveyed in August of 2002.The northern pike gillnet catch was 4.3 per lift with an average weight of 3.7 pounds.  The catch exceeded the management goal.   Abundance was normal for lake class 24 but the mean size was high.  Sampled northerns ranged from 18 to 33.7 inches with a 25.5 inch mean.  The 2002 catch was slightly higher than the 30 year average for East Rush Lake.  The 1997 year class was dominate, representing more than half the northern catch.Walleyes were sampled at a rate of 3.3 per gillnet which is in the normal range for lake class 24.  Although the walleye catch did not meet the lake management goal, fish were quality size averaging 2.1 pounds with one third of the catch greater than 20 inches.  The 1997 catch was very similar while the 30 year average was 2.7 walleyes per gillnet lift.  The 1999 year class, the result of yearling stocking in 2000, was the most abundant. Night electrofishing in September sampled walleye hatched in 2002.  These young walleye could be attributed to either fry stocking or natural reproduction.Yellow perch are a primary forage for both northerns and walleyes.  Their abundance in East Rush has historically been moderate.  The 2002 catch was the exception with a very high catch rate of 137.4 per gillnet.  Size was within the lake class norm with a 7.4 inch average.  A good distribution of perch between 5 and 7 inches should provide ample forage for gamefish,  while the 10% of the catch that exceeded 8 inches should provide additional harvest opportunty for anglers.Black crappie abundance was normal in both the trapnets and gillnets.  Sampled crappie were larger than in the past 3 assessments.  Overall crappie averaged 8.2 inches and 1/3 of a pound with a range from 5.2 to 14.5 inches.  Bluegill were normal in both abundance (23.8/trapnet) and size (0.2 pounds) for lake class 24.  The 2002 catch was unusual high for East Rush.  The highest previous catch was 6.8 per trapnet.  Sampled bluegill ranged from 3.4 to 8.9 inches.  Twenty percent of the sample exceeded 7 inches, an acceptable size to some anglers.The samples of all three panfish species were dominated by 2 and 3 year old fish.  Perch and crappie growth was faster than expected. Largemouth bass abundance was first indexed in 1997 using night electrofishing.  Bass abundance was moderate at 26.3 per hour of sampling, an increase from 11.7 in 1997.  Largemouth also exhibited good growth with strong 1997 and 1999 year classes.   Bass were quality sized averaging 13.1 inches and 1.6 pounds. Shoreline seining sampled young of the year bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.  Other species sampled during the survey included black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, common carp, freshwater drum, emerald shiner, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead.   </p>",

The lake is managed primarily for walleye, muskellunge, and northern pike, with black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass as the secondary species. <br> \n <br> \nA muskellunge assessment was conducted on East Rush Lake from April 9 to 26 2012. The primary reason for this assessment was to calculate a population estimate by recapturing fish that were marked in 2011.  A total of 17 fish were caught including one same-year recapture.  The catch consisted of 6 males, 4 females, and 6 immature fish.  The length range of all fish was 11.2 to 50.1 inches. Male average length was 40.9 inches, with a length range from 34.5 to 44.4 inches. Male average weight was 16.2 pounds, with a weight range from 9.7 to 20.9 pounds. Female average length was 45.8 inches, with a length range from 35.9 to 51.0 inches. Female average weight was 23.1 pounds, with a weight range from 11.5 to 32.6 pounds.  Immature fish had a length range of 11.2 to 14.3 inches.   <br> \nRelative weight (Wr), a measure of the condition of a fish, was calculated for all adult fish using an equation specific to Leech Lake strain muskellunge in East and West Rush Lakes. A Wr of 100 or greater means that a fish's weight is appropriate for its length.  All 10 of the adult fish caught in East Rush Lake had a relative weight above 80, eight had a Wr over 90, and two had a Wr over 100.  The average Wr was 96, indicating that overall, fish were in relatively good condition. <br> \n <br> \n The Peterson formula was used to calculate a population estimate.  In 2011 38 fish were marked. In 2012 10 adult fish were caught including 2 recaptures from last year.  This gives an estimated population of 143 fish, with upper and lower 95% confidence limits of 358 and 52 respectively.  This is a density of 0.11 fish per acre.  <br> \n  <br> \nOverall, the opportunity to catch a musky in this lake may be lower than in some lakes, but chances of catching a nice fish here are good, as 70 percent of the fish caught were 40 inches or larger and fish over 50 inches were present. <br> \n</p>",

The muskellunge was near its median figure in the gillnet (0.20) and the trapnet (0.25) with an average weight per fish of 11.28 pounds. The northern pike was low at 1.30 per set but averaging 5.54 lbs.  The yellow perch was slightly low at 17.40 per set while the golden shiner at 1.20 was low. The largemouth bass (0.13) and the white crappie (1.88) were low while the bluegill (1.38) and the black crappie (0.75) were extremely low.  The pumpkinseed was very low as were all species of bullhead. The white sucker was low while the northern redhorse and carp were only slightly above their local median figures. The freshwater drum was very high at 20.60 per gillnet set.  NOTE:  As compared to the 1982 resurvey, there was a significant decrease in the walleye and yellow perch populations with a significant increase in the northern pike population.</p>",

The northern pike and muskellunge have slightly high populations with the northern pike being of good average size.  The yellow perch has an extremely high number per set at 79.50.  This is almost 10 times the state median. The black and white crappie have high populations and range from fair to good size. The bluegill and pumpkinseed have low populations and are of small size. The yellow bullhead has a slightly high population and the black bullhead a slightly low population. Both these species are of good average size. The golden shiner is slightly high and the white sucker is slightly low when compared to their respective state medians. The largemouth bass were absent from the net catch but natural reproduction was taken in the shoreline seining.</p>",

IN AUGUST 1988 A POPULATION ASSESSMENT WAS CONDU- CTED ON EAST RUSH LAKE. TEN GILLNETS AND EIGHT TRAPNETS WERE SET ALONG WTIH SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS. BASED ON RESPECTIVE LOCAL MEDIANS THE PRESENT FISH POPULATION IS AS FOLLOWS: THE NORTHERN PIKE NET CATCH WAS UP FROM THE FREVIOUS SURVEY IN 1985. HOWEVER, THE NET CATCH HAS NEVER BEEN ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH IN ALL SURVEYS DATING BACK TO 1957. IN 1988 THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 22.0 TO 35.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 25.0 25.9 INCHES. THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 4.20 PDS. HISTORICALLY, THE NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION HAS REFLECTED ABUNDANCE BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH BUT THE CONDITION AND NUMBERS OF LARGER FISH CAN BE NOTEWORTHY FOR THE ANGLER. THE WALLEYE NET CATCH SHOWED A REAL INCREASE FROM 1985 AND WAS ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 10.5 TO 27.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENDTH GROUP OF 13.0 - 13.9 INCHES. MEAN WEIGHT WAS 1.33 PDS. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY WAS REPRESENTED BY A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION OF YEAR-CLASSES. OF THE 86 WALLEYES AGED 23% WERE AGE I AND 52% WERE AGE II. THIS MADE UP 75% OF THE SAMPLE. GROWTH RATES OF THE AGE-CLASSES I-III EX- PRESSED FAST GROWTH AND AGE-CLASSES OLDER THAN III GREW AT RATES JUST ABOVE NORMAL. THE YELLOW PERCH NET CATCH WAS UP FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY BUT BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 5.0 TO 9.4 IN. WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 6.5 - 6.9  INCHES. THIS LENGTH GROUP SIZE DROPPED FROM 1985. IN PAST SURVEYS YELLOW PERCH ABUNDANCE HAVE BEEN ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH EXCEPT IN 1985 AND 1988. SHORELINE SEINING HAULS IN LATE AUGUST NETTED 14 YOUNG-OF-YEAR IN A 0.40. ACRE AREA. HISTORICALLY, YELLOW PERCH NUMBERS WERE LOW IN SEINING EFFORTS. TWO (SHOEPAC STRAIN) MUSKELLUNGES WERE CAUGHT IN THE GILLNETS. THIS WAS THE SAME NET CATCH AS IN THE PREVIOUS SURVEY AND BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE FISH WERE BOTH IN THE 30.0 - 30.9 INCH LENGTH GROUP. THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 6.6 POUNDS. ONE FISH WAS AGE VI AND THE OTHER WAS AGE VIII. THE LARGEMOUTH BASS HAD NET CATCHES BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIANS BUT PAST/PRESENT SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS INDICATED SUCCESSFUL NATURAL REPRODUCTION FOR THEIR PERSPECTIVE YEAR-CLASSES. BLUEGILL SUNFISH NET CATCHES WERE UP FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY BUT REMAIN BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH AS IN ALL PAST SURVEYS. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 3.0 TO 7.4 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 6.0 - 6.4 INCHES. THIS WAS THE SAME LENGTH GROUP IN THE 1982 AND 1985 SURVEYS SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS NETTED 1,295 YOUNG-OF- YEAR IN THE 0.40 ACRE AREA. THE WHITE CRAPPIE NET CATCH WAS UP FROM THE PRE- VIOUS SURVEY AND ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 3.0 TO 10.4 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 8.0 - 8.4 INCHES. THIS WAS THE SMAE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP REPRESENTED FOR THE GILLNET CATCHES. BLACK CRAPPIE NET CATCHES WERE UP CONSIDERABLY FROM 1985 YET REMAIN BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 3.0 TO 12.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 6.5 TO 6.9 INCHES. IN THE GILLNETS THE BLACK CRAPPIE SHOWED A CATCH WELL ABOVE PAST SURVEY CATCHES. THIS WAS ALSO THE FIRST TIME THE CATCH EXCEEDED THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION WAS 4.0 TO 10.4 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 7.0 - 7.4 INCHES. IN 1975 A DAM/DIKE WASHOUT OCCURRED ON A SECTION OF RUSH CREEK IN THE TOWN OF RUSH CITY. AFTER THAT PERIOD, THE INTRODUCTION OF FRESHWATER DRUM  FIRST OCCURRENCE IN TEST NETS, FOR EAST RUSH LAKE, WAS IN THE 1977 SURVEY. THE GILLNET CATCH IN 1988 WAS ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH BUT DOWN FROM THE 1985 SURVEY. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 4.0 TO 15.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LEN- GTH GROUP OF 11.0 - 11.4 INCHES. COMMERCIAL FISH- ING EFFORTS REMOVED 770 POUNDS OF FRESHWATER DRUM FROM EAST RUSH LAKE IN 1988. THE 1988 CARP, TRAPNET NET CATCHES RAMAINED THE SAME AS IN 1985 AND WITH THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. GILLNET CATCHES INCREASED TO AN ALL-TIME HIGH FROM PAST SURVEYS AND WERE ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 10.0 TO 26.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 12.0 - 12.9 INCHES, IN THE GILLNETS. SEVENTY PERCENT OF THIS CATCH WAS BETWEEN 12.0 - 13.9 INCHES. COMMERCIAL FISHING EFFORTS REMOVED 2,870 POUNDS OF CARP FROM EAST RUSH LAKE AND 113,380 POUNDS FROM WEST RUSH LAKE. OF THE SEVEN OTHER SPECIES TAKEN OUT OF EAST RUSH LAKE, HOWEVER, 18.050 CARP WERE REMOVED FROM WEST RUSH LAKE. OF THE SEVEN OTHER SPECIES TAKEN BY TEST NETS, (BOWFIN, GOLDEN SHINER, BLACK BULLHEAD, YELLOW BULLHEAD, BROWN BULLHEAD, HYBRID SUNFISH, AND PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH), FIVE WERE NOT SIGNIFICATNLY ABOVE OR BELOW THE PREVIOUS SURVEY OR LOCAL MEDIAN CATCHES. THE BLACK BULLHEAD HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN CAUGHT IN LOW NUMBERS WHEN COMPARED TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE WHITE SUCKER WAS BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH AND SHOWED THE LOWEST CATCH OF PAST SURVEYS. GREEN SUNFISH WERE PRESENT IN THE SHORELINE SEINE HAULS. IN GENERAL, A COMPARISON OF 1988 TO 1985 NET CATCH RATES (USING NET SELECTIVE GEAR) SHOW THIS:  OF THE SEVENTEEN FISH SPECIES CAUGHT IN 1988, TWELVE EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE, THREE WITH NO CHANGE, AND TWO DECREASED.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  Rush Lake is characterized by two distinct basins which comprise approximately 2,823 surface acres.  East Rush Lake (1,359 acres), is ecologically classified as a centrarchid-walleye lake and managed (by DNR) as a walleye-centrarchid lake.  Most recent fish stocking plans involved walleye and muskellunge (LLB) fingerling stocking every year.  On August 24, 1992, a lake survey was conducted on East Rush Lake.  Ten gillnet and eight trapnet sets along with four shoreline seine hauls were used to evaluate the status of the present fish population.  The fish captured by these methods were compared against net catches in previous lake surveys on East Rush, and to expected net catches to lakes of the same classification statewide (Lake Class 32).  The following paragraphs will briefly describe catch comparisons and other data relating to individual fish species.\n  The northern pike net catch (1.20/set) showed a real decrease from the previous survey catch in 1988 (1.80/set) and falls below the first quartile (1.75/set).  Netting over the last 10 years (4 surveys) indicated northern pike levels were consistently low (at and below the first quartile).  Data from the period of 1957 to 1977 (3 surveys) showed that northern pike levels were within the first and third quartile range (1.75/set and 6.50/set).  The 1992 catch (12 fish) ranged in length from 19.0 to 31.9 inches with a median length group of 24.0- 24.9 inches.  The mean weight was 3.54 pounds which was considered large when compared to the third quartile weight (3.29 pounds).  In past surveys, sampled northern pike were also on the larger side of normal.  Age determination found 3,4,5, and 7 year old fish with age 3 fish growing slightly faster than normal and the remaining age classes growing at rates typical of statewide averages.\n  The walleye net catch (1.40/set) showed a real decrease from the previous survey catch (8.40/set) but falls within the first and third quartile range (1.00/set to 4.00/set), indicating that the walleye population is statistically normal.  The lengths ranged from 11.0 to 25.9 inches with a median length group of 15.0-15.9 inches.  The mean weight was 2.08 pounds.  Back-calculated age data from scales, spines, and opercula determined that ages 2 through 7 were represented.  These fish expressed growth rates slightly faster than typical growth rates for walleyes in this lake type (Lake Class 32).  Seventy-five percent (75%) of the high walleye catch in 1988 was made up of age 1 and 2 year olds making the overall population appear very high.  This catch did not represent the older age classes very well.  The 1992 data found that those same year classes (1987 and 1986) made up 47% of the walleyes captured. The 1986 year class, in particular, was the strongest year class sampled in both the 1988 and 1992 surveys.\n  The present walleye population in East Rush Lake is composed of stocked and natural fish.  Although walleye stocking has been done for several years, and on an annual basis since 1972 (except 1976,1985, and 1988), the need is probably more of a supplemental measure than a required one.  If angling and natural mortality data of the stocked walleyes could be attained, the contribution of natural reproduction to the population could be assessed.  The existing natural hatch, however present, needs to be understood.  For instance, four of the 15 walleyes sampled in 1992 were from non-stocking years (1985 and 1988).  The 1988 survey found 10 of 86 walleyes to be from the non-stocking year of 1985. The 1957 survey also sampled many walleyes which did not fit to stocking years.  The remaining walleyes in the samples could not be distinguished from either natural or stocked fish, but certainly a composite thereof.  Recent heavy stocking years have not shown great increases in the walleye numbers captured by test net gear, except 1986.  The 1986 year class showed dominant presence in follow-up surveys.  Their good presence may also be resultant of a good natural hatch.  In the future, definite stocking gaps should be left as to evaluate the impact of natural reproduction to the population.  So far, it seems that stocking walleyes at high levels has not greatly improved the relative walleye abundance in East Rush Lake.\n  The black crappie gillnet catch (21.50/set) was down from the previous survey high (40.50/set) but still remains above the third quartile (13.33/set) indicating a high population.  The fish captured ranged from 5.0 to 10.4 inches with a median length group of 7.5-7.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.28 pounds.  Age determination found fish to be 2 to 5 years old in the sample with back-calculated lengths indicating growth rates typical of statewide average growth rates.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded 19 young-of-year.\n  The white crappie gillnet catch (6.10/set) and the trapnet catch (0.50/set) marked the lowest catches in all surveys dating back to 1957.  Although our catches were lower than in previous surveys, the white crappie population still falls within the normal range.  The fish ranged from 5.5 to 10.4 inches with a median length group of 8.0-8.4 inches.  The mean weight was 0.26 pounds.  Age determination found fish to be 1 to 5 years old in the sample with back-calculated lengths indicating growth rates typical of statewide average growth rates.\n  The bluegill trapnet catch (1.50/set) was again below the first quartile (6.37/set).  In all surveys dating back to 1957, bluegill trapnet catches have been very low.  One issue that stands to reason is that East Rush Lake is not conducive to favorable trapnetting.  Shoal water conditions are such that net leads are usually set several feet out from shore.  Lack of vegetation near some trapnet sites also lowers catch rates.  Because this has hindered summer trapnetting in each of the surveys, bluegill abundance most definitely was underestimated.  The bluegills sampled in 1992 ranged from 3.0 to 8.4 inches with a median length group of 6.0-6.4 inches.  Ages 1 to 6 were present in the sample and they expressed growth rates typical of normal statewide averages.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded only 18 young-of-year.\n  Similar to the low bluegill netting, the largemouth bass were not sampled very well.  This factor along with the phenomenon of bass being \"net shy\" presented little information on the status of the population.  The 3 fish that were caught were 1 year olds measuring in the 3.5-3.9 inch group.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded 21 young-of-year.  In future surveys, night electrofishing will be needed to evaluate the largemouth bass population.\n  The yellow perch catch (17.80/set) was down slightly from the previous survey (19.60/set) but still remains above the median catch (12.75/set) for this lake class.  Perch have historically carried normal to high populations in East Rush Lake.  The perch captured in 1992 ranged from 5.5 to 9.4 inches with a median length group of 7.5-7.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.16 pounds.  Age classes sampled were the 2 to 5 year olds.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded 25 young-of-year.\n  The carp gillnet catch (0.90/set) went down substantially from the previous survey (11.40/set).  One reason for the high catch last survey was because the 12.0 inch carp (70% of the catch) were highly susceptible to the 2 inch bar mesh of the standard gillnets.  This survey and all other past surveys did not experience such a selective catch as in 1988.  The 1992 gillnet catch sampled carp from 22.0 to 31.90 inches.  The mean weight was 8.45 pounds.  Carp taken in the gillnets represented 21% of the total fish biomass (by weight) recorded by gillnets for East Rush Lake.\n  The freshwater drum gillnet catch (10.70/set) went down slightly from the previous survey (11.70/set) and was just below the lake class median catch (14.92/set).  The lengths ranged from 8.5 to 14.9 inches with a median length group of 13.0-13.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.97 pounds.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded 9 young-of-year.  This species first entered the lake in 1975 following the event which washed out the dam/dike barrier on Rush Creek, in Rush City.  Since their arrival, the obvious factor which the drum have had on Rush Lake was the amount of space or biomass they utilize in the lake system.  Twenty-eight (28%) of the total fish biomass (by weight) in 1992 gillnet catch was composed of freshwater drum.  Using gillnet indices, drum and carp made up almost 50% of the total fish biomass in the lake.  \n  Read the \"Special Problems and Conditions Affecting Fish and Fishing\" section on page 12 of this survey, regarding the rough fish population.  \n  Six other species were sampled by test nets (golden shiner, white sucker, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed).  The golden shiner (4.40/set) was above the third quartile (3.00/set).  The remaining species were all below their respective first quartile catch values which indicated low populations.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Rush Lake is a large (1480 acre) lake in northern Chisago County. It is connected by a navigable channel to West Rush Lake, but the two lakes are very different in structure. East Rush is shallower, with a maximum depth of 24 feet, and more windswept. Algae blooms can result in low water clarity in late summer. The two lakes are managed primarily for Walleye, Muskellunge, and Northern Pike, with Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass as the secondary management species. A standard survey was conducted in 2015 using trap nets, electrofishing, and gill nets.  Overall, the fishing on East Rush Lake for many species should be quite good.  There are good numbers of Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were sampled at their lowest rate since 1992 and slightly below their historic average, but numbers were still within the normal range for this lake type.  A variety of sizes are present, with fish in excess of 28 inches present.  Although some natural reproduction takes place, the Walleye population is primarily a result of stocking efforts. <br> \n <br> \nA 24-36 inch protected slot regulation for Northern Pike has been in place since 2005 on East Rush Lake, and was changed to a 26-40 inch protected slot in July of 2015. These regulations are intended to increase the numbers of larger pike.  Numbers of Northern Pike in the 2015 survey were normal for the lake type and higher than the historic average.  Northerns averaged 27.8 inches and 5 pounds, their highest since 1985.  It is hoped that the new, shifted protected slot limit will further improve the Northern Pike size structure while allowing anglers the expanded opportunity to harvest fish up to 26 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass, sampled by night electrofishing on June 9, were less abundant than the 2011 sample and some other Chisago County lakes. However, size was good with the majority of bass 12 inches in length or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were again abundant with the gill net catch exceeding the norm for the lake class.  While roughly 10% of the catch approached 9 inches or better in length, crappies between 6.5 and 7.5 inches accounted for one-third of the catch.  This year class should provide good angling for the next several years.  Bluegill numbers were typical of the lake type.  Bluegill size was the largest recorded since the1985 assessment with 37% of the catch surpassing 7 inches.  Yellow Perch were abundant in both net types and provide a good food supply for larger predator fish as well as additional angler harvest opportunity.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Rush Lake is a large (1480 acre) lake in northern Chisago County. It is connected by a navigable channel to West Rush Lake, but the two lakes are very different in structure. East Rush is shallower, with a maximum depth of 24 feet, and more windswept. Algae blooms can result in low water clarity in late summer. The two lakes are managed primarily for Walleye, Muskellunge, and Northern Pike with Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass as the secondary management species. Trap nets, electrofishing, and gill nets were utilized during August of 2019 to assess the current fish populations.  Overall, the fishing on East Rush Lake for many species should be quite good.  There are good numbers of Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nA 24-36 inch protected slot regulation for Northern Pike has been in place since 2005 on East Rush Lake, and was changed to a 26-40 inch protected slot in July of 2015. These regulations are intended to increase the numbers of larger Pike.  Numbers of Northern Pike in the 2019 survey were normal for the lake type and higher than the historic average and the previous assessment.  Northerns averaged 29 inches and 5 pounds, their highest since 1985.  It is hoped that the newer protected slot limit will continue to produce quality Northern Pike angling while expanding harvest opportunity to 26 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nAs in 2015, Walleyes were numbers were below their historic average but were still within the normal range for this lake type.  A variety of sizes are present, with fish in excess of 27 inches present.  Although some natural reproduction may take place, the Walleye population is primarily a result of stocking efforts. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass, sampled by night electrofishing on May 29, were less abundant than the some other Chisago County lakes. However, size remains good with the majority of bass 12 inches in length or larger and a 15 inch average. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were again abundant with the gill net catch exceeding the norm for the lake class.  While 10% of the catch exceeded 9 inches in length, half the catch was 8 inches or better.  Yellow Perch were more abundant and larger than typical for the lake type.  Perch averaged nearly 8 inches in the gill nets with a fourth of the catch exceeding 9 inches. <br> \n</p>",
