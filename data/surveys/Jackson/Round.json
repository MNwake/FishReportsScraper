                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 1024-acre shallow bowl-shaped lake located in Jackson County approximately two miles to the northeast of the City of Round Lake.  Round Lake has a mean depth of 8 feet, and a maximum of 9 feet in typical years with normal precipitation.  There was a drought in 2021, therefore Round Lake was nearly 1.5 feet below typical water levels leaving a lot of shoreline exposed.  However, the water clarity remained unchanged from previous years with 1 foot of clarity during the survey time period.  Walleye are the primary management species in Round Lake and have been stocked almost annually since 2018 (not stocked in 2020 due to COVID fieldwork shutdown).  Since 2018, Round Lake has been included in a research project that is evaluating the performance of two strains of Walleye, the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) and the Mississippi Strain (MIS).  The MIS Walleye come from northern Minnesota and until recently, were the primary strain stocked in Windom management area lakes.  The LMS originated in the Cannon River system in east central Minnesota (Mississippi River tributary), was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Sporadic natural reproduction occurs in Round Lake, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and enhanced natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes.  Secondary management species for Round Lake include Black Crappie and Yellow Perch.  Secondary management species populations typically sustain themselves through natural reproduction, but adult Yellow Perch were stocked in 2016 because of a low catch rate in the 2013 and 2015 surveys.  A standard survey was conducted during the week of August 23, 2021 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 4 trap nets. Only 4 trap nets were utilized due to a continued drought reducing the ability to net along much of the shoreline due to Round Lake's gradually sloping morphometry.  <br> \n <br> \nSince 1983, Walleye catch rates have averaged 15.9 per gill net (excluding the 2005 catch rate of 152.5 per gill net) and have varied from 7.7 per gill net in 2013 to 29.2 per gill net in 1994.  The 2021 catch rate was 14.7 per gill net, an increase from 2019 (10.7), but remained within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net).  Total lengths of Walleye ranged from 9.6 to 25.2 inches and averaged 17.3 inches in the gill net sample.  Eight ages of Walleye were sampled including fish from 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020.  Of the 8 years classes observed two are from non-stocked years, 2015 and 2020.  However, the most dominant year classes were 2017 (23% of aged sample) and 2019 (37% of aged sample), years when Walleye fry were stocked.  Growth was typical for southern Minnesota as mean length of age-3 Walleye was 15.9 inches.  Body condition of Walleye was normal suggesting that sufficient prey is available.  Finally, fall night electrofishing for young-of-the-year Walleye resulted in a catch rate of 170 per hour that averaged 4.9 inches.  This stocked year class could become dominant and help to boost the population.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have steadily increased since 2009 (1.3 per trap net), and the trend continued in a huge way in 2021 with a catch rate of 36.8 per trap net. The 2021 catch rate was the greatest of record dating back to 1983 and was more than 4 times the long-term average of 8.7 per trap net.  The 2021 White Crappie catch rate was 0 per trap net, a decrease from 2.2 per trap net in 2021, and the first time since 2009 that no White Crappie were caught in the trap net sample.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 3.3 to 14.7 inches and averaged 5.8 inches in the trap net sample.  Body condition of Black Crappie was above average, indicating that forage is abundant. The Black Crappie population appears to be positioned well to provide excellent angling in Round Lake for several years to come. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 Yellow Perch catch rate was 17.0 per gill net, which is the fourth highest catch rate observed on Round Lake since 1983.  Interestingly, 3 of the 4 highest catch rates have occurred during the past 3 surveys (2017, 2019, and 2021).  This corresponds to years following adult Yellow Perch stocking in 2016 showing a benefit of periodic stocking when abundance is low.  The 2021 catch rate of 17.0 per gill net was similar to the long term average of 18.9 per gill net, and was within the normal range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 6.0 to 10.4 inches and averaged just over 8 inches.  Body condition of Yellow Perch in the gill net and trap net sample was good, suggesting that they are healthy and that prey is abundant.  The Yellow Perch population appears healthy, plump, and should provide an excellent fishing opportunity over the next 2 to 3 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch rate of White Bass was 32.3, which is the highest catch rate ever observed in Round Lake and exceeds the long term average of 5.2 per gill net and the expected catch rate range for similar lakes in Minnesota (0.3 to 9.9 per trap net).  The trap net catch rate of White Bass was 4.5 per net and also exceeds the expected catch rate range for similar lakes in Minnesota (0.2 to 0.7 per trap net).  Lengths of White Bass ranged from 4.7 to 19.2 inches and averaged 8.1 inches in gill nets and 9.7 inches in trap nets.  The majority of the White Bass sampled were less than 6.5 inches long (71%).  White Bass were first sampled in Round Lake in 2005. Since then abundance has steadily increased, however negative effects on other species have not been detected thus far.  There is increasingly an opportunity to catch many White Bass over 16 inches in Round Lake and they provide a great fight while casting the shoreline.    <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 catch rate of Northern Pike was 1.7 per gill net, which exceeds the long-term average catch rate of 1.0 per net, but falls within the expected range for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Northern pike ranged from 20.8 to 32.2 inches and averaged 24.8 inches in the gill net sample.  Only 1, 25.8 inch, Northern Pike was caught in the trap net sample. Northern Pike have not been stocked in Round Lake, indicating that natural reproduction is maintaining this population.  There appears to be an increasing opportunity of catching Northern Pike that exceed the 24 inch minimum size for the southern Minnesota regulation (2 fish with a 24 inch minimum length limit). Round Lake may be a good place to pick up a few harvestable size Northern Pike over the next year or two.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate was 6.3 per gill net, which is a reduction from 2019 when 18.7 per gill net were observed and was the greatest catch rate since 1994.  The 2021 catch rate is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in Minnesota (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net).  This has become a normal occurrence on Round Lake since 1994.  Other Species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo (N=12), Channel Catfish (N=5), Common Carp (N=4), Freshwater Drum (N=22), Green Sunfish (N=2), and White Sucker (N=4). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 930-acre lake, located in Jackson County approximately 9 miles southeast of the city of Worthington.  Since 2018, Round Lake has been included in a research project that is evaluating the performance of two strains of Walleye, the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) and the Mississippi Strain (MIS).  However, during 2020, no stocking was done as no Walleye egg-take operations were conducted due to the start of the COVID pandemic causing a DNR close-contact work moratorium.  Walleye stocking, including the performance evaluation, was restarted in 2021. The total fry quota for Round Lake was 473,500, of which half were MIS and half were LMS.  The MIS Walleye come from northern Minnesota and until recently, were the primary strain stocked in Windom management area.  The LMS originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Round Lake has areas of spawning habitat and has shown sporadic natural reproduction, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes.  To evaluate strain performance in 2022, 210 Walleye fingerlings were needed for testing and analysis. Night electrofishing was used to collect the Walleye for the study.  Standard night electrofishing (2 hours) was conducted on 28 September 2022. <br> \n <br> \nThe fingerling quota was met with standard night electrofishing as 539 fingerlings were captured during 2.0 hours of electrofishing (269.50 per hour). Fingerlings ranged in length from 5.2 to 7.9 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  Seven adult Walleye were also captured and submitted for genetic analysis.  The Age 0 Walleye genetic analysis indicated 90% of the fish were LMS and an indication MIS may not have performed very well after stocking.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake, near the town of Round Lake in Jackson County, is a 1,024 acre lake with a maximum depth of 9 feet.  This almost perfectly circular lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch and black crappie.  Aquatic vegetation has not been able to become established because of the lakes shape, nutrient input, and fish community.  Round Lake has experienced partial winterkills in years past.  It has been opened to liberalized fishing 10 times since 1945 with the last time being 1979.  An aeration system that was placed in the lake in 1981 has at least played a part in maintaining higher oxygen levels over the years.  However, Round Lake does experience low oxygen during winters with heavy snow cover and has frequent algae blooms during the summer.  The lake is dominated by sand and silt except for a man made experimental spawning reef.  This experimental spawning reef for walleyes was placed in the lake in 1996 with little documented success.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of  August 13 of 2001.  Four gillnets, 12 trapnets, and 5 seine hauls was used to assess the fish community composition.The walleye catch rate in gillnets was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Total lengths of walleyes averaged almost of 15 inches.  Most of the walleyes captured would be \"keepers\" by angler standards, and were from the 1999 and 2000 walleye fry stocking years.  This data indicated a healthy Round Lake walleye population.  Round Lake is scheduled to receive walleye fry 3 out of 4 years.  The channel catfish catch rates in gillnets and trapnets were the highest catch rates ever recorded based on previous surveys.  Total lengths of channel catfish captured in gillnets averaged 17.22 inches and 19.5 inches, respectively.  All of the fish were aged to the 1997 year class except for one Age 6 and one Age 7 fish.  The 1997 year class of channel catfish was also a strong year class on Budd, Hall, and Amber lakes.  According to our stocking records, channel catfish have not been stocked since 1981.  However, it is possible that channel catfish could be using the cavities in the spawning reef for reproduction.  This fishery is one of the best channel catfish fisheries in our 10 county area.  Coincidently, only 17 black bullheads were captured from gillnets and trapnets combined.  This information would possibly indicate that channel catfish may control black bullhead abundances in certain lakes.Yellow perch were present but not as abundant as some years, and averaged almost nine inches in length.  Three different year class of perch were captured (1998, 1999, and 2000).  No Age 0 yellow perch were captured in 5 seine hauls.  Since there is a substantial predator base of channel catfish and walleyes in the fish community, it is not surprising that the yellow perch numbers are somewhat depressed.The black crappie catch rate in trap nets was within the normal range, but they only averaged about 5 inches long.  Five seine hauls captured 193 black crappie on 8/13/2001 which indicates a substantial year class of Age 0 fish.  The average length of black crappie captured in the seine was 2.24 inches.  Black crappie captured in trapnets were mostly keepers with quite a few \"10-inchers\" in the population.  Five year classes of black crappie were captured with the Age 0 and Age 3 dominating the population.  This population provides a great opportunity at larger than average black crappies.The northern pike catch rate in gillnets was slightly above the normal range of 1/set.  Interestingly, three different year classes of northern pike were caught (1998, 1999, and 2001).  Several other population surveys during the 2001 survey season in the Windom Area revealed other northern pike natural reproduction.  Additionally, natural reproduction surveys done with five seine hauls captured two Age 0 smallmouth bass in Round Lake which likely indicates an illegal stocking of adults that naturally reproduced.  Black bullhead numbers in both gillnets and trapnets were considerably lower than average.  It is likely that the higher numbers of channel catfish have kept the bullhead numbers in control.Other species captured in the 2001 survey either by trapnet, gillnet, or seine were bigmouth buffalo, common carp, freshwater drum, white sucker, quillback, white crappie, and fathead minnows.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Round Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Ryan Doorenbos  </p>",

NO WALLEYE WERE STOCKED DURING 1987 OR 1988 INDI- CATING THAT THE AGE 0 AND 1 FISH ARE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. ONLY ONE NORTHERN PIKE WAS CAPTURED DURING GILL NETTING BUT EIGHT WERE CAPTURED WHILE TRAP NETTING AVERAGE WEIGHT OF THE CAPTURED NORTHERN PIKE WAS 3.2 LBS. AGE OF THE CAPTURED FISH WAS DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN AGES 1 THROUGH 5. THE YELLOW PERCH GILLNET CATCH INDEX OF 15.7 FISH PER LIFT IS BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 20.7 FISH PER LIFT AND THE 1983 SURVEY INDEX OF 126.0 FISH PER LIFT. SHORELINE SEINING PRODUCED 142 YOY YELLOW PERCH PER ACRE SEINED. THE BLACK CRAPPIE TRAPNET INDEX IS 1.6 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION SAMP- LED BY THE TRAP NETS IS DOMINATED BY AGE 2 FISH. AVERAGE WEIGHT OF THE BLACK CRAPPIES IN THE TRAP NETS WAS 0.55 LBS. NO YOY BLACK CRAPPIES WERE CAPTURED DURING SHORELINE SEINING. THE APPROPRIATE NET CATCH INDICES ARE BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS FOR WHITE SUCKER, CARP, BIGMOUTH BUFFALO, CHANNEL CATFISH, WHITE CRAPPIE, GREEN SUNFISH AND FRESHWATER DRUM. ONE FRESHWATER DRUM WAS CAPTURED IN THE GILL NETS AND ONE IN THE TRAP NETS. GOLDEN SHINER WERE CAPTURED IN THE TRAP NETS AT 1.6 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE TRAPNET CATCH INDEX FOR BLACK BULLHEAD IS 89% BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE MODAL LENGTH OF THE BULLHEADS SAMPLED IN THE TRAP NETS IS 10.0 INCHES. THE AVERAGE WEIGHT IS 0.5 LBS. THE GILLNET CATCH INDEX IS 1.5 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. A COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN FOUND BLACK BULLHEADS TO BE ABUNDANT AND REMOVED 13,000 LBS. DURING THE WINTER OF 1988- 89.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake was opened to liberalized fishing ten times since 1945, the last time in 1979.  A helixor aeration system was installed in 1981.  Round was one of four Jackson County creel survey lakes during the 1990 open-water season.  Walleye and black bullhead provided most of the catch on Round Lake, with walleyes up to nine pounds. <br> \n          <br> \nFor many years local residents perceived that Round Lake was too low, the result of Judicial Ditch (J. D). No. 9 diverting much of the lake's natural watershed away to the north and east.  As a remedy, a diversion project was proposed during the 1950's and early '60's to pump water back into the lake.  Legislative funds were appropriated for that purpose, but for reasons that are unclear, it never happened.  After the aeration system was installed, winterkill frequency lessened and interest in higher water levels faded away. <br> \n <br> \nRound Lake has provided considerable angling opportunity over the years for southwest Minnesota, and attracts nonresident anglers as well for walleye, bullhead and channel catfish.  Walleye natural reproduction occurs in some years and an experimental spawning reef was placed on the south side of the lake to enhance reproduction.  However, the reef has failed to significantly increase walleye natural reproduction success.  During the survey in 2001, two smallmouth bass were captured during a seine haul, which indicated possible broodstock in the lake that naturally reproduced.  It is possible that with the addition of the spawning reef, spawning habitat for smallmouth bass was adequate for natural reproduction.  Despite the fact that channel catfish have not been stocked since 1981, the fishery has done quite well and as a result may be controlling black bullhead relative abundance.  Channel catfish may also be utilizing the cavities in the spawning reef for natural reproduction because shoreline seining captured age-0 channel catfish.  Even though the reef may have been designed for walleye natural reproduction, it is possible that the reef is having an effect on the total fish community in Round Lake.  The fish community composition and size structure, based on the 2001 survey, indicate intensive fish management on Round Lake has provided positive results. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population in Round Lake is high compared to other similar lakes.  The walleye gill net catch rate of 28.3 was higher than what we normally see on lakes like Round Lake.  Lengths of walleye sampled in our gill nets ranged from 10.9 to 26.0 inches and averaged 17.3 inches.  A high percentage of the fish sampled were in the 16 to 19 inch range. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population is also doing very good in Round Lake.  Lengths of yellow perch sampled in our gill nets ranged from 5.8 to 12.6 inches and averaged 10.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers are fairly low in Round Lake but lengths of black crappie are impressive.  Black crappie lengths in 2009 ranged from 1.9 to 14.3 inches and averaged 10.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers remain low in Round Lake.  Black bullhead catch rates have not been within the interquartile range since 1990.  It is likely the large predator base (walleyes and channel catfish) have reduced black bullhead abundance. <br> \n <br> \nA fair number of northern pike are also roaming the waters of Round Lake.  Lengths of northern pike sampled in our gill nets ranged from 15.2 to 21.5 inches and averaged 18.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe white bass gill net catch rate of 3.7 fish per net was what we would expect for lakes similar to Round Lake.  Lengths of white bass sampled in gill nets ranged from 12.1 to 13.4 inches averaged 12.6 inches.  This is the first time white bass have been observed during a lake survey.  Another survey first was a 23.2 inch shortnose gar sampled in trap nets during the 2009 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish are quite numerous in Round Lake as well.  Although numbers were higher in 2001, catch rates remain respectable.  Lengths of channel catfish sampled in gill nets in 2009 ranged from 24.84 to 30.71 inches with a mean length of 27.16 inches.  If the walleyes are not eating the bullheads, the larger channel catfish are likely eating them as well. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during the assessment included common carp, freshwater drum, quillback carpsucker, and white crappie.  <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Round Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

Round Lake has a mean depth of 8.0 ft., and a maximum of 9.0 ft, and had a Secchi depth of 0.7 ft.  Nutrient input into Round Lake is high, as its watershed is dominated by agriculture.  Walleye are the primary management species and secondary management species include Black Crappie and Yellow Perch. Round Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fry in the spring of 2017, due to surplus production of this strain.  The Lower Mississippi strain was last stocked decades ago, but has persisted in several area lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  A nighttime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 7, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful. <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 67.8 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that the fry stocking was successful.  In stocked years, the goal is to attain 30.0 per hour electrofishing.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 5.4 to 7.8 inches and averaged 6.8 inches.  If they survive the winter, the 2017 year class should be a strong year class in the Round Lake Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 1024-acre, class 43 lake, located in Jackson County approximately two miles to the northeast of the City of Round Lake.  Round Lake has a mean depth of 8.0 ft., and a maximum of 9.0 ft, and had a Secchi depth of 1.0 ft.  Walleye are the primary management species in Round Lake and have been stocked annually since 2018.  Since 2018, Round Lake has been included in a research project that is evaluating the performance of two strains of Walleye, the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) and the Mississippi Strain (MIS).  The total fry quota for Round Lake was 473,500, of which half were MIS and half were LMS.  The MIS Walleye come from northern Minnesota and until recently, were the primary strain stocked in Windom management area lakes.  The LMS originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Sporadic natural reproduction occurs in Round Lake, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes.  To evaluate strain performance, 50 Walleye yearlings and 210 Walleye fingerlings were needed from Round Lake in 2019.  Trap nets and electrofishing were used to collect Walleye for the study.  <br> \n <br> \nThe fingerling quota was met as 201 fingerlings were captured with electrofishing (94.7 per hour) and 7 were captured in trap nets (20 net nights).  Fingerlings ranged in length from 5.0 to 8.2 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.  Three yearling Walleye were captured in the gill net during the standard survey in August; however, yearling Walleye were not observed during fall sampling events, indicating that the 2018 stocking was likely unsuccessful.  Results of which strain performed better are not yet available.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 930-acre lake, located in Jackson County approximately 9 miles southeast of the city of Worthington. Round Lake was part of a research project that evaluated the performance of two strains of Walleye, the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) and the Mississippi Strain (MIS), from 2018 to 2022. However, during 2020, no stocking was done as no Walleye egg-take operations were conducted due to the start of the COVID pandemic causing a DNR close-contact work moratorium. The total fry quota for Round Lake was 473,500, of which half were MIS and half were LMS. The MIS Walleye come from northern Minnesota (Pine River egg-take) and until recently, were the primary strain stocked in Windom management area. The LMS originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye. LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah (current LMS egg-take location), a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction. The study found that LMS Walleye performed best and thus would be stocked exclusively into Round Lake moving forward. To continue to evaluate LMS Walleye fry stocking in 2023 night electrofishing was on 10 October 2023. Two hours of electrofishing was utilized so that the data could be incorporated into a continuing statewide study of Walleye lakes with and without zebra mussels (Round Lake is without zebra mussels).  <br> \n <br> \nOnly 236,750 LMS Walleye fry were stocked in Round Lake in 2023, half the amount stocked during the LMS vs. MIS study. This reduction is a result of LMS advantage found during the study on Round Lake and the lack of MIS Walleye that were found in sampling. Essentially, we discovered we could stock half the amount of Walleye fry than historically done and realize a similar outcome, if not better, with LMS strain Walleye. Ninety-three age-0 Walleye were captured during 2.0 hours of electrofishing (46.5 per hour). Walleye ranged in length from 5.9 to 8.4 inches and averaged 7.0 inches. A night electrofishing catch rate greater than 30 per hour with fish larger than 5 inches is a good indication that the stocking was successful and the fish have a high likelihood of getting to 13 inches or greater. Overall, the Walleye population is doing well on Round Lake and continued LMS fry stocking will help to boost the potential of the population. Down the road, if natural reproduction is consistent and strong, the Walleye population of Round Lake may be similar to Lake Sarah in that stocking will not be necessary. Additional sampling utilizing gill nets and trap nets will occur in 2025 and should help to determine the overall contribution of the 2023 year class to the overall population.   <br> \n</p>",

NORTHERN PIKE NUMBERS WERE BELOW AVG. ALL CAME FROM GROUPS I, II, AND III. BLACK CRAPPIE NUMBERS WERE 5.5 TIMES THE STATE AVERAGE, WITH 93.5% BEING FROM GROUP II AND THE BALANCE FROM GROUP III. THE BLUE- GILL POPULATION WAS APPROXIMATELY 10% OF STATE AVG WITH AGE CLASSES IV, V, AND VI REPRESENTED. THE YELLOW PERCH POPULATION WAS ABOUT 16 TIMES STATE AVERAGE, WITH 47% FROM GROUP III AND 23% FROM GROUP IV. GROUPS I,II, AND V ARE ALSO REPRESENTED GROWTH RATE WAS GOOD ON BOTH BLUEGILLS AND PERCH. NATURAL REPRODUCTION WAS SUCCESSFUL FOR BLACK CRAPPIE, BLUEGILL, AND PERCH THIS YEAR. PUMPKIN- SEED, WHITE CRAPPIE, GREEN SUNFISH, AND ORANGE- SPOTTED SUNFISH ARE PRESENT IN SMALLER NUMBERS. ONE CHANNEL CATFISH WAS TAKEN DURING THE SURVEY. GOLDEN SHINER NUMBERS WERE ABOUT 40 TIMES STATE AVG, WHITE SUCKERS 9 TIMES ABOVE, AND CARP AND BUFFALO SOMEWHAT BELOW STATE AVERAGE. BLACK BULL- HEAD NUMBERS WERE 23 TIMES STATE AVERAGE, BUT GOOD AVERAGE SIZE (2.3/LB) SHOULD MAKE THEM POPU- LAR WITH ANGLERS AND POSSIBLY A COMMERCIAL FISHER- MAN.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is managed primarily for walleye and in 1994 contained a good walleye population.  According tothe information collected during the summer of 1994, the walleye population was larger than most lakes similarto Round.  Walleyes ranged from 6.5 to 28.0 inches, and there was a strong age-1 year class that averaged about12.0 inches.  This age-1 year class should provide good fishing for a couple years.  Walleye natural reproductionhas also been documented in several years.  However, the consistency and percent contribution of the naturalwalleye to the population is not well understood, at this time.     Yellow perch and black crappie are also managed in Round Lake.  Yellow perch abundance is about normal forlakes like Round.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 6.0 to 11.0 inches.  Yellow perch populations really tend tofluctuate, so with just one strong year class, fishing could improve considerably.     The black crappie population was in pretty good shape.  Their abundance was normal for lakes like Round andthere were several year classes represented in our age analysis.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 3.0 to 13.5inches.  Most of the fish were either age-1 (average 3.5 inches) or age-3 (average 10.0 inches).     Round Lake also has the potential for producing a trophy channel catfish.  Two channel catfish were sampledduring the summer of 1994 and they weighed 11 and 17 pounds.  Channel catfish are not real abundant but they maymake some lucky anglers day when they hook into one of these brutes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nRound Lake is a 1024-acre lake located in Jackson County approximately two miles to the northeast of the City of Round Lake.  Round Lake has a mean depth of 8.0 ft. and a maximum of 9.0ft; however, the water level in 2015 (1,521.6 ft.) was the second lowest recorded elevation in the last 27 years. The highest water level was observed in 1993 at 1523.82 ft., and the lowest recorded water level was observed in 1959 at 1519.45 ft.  There is no explanation for why the lake's current water level is so low, other than the Round Lake area has missed out on many local precipitation events.  Nutrient input into Round Lake is high, as its watershed is dominated by agriculture.  Aquatic vegetation is scarce as the turbid waters prevent its establishment and growth.  Prior to the installation of the aeration system, Round Lake was prone to winterkill, as it was opened to liberalized fishing ten times between 1945 and 1979.  An aeration system was installed in 1981 to prevent winterkill.  Round Lake has not experienced winterkill since its installation.  Walleye are the primary management species in Round Lake and have been stocked as fry three out of four years since 2008 (2012, 2013, 2014, 2016).  Secondary management species include Black Crappie, Channel Catfish, and Yellow Perch.  Secondary management species populations sustain themselves through natural reproduction, thus they haven't been stocked since the aeration system was installed.  Other sport fish present include Northern Pike, White Bass, and White Crappie.  A survey was conducted during the week of August 10, 2015 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nSince the record catch rate of 152.5 per gill net in 2005, Walleye catch rates had steadily declined to 28.3 per gill net in 2009 and 7.7 per gill net in 2013.  The Walleye catch rate increased in 2015 to 16.3 per gill net, which is above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net).  The increase in abundance is likely the result of a successful fry stocking in 2013, as over half of the Walleye sampled were age-2 (2013 year class).  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 6.5 to 25.8 inches and averaged 13.5 inches.  Five year classes of Walleye were sampled (2005, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015), all of which correspond to fry stocking, except the 2015 year class, which was not a stocked year and likely the result of natural reproduction.  Growth of Walleye in Round Lake was slow compared to similar lakes, as Walleye reached 14.3 inches by age-3.  The slower growth rate could be a result of a more abundant walleye population and thereby creating more competition for food.  Walleye angling should be good on Round Lake in the next couple of years.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have steadily increased in gill nets and trap nets since 2009.  Gill net catch rates have increased from 1.3 per gill net in 2009 to 3.0 per gill net in 2013 to 4.3 per gill net in 2015, which is within the expected range of catch rats for similar lakes in the area (0.0 to 6.7 per gill net).  Trap net catch rates have increased from 1.3 per trap net in 2009 to 2.3 per trap net in 2013 to 3.4 per trap net in 2015, which is also within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (0.7 to 15.3 per trap net).  Black Crappie were 5.5 to 11.7 inches long and averaged 9.3 inches.  Black crappie numbers tend to be highly variable and is often characterized as cyclic, with strong year classes reoccurring every three to five years.  This variable and cyclic abundance often results in a \"boom-or-bust\" crappie fishery, where years of increased angler catch rates are followed by years of decreased angler catch rates.  Although catch rates of Black Crappie aren't high, there are still some available for anglers if they can find the right spot.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nCHANNEL CATFISH  <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish catch rates have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 1994 to 19.5 per gill net in 2001, and have averaged 4.4 per gill net since 1983.  In 2015, Channel Catfish were captured at a rate of 6.0 per gill net, down from 7.0 per gill net in 2013, but still higher than the expected range of catch rates in similar lakes in the area (0.0 to 3.0 per gill net).  Channel Catfish were 18.6 to 30.3 inches long and averaged 21.6 inches.  The Channel Catfish population is self-supporting as they have not been stocked since 1981.  Channel Catfish angling at Round Lake should be good.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates have not exceeded 15.7 per gill net since 1988, and have usually been low. The 2015 catch rate of 1.7 per gill net was the same as the 2013 catch rate and was below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net).  Yellow Perch were 7.3 to 11.1 inches long and averaged 9.7 inches.  Yellow Perch populations tend to fluctuate depending on the abundance of predator populations such as Walleye, Channel Catfish, Northern Pike, and White Bass. These predators are likely controlling the Yellow Perch population in Round Lake. No Yellow Perch less than 7.0 inches were sampled, indicating that natural reproduction has been minimal in recent years.  Current low water levels likely reduce the amount of preferred spawning habitat available for adult Yellow Perch, thereby limiting reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWHITE CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nAlthough the Black Crappie numbers are lower, the White Crappie catch rate was 19.3 per gill net and 7.8 per trap net, which are the highest catch rates of White Crappie recorded in Round Lake.  Prior to 2015, White Crappie catch rates in gill nets did not exceed 0.3 per gillnet, and in trap nets did not exceed 0.3 per trap net.  Similar to Black Crappie, recruitment of White Crappie can be highly variable resulting in sporadic strong year classes, which is likely where these fish came from.  White Crappies were 7.4 to 12.1 inches long and averaged 9.1 inches.  The 8.0 to 9.5 inch White Crappies were the most abundant size.  White and Black Crappie can typically coexist, but it is not uncommon for one species to occur at a lower abundance than the other.  Typically White Crappies tend to do better in turbid water systems compared to Black Crappie.  Barring any setbacks, White Crappie should provide a quality angling opportunity after another year of growth.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWHITE BASS  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass were first sampled in 2005 at rate of 0.5 per gill net and since have increased to 3.7, 4.0, and 5.0 per gill net in 2009, 2013, and 2015, respectively.  Gill net catch rates are within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 9.9 per gill net).  In trap nets, catch rates have increased from 0.9 per trap net in 2009 to 1.0 per trap net in 2013 to 6.6 per trap net in 2015, all of which are above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.2 to 0.7 per trap net).  White Bass were 4.1 to 16.3 inches long and averaged 11.8 inches.  White Bass grow fast in Round Lake, attaining a length of 12 inches by age-3.  The presence of multiple year classes and small fish indicates that White Bass naturally reproduce in Round Lake.  White Bass are aggressive predators that could potentially compete with other predators if prey is limited, but may also provide an additional angling opportunity in Round Lake.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nFive Northern Pike were captured in the survey, and were 24.7 to 37.4 inches long and averaged 30.1 inches.  Catches of Northern Pike have always been low in Round Lake; however, if you hook into one it should be large.  <br> \n <br> \nThree Black Bullhead were captured in the survey, ranging from 13.1 to 14.0 inches and averaging 13.5 inches.  The Channel Catfish and Walleye population are keeping the Black Bullhead population low.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe Freshwater Drum catch rate has increased from 2.0 per gill net in 2009 to 4.7 per gill net in 2013 to 5.3 per gill net in 2015, but is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.8 to 6.9 per gill net).  Lengths of Freshwater Drum ranged from 4.4 to 22.5 inches and averaged 14.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth Buffalo abundance increased to 3.7 per gill net, up from 1.3 per gill net in 2013. Lengths of Bigmouth Buffalo ranged from 11.8 to 22.5 inches and averaged 18.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were captured at a rate of 0.6 per trap net, which is the lowest observed trap net catch rate for Common Carp in Round Lake, and is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net).  Lengths of Common Carp ranged from 5.2 to 34.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared By Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

The seine hauls captured 12 species of fish, including Bigmouth Buffalo (N=1), Black Bullhead (N=49), Black Crappie (N=15), Channel Catfish (N=2), Common Carp (N=34), Freshwater Drum (N=3), Fathead Minnow (N=8), Golden Shiner (N=2), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=72), Walleye (N=2), Yellow Perch (N=15), and Green Sunfish (N=8). Electrofishing captured eight species of fish including Black Bullhead (N=111), Common Carp (N=92), Fathead Minnow (N=4), Freshwater Drum (N=6), Green Sunfish (N=21), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=26), Walleye (N=4), and Yellow Perch (N=1). Reproduction exists for many of the species in Round Lake, as young-of-the-year (YOY) Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Orangespotted Sunfish, Yellow Perch, and Green Sunfish were sampled.  YOY Walleye were likely the result of stocking.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of Round Lake.  The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community. The IBI score at Round Lake was 6, below the impairment threshold of 36. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 1024-acre, class 43 lake, located in Jackson County approximately two miles to the northeast of the City of Round Lake.  Round Lake has a mean depth of 8.0 ft., and a maximum depth of 9.0 feet, and had a Secchi depth of 1.0 foot during the most recent fish netting survey in 2019.  Walleye are the primary management species in Round Lake and have been stocked annually since 2018.  Since 2018, Round Lake has been included in a research project that is evaluating the performance of two strains of Walleye, the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) and the Mississippi Strain (MIS).  The total fry quota for Round Lake is 473,500, of which half were MIS and half were LMS in 2018 and 2019.  The MIS Walleye come from northern Minnesota and until recently, were the primary strain stocked in Windom management area lakes.  The LMS originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  No Walleye were stocked in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic that shut down statewide egg take operations during the spring of 2020.  Sporadic natural reproduction occurs in Round Lake, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes which could boost already existing natural reproduction.  Since no Walleye fry were stocked in 2020, it gave MN DNR staff a chance to evaluate natural reproduction statewide. Round Lake was included in this assessment.  Shoreline night electrofishing was conducted on 6 stations 20 minutes in duration on 21 September 2020 to assess presence of age-0 Walleye.     <br> \n  <br> \nAge-0 Walleye (often referred to as Young-of-the-year, YOY) were sampled at all 6 stations sampled indicating natural reproduction.  One hundred thirty two Walleye were sampled during 2 hours of electrofishing resulting in a catch rate of 65.76 per hour.  Typically, Walleye YOY catch rates less than 20 per hour result in poor year-classes that do not contribute to the fishery, meaning they are not typically caught by anglers.  A catch rate above 20 per hour can result in good fishing once they reach a catchable size, therefore, there is a chance the 2020 age-0 Walleye can create a fishable year-class.  Length during the fall is a big determination of successful over winter survival of age-0 Walleye.  The 2020 sample of age-0 Walleye ranged in length from 6.34 to 8.90 inches with an average length of 7.65 inches.  Typically, Walleye that do not reach a length greater than 5 inches by fall of their first year may die during their first winter due to a lack of food or as a result of predation.  The Round Lake age-0 fish were all over 5 inches with the smallest fish measuring 6.34 inches.  In addition to the presence of a naturally reproduced year-class in 2020, tissue samples were collected from the first 100 fish caught in order to determine genetic ancestry and whether recent stocking of LMS Walleye has resulted in contribution to the genetic make-up of naturally reproduced fish.  Genetic analysis of fin clips from the sample collected indicate that Lower Mississippi River (Lake Sarah egg take) genetics are dominant (41%) followed by Spicer Strain (25%, stocked from mid-2000's to mid-2010's) with little evidence of other persistent genetic strains (all others < 10% and inconclusive).  It is encouraging to observe a potentially abundant naturally reproduced year-class in Round Lake, it bodes well for the future of the Walleye fishery.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a little more than a 1000-acre lake located in Jackson County approximately two miles to the northeast of the City of Round Lake.  This pot hole prairie type of lake has a mean depth of 8.0 feet, and a maximum of 9.0 feet in typical years with more normal precipitation.  The last several years we have received calls from lakeshore owners, recreational users, and anglers about increasing aquatic vegetation.  In fact in 2023, one of our fisheries staff observed nearly 100% coverage to the surface of aquatic vegetation and water clarity to the bottom, only to find turbid conditions and limited presence of vegetation during the survey later in the summer.  Walleye are the primary management species, along with Black Crappie and Yellow Perch secondary, in Round Lake.  Due to a Walleye fry performance study, Walleye have been stocked annually since 2018 (not stocked in 2020 due to COVID).  Sporadic natural reproduction occurs in Round Lake, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes.  Black Crappie and Yellow Perch typically sustain themselves through natural reproduction provided conditions and habitat are suitable.  A standard survey was conducted during the week of August 28, 2023 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 10 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nSince 1983, Walleye catch rates have averaged 16.2 per gill net (excluding the 2005 catch rate of 152.5 per gill net) and have varied from 7.7 per gill net in 2013 to 29.2 per gill net in 1994.  The 2023 catch rate was 20.0 per gill net, an increase from 2021 (14.5), and exceeded the expected range of catch rates for class 43 lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Total lengths of Walleye ranged from 6.4 to 25.7 inches and averaged 14.0 inches.  Ten year classes of Walleye were sampled including fish from 2013 through 2023.  Walleyes sampled from the 2015 and 2020 year class were proof of natural reproduction.  However, the most dominant year classes were 2023 (41% of aged sample) and 2021 (32% of aged sample), years when fry were stocked.  Growth was typical for southern Minnesota as average length of age-2 Walleye was 12.8 inches.  Condition of Walleye was normal (Wr=96), suggesting that sufficient prey is available.  Based on the catch rates, growth rates, and presence of multiple year classes of Walleyes, angling opportunities should be abundant into the future.   <br> \n <br> \nCrappie fishermen should be happy going into the future.  Black Crappie catch rates have steadily increased since 2009 (1.3 per trap net), and the trend continued in 2023 with a catch rate of 53.4 per trap net, an increase from the 2021 catch of 36.8 per trap net. The 2023 catch rate was the greatest of record dating back to 1983 and was more than 4 times the long-term average of 11.7 per trap net.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 3.4 to 14.2 inches and averaged 5.9 inches.  Although the fish are on the smaller side, time and growth rates should make this worth some angler hours in the near future.    <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 catch rate of Yellow Perch was 79.7 per gill net, the second highest catch rate on record since 1983.  Interestingly, 4 of the 5 greatest catch rates have occurred during the past 4 surveys (2017, 2019, 2021, and 2023), which correspond to years following adult Yellow Perch stocking that was conducted in 2016 due to successive low catch rates in 2013 and 2015 (1.7 per gill net each year).  The 2023 catch rate exceeded the expected range of catch rates for this type of lake.  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 4.4 to 11.6 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  Relative weight of Yellow Perch was 93, suggesting that they are healthy and that prey is abundant.  Perch anglers should keep this lake on their radar.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 Northern Pike catch rate was the highest ever recorded in a survey at 3.7 per gill net.  The catch was higher than the long term average of 1.2 per gill net.  The Northern Pike in Round Lake are naturally produced, as it has not been stocked with Northern Pike since 1984.  It is highly likely all of the aquatic vegetation the last several years have helped Northern Pike natural reproduction habitat.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 10.9 to 36.5 inches and averaged 22.2 inches.  These fish may produce some good action at times given how aggressive this species is on crank baits. Anglers should continue to be aware of the southern Minnesota Northern Pike regulation of 2 fish over 24 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe White Bass catch rate decreased from 32.3 per gill net in 2021 to 18.7 per gill net in 2023 but was still above the expected catch rates for this type of lake (0.3 to 9.9 per gill net).  Common Carp catch rates were 17.0 per gill net and 6.6 per trap net, both above significantly above their long term catch rates (1.9 per gill net and 1.8 per trap net).  However, most of the Common Carp were less than 8.0 inches in length.  Black Bullhead abundance remained low at 2.7 per gill net.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, Shortnose Gar, White Crappie, and White Sucker.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 930-acre lake, located in Jackson County approximately 9 miles southeast of the city of Worthington.  Since 2018, Round Lake has been included in a research project that is evaluating the performance of two strains of Walleye, the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) and the Mississippi Strain (MIS).  However, during 2020, no stocking was done as no Walleye egg-take operations were conducted due to the start of the COVID pandemic causing a DNR close-contact work moratorium.  Walleye stocking, including the performance evaluation, was restarted in 2021. The total fry quota for Round Lake was 473,500, of which half were MIS and half were LMS.  The MIS Walleye come from northern Minnesota and until recently, were the primary strain stocked in Windom management area.  The LMS originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Round Lake has areas of spawning habitat and has shown sporadic natural reproduction, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes.  To evaluate strain performance in 2021, 210 Walleye fingerlings were needed for testing and analysis. Night electrofishing was used to collect the Walleye for the study.  Standard night electrofishing (2 hours) was conducted on 14 September 2021. <br> \n <br> \nThe fingerling quota was met with standard night electrofishing as 275 fingerlings were captured during 2.2 hours of electrofishing (170 per hour).  Fingerlings ranged in length from 3.8 to 7.0 inches and averaged 5.0 inches.    As with previous years, LMS Walleye made up 65% of the Age 0 Walleye collected.  Additionally, about 28% came back as MIS Walleye, and only 7% were from natural reproduction.  The take home message is consistent in that LMS Walleye are out performing MIS Walleye in southern MN lakes.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 1024-acre lake located in Jackson County approximately two miles to the northeast of the City of Round Lake.  Round Lake has a mean depth of 8.0 ft., and a maximum of 9.0 ft, and had a Secchi depth of 1.0 ft.  Walleye are the primary management species in Round Lake and have been stocked annually since 2018.  Since 2018, Round Lake has been included in a research project that is evaluating the performance of two strains of Walleye, the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) and the Mississippi Strain (MIS).  The MIS Walleye come from northern Minnesota and until recently, were the primary strain stocked in Windom management area lakes.  The LMS originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Sporadic natural reproduction occurs in Round Lake, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes.  Secondary management species include Black Crappie and Yellow Perch.  Secondary management species populations typically sustain themselves through natural reproduction, but adult Yellow Perch were stocked in 2016 because of a low catch rate in the 2015 survey.  A standard survey was conducted during the week of August 26, 2019 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 11 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nSince 1983, Walleye catch rates have averaged 16.2 per gill net (excluding the 2015 catch rate of 152.5 per gill net) and have varied from 7.7 per gill net in 2013 to 29.2 per gill net in 1994.  The 2019 catch rate was 10.7 per gill net, which is similar to the 2017 catch rate of 10.3 and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net).  Total lengths of Walleye ranged from 7.1 to 27.6 inches and averaged 17.7 inches.  Five year classes of Walleye were sampled including fish from 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, all of which correspond to stocking events.  Growth was fast as mean length of age-2 Walleye was 15.9 inches.  The 2019 year class should be strong, as indicated by a catch rate of 94.7 young-of-the-year Walleye per hour in the fall electrofishing survey.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have steadily increased since 2009 (1.3 per trap net), and the trend continued in 2019 with a catch rate of 4.5 per trap net. The 2019 catch rate was slightly below the long-term average of 6.3 per trap net dating back to 1983, but was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (0.7 to 15.3 per trap net).  The 2019 White Crappie catch rate was 2.2 per trap net, an increase from the 2017 catch rate of 1.2 per trap net, and exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (0.0 to 2.0 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 3.0 to 14.5 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  Lengths of White Crappie ranged from 3.2 to 14.0 inches and averaged 5.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 Yellow Perch catch rate was 19.0 per gill net, which is the third highest catch rate observed on Round Lake since 1983.  The 2019 catch rate of 19.0 per gill net was similar to the long-term average of 19.1 per gill net, and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 6.0 to 10.4 inches and averaged 8.1 inches <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch rate of White Bass was 31.3, which is the highest catch rate ever observed in Round Lake and exceeds both the long-term average of 3.5 per trap net and the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in Minnesota (0.2 to 0.7 per trap net).  Lengths of White Bass ranged from 4.5 to 17.2 inches and averaged 6.2 inches.  The majority of the White Bass sampled were less than 6.0 inches long (89 percent).  White Bass were first sampled in Round Lake in 2005. Since then abundance has steadily increased, however effects on other species have not been detected thus far.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 catch rate of Northern Pike was 3.3 per gill net, which exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (0.0 to 2.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 19.6 to 30.6 inches and averaged 25.9 inches. Northern Pike have not been stocked in Round Lake, indicating that natural reproduction is maintaining this population.  Round Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the new Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike longer than 24 inches can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate was 18.7 per gill net, which is the highest observed catch rate since 1994, but is still below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in Minnesota (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net).  Other Species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, White Sucker, Green Sunfish, River Redhorse, and Shortnose Gar. <br> \n</p>",

THIS FIGURE DOES REPRESENT A FORTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE CATCH RATES FROM THE 1988 SURVEY HOWEVER.  GROWTH IS SOMEWHAT SLOWER THAN AVERAGE WHEN COMPARED TO WALLEYE POPULATIONS IN OTHER AREA LAKES.  THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE OF THE AGE 1, 2, AND 3 COHORTS.  THE AGE DISTRIBUTION ON WALLEYES IS BROAD, ENCOMPASSING AGES 1 THROUGH +8.  WALLEYES EXHIBITED GOOD CONDITION FACTORS FOR ALL AGE GROUPS.  THE 1984 AND 1986 FINGERLING STOCKINGS APPEAR TO HAVE PRODUCED TWO STRONG YEAR CLASSES.  SOME NATURAL REPRODUCTION SEEMS TO OCCUR, HOWEVER THE MIXED STOCKINGS OF FRY, FINGERLINGS ADN YEARLINGS IN THE PAST RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TRUE CONTRIBUTION OF NATURALLY PRODUCED FISH TO THE WALLEYE POPULATION. AMPLE SPAWNING AREAS DO EXIST ON THE NORTH, EAST AND SOUTH SHORES OF ROUND LAKE.  YELLOW PERCH GILL NET CATCH RATE OF 6.0 FISH PER NET WAS ABOUT THREE TIMES LESS THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND IS SLIGHTLY BELOW THE STATE MEDIAN OF 8.0.  THIS RATE REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL DROP FROM THE 1983 STOCKING OF NORTHERN PIKE FINGERLINGS HAS SEVERELY REDUCED RECRUITMENT TO ADULT SIZE.  ONLY ONE YOUNG OF THE YEAR YELLOW PERCH WAS COLLECTED DURING THE SHORELING SEINING PORTION OF THE SURVEY THE BLACK CRAPPIE TRAP NET CATCH RATES WERE SLIGHT LY BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  HOWEVER, AVERAGE SIZE WAS NEARLY TWICE THAT OF LOCAL AVERAGES.  MOST OF THE BLACK CRAPPIES COLLECTED WERE GREATER THAN 10 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH AND GREATER THAN AGE 5. IT APPEARS AS THOUGH A STRONG YEAR CLASS WAS PRODUCED IN 1990 AS SHORELING SEINING PRODUCED 163 YOUNG OF THE YEAR (MEAN=54.3+/-34) BLACK CRAPPIES. BLACK BULLHEAD CATCH RATES WERE ABOUT NINE TIMES BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  MOST BLACK BULLHEAD WERE 10 TO 11 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH.  NORTHERN PIKE, COMMON CARP, GOLDEN SHINER, CHANNEL CATFISH, BLUEGILL, WHITE CRAPPIE, AND FRESHWATER DRUM WERE CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY, HOWEVER THE APPROPRIATE CATCH INDICES WERE BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS FOR EACH SPECIES.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a shallow prairie lake located 2.5 miles northeast of the city of Round Lake.  The lake management plan indicates walleye as the primary species of management with yellow perch and black crappie as secondary species.  During the winter of 1995-96, an artificial walleye spawning reef was constructed near the south shore.  Evaluation of the reef is still in progress.Based on the information collected during the summer of 1997, the walleye population is still in good shape.  Walleye numbers in Round Lake were just above average when compared to similar lakes.  Walleye ranged from 11 to nearly 28 inches and averaged 19 inches.  Although walleye numbers appear to be down from the 1994 sample, fishing should still be good.Four years of evaluation of the spawning reef has occurred.  Young walleye produced naturally were sampled for two years before and after putting in the reef.  If the spawning reef was successful, more young walleye should have been observed after the reef was built than before.   The two years before the reef we collected 9 and 25 young walleye per hour of electrofishing.  The two years following the reef construction, we collected 10 and 0 young walleye per hour of electrofishing.  At this time, the reef does not appear to have had any positive or negative effects on natural reproduction.The yellow perch population has declined since 1988.  Yellow perch numbers were at the lower end of what is considered normal for lakes like Round.  In 1997, there was still plenty of yellow perch to produce some strong year classes.  Given the right spring spawning conditions, one or two strong year classes could improve yellow perch fishing substantially.The black crappie population had been decent for many years but in 1997 it was lower than usual.  It is not well understood what has led to their decline.  However, black crappie numbers were sufficient to sustain the population.  Black crappie ranged from 6.7 to 14.1 inches, indicating there remains a chance of catching a trophy.Although channel catfish are not specifically managed for in Round Lake there is a small population.  In the 1994 assessment, two large catfish were caught (11 and 17 pounds).  In 1997, 18 channel catfish were sampled but all were less than 19 inches long.  To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Round Lake through watershed management.  Improved land use practices will help insure this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake, near the town of Round Lake in Jackson County, is a 1,024-acre lake with a maximum depth of 9 feet.  Round Lake has a shoreline development index (SDI) of 1.2 (SDI of 1.0 is a perfect circle), which means Round Lake is well-named.  Establishing aquatic vegetation has been difficult given the lakes morphology, fish community, and landscape use.  Field tiling is a common practice on the landscape in this agricultural area, which creates a direct line for nutrient input.  Round Lake has an aeration system in operation during the winter months and has not experienced a partial winterkill since 1979, according to the DNR records.  Round Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch, black crappie, and channel catfish.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 8 of 2005.  Two gill nets and 10 trap nets were used to assess the fish community composition.At the time of the survey, there was an unprecedented walleye population in Round Lake.  An average statewide walleye catch rate during a lake survey would be around 15 walleye/gill net set.  Round Lake had a catch rate of nearly 153 walleye/gill net set.  It is no doubt the highest catch rate the Windom Area Lakes have experienced and quite possibly the highest catch rate statewide for a management lake.  It should be noted that this phenomenal catch rate was a result of walleye fry and not fingerling stockings.  Most of the fish are in the 10-13 inch range with another group of fish in the 14-20 inch range.  The average fish length was just over 12 inches.  The average angler has a great chance to catch some walleye but reasonable harvest should be considered in order to continue this great fishery.The channel catfish catch rate was not as high as we have seen in other years.  Despite the lower catch rate, the average sized catfish was nearly 18 inches.  According to our stocking records, channel catfish have not been stocked since 1981.  However, it is possible that channel catfish could be using the cavities in the spawning reef for reproduction.  During the warm summer months, this could be a destination for all of those catfish anglers with a good chance at catching a few.Yellow perch numbers have slightly rebounded since the last survey.  The catch rate for perch was nearly 10/set, which was average for this type of lake.  The average length was nearly 10 inches which is a \"keeper\" for most anglers targeting perch.  Most of the fish are in the 9-11 inch range.  Another panfish that could provide some table fare and at the same time provide some good action is black crappie.  The catch rate for black crappie matched a near record high in Round Lake.  Most of the crappie are in the 5-6 inch and 9-10 inch ranges.  The average length crappie was almost 8 inches while the largest fish measured was almost 14 inches.  When things slow up walleye fishing, it is possible to have some good action catching panfish, with an occasional \"keeper\".  The Round Lake panfish populations are likely benefiting with a large predator base, that eats the smaller panfish, which allows the escapees to grow faster and reach larger lengths.Despite the fact that northern pike are not managed for in Round Lake, there are some real \"dandies\" swimming around.  Although the catch rate was not real high, the average sized northern was almost 32 inches.Black bullhead numbers in both gill nets and trap nets were considerably lower than average for the Windom Area.  The walleye population may be keeping the bullhead numbers down.  Despite the few bullheads in Round Lake, there are several fisheries not far from Round Lake that would provide some great fishing for bullheads.  If bullheads are your target, consider fishing Indian, Okabena, Loon, Pearl, Ocheda, Iowa, Illinois, and Bella Lakes. Other species captured in the 2005 survey either by trap net and gill net were bigmouth buffalo, common carp, freshwater drum, white sucker, and white bass.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Round Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Ryan Doorenbos</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> INTRODUCTION <br> \nRound Lake is a 1024-acre, class 43 lake located in Jackson County approximately 2 miles to the northeast of the City of Round Lake. Round Lake has a mean depth of 8.0 ft., a maximum depth of 9.0 ft., and had a secchi reading of 0.8 ft. Nutrient input into Round Lake is high, as its watershed is dominated by agriculture. Aquatic vegetation is rare as the turbid waters prevent its establishment and growth. Prior to the installation of an aeration system, Round Lake was prone to winterkill, as it was opened to liberalized fishing 10 times between 1945 and 1979. An aeration system was installed in 1981 to prevent winterkill. Round Lake has not experienced a winterkill since its installation. A rock spawning reef was installed in February of 1996 with the intention of providing spawning habitat for walleyes. The effect of the reef has not been evaluated, but it has been speculated that it has positively impacted the fish community in Round Lake. Walleyes are the primary management species in Round Lake and have been stocked as fry three out of four years since 2008 (2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013). Secondary management species include black crappie, channel catfish, and yellow perch. Channel catfish, yellow perch, and black crappie populations are self-sustaining; therefore, these species have not been stocked since the aeration system was installed. The sport fish community consists of black crappie, channel catfish, northern pike, walleye, white bass, yellow perch, and white crappie. A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 12, 2013 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nThe 2013 walleye catch rate of 7.7 per gill net was the lowest catch rate observed in the last three decades on Round Lake. Since the record high catch rate of 152.5 per gill net in 2005, catch rates have steadily declined to 28.3 per gill net in 2009 and to 7.7 per gill net in 2013. The stocking regime has remained consistent during the decline, where walleye fry are stock three out of four years. The 2013 catch rate is within the expected range of catch rates (2.3 to 25.0 per gill net) for lakes similar to Round Lake. Since 1983, walleye catch rates have averaged 32.4 per gill net, including the 2005 catch rate, and averaged 17.4 per gill net, excluding the 2005 catch rate, both being magnitudes greater than what was observed in 2013. A population abundance model was used to estimate the 2013 population size for Round Lake based on gill net catches of walleye. The model estimated that there are around 8,315 walleyes in Round Lake, with 14 percent of them being 18.9 inches or larger. The model estimated that approximately 35 percent of the walleyes in Round Lake are around 10.5 inches, and 86 percent less than 11.3 inches. The actual net data indicated a larger size structure. Walleyes ranged in length from 6.4 to 26.7 inches and averaged 17.7 inches. Fifty-five percent of the walleyes captured were 19 inches or greater and 31 percent were 22 inches or greater. Six year classes of walleyes were sampled (2004, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012) and corresponded to years in which fry stocking occurred. The presence of several year classes indicated a relatively balanced population. Walleyes in the sample that were aged averaged 9.4 inches at age-1, 14.0 inches at age-2, and 16.7 inches at age-3, indicating fast growth in young fish. The steady decline in walleye catch rates over the last two surveys could be partially attributed to the increase in abundance of other top level predators in Round Lake. White bass were first sampled in Round Lake in 2005 and have increased in abundance since. White bass are aggressive predators that could predate on or compete with walleye, if prey resources are limited. Channel catfish are also abundant in Round Lake, and are very effective at controlling black bullhead abundance, a prey resource for walleye. Natural reproduction is limited in Round Lake; therefore the walleye population is highly dependent on successful fry stockings such as the 2005 stocking. Electrofishing in the fall of 2013 for a walleye genetics study yielded a fair number young-of-year walleyes, suggesting that the 2013 fry stocking was successful; however, the magnitude of the year class is not known. <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates have been highly variable in Round Lake, ranging from 0.5 per trap net in 1997 to 14.6 per trap net in 1983. The 2013 black crappie catch rate was up slightly from the 2009 catch rate of 1.3 per trap net and fell within this historic range at 2.3 per trap net. The 2013 catch rate fell within the expected range of catch rates (1.2 per trap net to 20.5 per trap net) for lakes similar to Round Lake. Crappie recruitment tends to be highly variable, where strong year classes are produced every 3-5 years, resulting in a boom-and-bust fishery. Strong crappie year classes are typically produced when water levels are high enough to flood upland vegetation during the spawning season. Black crappie size structure was relatively small, with black crappies ranging from 5.4 to 13.4 inches and averaging 9.0 inches. The majority of the black crappies sampled were between 8 and 10 inches in length. Only one crappie greater than 10 inches in length was sampled. Black crappies were plump suggesting that crappies are foraging well in Round Lake. The lack of crappies greater than 10 inches is likely the result of harvest of fish 10 inches or greater in length.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nYellow perch catch rates decreased from 11.7 per gill net in the 2009 survey to 1.7 per gill net in the 2013 survey, falling below the expected catch rate range (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net) for lakes similar to Round Lake. Yellow perch have never occurred in extremely high numbers, except in 1983 when the gill net catch rate was 126.0 per net. Excluding the 1983 catch rate, gill net catches of yellow perch have ranged from 1.7 per gill net in 2013 to 15.7 per gill net in 1988, averaging 7.6 per gill net. The five yellow perch captured in 2013 were likely from the same year class, as they ranged in length from 10.1 inches to 10.9 inches and averaged 10.7 inches. Yellow perch populations tend to fluctuate depending on the abundance of predator populations such as northern pike and walleye. Both northern pike and walleye abundances were down from previous surveys, indicating that other predators such as channel catfish or white bass may be utilizing perch as a forage base. No yellow perch less than 10 inches in length were sampled in this survey and only one young-of-year perch was sampled in the near shore survey indicating that natural reproduction has been minimal in recent years. Low water levels resulting from drought conditions likely reduce the amount of preferred spawning habitat available for adult perch, thereby limiting reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nCHANNEL CATFISH  <br> \nChannel catfish catch rates have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 1994 to 19.5 per gill net in 2001 and averaged 4.2 per gill net dating back to 1983. In 2013, channel catfish were captured at a rate of 7.0 per gill net, up from 3.0 per gill net in 2009 and 3.5 per gill net in 2005, and within the observed range of catch rates on Round Lake. Channel catfish ranged in length from 11.7 to 30.4 inches and averaged 18.6 inches. Fifty-two percent of the channel catfish captured were 19 inches or greater in length. Channel catfish were plump, indicating that sufficient prey is available. The channel catfish population in Round Lake is self-supporting as they have not been stocked since 1981. The walleye spawning reef installed in 1996 is likely functioning as a spawning area for channel catfish. The rock reef likely provides prime spawning habitat for channel catfish, who construct their nests in cavities.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD  <br> \nBlack bullhead gill net and trap net catch rates increased in 2013, compared to 2009 catch rates. Bullheads were captured at a rate of 14.7 per gill net and 2.4 per trap net in 2013, both the highest catch rates observed since 2001. Gill net and trap net catch rates were below the expected catch range (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net; 11.5 to 132.6 per trap net) for lakes similar to Round Lake. Black bullheads ranged in length from 5.4 to 13.1 inches and averaged 11.5 inches. Most of the black bullheads were large, with 96 percent being 10 inches or greater. Lack of bullheads less than 10 inches may be attributable to the predators in Round Lake, particularly channel catfish and walleye. At this time it appears that the black bullhead population in Round Lake is being controlled by the predators in the system.   <br> \n  <br> \nOTHER SPECIES  <br> \nThree northern pike were captured in the survey, ranging from 23.0 to 34.5 inches and averaging 27.7 inches. Catches of northern pike have been low in Round Lake since surveys began. The lack of preferred habitat (i.e., clear water and aquatic vegetation) likely contributes to the low catch rates of northern pike.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass were first sampled in Round Lake during the 2005 survey at a rate of 0.5 per gill net. The white bass catch rate increased to 3.7 per gill net in 2009. In 2013, the catch rate increased to 4.0 per gill net, which was within the expected catch range (0.3 to 9.9 per gill net) of lakes similar to Round Lake. Gill netted white bass ranged in length from 9.3 to 15.4 inches and averaged 12.4 inches. Some smaller (4 to 5 inches) white bass were sampled in trap nets, indicating that white bass are able to reproduce in Round Lake or are able to move into the lake through the West Fork of the Little Sioux River when water levels are high. White bass are aggressive predators that could potentially compete with other predators if prey is limited, but may also provide an additional angling opportunity in Round Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe freshwater drum catch rate increased from 2.0 per gill net in 2009 to 4.7 per gill net in 2013, which is the second highest catch rate observed on Round Lake. The 2013 catch rate of 4.7 per gill net is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included bigmouth buffalo, white sucker, common carp, quillback, shorthead redhorse, and white crappie. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 1024-acre lake located in Jackson County approximately two miles to the northeast of the City of Round Lake.  Round Lake has a mean depth of 8.0 ft., and a maximum of 9.0 ft, and had a Secchi depth of 0.7 ft.  Nutrient input into Round Lake is high, as its watershed is dominated by agriculture.  A rock spawning reef (300 ft. long x 25 ft. wide x 2 ft. tall) was installed in February of 1996 with the intention of providing spawning habitat for Walleye.  The spawning reef has since sunk a bit into the lake bottom and has not retained its full potential.  Walleye are the primary management species in Round Lake and have been stocked as fry three out of four years since 2008 (2012, 2013, 2014, 2016).  Beginning in 2017, Walleye fry will be stocked every other year to allow for additional \"blank\" years so that natural reproduction can be assessed.  Secondary management species include Black Crappie and Yellow Perch.  Secondary management species populations typically sustain themselves through natural reproduction, but adult Yellow Perch were stocked in 2016 because of a low catch rate in the 2015 survey.  Other sport fish present include Northern Pike, White Bass, and White Crappie.  A standard survey was conducted during the week of August 7, 2017 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate decreased from 16.3 per gill net in 2015 to 10.3 per gill net in 2017.  Since 1983, Walleye catch rates have averaged 28.9 per gill net, including the 2005 catch rate of 152.5 per gill net, and 16.6 per gill net without including the 2005 catch rate.  While the 2017 catch rate of 10.3 is below the long term average, it is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 6.0 to 27.4 inches and averaged 17.1 inches. Five year classes of Walleye were sampled including fish from 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016.  All of the year classes correspond to stocking events, except the 2015 year class, which accounted for 38 percent of the aged Walleye and was likely naturally reproduced.  Growth of Walleye in Round Lake was similar to growth in similar lakes, as average length at age-1, age-2, age-3, and age-4 were 9.8 inches, 13.7 inches, 15.5 inches, and 18.0 inches, respectively.  Walleye angling should be good on Round Lake in the next couple of years with nice sized fish available.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have steadily increased in gill nets since 2009.  Gill net catch rates have increased from 1.3 per gill net in 2009 to 3.0 per gill net in 2013 to 4.3 per gill net in 2015 to 6.0 per gill net in 2017, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.4 to 13.8 per gill net).  The trap net catch rate in 2017 was 3.4 per trap net, which was the same as the 2015 trap net catch rate.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 5.8 to 13.2 inches and averaged 9.5 inches.  Although catch rates of Black Crappie aren't high, there are still some available for anglers if they can find the right spot. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Yellow Perch catch rate was 21.3 per gill net, which is the second highest catch rate observed on Round Lake since 1983.  The 2017 catch rate of 21.3 per gill net exceeded the long term average of 19.1 per gill net, and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 6.9 to 11.9 inches and averaged 8.4 inches.  It appears that the Yellow Perch stocking in 2016 rejuvenated the population, and should provide a good food source for Walleye and an additional angling opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nThe White Bass catch rate in 2017 was 11.7 per gill net, an increase from 5.0 per gill net in 2015 and above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 9.9 per gill net).  Lengths of White Bass ranged from 4.1 to 16.9 inches and averaged 9.7 inches.  The presence of multiple year classes and newly hatched (in 2017) fish indicates that White Bass naturally reproduce in Round Lake.  White Bass are aggressive predators that could potentially compete with other predators if prey is limited, but may also provide an additional angling opportunity in Round Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nTen Northern Pike were sampled, ranging in length from 17.6 to 22.9 inches and averaged 20.4 inches.  Catches of Northern Pike have been low in Round Lake since surveys began. The Channel Catfish catch rate was 1.3 per gill net, which is the lowest catch rate recorded since 1994.  The abundant predators in Round Lake may be controlling the catfish population.  Other species sampled include Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Freshwater Drum, White Crappie, and White Sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

This history and habitat led to the inclusion of Round Lake in a Walleye study.  Department of Natural Resource researchers are comparing the effectiveness of two genetic strains of Walleye.  Historically the Windom area had received \"northern strains\" of Walleye from northern Minnesota Walleye spawning runs.  This was a very cost effective way of stocking Walleye statewide. However, a \"southern strain\" of Walleye was identified as unique and Lake Sarah in Murray County was a source of this strain.  Lake Sarah has not been stocked since 1991 and has maintained excellent numbers of Walleye naturally. An egg take has been conducted on Lake Sarah to raise these fish since 2015.  The two strains were stocked equally into Round Lake to test for differences in contribution to the catch.  Electrofishing for fall fingerling Walleye was used in September 2018 to determine the stocking success of both strains.  Fin clips of each fish sampled was collected and sent for DNA analysis and determination of strain.   <br> \nSix 15 minute electrofishing stations were used during the night of September 25, 2018 to collect Walleye for DNA analysis.  Twenty-five Walleye fingerling were sampled in 90 minutes of sampling for a total catch rate of 16.6 per hour of electrofishing.  Data for southwest Minnesota indicates that a catch rate less than 30 per hour is a weak year class.  Walleye ranged in length from 6.38 to 8.39 inches with a mean length of 7.31 inches.  Genetic samples indicate that the distribution is skewed toward northern strain Walleye after 1 year.  This indicates that Mississippi River strain may have a competitive advantage in Round Lake and may be better suited to survive.  However, we need to continue examining the contribution of each strain until they are old enough to be caught by anglers.  This will be the better indication of successful stocking, when fish can be caught and utilized by anglers.  Round Lake stocking will be monitored in this way each year, and with samples from older fish in later years, until the study expires in 2023.  Then a final determination of which strain to use will be determined.  The ultimate outcome should result in additional Walleye available to anglers, with an added benefit that Round Lake Walleye may become self-sustaining like Lake Sarah.     <br> \n</p>",

The average lakewide habitat score was 84.2 (+/- 2.8) out of 100 possible. A score of 84.2 indicates the lakewide shoreline condition is Moderately High (80-85). Approximately 73 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 79.9 (+/- 3.5) indicating shoreline habitat quality of developed sites is Moderate (70-80), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 95.8 (+/- 1.4) with Excellent (92+) habitat quality.</p>",
