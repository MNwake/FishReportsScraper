                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake is located 6 miles west of McGregor in east central Aitkin County. The public access is located on the north side of this moderately developed lake. This 300 acre lake is shallow and has a history of partial winterkills. The recent strong winterkills probably took place the winters of 1996-1997, 2012-2013 and 2013-2014; although, as this report was prepared we did receive another report of a likely kill beginning in February 2018. Partial winterkills are likely to have occurred in other years too, but were never reported or documented. Winterkills are not necessarily a bad thing and historically were fairly common in Minnesota.  In recent years, winters have not been as harsh and winterkills have not been as prevalent on a statewide scale. Partial winterkills are usually good for lakes particularly when it comes to bluegills. Following a winterkill there are typically enough survivors to repopulate the lake and growth rates tend to be very good for some time.  As densities increase with the addition of each new year class, the survival decreases and growth rates slow. The lake then winterkills again, thereby decreasing density, and the whole process of high survival and fast growth repeats itself.  When these lakes go several years without a winterkill, they can provide for excellent fisheries. As of 2017, black crappie, bluegill and northern pike populations were healthy and rebuilding. Largemouth bass were not sampled in 2017, but are known to inhabit the lake and sometimes take longer to recover from winterkill situations. <br> \n <br> \nIt appeared fish populations were beginning to recover from the most recent known winterkills in 2012-13 and 2013-14. The previous survey, in 2007, showed that populations of gamefish including northern pike, black crappie, bluegill and yellow perch were present in good numbers. The 2017 assessment showed much lower numbers for those same species, but they were mostly still within the normal ranges for this lake. Sizes were overall pretty good, especially for the panfish.  Yellow perch numbers did go down somewhat since 2007, although they were still above normal levels for this lake type.  Good perch populations are often a key component to quality fisheries. <br> \n <br> \nWhile no AIS are present at this time, extra diligence is in order to prevent the spread from other waters.  Lake users and shoreland owners should be remember to follow AIS rules for boating and installing/removing dock equipment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake is located 6 miles west of McGregor in east central Aitkin County.  The public access is located on the north side of this moderately developed lake.  This 300 acre lake is shallow and has a history of partial winterkills. The last strong winterkill probably took place the winter of 1996-1997.  Although, the special assessment conducted that spring observed no panfish, no fish were stocked, presumably due to anecdotal reports of anglers catching panfish. As observed in this survey, the fish populations rebounded. As is common on these occasional winterkill lakes, after the initial \"explosion\" in growth rates and abundance, the fishery begins to slow down.  As densities increase with the addition of each new year class, the survival decreases and growth rates slow.  The lake then winterkills again, thereby decreasing density, and the whole process of high survival and fast growth repeats itself. <br> \n <br> \nWhen these lakes go several years without a winterkill, they provide for excellent fisheries. At present, there are abundant black crappie, bluegill and northern pike populations. <br> \n <br> \nWhile most of the black crappie were less than 9 inches in length, several fish over 11 inches long were sampled.  The largest one was over 13 inches long. Black crappie may be experiencing a slow down in growth rates, which would likely be related to the higher density.   <br> \nThe abundant 2001 and 2002 year classes of bluegill are predominant in the population.  Approximately 80 percent of the fish sampled came from those year classes. While the average bluegill sampled was only 6.3 inches in length, more than 10 percent of the fish sampled were at least 8 inches long.  Although growth rates are still reasonably fast, a slow down would be expected until the next winterkill once again reduces the extremely high density of bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough northern pike growth rates at Rock Lake were not exceptional, the pike population did display an excellent size distribution.  In our sample, northern pike ranged from 17 to 32 inches in length, and the average captured in the gill nets was over 25 inches long.  More than 70% of the entire sample was over 24 inches.  The current perch population provides an excellent forage base for the pike. <br> \n</p>",
