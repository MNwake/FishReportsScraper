SPAWNING HABITAT IS POOR FOR NORTHERN PIKE SINCE MARSH AREAS ARE ABSENT. GOOD SPAWNING HABITAT EXISTS FOR LARGEMOUTH BASS AND OTHER CENTRARCHIDS.  BLACK GRUB (NEASCUS SPP.) AND YELLOW GRUB (CLINOSTOMUM MARGINATUM) WERE THE ONLY PARASITES FOUND.  NORTHERN PIKE, ROCK BASS, YELLOW PERCH, LARGEMOUTH BASS AND BLUEGILL WERE THE SPECIES INFECTED WITH NEASCUS AND ALL SPECIES HAD A HEAVY INFECTION OF NEASCUS.</p>",
