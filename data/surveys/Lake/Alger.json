Northern Pike were sampled in Alger Lake in similar low numbers as seen in the previous assessment.  The average weight of the seven Northern Pike sampled was 2.4 pounds the largest fish was 25.9 inches (4.3 pounds).  Historical records show the lake is capable of producing fish measuring above 30 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were abundant with the average length of 7.2 inches and the largest fish was 10.2 inches (0.4 pound).
