                "narrative": "<p>Little Ball Bluff Lake is located in northeastern Aitkin County.  The lake is relatively small and deep with sharp drop-offs and clear water. The shallow-water areas of Little Ball Bluff Lake are narrow and steep-sided, which limits the catch in fishery surveys. Most of the development is located along the northeast side of the lake.  The primary species of interest to anglers include northern pike, black crappie and bluegill. Northern pike were caught at a rate 4.7 fish per net lift, which remained unchanged since the last survey in 1996. The northern pike average about two pounds in size, but there are some individuals10 pounds or larger in the population.  Both the bluegill and black crappie are found in normal abundance for this lake type. These species are slow growing resulting in few fish living long enough to reach memorable size, which is typical of these small, deep lakes.  The average bluegill is less than 6 inches long with few fish sampled greater than 8 inches in length.  The average black crappie sampled was 8 inches long and weighed about one-third of a pound. A small population of cisco exists in the lake.  Successful reproduction of cisco is limited by spawning habitat and only one individual was sampled in this survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Ball Bluff Lake is a small, deep lake with clear water and steep drop-offs, and is located in northeastern Aitkin County.  The steep shoreline makes fish sampling difficult.  There is a state owned public access with an earthen ramp on the northeast shore.  The lake has relatively low productivity with moderate abundance of most fish species.  Bluegill and northern pike exhibited slow growth resulting in few fish reaching larger sizes, although some bluegills grew old enough to exceed preferred size.  Black crappie have more typical growth rates for lakes in the Aitkin fisheries area.  The fish community, in general, is similar to other small lakes in the area with opportunities for black crappie, bluegill, and northern pike.  While tullibee have been sampled in most previous surveys, none were sampled in 2013.  Habitat for this cold water species is present, but marginally adequate.  Another species not observed in 2013, but likely still present, is largemouth bass.  Bass had been appearing to increase in abundance in recent surveys, which is similar to many other waters in the north half of the state.  Anglers looking for a tranquil setting with abundant natural beauty while chasing these popular species might enjoy this secluded lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A temperature - dissolved oxygen (TDO) profile was collected on August 2, 2017 to measure the amount of thermal habitat available for tullibee. The TDO3 (temperature at 3 mg/l dissolved oxygen) was determined to be 12 degrees C. The water was warm from the surface to about 11 feet deep. The overall oxy-thermal habitat for tullibee was limited and found between 11 to 20 feet deep, and poor in deeper water. Data collected from 2009-2017 indicate only marginal thermal habitat for tullibee in most years, with the best conditions found in 2014 2015, and 2017, although still \"poor\" compared to other lakes in the area that are monitored. Because the Aitkin Area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of cold-water habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The shallow-water areas of Little Ball Bluff Lake are narrow and steep-sided, which limits the catch in fishery surveys. What this survey did find was a fair population of northern pike, which ranged up to 33.7 inches long and averaged a respectable 21.5 inches. The previous two surveys sampled pike at less than the average rate for this lake type. The larger pike should provide some action for anglers. Anglers should practice reduced harvest on the larger pike because forage is low and the lake is less capable of maintaining production of larger fish.    Adult yellow perch were stocked at 6.2 lbs per acre in 1992 and 3.5 lbs per acre in 1993 to prey on small sunfish so that the remaining sunfish could grow to sizes acceptable to anglers. Few yellow perch were caught in this survey. The northern pike population probably increased enough to reduce the adult perch back to low levels. Northern pike grew well on the enhanced diet of yellow perch. Now that the perch appear to be nearly depleted, pike growth will probably slow and pike size will return to a lower level of acceptance to anglers.    Black crappie and bluegill abundance and size structure are normal for this lake type, except no bluegills over 8.0 inches were caught. Growth is normal for the crappies, below normal for young bluegills and above normal for older bluegills. The older bluegills probably grew well by preying on the young perch produced by the stocked yellow perch.    A small population of tulibees exists in the lake and the fish tend to grow well when young. The production of new tulibees is sporadic and fishing will be sporadic as well as limited by low abundance.</p>",
