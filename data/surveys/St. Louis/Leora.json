Forty-one percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Previous assessments have been conducted in 1993, 1988, 1978, 1973, and Leora Lake was initially surveyed in 1951.     Leora Lake is a known as a largemouth bass lake, however, it is also presently being managed for walleyes through fingerling or fry stocking.  Largemouth bass electrofishing catch rates were 6.2 fish per hour, which is well below the 1993 values of 17.4 per hour.  Growth rates were fast for largemouth bass compared to populations from other lakes in the Duluth area.  Walleye catch rates were average, but well below the historicly high rates in 1993.  Walleyes born in 1996 (a year with no stocking) were collected, which provides the first evidence of natural reproduction of walleyes in this lake.  Leora lake currently has an abundance of slow growing northern pike, apparently stemming from several consistent year classes from 1994 to 1997.  The panfish population is comprised of bluegill and black crappie.  Bluegills are more abundant, but average size is somewhat small (4.9 inches), and growth rates are slow.  Black crappies are less abundant, but the average size is 8.5 inches, and growth rates are fast.  Yellow perch catch was low, but their abundance has fluctuated greatly since the initial survey in 1951.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leora Lake is a 269-acre lake with 110 (41%) littoral acres and a maximum depth of 35 feet. The lake is located east of Highway 53, near Cotton, MN. Leora Lake has a concrete, back in public access on the south side of the lake directly off of CR #49. Primary management species are largemouth bass and walleye. Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in even years since 2000. Leora was last assessed in 2003.  Leora was surveyed during the summer of 2011 to update information about fish populations and aquatic habitat and to evaluate the success of the walleye stocking program.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 4.0 per gillnet lift was down from 2003 (9.2) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 15.3 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Ten year-classes were present from 1995 through 2010, with a strong 2008 year-class.  Seventy-one percent of the walleyes aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.  Previous investigations have ranged from 50-100% correspondence of aged walleye to stocked year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 22 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 25.0 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass average length was 11.9 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 through 2010 were represented, except 2008.  Shoreline seining captured 19 young-of-the-year (YOY) largemouth bass with an average length of 2.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 6.5 per gillnet lift was down from 2003 (9.8) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 19.7 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2004 to 2010 were represented, with a strong 2007 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 2.9 per trapnet lift was up from 2003 (1.2) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 9.4 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2004 to 2009 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 8.8 per trapnet lift was up from 2003 (1.3) and average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 6.0 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001to 2007 were represented.  Shoreline seining captured 39 YOY bluegill with an average length of 1.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 0.3 per gillnet lift was the same as 2003 and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 6.1 inches, but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Both perch captured were from the 2008 year-class.  Shoreline seining captured 7 YOY yellow perch with an average length of 2.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included Iowa darter, Johnny darter, blacknose shiner, golden shiner, tadpole madtom, pumpkinseed sunfish, bluntnose minnow and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Forty aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 20 transects.  Variable-leaf pondweed was the most frequently found plant (100% of transects) followed by flat-stem pondweed and large-leaf pondweed (90% of the transects).  The most common substrate types were sand, gravel, muck and detritus which were identified along 100%, 50%, 25% and 25% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Leora is a slightly acidic, moderately hard water lake with moderate fertility.   <br> \n <br> \nLeora Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2011.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.</p>",

Leora Lake has a concrete, back in public access on the south side of the lake directly off of CR #49. Primary management species are Walleye and Largemouth Bass.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in even years since 2000.  Leora was last assessed in 2011.  Leora was surveyed during the summer of 2021 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the success of the Walleye stocking program.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 5.2 per gillnet lift was up from 2011 (4.0) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 18.1 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  The proportion of adult Walleye that exceeded quality size (greater than 15 inches) was 94%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 20 inches) was 10%.   Four year-classes were present from 2010 through 2018, with a strong 2016 year-class.  One-hundred percent of the Walleyes aged corresponded to stocked year-classes, with the 2016 year-class currently offering very good Walleye angling opportunities in Leora Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 44 Largemouth Bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 40.5 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth Bass average length was 11.6 inches and growth was below average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  The proportion of adult Largemouth Bass that exceeded quality size (greater than 12 inches) was 53%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 15 inches) was 17%.  The proportion that exceeded memorable size (greater than 20 inches) was 3%.   <br> \n <br> \nLeora also offers quality angling opportunities for Northern Pike.  Northern Pike abundance of 3.4 per gillnet lift was down from 2011 (6.5) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 26.7 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  The proportion of adult Northern Pike that exceeded quality size (greater than 21 inches) was 94%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 28 inches) was 17%.  The proportion that exceeded memorable size (greater than 34 inches) was 11%.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish in Leora are in average abundance but tend to run small in size.  Black Crappie abundance of 2.8 per gillnet lift was up from 2011 (0.7) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black Crappie mean length was 8.0 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 4.6 per trapnet lift was down from 2011 (8.8) and average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of Bluegills was 4.6 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance of 6.0 per gillnet lift was up from 2011 (0.3) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of Yellow Perch was 6.5 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leora Lake is a 269 acre lake with 110 (41%) littoral acres and a maximum depth of 35 feet.  The lake is located east of Highway 53, near Cotton, MN.  Leora Lake has one gravel public acess on the south side of the lake directly off of CR #49.  Primary management species are largemouth bass and walleye.  Walleye were stocked in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997, 2000 and 2002.    Largemouth bass spring electrofishing abundance was 42.5 fish/hr.  This catch was average for Duluth Area lakes and was within the range of values from previous assessments in 1993 and 1998 (45.9 fish/hr  and 11.8 fish/hr, respectively).  The mean length of fish sampled decreased from 13.6 inches in 1998 to 12.0 inches in 2003.  Growth for largemouth bass was fast for Duluth Area lakes with age 4 mean length at 12.0 inches.  Fish from the 1998 year class were the most abundant, although, other year classes from 1997-2001 as well as 1993 were well represented.    Walleye abundance was 9.2 fish/gillnet and an increase from 4.2 fish/gillnet in 1998.  Over the past three assessments (1993, 1998, 2003), walleye gillnet abundance has been average to above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length of fish sampled increased from 12.4 inches in 1998 to 17.2 inches in 2003.  Age 4 walleye exhibited average growth for Duluth Area lakes with a mean length of 15.6 inches, an increase over 1998 (14.1 inches).  Fifty-two percent (26 fish) of the fish aged were born in years that correspond to walleye stocking.  Age classes 2-8 and 13 were present in the assessment.    Northern pike abundance was 9.8 fish/gillnet and above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Over the past four assessments (1988, 1993, 1998 and 2003), northern pike abundance has increased from 2.5 fish/gillnet to 9.8 fish/gillnet.  Growth was slow for Duluth Area lakes with a mean length of age 4 fish at 19.9 inches.  The overall mean length of fish sampled increased from 17.4 inches in 1998 to 20.4 inches (2003).  The most abundant age classes were ages 2-4.  Black crappie abundance was 1.2 fish/trapnet, a decrease from 2.8 fish/trapnet in 1998,  and 8.8 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catch was above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Growth was fast for Duluth Area lakes with a mean length at age 4 of 8.5 inches.  The mean length of fish decreased from 8.9 inches in 1998 to 6.7 inches (2003).  Twenty-five fish were aged with age classes 2-5 present.    Bluegill abundance decreased from 5.6 fish/trapnet in 1998 to 1.8 fish/trapnet in 2003 and was below average for Minnesota lakes of similar type. This reflected a pattern of declining abundance over the past four assessments (47.0 fish/trapnet in 1988 to 1.8 fish/trapnet in 2003).  The mean length of fish decreased from 6.4 inches (1998) to 5.7 inches (2003).  Growth of age 4 bluegills was below average for Duluth Area lakes for the last two assessments (4.9 inches in 1998 and 4.1 inches in 2003).    Other fish species sampled during the assessment included golden shiner, pumpkinseed, white sucker and yellow perch.    </p>",

This catch rate and average size place the lake amoung the better largemouth bass lakes in the Duluth area.  Walleye numbers are at historic highs for this lake and have an average size of 15.6 inches.  Only four age classes were present with the 1989 year class providing the bulk of the catch.  Good numbers of northern pike, bluegill and black crappie round out the fishery in Leora Lake.</p>",
