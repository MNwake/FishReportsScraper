                "narrative": "<p>Shallow Lake is a 531 acre lake located south of Warba, MN.  The lake has a county access and moderate to high shoreline development.  The 2000 lake management plan indicates walleye and northern pike were the primary species of management with black crappie and largemouth bass as secondary species.The walleye gill-net catch rate of 1.8 fish/net was just below average for this type of lake.  The 2003 catch did not attain the management goal of 2.5 fish/gill net, however, six year-classes and a fairly diverse size range was represented.  Fish from 8.7 to 26.3 inches were sampled and they averaged 16.0 inches.  Two-year-old fish represented 38% of the sample.  Based on age analysis, the population continues to be supported by stocking as it appears that natural reproduction is very limited.  Growth was similar to statewide averages with fish attaining 15.1 inches after four years of growth. The northern pike gill-net catch rate was highest on record if the 1968 assessment is excluded which only used one gill net.  The catch of 3.6 fish/net in 2003 was within the 1st quartile and lake class median of 2.2 and 5.0 fish/net.   The sampled fish ranged from 14.2 and 35.8 inches and had a mean length of 24.8 inches.  Six year-classes from age one to age six were represented with no dominant year-class.  Growth rates were good compared to the statewide average for northern pike.  Fish were nearly 30 inches after five years of growth.  Populations characterized by low to moderate density, good size distribution, and good growth are becoming increasingly rare in Minnesota.  Anglers concerned about the long-term health of the population should consider releasing northern pike longer than 24-26 inches to help maintain a balance population.The black crappie population has continued to do well in Shallow Lake.  In 2003, the gill-net and trap-net catch rates were both average when compared to lake similar to Shallow.  Fish sampled in the gill nets ranged from 4.6 to 11.8 inches and averaged 7.8 inches.  Fairly consistent recruitment was observed as six year-classes from two to seven years old were sampled.  Two and four-year-old fish were the most abundant representing 28 and 32% of the sample.  Growth was slower than the statewide averages for one and two years old fish but similar to statewide averages for the remaining ages.Largemouth bass are difficult to sample with our standard summer netting gears and methods.  Three largemouth bass were sampled in gill nets and three were sampled in trap nets.  These fish ranged from 6.4 to 14.1 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected.Bluegill trap net catch rates have been high (ranging from 48.8 to 87.1/net) in nearly all assessments.  The catch in 2003 was the highest on record at 87.1 fish/net; which is twice the 3rd quartile of 43.4 fish/net for lake class 23.   The fish ranged from 3.7 to 8.3 inches and averaged 5.7 inches.  Although age and growth information was not collected in this assessment it is likely that growth was slow due to the high density of the population.Tullibee are important prey for predators like walleye and northern pike.  The presence of a healthy tullibee population is often associated with trophy predators.  During the last four assessments, tullibee numbers, size distributions and condition have been good.  In 2003, the gill-net catch was above average for this type of lake, with a catch of 9.8 fish/net.  The fish ranged from 8.2 to 17.9 inches and averaged 13.5 inches.Yellow perch were sampled at a gill-net catch rate of 4.3 fish/net, which is about average for lakes similar to Shallow.  The gill-net catch rates have been below average in all assessments except in 1987 when 20.6 fish/net were captured.  The fish were small, ranging from 5.5 to 6.9 inches.  Age and growth information were not collected in this assessment.Other species sampled during the population assessment included hybrid sunfish, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shallow Lake is a 531 acre lake near Warba, Minnesota.  Shallow Lake has clear, well oxygenated water and the Secchi disk transparency of 16 feet was comparable with past surveys of the lake.  The lake is characterized by a steep sided, deep basin on the western side and a shallow flat with emergent plants on the eastern side.  Residential development is relatively high around most of the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were the most common fish in the gill net sample.  Perch catches have varied considerably and the 2009 perch catch was above average for Shallow Lake but within the expected range when compared to similar lakes.  The size structure was poor and perch were generally too small to be of interest to anglers.  Given their relative abundance and size structure, perch are likely an important prey species for northern pike and walleye in Shallow Lake. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were the second most common fish species in the gill net sample and the catch rate was within the expected range when compared to similar lakes.  The lake supports a high percentage of large tullibee as most individuals ranged from 14 to 17 inches.  Tullibee are an important prey species and are often associated with the production of large predators including northern pike and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nShallow Lake continues to support a modest walleye fishery.  The catch rate was near the average for Shallow Lake and similar lakes.  Size structure was good, as most fish exceeded the quality size of 15 inches.  Two walleye exceeding 27 inches were captured in the trap net, indicating the potential for trophy walleye production.  Shallow lake is stocked regularly with walleye fingerlings.  Analysis of bony structures identified 8 year classes which generally corresponded to stocked years.  Growth was near the statewide average with individuals typically exceeding 14 inches by age 4.  Given the size structure and catch rate, fair angling opportunities should exist for this species. <br> \n <br> \nShallow Lake has a history of supporting a low to moderate northern pike population characterized by a favorable size structure.  The catch rate in 2009 was near the average for Shallow Lake and was within the expected range when compared to similar lakes.  The size structure remained good, as most individuals exceeded 21 inches.  Twenty-four percent of the captured fish exceeded 28 inches, indicating good angler opportunities for large individuals.   Six year classes were present and recruitment appeared to be relatively consistent.  Growth was fast for the first four years with individuals typically exceeding 24 inches by age 4 and average thereafter with individuals typically exceeding 28 inches by age 7.   <br> \n <br> \nShallow Lake has a history of producing bluegill in relatively high abundance.  In 2009, the trap net catch rate was typical for the lake and was within the expected range for similar lakes.  The size structure was modest, as most fish exceeded 6 inches.  Few individuals exceeded 8 inches, however.  The lack of large individuals may limit angler interest in this species. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at a rate within the expected range for the lake type and typical for Shallow Lake.  The size structure was relatively poor as few individuals exceeded 8 inches.  Five year classes were identified.  The 2005 year class (age 4) comprised 63% of the sample, suggesting inconsistent recruitment.  Inconsistent recruitment of black crappie is a common life history trait for many populations, often resulting in \"boom and bust\" angling cycles.  Growth was average with individuals typically exceeding 8 inches by age 4.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in relatively high numbers.  The size structure was dominated by small fish, although two bass exceeding 18 inches were captured.  Growth was near the statewide average with individuals typically exceeding 12 inches by age 4.  Given the abundance of this species, good angling opportunities should exist.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured include pumpkinseed sunfish, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \nShallow Lake has a high amount of residential development surrounding it.  The protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches results in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future.

                "narrative": "<p>Shallow Lake is primarily managed for walleye and largemouth bass.  Walleye fingerlings/yearlings have been stocked, most recently in 1995.     Walleye were sampled in gill nets.  The catch rate (3.0/set) was within the expected range for lakes of this type.  The mean length was 15.7 inches, ranging from 9.4 to 21.7 inches.  The mean weight was 1.5 pounds.  Trap nets also sampled walleye, and that catch rate (0.6/set) also was within the expected range.  The mean length of trap net sampled walleye was 13.7 inches, ranging from 8.3 to 22.4 inches.  Walleye growth rates were near the statewide mean for all ages examined (ages 1-8).  Over 25% of the walleye sampled were from non-stocked year classes, indicating natural reproduction is occurring.     Largemouth bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing.  The mean length was 8.8 inches (ranging from 5.7 to 16.6 inches), with a mean weight of 0.5 pounds.  Gill nets sampled five bass, for a catch rate (0.8/set) within the expected range.  The mean length of gill net sampled bass was 13.1 inches, ranging from 8.9 to 15.9 inches.  The trap net bass catch rate (0.6/set) was within the expected range.  These five bass ranged in length from 4.8 to 9.1 inches.  Bass growth rates were below (<85%) the statewide mean for ages 1-3, and near the mean for ages 4-6.     The northern pike gill net catch rate (3.1/set) was within the expected range.  The mean length was 25.0 inches, ranging from 19.1 to 30.0 inches.  The mean weight was a hefty 3.7 pounds.     The black crappie gill net catch rate (2.9/set) exceeded the expected range, with a mean length of 6.9 inches (ranging from 4.4 to 11.5 inches).  Trap net caught black crappie had a catch rate (3.0/set) that exceeded the expected range.  The mean length and range in lengths were similar to the gill net data.    The bluegill trap net catch rate (48.8/set) exceeded the expected range.  The mean length was 5.5 inches, and ranged from 3.1 to 8.1 inches.  Gill nets sampled 125 bluegills (13.9/set), ranging in length from 3.1 to 7.8 inches (mean length=5.0 inches).  No expected range was available for gill net sampled bluegill.     Tullibee were sampled in gill nets at a rate near the upper end of the expected range (10.4/set).  This may account for the large mean size of northern pike as tullibee can be an important part of the pike's diet.     Other species sampled in test nets include: brown and yellow bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow perch.     In 1974, Shallow Lake produced the state record brown bullhead.  It weighed 7 pounds, 1.5 ounces, and was caught by William Meyer.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shallow Lake is in the Mississippi River Watershed southwest of Warba.  Shallow Lake has a total surface area of 531 acres, a littoral area of 268 acres (50% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep), and a maximum depth of 85 feet.  The lake has one unnamed inlet and an outlet through a bog that leads to the Swan River.  The lake is characterized by a steep sided, deep basin on the western side and a shallow flat side with emergent plants on the eastern end.  Previous surveys have identified a diverse aquatic plant community.  Residential development is relatively high around most of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan was last revised in 2015 when Northern Pike and Walleye were the primary management species.  The goals of the plan were to maintain the Walleye gill net catch at 3.0 fish/gill net and maintain a quality Northern Pike population characterized by a catch of less than 3.0 fish/gill net with 25% exceeding 28 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nShallow Lake was stocked with Walleye fingerlings at a rate of two pounds per littoral acre (acres less than 15 feet deep) every other year from 2004- 2015 to improve the Walleye gill net catch rate.  This was a higher than typical stocking rate for lakes in the Grand Rapids Fisheries Area and appeared to contribute to marginally higher catch rates, but Walleye growth was slow.  The stocking rate was adjusted beginning in 2016 when one pound of fingerlings per littoral acre were stocked annually with hopes of improving growth rates by reducing competition between young Walleye.  A standard survey was conducted on Shallow Lake in June of 2022 consisting of 9 gill nets and 9 trap nets. The purpose of the survey was to determine the status of the fish community and continue to evaluate the effectiveness of Walleye fingerling stocking.  Electrofishing for Largemouth Bass was not completed in 2022 due to staffing and workload considerations.   <br> \n <br> \nShallow Lake has a history of low to moderate gill net catches of Walleye and the population is maintained by stocking.  It should be noted that lakes with similar habitats typically do not produce large Walleye catches.  The 2022 gill net catch rate was typical for lakes with similar habitats, average for Shallow Lake, and near the management goal.  Walleye lengths from the gill nets ranged from 9.1 to 27.6 inches and averaged 18.3 inches.  Recent recruitment appeared to be poor as age estimates ranged from age-4 to 21 suggesting average year-class production from 2016-2018 but poor survival from 2019-2021.  Growth was faster than the previous survey and was near the statewide average as Walleye averaged 14.6 inches by age 4.  Older fish appeared to grow slowly, however.  Several fish exceeding age-10 were observed suggesting low harvest rates and good adult survival.  It continues to appear that stocking can maintain a fair Walleye fishery, but a larger population is unsustainable due to poor recruitments caused by competition from other predators, limited prey, and overall habitat conditions. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have occurred in low numbers with a quality size structure.  Average size and growth are typically good when Northern Pike occur at low densities so relatively low pike numbers are a desirable attribute of Shallow Lake.  The 2022 catch rate was typical for similar lakes but the highest observed for Shallow Lake.  The fishery continued to produce an excellent size structure.  Northern Pike ranged from 15 to 43.3 inches and averaged 27.6 inches.  Thirty-three percent of sampled pike exceeded 28 inches, exceeding the management goal.  Growth was fast and resembled past surveys.  Pike averaged 28 inches by age-6.   Age distribution was balanced with fish up to age-10 and 47% were age-6 or older suggesting low adult mortality.  Releasing medium and large pike is the best way to maintain a quality Pike population and avoid the problem of too many small pike.  Anglers are encouraged to help maintain the quality pike population in Shallow Lake by limiting harvest to pike under 22 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie populations often exhibit irregular recruitment resulting in dominant year-classes, shifting age and size structures, and inconsistent angler success.  Shallow Lake has a history of sporadically producing a quality Black Crappie fishery.  The gill net catch in 2022 was high compared to similar lakes and above the long-term average for Shallow Lake. Gill net caught crappie ranged from 4.5 to 13.2 inches and averaged 9 inches with 36% of the gill net sampled crappie exceeding 10 inches.  Growth resembled past surveys and was fast.  Crappie averaged over 10 inches by age 5.  Recruitment appeared to occur frequently and ages-2 to 10 were present.  Year-class strength varied and 45% of the sampled fish were from the 2019 year-class.  The catch rate and size structure suggested good angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nLakes with similar habitats often produce high numbers of slow growing sunfish.  Bluegill catches from Shallow Lake were high in most surveys and relatively few fish exceeded 8 inches.  The 2022 catch was typical for the lake class but below average for Shallow Lake.  Size structure has been poor but improved dramatically in 2022 when Bluegill from the trap nets ranged from 3.1 to 9.2 inches and averaged 6.5 inches and 10% exceeded 8 inches.  The improved size quality followed a record low catch in 2014 suggesting an improvement in growth rates.  Growth rates were described as slow in the 1992 survey but improved in 2022 when they were faster than typical for the lake class.  Bluegill averaged 6.1 inches by age-6, but only averaged 7.3 inches by age-8.  Despite the improvement, growth was still too slow to consistently produce a high-quality fishery.  Higher quality Bluegill fisheries typically support low to moderate numbers and produce 8-inch fish in 8 years or less.  Ten year-classes were present, and recruitment appeared consistent.  Fish up to age-11 were sampled suggesting relatively low adult mortality.  Good angling opportunities for high angler catch rates of moderately sized Bluegill should exist given the overall abundance and size structure.  Bluegill over 8 inches may take a decade or more to produce so anglers are encouraged to release larger fish to help maintain the improved size quality.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass have been commonly sampled from Shallow Lake.  Bass were sampled at a catch rate which is typical for the lake class.  Bass ranged from 12.5 to 16.4 inches and averaged 14.7 inches.  It should be noted that Largemouth Bass are difficult to sample in standard survey nets.  Spring electrofishing was not conducted in 2022, but sampling in 2009 indicated relatively high bass abundance with a population dominated by small fish. <br> \n <br> \nCisco (Tullibee) are important prey that contribute to the production of large predators such as Northern Pike and Walleye.  Cisco were not sampled from Shallow Lake prior to the 1970's but catches were moderate over the last several decades.  The 2022 Shallow Lake catch was typical compared to similar lakes, but below average for Shallow and the lowest observed since 1981.  Captured Cisco were generally large, ranging from 11.6 to 18.5 inches with an average length of 13.9 inches.  Shallow Lake has been closed to sports netting for Cisco, but residents indicate that ice angling for this species has increased in popularity.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are important prey for Walleye and low numbers may limit the Walleye population.  Lakes that resemble Shallow Lake typically produce low to moderate catches of Yellow Perch.  The 2022 catch was typical for similar lakes and near the long-term average for Shallow Lake.  Size structure was moderate as perch ranged from 5.7 to 10.6 inches with an average length of 7.1 inches.  Small size and relatively low numbers likely limit the popularity of the perch fishery, but they appeared to exist in sufficient numbers to support the existing predatory fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to drain all water from boats and bait containers, remove all vegetation from boats and trailers, and are encouraged to wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another waterbody.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shallow Lake is 531 acre, moderately fertile, hardwater lake that fits in Schupp's lake class #23, and is classified as a walleye-centrarchid lake.  Shallow Lake has minimal natural reproduction of walleye and is stocked with fingerlings on an even year basis.Northern pike are of low abundance with a gill net catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 1.0 per gill net lift.  This is lower than the statewide mean and the first quartile break for northern pike in this lake class (first-third quartile range = 2.3-8.3).  Though northern pike exhibit low abundance, their mean weight of 3.8 pounds is greater than the statewide mean and lake class median.  Northern pike abundance appears to be limited by a lack of spawning habitat and consequent minimal recruitment.  This low recruitment coupled with a high quality forage base of cisco and yellow perch contribute to fast growth (28.7\" at age 5).  Age 2 (n=3), 4 (n=2), and 5 (n=2) fish were most abundant in the gill net catch, and age-classes 1-6 were sampled.Bluegill were abundant in both gill nets and trap nets.  The gill net CPUE of 5.7 was slightly above the third quartile break (first-third quartile range = 0.7-5.7).  The trap net CPUE of 52.9 was 37% larger than the third quartile break (first-third quartile range = 9.8-38.7).  The trap net length frequency distribution ranged from 3.5 to 8.9 inches with a Proportional Stock Density (PSD) of 30.  The gill net length frequency distribution ranged from 3.5 to 8.9 inches with a PSD of 65.  Age 3-8+ fish were sampled with age 4 (35%) and age 8 (21%) most abundant in the gill net.  Growth was slow when compared to statewide averages.  Back calculated growth was:  age 1-1.6\" (n=68), 2-2.4\" (n=68), 3-3.3 (n=68), 4-4.2\" (n=66), 5-5.2\" (n=41), 6-6.1\" (n=30), and 6.9-7.0\" (n=22).Largemouth bass were sampled at \"expected\" rates in both gill nets and trap nets.  Due to the small sample size of gill net and trap net captured bass (n=7), comparisons were made with caution.  Gill net and trap net indices of abundance were within their respective first-third quartile ranges.  Back calculated lengths were: age 1-3.0\" (n=7), 2-5.4\" (n=7), 3-8.0 (n=7), 4-9.6\" (n=5), 5-11.2\" (n=4), 6-12.5\" (n=3), 7-14.7\" (n=1).Black crappie gill net CPUE of 2.1 is larger than the third quartile break for this lake class (first-third quartile range = 0.3-1.8).  Age 2-8+ fish were sampled; however, crappie of age 6 and 7 were absent from the sample, indicating the possibility of variable recruitment.  Black crappie growth was normal.  Back calculated growth was; age 1-2.4\" (n=19), 3-6.6\" (n=15), 4-8.3\" (n=12), 5-9.6\" (n=7), 6-10.3\" (n=2), and 7-11.0\" (n=2).The walleye gill net CPUE value of 2.6 is 24% larger than the lake class median of 2.1 but is within the first-third quartile range of 0.9-4.8.  Gill net length frequencies show a bimodal distribution which indicates the possibility of two dominant year-classes.  Aging of gill net sampled walleye confirmed that age 3 (30%) and age 6 (37%) dominated the catch.  Back calculated lengths for walleye were:  age 1-4.1\" (n=30), 2-8.4\" (n=30), 3-11.6\" (n=28), 4-14.4\" (n=18), 5-17.0\" (n=15), 6-18.8\" (n=15), 7-22.0\" (n=4).  Of 30 walleye sampled 28 were from stocked years.</p>",

There have been increases since 1976 in the crappie and northern pike populations.  Panfish abundance was very high but has now dropped to more acceptable levels.  The walleye population has declined in recent years and reproduction is not adequate to maintain acceptable numbers.  Both walleye fry and fingerling stocking have been tried.  A comparison of walleye ages and stocking years indicates only fingerling stocking was successful.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shallow Lake is located southwest of Warba, Minnesota in the Mississippi River Watershed.  Shallow Lake has a total surface area of 531 acres, a littoral area of 268 acres (50 %), and a maximum depth of 85 feet.  The lake has one unnamed inlet and an outlet through a bog that leads to the Swan River.  The lake is characterized by a steep sided, deep basin on the western side and a shallow flat with emergent plants on the eastern side.  Residential development is relatively high around most of the lake. Previous surveys have identified a diverse aquatic plant community. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan was last revised in 2010.  The goals of the plan were to increase the Walleye gill net catch to 3.0 fish/net and maintain a quality Northern Pike population characterized by a catch of 3.0 fish/gill net and an RSD-P of at least 15. <br> \n <br> \nShallow Lake has been stocked with Walleye fingerling at a rate of 2 pounds per littoral acre every other year since 2004 in an attempt to improve the Walleye gill net catch rate.  This is a higher than typical stocking rate for lakes in the Grand Rapids Fisheries Area.  A population assessment was conducted on Shallow Lake in June of 2014 to determine the status of the fish community and evaluate the effectiveness of Walleye fingerling stocking.  The assessment consisted of 9 gill nets and 9 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nCisco (tullibee) were not sampled from Shallow Lake prior to the 1970s.  Since that time, Shallow Lake has produced moderate catches of Cisco.  Cisco were the most common fish captured in gill nets in 2014 and the catch was typical when compared to similar lakes and consistent with past sampling on Shallow Lake.  Captured Ciscoe were generally large, ranging from 14.6 to 17.3 inches with an average length of 16.2 inches.  Shallow Lake has been closed to sports netting for Cisco, but local residents indicate that ice angling for this species has increased in popularity.  Ciscoes are an important forage fish for large predators such as Northern Pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the second most common fish in the gill net sample.  Lakes with habitats similar to Shallow Lake typically produce low to moderate catches of Yellow Perch.  The 2014 catch rate was typical compared to similar lakes and near the long term mean for Shallow Lake.  Size structure was moderate, as Perch ranged from 5.5 to 9.8 inches with an average length of 7.2 inches.  Small size and relatively low abundance likely limit the popularity of the perch fishery.  Yellow Perch are an important forage species for Walleye and low abundance may limit the Walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nShallow Lake has a history of low to moderate gill net catches of Walleye.  It should be noted that lakes with similar habitats typically do not produce large Walleye catches.  The 2014 gill net catch rate was typical compared to similar lakes, but above the long-term average for Shallow Lake and was the second highest catch recorded for the lake.  Walleye were generally small, as lengths from the gill net ranged from 8.2 to 21.5 inches and averaged 13.8 inches.  It should be noted that some large Walleye are present; however, as Walleye up to 27 inches were captured in the trap nets.  Age and growth analysis identified four year classes, and all but one fish corresponded to a stocked year class.  Growth was slower than expected as walleye exceeded 14 inches by age 5.  It is likely that the higher then typical stocking rate has contributed to poor growth.  Despite poor growth, good angling opportunities should exist given the current size structure and abundance. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike sample from Shallow Lake has consistently resulted in a relatively low catch rate and quality size structure.  The 2014 catch rate was low compared to similar lakes, but typical for Shallow Lake.  Low Pike abundance is a desirable attribute of Shallow Lake.  Average size and growth are typically good when Northern Pike occur at low densities.  Size structure from Shallow Lake was good in 2014 as pike ranged from 18.9 to 39.8 inches and averaged 25.8 inches.  Age and growth analysis identified seven year classes with inconsistent recruitment.  Many pike populations are dominated by ages 2-5 with few older fish present.  In contrast, 35% of the pike from the 2014 Shallow Lake sample were age 6 or older, suggesting good survival of adult fish.  The oldest pike captured was a 30 inch male estimated to be 14 years old.  Growth was fast as fish exceeded 28 inches by age 6.  An abundance of small pike can be a nuisance to anglers while negatively impacting the fish community.  Releasing medium and large pike is the best way to maintain a quality pike population and avoid the problem of too many small pike.  Anglers are encouraged to help maintain the quality pike population of Shallow Lake by releasing pike exceeding 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie populations often exhibit irregular recruitment resulting in dominant year classes, shifting age and size structures, and inconsistent angler success.  Shallow Lake has a history of sporadically producing a quality Black Crappie fishery.  The gill net catch in 2014 was high compared to similar lakes and above the long term average for Shallow Lake.  Size structure was good as crappie ranged from 4.1 to 11.9 inches and averaged 9.1 inches.  Six year classes (ages 2-7) were present and recruitment appeared relatively consistent in the recent past.  Growth was fast, as crappie typically exceeded 10 inches by age 5.  The current age and size structure indicates good angling opportunities for this species. <br> \n <br> \nShallow Lake has typically produced large trap net catches of Bluegill characterized by poor size quality.  The 2014 catch contrasted this trend, as the catch rate was relatively low.  It is unknown if the dramatic reduction in catch rate represents and actual population decline or sampling conditions were poor due to weather.  A major cold front occurred mid-week during sampling and few fish were observed in near-shore areas.  Size structure remained poor, as Bluegill from the trap nets ranged from 3.1 to 7.9 inches and averaged 6.3 inches.  Poor size quality may limit the popularity of the Bluegill fishery.  Age and growth data was not collected but past sampling has consistently shown poor growth. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass have been commonly sampled from Shallow Lake.  Bass were sampled at a typical rate for the lake class.  Bass ranged from 5.9 to 15.5 inches and averaged 11.7 inches.  It should be noted that Largemouth Bass are difficult to sample in standard survey nets.  Spring electrofishing was not conducted in 2014, but sampling in 2009 indicated relatively high bass abundance with a population dominated by small fish. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included Burbot, Hybrid Sunfish, Rock Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nShallow Lake is not known to support invasive species.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
