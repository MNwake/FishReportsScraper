                "narrative": "<p>Mud Lake is located in western Minnesota, approximately four miles west of Wheaton.  It is a highly productive lake that measures 2,500 acres at normal summer pool level with a maximum depth of 7 feet.  Mud Lake is on the Minnesota-South Dakota border and is subject to border water fishing regulations.  Mud Lake has a high potential for winterkill and the fish community may reflect that at times.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks cooperatively manage the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nLittle angling is known to occur on Mud Lake during the summer due to difficult access and numerous submerged boulders.  Anglers are advised to carefully study a map of the lake before boating, and to drive slowly.  Most fishing occurs from shore just upstream from Mud Lake below the Reservation Dam at the outlet of Traverse Lake, or during the winter through the ice. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have been abundant in all five fish assessments (1994, 1999, 2005, 2010, and 2015).  In 2015 they were present from 5 different year classes and measured 13-32 inches.  Northern pike frequently experience good reproduction in Mud Lake.  The majority (58%) were from the 2013 year class and ranged from 20-25 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were moderately abundant in 2015 with most fish originating from the 2013 year class.  They measured 11-14 inches, but fish up to 28 inches were also present.  <br> \n      <br> \nOther game fish species present in moderate numbers included Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, White Bass, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Because of its shallow nature and abundant aquatic vegetation, Mud Lake was felt to be prone to winter oxygen depletion.  To utilize fish that might be lost to winter fish kills, an agreement was reached with South Dakota in the mid-1970's to open the lake to liberalized fishing annually.  A project to enhance waterfowl habitat in Mud Lake was initiated in 1987.  Since that time, the lake has been managed primarily for waterfowl.     It appears that oxygen levels may frequently decline in the main body of the lake to the point that partial winterkills might occur.  However, oxygen levels in other parts of the lake may be sufficient to provide refuges for fish and prevent total winterkills most years, and every year since 1991.     Northern pike were extremely abundant, with a sampling catch rate five times higher than the normal range for similar lakes.  Although individuals up to age 5+ and 29 inches were collected, almost 95% of the pike were age 1+, from a 1993 year class that ranged from 12 to 20 inches.  Those fish were mainly responsible for the extremely good pike fishing anglers experienced during the 1994-95 winter.  Most likely, the older fish, coupled with extremely favorable spawning conditions, little competition and good forage, produced the large 1993 year class and established the pike population.     Carp were quite abundant, particularly young of the year fish reproduced earlier in 1994.  Although populations of adult bullheads, yellow perch and black crappies were not noteworthy, a fairly high number of young of the year of those species were collected.  This may be an indication that their populations are expanding.  A wide assortment of other fish species were observed.     Plans for managing the fishery in Mud Lake will be reviewed with South Dakota in June, 1994, and may be revised.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mud Lake is a 4,600 acre lake located along the Minnesota/South Dakota border near the town of Wheaton and is part of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Traverse Lake flood control project.  In 1983, a Mud Lake Management Group (MLMG) was formed to coordinate management activities of the lake.  This group consisted of representatives from the St. Paul District of the USACE, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Department, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, lakeshore landowners, and local sportmen's groups.  Since 1987, management has been primarily for waterfowl.  Following recommendations made by the MLMG, Mud Lake underwent a drawdown project starting in 2001.  Heavy summer rains prevented the drawdown projected, originally scheduled for two years, to be completed until 2005.  Heavy rains in 2005 quickly refilled the basin and a netting assessment was conducted to evaluate the status of the Mud Lake fisheries.       Dissolved oxygen has frequently declined to the point of winterkill in Mud Lake.  As a result, the MNDNR and SDGFP open the lake to liberalized fishing from December 1 to the last day of February.  Under current liberalized regulations, anglers are allowed to take up to three times the daily limit with a variety of methods, which include using up to six lines per person.     Test nets sampled moderate to abundant northern pike, walleye and white bass in 2005.  However, the majority of these species were young-of-year and would not be large enough to interest anglers.  Given adequate winter dissolved oxygen, it will take one year for northern pike to obtain lengths of 20-22 inches, two years for walleye to reach 14-16 inches, and two years for white bass to reach 10-12 inches.  Northern pike appeared to be naturally reproduced within Mud Lake, but walleye and white bass migrated from Traverse Lake.  Walleye fry stocked into Traverse Lake in 2005 were chemically marked.  Examination of Mud Lake walleye found that 100 percent came from the Travese Lake stocking.  White bass capable of reproduction were not sampled in Mud Lake in 2005, so the high numbers of young-of-year bass were attributed to migration from Traverse Lake.     Channel catfish, white crappie and yellow perch were sampled in low abundance.  Catfish ranged from 17-23 inches.  Looking at catfish growth patterns, it appeared as though they likely migrated in from the Bois de Sioux River.  Although fish passage through the White Rock Dam is difficult at best, high water levels in July appeared to have allowed some movement.  White crappie and yellow perch abundance was low and would not draw much angler interest.     Adult common carp were sampled in low abundance.  However, young-of-year were extremely abundant and an expansion of the carp population is likely.  An expansion would be detrimental to water quality and habitat of Mud Lake.     Fisheries management activities for Mud Lake include annual winter dissolved oxygen monitoring, and a fisheries population assessment in 2010.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mud Lake is a shallow, nutrient rich lake located in Western Minnesota along the South Dakota border. Annual monitoring has indicated that oxygen may frequently decline to levels that could cause winterkill.  As a result, Minnesota DNR in cooperation with South Dakota's Department of Game, Fish and Parks have agreed since the 1970's to open Mud Lake annually to liberalized fishing from December 1 through the last day of February.  Under current liberalized regulations, anglers are allowed to take up to three times the daily limit with a variety of methods, which includes using up to six lines per person.     A partial winterkill did occur in the winter of 1999.  Investigations by DNR Fisheries personnel revealed several thousand dead carp, but very few dead game fish.         The northern pike population was moderately abundant in the 1999 population assessment, although it was considerbly less than what was recorded in the last assessment (1994).  Although fish up to age 4+ and 29 inches were collected, 42% of the gill net catch was age 2+ and ranged in size from 16-24 inches.  Test nets also indicated a strong 1999 year class that could, with good growing conditions and adequate winter oxygen levels, provide anglers with a quality fishing opportunity within the next few years.     The 1999 yellow perch population was moderately abundant and had increased considerably from 1994 levels.  The majority of perch were 6-7 inches, but a fair number of 8-9 inch fish were also present.     Walleye were present in low numbers in 1999.  An examination for oxytetracyline (a chemical used to identify stocked fish) marks revealed that some of the walleye stocked into Traverse Lake had migrated into Mud Lake.  Low forage abundance in Traverse possibly led to increased migration of walleye into Mud Lake.  The overall low catch rate of adult and young-of-year walleye in both gill and trap nets in the Mud Lake assessment indicate this migration was probably not substantial.     Black crappie were present in low to moderate numbers and ranged in size from 5-12 inches.  Moderate numbers of young-of-year black crappie were also present, but a past year class (1994) with similar abundance did not recruit into a sizable adult population.     Black bullhead and carp were quite abundant, particularly young-of-year fish.  Some bullhead up to 12 inches were present, but the majority of fish were less than 8 inches.     Fisheries management plans for Mud Lake include continued annual winter dissolved oxygen monitoring, continued liberalized winter fishing and a complete lake survey in 2004.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Mud Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately four miles west of Wheaton.  It is a highly productive lake that measures 2,500 acres at normal summer pool level with a maximum depth of 7 feet.  Mud Lake is on the Minnesota-South Dakota border and is subject to border water fishing regulations.  Mud Lake has a high potential for winterkill and is opened annually from December-February to restricted liberalized fishing.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks cooperatively manage the fishery. <br> \n     Little angling is known to occur on Mud Lake during the summer due to difficult access and numerous submerged boulders.  Anglers are advised to carefully study a map of the lake before boating, and to drive slowly.  Most fishing occurs from shore just upstream from Mud Lake below the Reservation Dam at the outlet of Traverse Lake, or during the winter through the ice. <br> \n     Northern pike have been abundant in all four fish assessments (1994, 1999, 2005, and 2010).  In 2010 they were present from 5 different year classes and most measured 13-30 inches, however a couple fish over 30 inches were also sampled.  Northern pike frequently experience good reproduction in Mud Lake. <br> \n     Walleye were abundant in 2010 with most fish measuring 9-12 inches, but fish up to 21 inches were also present.  The majority of walleye sampled were from a strong 2009 year class that was the result of natural reproduction. <br> \n     Other game fish species present in moderate numbers included black bullhead, black crappie, white bass, and yellow perch.</p>",
