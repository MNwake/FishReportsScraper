DUE TO THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE, LITTLE CAN BE SAID REGARDING WAE GROWTH, HOWEVER, THE TWO AGE 2 FISH COLLECTED ARE MOST LIKELY THE RESULT OF A 1988 FRY STOCKING EFFORT.  GROWTH OF THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS WAS WELL BELOW THE LOCAL AVERAGE.  ONLY THREE YELLOW PERCH WERE COLLECTED DURING THE SURVEY, YIELDING A CATCH WELL BELOW STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS.  THESE FISH MAY REPRESENT WHAT REMAINS OF A 1988 STOCKING OF ADULTS.  APPARENTLY, THIS STOCKING DID NOT YIELD ANY OFFSPRING AS NO YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR, AGE 1 OR AGE 2 YEP WERE COLLECTED.  THE BLB TRAP NET CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT OF 186.9 FISH/NET IS MORE THAN TWICE THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  HOWEVER, THE 1990 BLACK BULLHEAD CPUE DID REPRESENT A DROP FROM THAT OF 1985.  THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION BLB CAPTURED IN TRAP NETS IS BIMODAL WITH A GROUP OF FISH 4-6 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH, AND ANOTHER GROUP 8.5-11 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH.  NOP OR BLG WERE COLLECTED IN 1990.  ONLY ONE BLC WAS COLLECTED.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Independence Lake is a 97-acre largemouth bass, bluegill, and walleye fishery.  Independence Lake has had problems historically with oxygen levels in both the summer and winter because of nutrient run-off.  The topography of the lake is such that it is protected by trees and is less susceptible to wave action and the agricultural landscape practices within the watershed is such that considerable amounts of nutrients end up in the lake.  The problems with low oxygen have been reduced since a Helixor system was put in place in 1996.Independence Lake is one of only a few lakes in the area that is managed primarily for largemouth bass.  During the spring of 1999, largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 46.0 fish/hour.  During the summer survey, one largemouth bass was sampled with a gill net set.  The largemouth bass sampled by electrofishing had total lengths ranging between 11.0 and 13.3 inches, with an average of 12.4.  Unfortunately, the fact that no largemouth bass from the 1998 or 1999 year classes were captured electrofishing or shoreline seining indicates limited natural reproduction.  Fingerling largemouth bass were stocked in the fall of 1996, 1997, and 1999.  Fishing for largemouth bass should be decent and the sizes of largemouth bass caught will likely be respectable.  Harvest of larger predators, such as largemouth bass and walleye, have shown to have significant effects on the populations.  Efforts to limit nutrient runoff may increase native aquatic plant stands which would likely produce more consistent recruitment of largemouth bass.Largemouth bass and bluegill tend to do well in lakes that have up to 30% aquatic vegetation coverage.  The bluegill trap net catch rate was 78.00 fish/net set which was higher than normal for this type of lake.  The bluegill trap net catch rate in the 1999 survey was the highest on record for Independence Lake.  The second highest catch rate was recorded in 1985 when an average trap net catch rate was 2.10 fish/net set.  The bluegill total lengths sampled in trap nets ranged between 3.1 and 9.4 inches, with an average of 5.4.  A mode was observed in the 6.0 to 6.5 inches.  One seine haul produced 529 young of the year bluegill which indicated successful bluegill reproduction in 1999.  Bluegill reproduction was successful but aquatic vegetation for nursery habitat is crucial for survival.  Bluegill numbers indicate fishing should be respectable in the next few years.Fifteen walleyes were sampled with one gill net.  Total lengths of walleye sampled ranged between 16.3 and 18.3 inches, with an average of 17.3.  All of these fish were three years old and probably from the fall of 1996 walleye fingerling stocking.  The mean walleye trap net catch rate was 2.00 fish/net set which was about average for this type of lake.  The total lengths of walleye sampled in trap nets ranged between 16.9 and 18.0 inches, with an average of 17.7.  Both gears indicate a normal density of walleye compared to other area lakes.  The walleye fishery is recovering from a \"summerkill\" in 1996.  Fishing should begin to improve over the next couple of years.     The black bullhead trap net catch was 50.80 fish/net set which was above the 50% quartile (42.00 fish/net set) for this lake class.  Previous surveys conducted on Independence Lake had considerably higher catch rates than this years.  Black bullhead trap net catch was 214.00 fish/net set in 1985 and 186.88 fish/net set in 1990.  Based on these data, the black bullhead population had normal densities compared to other area lakes and the size structure consisted mostly of smaller individuals.  The long range goal of keeping the black bullhead population at less than 20 per trap net may better be obtained by maintaining a higher density largemouth bass population.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Independence Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nIndependence Lake is a 112-acre lake located seven miles southeast of the City of Windom in Jackson County.  The lake's shallow depth (maximum of 10 feet) and improved water clarity in recent years have encouraged the growth of dense aquatic vegetation (mainly curly-leaf pondweed, which is an exotic species and coontail) throughout the lake.  There was also some bulrush present in a couple of locations on the perimeter of the lake.  The vegetation growth has benefitted the fishery by providing habitat for several species of fish.  Independence Lake has historically been vulnerable to low oxygen levels during the winter, which have resulted in occasional winterkill of fish; however, this has not occurred in recent years.  Because of the threat of winterkill, the Jackson County Conservation League operates a Helixor aeration system in Independence Lake.  Independence Lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Bluegill and Walleye.  Largemouth Bass fingerlings were stocked in 2013; however, Largemouth Bass mostly maintain themselves through natural reproduction.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked two out of three years and have been stocked extensively in the last decade (2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014).  Independence Lake was surveyed the week of June 15, 2015 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLARGEMOUTH BASS <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were captured at a rate of 656.5 per hour, which is the highest recorded catch rate on Independence Lake.  Catch rates in previous years had been stable, ranging from 22.7 per hour in 2007 to around 47.0 per hour in 1999 and 2011.  Largemouth Bass were 3.6 to 19.0 inches and averaged 6.2 inches. Average length was small because 82 percent of the bass sampled were less than 5.4 inches; however, good numbers of fish from 15.0 to 19.0 inches were present.  Largemouth Bass were plump, indicating that plenty of food is available.  The wide range of lengths indicated that this is a balanced population that should provide good fishing in an area where bass fishing opportunities are scarce.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nGill net catch rates of Walleye in Independence Lake have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 2007 to 15.0 per gill net in 1999, and have averaged 5.9 per gill net since 1985.  In 2015, Walleye were captured at a rate of 8.0 per gill net, which was about the same as the 2011 catch rate of 7.7 per gill net, and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net.  Walleye were 12.1 to 24.3 inches long and averaged 16.3 inches.  Four year classes of Walleye were sampled including fish from 2013 (age-2), 2012 (age-3), 2011 (age-4), and 2008 (age-7), all of which correspond to stocking events.  Fingerlings were not stocked in 2012, but yearlings from Carey Lake (1.6 fish per pound) were stocked in the fall 2013, which accounts for the 2012 year class. The 2013 year class was the most abundant, accounting for 61 percent of the Walleye sampled.  Growth of Walleye was good as they reached 16.2 inches at age-3.  Walleye were plump, suggesting that they are readily feeding on the abundant Yellow Perch population.  Fingerling stocking appears to be providing a stable Walleye population with a decent number of fish, good size structure, and good growth.  Independence Lake should be a good walleye angling destination right now and in the future.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL and PUMPKINSEED <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates have steadily declined since 1999, going from 78.0 per trap net in 1999 to 13.0 per trap net in 2003 to 1.9 per trap net in 2007 to 0.4 per trap net in 2011 to 0.0 per trap net in 2015.  However, the decline in Bluegill numbers is likely related to the increase in Pumpkinseed (28.2 per trap net) and Yellow Perch (167.7 per gill net) numbers.  The three species often occupy similar habitats and eat similar foods thereby competing with each other for resources.   Oftentimes, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed hybridize, resulting in fewer \"pure strain\" Bluegill.  Pumpkinseed were first sampled in 2003 at a rate of 4.2 per trap net and since have declined to 3.7 per trap net in 2007 to 1.6 per trap net in 2011, and then drastically increased to 28.2 per trap net in 2015.  Pumpkinseed were 4.0 to 8.7 inches and averaged 5.1 inches.  Pumpkinseed less than 6.0 inches accounted for 99 percent of the sample, as only two over 6.0 inches were captured.  With an additional year or two of growth, the Pumpkinseed should reach a size that anglers can harvest.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nIn the last decade, Yellow Perch abundance has increased from 25.5 per gill net in 2007 to 67.7 per gill net in 2011 to a record high of 167.7 per gill net in 2015.  Yellow Perch were 6.5 to 8.7 inches and averaged 7.7 inches.  With an additional year or two of growth, Yellow Perch should be approaching a size that anglers are willing to harvest.  Yellow perch fishing should be phenomenal in the next couple of years at Independence Lake.  No doubt this would be a great destination for young anglers learning to fish as action for Yellow Perch, small Largemouth, and/or Pumpkinseed is likely to provide hours of entertainment outdoors.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead catch rates in gill nets (7.0 per gill net) and trap nets (3.6 per trap net) were the lowest recorded catch rates for Independence Lake since surveys began in 1985. Both catch rates were below their expected ranges of catch rates for similar lakes (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net; 11.5 to 132.6 per trap net).  Black Bullhead were 10.4 to 12.3 inches and averaged 11.2 inches.  The decline in Black Bullhead abundance may be attributed to stable predator populations of Largemouth Bass and Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nTwo Black Crappies, both 5.1 inches in length, were captured in the 2015 survey.  Black Crappie have historically occurred at very low abundances in Independence Lake.  Independence Lake is unique, in that Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo, and Channel Catfish have never been sampled there.  This is due in part to the fact that Lake Independence does not have a good connection downstream thus making fish immigration difficult if not impossible.  To avoid unintended introductions, anglers should be diligent about disposing of unused bait in the trash and should report unpermitted movement of fish. <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Independence Lake is a 112-acre lake located in Jackson County southeast of Windom.  The lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 feet and 1.5 miles of shoreline.  Fish management on Independence Lake was limited by the lack of a convenient public access and boat ramp until the early 1990's.  Since then, the lake has been managed for walleye and black crappie, with attempts to manage for largemouth bass and bluegill occurring since the 1993.  It is presently managed for largemouth bass while bluegill and walleye are managed secondarily.  A population assessment using night electrofishing for largemouth bass and trap netting, and gill netting for all other species was conducted in June of 2011.  In addition, a depth sounding was conducted and a contour map was created for Independence Lake that can be found on the Windom Fisheries Management webpage at http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/areas/fisheries/windom/index.html, click on the \"Latest Contour Maps\" link at the bottom of the page to access the map.  Currently, the MN DNR (Parks and Trials Division) is trying to renew the public access lease agreement with a private land owner.  There exists a possibility that the landowner wants the public access removed from the lake.  Continued management of Independence Lake for fish is contingent upon public access on the lake.  Without access, Independence Lake will no longer be stocked with fish. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are difficult to sample with trap nets and gill nets due to their behavior and ability to avoid nets.  In gill nets and trap nets, only 4 largemouth bass were caught, all in gill nets.  The gill net catch rate was 1.3 per net which is within the normal range for Independence Lake (0.2 to 1.5 per net) with an average weight of 2.3 pounds which is well above the normal range for Independence Lake (0.6 to 1.4 lbs.).  The 4 largemouth bass ranged in length from 12.3 to 18.0 inches with a mean of 14.8 inches.  To better understand the largemouth bass population, night electrofishing is used in population assessments to target largemouth bass.  Night electrofishing allows us to sample them effectively with the ability to take measurements (length and scale samples for age) and release the fish without harm.  During night electrofishing 36 largemouth bass were caught for a catch rate of 47.0 fish per hour.  A population estimate was conducted and the estimate revealed that the adult largemouth bass population exceeds 70 individuals (probably more than that due to the decreased effectiveness of fishing for largemouth bass with nets).  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6.2 to 19.5 inches with a mean of 13.3 inches. Five ages of largemouth bass were verified with largemouth bass reaching 8 inches by age 3 and 16 inches by age 6.  The overall size structure of largemouth bass was excellent and the current condition of the largemouth bass is great indicating a population that is foraging well and has some hefty fish.  Independence Lake is a great largemouth bass lake and should be high on your list for bass angling.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were in low abundance during the 2011 survey with 0.4 fish per trap net which is less than the normal range of 1.2 to 20.0 fish per net.  The pumpkinseed catch rate was 1.6 fish per trap net which is within the normal range of 0.3 to 4.9 fish per trap net.  In 2011, the hybrid sunfish catch rate was 9.3 fish per trap net and the size structure included fish ranging in length from 4.1 to 8.3 inches with a mean of 5.5 inches.  The catch shows a well established and robust hybrid sunfish population.  Sunfish (bluegill, pumpkinseed, orangespotted, green, etc.) are notorious for hybridizing with other sunfish species.  Overtime, the sunfish population in Independence Lake has become more and more hybridized resulting in a bluegill pumpkinseed hybrid.  Hybrid sunfish grow fast and will do well in Independence Lake.  Overall it appears that the sunfish population in Independence is experiencing increased hybridization, but abundance, size, condition, and reproduction of sunfish are at levels that will sustain a viable population with good angling success on the horizon.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are stocked in Independence Lake to provide an additional fishing opportunity and as a means to keep the black bullhead population in check via predation.  In 2011, 26 walleye were sampled with a gillnet catch rate of 7.7 fish per net and a trapnet catch rate of 0.3 fish per net.  The gillnet catch rate was within the normal range of 2.3 to 18.1 fish per net and the second highest catch rate observed since fish population assessments began in 1985.  The trap net catch rate was below the normal range of 0.5 to 3.0 fish per net, but trap nets ineffective in sampling walleye, especially in a lake that has steep shoreline drop-offs like Independence.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.7 to 24.8 inches with a mean of 17.9 inches and an average weight of 2.3 pounds (ages 1-4; fish stocked from 2007-2010).  For the small size of Independence Lake, the walleye had a tremendous size structure and good body condition.  Growth of walleye was also very good with fish reaching 17.0 inches by age 3.  The walleye population in Independence Lake appears to be doing very well.  A recent fingerling stocking in 2011 will add to the walleye population in Independence Lake and will help provide a great fishing opportunity over the next 2 to 3 years.     <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch in Independence Lake are on the rise.  In 2011, the gillnet catch rate was 67.7 fish per net which is the second highest on record and the highest since 1985 when it was 145 per net.  The current catch rate is 2.7 times the upper normal range of 2.7 to 25.0 fish per gillnet and more than the long-term average of 40.5 fish per gillnet.  The yellow perch range in length from 6.1 to 12.7 inches and have an average length of 8.3 inches and an average weight one quarter pound per fish.  The size structure of yellow perch is great but the average body condition is in the below average range indicating a population that has a balanced size structure but is showing some signs of stress.  With a high abundance of yellow perch, competition with other perch and with other species for food resources may be to blame for the low body condition.  It is possible the yellow perch abundance will decrease some over the next several years due the stress on the population.  With that said, the population of yellow perch is still at a very high abundance with a very good size structure that should create a good fishing opportunity for hungry yellow perch in Independence Lake.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled with gillnets, trapnets, and nearshore sampling (seining and electrofishing) were black bullhead, black crappie, and green sunfish.  The black bullhead population is appears to be decreasing in population, 464 fish per gill net were caught in 2003 and now only 18.3 per gill net were caught in 2011 showing a possible benefit of intensive walleye stocking on black bullhead abundance.  Black crappie have never been abundant in Independence Lake, it appears that they are remnants of past stockings or introductions to the lake from people dumping black crappie in hopes of establishing a population.  Green sunfish are widely distributed in southern Minnesota lakes and maintain themselves through natural reproduction, they are also very tolerant to disturbances and poor water quality so they are one of the first to re-colonize lakes that winterkill or summerkill frequently.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Independence Lake; we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms leading to decreased water clarity and they can degrade water quality over time.  Tell local landowners that you care about the water quality in Independence Lake and that they can help make it better.  Be responsible with your harvest of large fish, it takes 2 to 3 times as long to produce a trophy fish than it does to produce a trophy deer, release all fish you do not plan to harvest for personal consumption or trophy mounting.  Pictures and memories can last a lifetime, help pass those opportunities along to others by practicing catch-and-release fishing.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Independence is a 112-acre lake located in Jackson County southeast of Windom.  The lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 feet, 1.5 miles of shoreline, and is a class 43 lake.  It is presently managed primarily for largemouth bass while bluegill and walleye are managed secondarily.\n\nIndependence Lake has been opened to liberalized fishing ten times since 1950.  Pump and baffle and Aire-O2 type aeration systems were used intermittently since 1990, with a Helixor system eventually installed in 1996.  The small watershed is somewhat isolated and the lake is less open to the effects of wind and wave action than most lakes in SW Minnesota.\n\nManagement on Independence Lake was limited by the lack of a convenient public access and boat ramp until the early 1990's.  Since then, the lake has been managed for walleye and black crappie, with attempts to manage for largemouth bass and bluegill occurring since the 1993 reclamation.  Nutrient runoff from the watershed and accumulation in the bottom sediments led to low dissolved oxygen levels, extensive algae blooms and the development of summerkill conditions in 1996.  A manure spill occurred in 2006 when a bladder filled with manure broke and drained into the lake.\n\nFive species of vegetation were observed during a plant survey conducted during the summer of 2007.  Sago pondweed, clasping-leaf pondweed, hardstem bulrush, muskgrass, and river bulrush were observed with sago pondweed abundant and claspingleaf pondweed common.\n\nThe largemouth bass population is doing well in Independence Lake.  The largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 22.7 fish per hour in 2007 compared to 46.0 per hour in 1999.  Lengths of largemouth bass caught electrofishing ranged from 8.6 to 18.5 inches and averaged 15.0 inches.  Six age classes of largemouth bass were observed during the survey from age-2 to age-12.  \n\nThe bluegill population is down in Independence from the past two surveys.  The bluegill trap net catch rate was1.9 per net in 2007 compared to 13.0 in 2003 and 78.0 in 1999.  Lengths of bluegill caught in trap nets ranged from 6.0 to 9.3 inches and averaged 8.5 inches.  \n\nA pumpkinseed is very similar to a bluegill and is in the same family.  The main difference is that the pumpkinseed has an orange spot at the end of its gill cover.  The pumpkinseed population is doing very well in Independence Lake.  The pumpkinseed trap net catch rate was 3.7 per set 2007 compared to 4.2 in 2003 and 0 in 1999.  Lengths of pumpkinseed caught in trap nets ranged from 3.5 to 8.1 inches and averaged 6.1 inches.  \n\nNo walleye were sampled during the survey in 2007.  It is unknown at this time why the population is down.  The lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings two of three years.  Based on anecdotal information, heavy pressure was put on the walleye population in 2005 and 2006, which could have depleted the walleye population.  \n\nIndependence Lake has high numbers of yellow perch.  The yellow perch gill net catch rate was 25.5 per net in 2007 compared to 4.0 in 2003 and 0 in 1999.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in gill nets ranged from 5.3 to 9.3 inches and averaged 7.7 inches.  \n\nThe black bullhead trap net catch rate was 30.6 per net in 2007 compared to 242.1 in 2003 and 50.8 in 1999.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in trap nets ranged from 7.3 to 10.9 inches and averaged 8.0 inches.  \n\nOne 35.3 inch northern pike was sampled during the survey.\n\nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Independence Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity.\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Independence Lake is a 112-acre lake located seven miles southeast of the City of Windom in Jackson County.  The lake's shallow depth (maximum of 10 feet) and improved water clarity in recent years have encouraged the growth of dense aquatic vegetation (mainly Curly-leaf pondweed and coontail) throughout the lake basin.  Bulrush is also present in a couple of locations on the perimeter of the lake.  The vegetation growth has benefitted the fishery by providing habitat for fish.  Independence Lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Walleye and Sunfish.  Walleye fingerlings, yearlings and adults are stocked when available and have been stocked extensively in recent years (2016, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2023).  Independence Lake was surveyed the week of May 30, 2023 to monitor fish populations using one gill net and nine trap nets.  The Largemouth Bass population was not assessed in 2023.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has never been high in Independence Lake as catch rates have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 2007 to 15.0 per gill net in 1999.  The Walleye catch rate in 2023 was 3.0 per gill net, an increase from the 2019 catch rate of 0.5 per gill net and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Walleye lengths ranged from 16.6 to 20.1 inches and averaged 18.6 inches.  It is likely that there are more Walleye present than what the nets caught because dense vegetation often negatively affects gill net catches.   <br> \n <br> \nSince 2003, Bluegill have occurred in low abundance (less than 2.0 per trap net) in Independence Lake.  Abundance increased in 2023 to 28.2 per trap net, above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.0 per trap net) and above the long-term average of 13.8 per trap net.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.1 to 7.4 inches and averaged 5.8 inches.  Sixty-four percent of the sampled Bluegill were 6.0 inches or longer and 20 percent of the sample were 7.0 inches or longer.  With a growing season past, Bluegill should be approaching harvest size.  <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed Sunfish abundance has steadily increased from 1.6, 28.2, and 42.0 per trap net in 2011, 2015, and 2019, respectively.  The increase continued in 2023 with a catch rate of 87.7 per trap net, which is the highest catch rate recorded at Independence Lake.  Pumpkinseed lengths ranged from 3.4 to 8.9 inches and averaged 5.4 inches.  Forty-five percent of sampled Pumpkinseeds were 6.0 inches in length or greater.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance in 2023 was down significantly from 2019, going from 223.0 per gill net to 13.0 per gill net in 2023.  While abundance in 2023 is well below the long-term average of 71.9 per gill net, it is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 5.4 to 12.5 inches and averaged 9.4 inches.  Many of the yellow perch captured were large, with 76 percent of them exceeding 9.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have not been sampled in Independence Lake since 2003.  In the2023 survey, Northern Pike were captured at a rate of 5.0 per gill net which is the highest catch rate observed at Independence Lake and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 20.7 to 22.7 inches and averaged 21.6 inches (PSD=92).  Northern Pike are likely to do well in Independence Lake because of the abundant prey and abundant aquatic vegetation.  Independence Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike longer than 24 inches can be harvested.  Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nIndependence Lake is unique, in that, it does not have Common Carp or Bigmouth Buffalo.  Black Bullhead were scarce as only 11 were captured in the survey.  Other species sampled in low abundance included Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Independence Lake is a 112-acre lake located seven miles southeast of the City of Windom in Jackson County.  The lake's shallow depth (maximum of 10 feet) and improved water clarity in recent years have encouraged the growth of dense aquatic vegetation (mainly curly-leaf pondweed and coontail) throughout the lake basin.  Bulrush is also present in a couple of locations on the perimeter of the lake.  The vegetation growth has benefitted the fishery by providing habitat for fish to spawn in or utilize for nursery habitat to avoid predators.  Independence Lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Walleye and Sunfish.  Walleye yearlings and adults are stocked when available and have been stocked extensively in recent years (2016, 2017, and 2018).  Independence Lake was electrofished on May 16, 2019 to evaluate the Largemouth Bass population and surveyed the week of August 5, 2019 to monitor other fish populations using two gill nets and nine trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass catch rates have varied from 1.0 per hour in 1995 to 666.7 per hour in 2015.  In 2019, the catch rate was 102.7 per hour.  Lengths of Largemouth Bass ranged from 7.2 to 19.7 inches and averaged 10.7 inches.  The Largemouth Bass population is comprised of mainly two year classes, a year class that is 7.0 to 9.0 inches in length and a year class that is 16.0 to 19.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has never been high in Independence Lake as catch rates have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 2007 to 15.0 per gill net in 1999.  The Walleye catch rate in 2019 was 0.5 per gill net, the second lowest catch rate on record, and below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net).  Keep in mind, walleye often times don't sample well in years when you have abundant submerged aquatic vegetation.  It is likely the Walleye may have been under sampled when compared to the population's true abundance.  Yearling and adult Walleye will be stocked in Independence when available.  <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Bluegill were found in Independence Lake in the late 90's and early 2000's; however, since 2003, Pumpkinseed Sunfish have had higher abundance. Since 2003, Pumpkinseed catch rates have varied from 1.6 per trap net in 2011 to 42.0 per trap net in 2019, which is the highest Pumpkinseed catch rate observed on this lake.  The 2019 catch rate of 42.0 per trap net greatly exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes throughout Minnesota (0.3 to 4.9 per trap net).  Despite the high abundance, average length of Pumpkinseed was 7.3 inches, with lengths ranging from 3.4 to 8.4 inches.  The message here is that you are catching sunfish, the odds are high that you are catching Pumpkinseed sunfish but will still provide good meal.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate has steadily increased from 4.0 per gill net in 2003 to 167.7 per gill net in 2015.  The 2019 catch rate of 223.0 per gill net was the highest catch rate ever recorded in Independence Lake, and greatly exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net).  Total length of Yellow Perch ranged from 7.5 to 10.2 inches and averaged 9.0 inches.  Fifty-one percent of sampled Yellow Perch were 9.0 inches in length or greater.  Yellow Perch were age-4 and age-5, with age-5 Yellow Perch accounting for the majority of the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nHistorical catch rates of Black Crappie in Independence Lake were typically near zero dating back to the mid 80's.  In 2019, abundance of Black Crappie increased to 14.5 per gill net, which exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in Minnesota (1.4 to 13.8 per gill net).  Black Crappie abundance has been very low for decades and stocking has not occurred and it is likely that Black Crappie were illegally stocked by an angler.  The Black Crappie appear to be from one year class because the range of lengths was narrow at 10.0 to 11.3 inches, and averaged 10.5 inches.  A strong year class of Black Crappie was produced in 2019 as 300 young-of-the-year were sampled in a near-shore seine haul.  <br> \n <br> \nOther Species sampled included Black Bullhead.  Since the reclamation and due to the lack of connectivity downstream to other sources of fish, Common Carp have not been sampled in the basin. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Independence is a 112 acre lake located southeast of Windom in Jackson County.  The lake has a shoreline length of 1.5 miles and a maximum depth of 10 feet.  Independence is presently managed for largemouth bass primarily while bluegill and walleye are managed secondarily.  The lake has suffered from a summerkill and winterkills primarily because of the high amounts of nutrients in the lake.  A helixor aeration system was installed in 1996 to help prevent winterkills.Independence has an excellent largemouth bass population based on information from local anglers and electrofishing results in 1996.  Some bass were removed in 2002 and moved to another lake because of the high numbers of small fish.The bluegill population looks very good in Independence.  Lengths of bluegill caught in our nets ranged from 5.6 to 8.2 inches and averaged 7.3 inches.  Many of the fish were in the 6.5 to 8.0 inch range and should provide good angling opportunities over the next couple of years.Pumpkinseeds are another type of sunfish in Independence Lake.  They are usually distinguished by an orange spot on their gill flap.  Numbers were typical of what we would see in lakes like Independence.  Lengths of pumpkinseeds ranged from 6.4 to 8.2 inches and averaged 7.2 inches.The walleye population consisted of primarily age 6 fish which ranged in length from 20.4 to 24.5 inches and averaged 22.0 inches.  The numbers of walleye weren't high but we have stocked walleye fingerlings in 2000 and walleye yearlings in 2002.  We are hoping that these fish will be available to harvest over the next couple of years.The northern pike population is similar to other lakes like Independence.  Lengths of pike caught ranged from 24.0 to 29.0 inches and averaged 26.4 inches.Black bullhead numbers were higher than what we've seen in Independence in the past.  The high numbers may be attributed to a strong year class of black bullhead in the 5.0 to 6.0 inch range.  Large black bullhead are also available for harvest.  Lengths of black bullhead sampled ranged from 5.0 to 14.0 inches and averaged 8.3 inches.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Independence Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",
