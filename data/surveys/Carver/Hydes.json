                "narrative": "<p>Hydes Lake is a shallow, productive 215-acre lake located approximately 2 miles northeast of Norwood Young America in Carver County.  A state-owned public boat access is located on the northeast side; shore access, however, is limited.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake has a maximum depth of 18 ft and water clarity in July was 2.2 ft.  The mid-summer profile of the lake's temperatures and oxygen concentrations indicated mixing throughout the top 2/3 of depth.  During the winter of 2010-11, low oxygen levels caused a significant fish kill of most species.  Bluegill and Largemouth Bass were restocked the following spring.  A standard population assessment consisting of gill nets and trap nets was conducted in 2013 to characterize the game fish community in Hydes Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2013 assessment revealed a fish community that still exhibits impacts of the partial winterkill in 2010-11.  Compared to the previous assessment (2007), panfish species tended to be smaller and fewer in number, and bullhead species more abundant.  However, Northern Pike may not have been as affected as other fishes.  Pike abundance was high (17.3 per gill net) and well above the 75th percentile value  (7.3 per gill net) when compared to other similar lakes in the state.  Mean length and weight were 22.5 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Size structure was moderate, with 74% of the fish measuring between 20-25 inches.  The longest pike was 32.7 inches.  Twenty-seven percent were age 2 and were produced after the winterkill.  The other 73% (ages 3 through 5) were winterkill survivors.  Typical of post-winterkill lakes, growth rates were fast for Northern Pike.  Fish were 22.7 inches by age 3 and 26.7 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance in spring trap nets was moderately high at 10.2 per net.  However, the size structure was small.  Eighty-one percent were between 5.5-6.5 inches.  Mean length and weight were 6.0 inches and 0.1 pounds, with the largest fish sampled 9.5 inches.  The majority (95%) of Black Crappie were age 2.  This 2011 year class was the first produced after the winterkill.  Growth rates were fast compared to other similar in the West Metro Management Area.  Crappie were 6.2 inches by age 2.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were moderately abundant in the spring trap nets (35.7 per net).  Similar to Black Crappie, the size structure was small.  Mean length and weight were 5.5 inches and 0.1 pounds.  The longest measured 8.9 inches.  Sixty-three percent were between 5.5 and 6.5 inches.  The 2011 year class was dominant; these age-2 fish represented 64% of the Bluegill sampled.  Bluegill grew fast, reaching 6.5 inches by age 3.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were moderately abundant in Hydes Lake.  Catch rates (11.5 per gill net) were near the median (10.5 per gill net) compared to other similar lakes.  However, the size structure was small. Yellow Perch total length ranged from 5.3 to 7.4 inches, averaging 6.1 inches.  Similar to the Black Crappie and Bluegill populations, the dominant year class of Yellow Perch was produced in 2011.  Age-2 fish comprised 91% of the population.  Perch grew fast, reaching 8 inches by age 3.        <br> \n <br> \nBullhead were the most abundant group of fish caught during the assessment.  The more common of the two species was Black Bullhead (97.2 per spring trap net) but Yellow Bullhead were also numerous (33.0 per trap net).  Although bullhead numbers have fluctuated to a degree over the years, Hydes Lake has supported high densities throughout its sampling history.  Bullhead species tolerate lower dissolved oxygen levels than most gamefish, so it is common for these catfish relatives to thrive in winterkill-prone lakes.  Black Bullhead total length in gill nets ranged from 4.4-11.3 inches and averaged 7.3 inches.  Yellow Bullhead ranged from 5.4-11.7 inches and averaged 8.3 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nHydes Lake has a history of winterkill, but also a history of good fishing in spite of the occasional die-offs.  While this productive \"boom and bust\" lake type may not provide a consistent fishery every year, it has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to grow quality fish.  Fast growth rates and the abundant 2011 year class of several species may help return the fish populations to a desirable condition in the following years.   <br> \n</p>",

Sixty percent of all black crappie sampled were over 9.0 inches in length.  Northern pike are present with average abundance but were found to be below average in size for lakes of this type.  Mean length for northern pike was 21.0 inches while mean weight was 2.1 pounds.  Despite the small average size some larger individuals are present in the community.  Thirty eight percent of northern pike captured were over 24 inches in length with three individual fish greater than 30 inches (11.5%).  The largest northern pike captured measured 33.6 inches.Bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch are present in Hydes Lake but at very low abundance levels.  Sizes for these species tend to be about average for lakes of this type.Walleye have historically been stocked in Hydes Lake and were sampled in low numbers in both gill and trap nets during this survey.  Mean size for walleye were well above average with gill net caught fish weighing 5.5 pounds and measuring 25.6 inches in length.  Walleye caught in trap nets were slightly smaller but were still measured at a respectible average length of 21.5 inches and weight of 3.6 pounds.  The low abundance levels for these species may result in low fishing success for anglers who target these species. Common carp and black bullhead are present, but with only small average size in Hydes Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hydes Lake is a 215-acre class 24 lake located approximately 2 miles northeast of Young America.  A state owned public boat access is located on the northeast side of the lake, however shore access is limited.  Hydes Lake is primarily managed for northern pike and bluegill, but the lake also contains quality black crappie and yellow perch populations.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net sample was above average for abundance (7.3 per net) and mean weight (3.4 pounds).  Sampled northern pike ranged in size from 15.6 to 32.9 inches with a 23.8-inch average and 23 percent of the population was longer than 28 inches.  This is an increase in abundance and mean length from the 2001 survey when northern pike were sampled at 0.6 per gill net and averaged 21.0 inches.  Northern pike in Hydes Lake are approximately an inch longer at each age compared with pike populations from similar lakes. <br> \n  <br> \nThe bluegill population appears to be rebounding from a declining trend started in 1985 when catch per effort was 63.0 per trap net and fell to 54.2 in 1990, 39.5 in 1995, and 1.56 in 2001.  During this survey abundance was 42.5 per trap net and mean weight was 0.2 pounds.  Mean length was 6.2 inches and 40 percent of the population was longer than 7 inches, however, few bluegills exceeded 8 inches in length.  Bluegills in Hydes Lake grow faster than average for this lake type, taking only three growing seasons to reach 6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance is at an all time high for Hydes Lake at 67.7 fish per gill net.  Also, the mean weight of black crappie is 0.3 pounds.  Black crappie sampled ranged from 4.3 to 11.1 inches and averaged 7.3 inches long.  Fourty seven percent were longer than 8 inches and 8 percent were longer than 10 inches.  Growth is slightly above average for all increments according to back-calculated length analysis, and black crappies are reaching 8.4 inches after four growing seasons.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch is another species that relative abundance has reached an all time high at 26.8 per net.  Prior to this survey, the highest catch of yellow perch occurred in 2001 at 3 fish per gill net.  Yellow perch ranged in size from 5.8 to 10.4 and averaged 8 inches (18 percent of the fish were longer than 9 inches).  Yellow perch in Hydes Lake grow fast, taking only four years to reach 8 inches.  While in similar lakes, an average of 7 years is required to break the 8-inch mark. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 8 largemouth bass ranging in size from 6.8 to 16.7 inches with and 8.7-inch average, however the nets used during this survey do not target largemouth bass and may not give a true indication of abundance or size. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during this survey include common carp, black bullhead, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike are very abundant in Hydes Lake, but average very small in size (19.0\"). The largest individual sampled, however, was 33.0\" in length. Largemouth bass are also abundant with the average size fish captured being 10.4\" in length. Over 18 percent of the bass sampled were 16 inches or more in length. Walleye have been stocked in past years and are present in relatively low numbers but exhibit a nice average size. Bluegill were present in normal abundance, but some quality size individuals are present. Almost 1/4 of the bluegill captured were 8.0\" or more in length. The presence of the high northern pike population is likely controling bluegill abundance and quality. Yellow perch were present in relatively low numbers. Black crappie and carp are present in high numbers but a small average size. The black bullhead population appears to be down in abundance since 1990. Bigmouth buffalo were observed in the catch for the first time in recorded assessments.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hydes Lake is a 222-acre lake with a maximum depth of 18 feet, located northeast of Norwood Young America, in west central Carver County. Hydes Lake has been known to \"boom or bust\" in previous years, with the last partial winterkill occurring during the winter of 2010-2011. Hydes is actively managed for Largemouth Bass, but includes catchable populations of Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike. A Standard Survey (trap nets and gill nets) was conducted on Hydes Lake during the week of 7/24/17. During the survey, water clarity was 2.5 feet, with low oxygen below 10 feet. Eurasian Watermilfoil also remains present in Hydes Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 49.4 fish per hour; this value is the first from effort specifically targeting Largemouth Bass in Hydes Lake. Largemouth Bass averaged 11.0 inches-- with the largest measuring 19.1 inches-- while 17% of fish sampled were over 15 inches. Growth was slow compared to similar lakes across the state. Despite slow growth, the Largemouth Bass population in Hydes is healthy, with many year classes of fish. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled with trap nets at low numbers (11.9/net) compared to similar lakes. Bluegill averaged 6.3 inches, with the largest measured at 9.1 inches. Approximately 22% of sampled fish were greater than 7 inches. Despite low numbers, Hydes Lake has the potential to provide Bluegill angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets (9.0/net) and trap nets (4.7/net) -- near the expected catch rates of similar lakes. Black Crappie averaged 8.1 inches, with the largest measured at 11.8 inches. Growth was fast, with an average size of 8.7 inches by age 3. Approximately 27% of Black Crappie Sampled in Hydes Lake were greater than 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers in Hydes Lake were high, with 14.0/net. Average size of Northern Pike in gill nets was 21.8 inches, with the largest measured at 27 inches. The majority of Northern Pike sampled were small, with 71% less than 22 inches. However, high numbers of small pike provides a good opportunity to take advantage of the new Northern Pike regulation (which begins in 2018), where possession limit increases to 10, but with no more than two pike longer than 26 inches; all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in the 2017 survey included: Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",
