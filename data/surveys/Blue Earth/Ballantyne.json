THE PRESENT BLUEGILL POPULATION IS REPRESENTED BY I-VII AGE CLASSES COMPARED TO THE DOMINATE III AGE CLASS PRESENT IN '82 AND THE IV AND V AGE CLASSES PRESENT IN '84. BLACK CRAPPIES CONTINUE TO INCREASE SLOWLY AVERAGING 0.50/TRAPNET IN '82 TO 0.75/TRAPNET IN '84 AND NOW AVERAGE 7.67/TRAP- NET. BLACK CRAPPIES WERE REPRESENTED BY I AND III AGE CLASSES IN '82 AND '84 COMPARED TO I-IV AGE CLASSES SAMPLES IN '87. PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH REMAIN LOW IN ABUNDANCE WITH ONLY ONE SAMPLED IN '87 COMPARED TO NONE SAMPLED IN '84 AND EIGHT CAPTURED IN '82. NORTHERN PIKE WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE '82 SURVEY, AVERAGING 4.50/GILLNET COMPARED TO 1.67/GILLNET IN '87. NORTHERNS WERE NOT SAMPLED IN THE TRAPNETS IN '84. THE '82 SURVEY WAS WELL REPRESENTED BY LARGE FISH AND WERE BELIEVED TO BE FROM STOCKING AFTER THE '79 WINTERKILL. THE PRESENT NORTHERN POPULATION IS REPRESENTED BY SMALLER I-III AGE CLASS FISH COMPARED TO LARGER I-V AGE CLASS FISH IN '82. A FAIR WALLEYE POPULATION IS PRESENT WITH MOST OF THE LARGE WALLEYES CAUGHT IN TRAPNETS IN '82, '84, AND '87. THE PRESENT POPULATION AVERAGED 0.33/ GILLNET COMPARED TO 2.00/GILLNET IN '82. GILLNETS WERE NOT USED IN '84, BUT WALLEYES AVERAGED 2.75/ TRAPNET. LARGE VII AND VIII AGE CLASS FISH NOW DOMINATE THE POPULATION. IT APPEARS SOME NATURAL WALLEYE REPRODUCTION IS TAKING PLACE WITH FIVE II AGE CLASS FISH SAMPLED. WALLEYE STOCKING WAS DISCONTINED IN '81, AND DUCK LAKE WHICH CONNECTS TO BALLANTYNE HASN'T BEEN STOCKED WITH WALLEYES SINCE '81. THE WALLEYES SAMPLED IN '82 AND '84 WERE REPRESENTED BY '79 YEAR CLASS FISH. PERCH HAVE SHOWN A DECREASE FROM 8.82/GILLNET IN '82 TO 0.33/GILLNET IN '87, WHICH IS VERY LOW FOR AREA LAKES. THE LOW PERCH POPULATION MAY INDICATE A RELATIVELY HIGH PREDATOR POPULATION. GOOD INFORMATION ON THE ABUNDANCE OF LARGEMOUTH BASS IS LACKING, AND LARGE WALLEYES MAY BE MORE ABUNDANT THAN GILLNETS INDICATE. BLACK BULLHEAD CATCH RATES HAVE DECLINED FROM 69.0 GILLNET IN '82 TO 7.00/GILLNET IN '87. FRESHWATER DRUM WERE NOT SAMPLED IN '82 BUT NOW AVERAGE 5.00/GILLNET. OTHER FISH POPULATIONS HAVE CHANGED LITTLE SINCE THE '82 SURVEY AND ARE RELATIVELY LOW IN ABUNDANCE; THEY INCLUDE CARP, BOWFIN, AND BIG- MOUTH BUFFALO. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE NOT SAMPLED IN TRAPNETS OR GILLNETS, BUT INFORMATION GATHERED FROM A BASS TOURNMENT IN JUNE '85 INDICATES A FAIR LARGEMOUTH BASS FISHERY.</p>",

BLG Y-O-Y WERE SAMPLED IN MODERATE NUMBERS IN SHORELINE SEINING.  BLC INCREASED FROM 5.25/TRAP NET IN 1991 TO 17.83/TRAP NET.  AGES 1-6 WERE SAMPLED, WITH 2 AND 6 YEAR OLDS MOST ABUNDANT.  GROWTH APPEARS TO BE GOOD UNTIL AGE 3 AND THEN SLOWS.  SOME OF THE SLOW GROWTH MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE STOCKING OF SLOW GROWING FISH (1988 YEAR CLASS) IN 1990.  WHC ARE ABUNDANT, AVERAGING 134.66/GILL NET COMPARED TO 3.00/GILL NET IN 1991.  WHC ARE DOMINATED BY 1 AND 2 YEAR OLDS.  GROWTH APPEARS TO BE FAST WITH WHC AVERAGING 5.7 INCHES AT THEIR SECOND ANNULUS. THE NOP CATCH IMPROVED FROM 3.00/GILL NET IN 1991 TO 11.00/GILL NET.  FIVE AGE CLASSES WERE SAMPLED, WITH AGES 1 AND 2 MOST ABUNDANT.  IMPROVED PIKE NUMBERS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO HIGH WATER CONDITIONS AND THE 1991 FRY STOCKING IN GILFILLIN MARSH. WAE REMAIN LOW IN ABUNDANCE, WITH TWO OLD FISH SAMPLED COMPARED TO NONE CAPTURED IN 1991.  LMB WERE SAMPLED IN 1992 SUMMER ELECTROFISHING, AVERAGING 4.0/HR. WITH A PSD OF 0.

THIS POPULATION ASSESSMENT WAS DONE TO DETERMINE THE CONTRIBUTION AND GROWTH RATE OF THE STOCKED FISH.  THE STOCKED FISH SEEM TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED THROUGH REPRODUCTION, BUT THEY DID NOT APPEAR STRONGLY IN THE SAMPLE.  NET CATCHES OF BLG AND BLC EITHER DECLINED OR REMAINED CONSTANT SINCE THE 1989 SURVEY, SO PANFISH STOCKING DID NOT INCREASE PANFISH DENSITY.  BLG WERE SAMPLED IN RELATIVELY LOW NUMBERS, AVERAGING 5.50/TRAP NET, COMPARED TO 16.50/TRAP NET IN 1989. BLG WERE DOMINATED BY 1 YEAR OLDS IN 1988, AND ARE NOW REPRESENTED BY FISH AGES 1-3.  THE ADULTS STOCKED IN 1990 DID NOT APPEAR IN THE SAMPLE, BUT THEY MAY HAVE REPRODUCED BEFORE DISAPPEARING. GROWTH IS GOOD,  AVERAGING 5.8 INCHES AT AGE 3, COMPARED TO THE STATE AVERAGE OF 4.9 INCHES.  BLC AVERAGED 5.25/TRAP NET, COMPARED TO 6.50/TRAP NET IN 1989.  ONE YEAR OLDS DOMINATE, AND THERE WERE A FEW 4 YEAR OLDS.  THE STOCKED FISH SEEM TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO MAINTAINING, BUT NOT INCREASING, BLC DENSITY.  THEY MIGHT ALSO HAVE MADE AN INDIRECT CONTRIBUTION, THROUGH REPRODUCTION. THOUGH INDIVIDUAL YEARS OF GROWTH WERE NOT SEPARATED, THE SLOW GROWTH OF 4 YEAR OLD BLC IS PROBABLY A REFLECTION OF SLOW GROWTH PRIOR TO STOCKING.  WHC EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH AT AGE 2 AND WERE NOT STOCKED FISH.  WHC AVERAGE 10.75/TRAP NET COMPARED TO 6.75/TRAP NET SAMPLED IN 1989.  WHC ARE DOMINATED BY 1 YEAR OLDS, WITH SOME 2 YEAR OLDS SAMPLED.

The cohorts of bluegill, white crappie and black crappie that were documented in 1992 were not observed in this sample and appear to have been replaced by more-recent year classes of all three species.  None of these have recruited to the fishery yet, generating the expressions of concern on the part of the lake association.  Abundant northern pike numbers provided the best fishery in the past three years.  Crappie and bluegill numbers have fluctuated in recent years, indicative of the unstable fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nBallantyne Lake is a 350 acre lake located in Blue Earth County near the town of Madison Lake. A DNR-owned public access is located on the south shore at the end of 615th Lane. Ballantyne Lake has maximum depth of 58 feet, which can be found in one of the two relatively deep holes in the lake. Most of the lake is comprised of shallower water, with about 81% of the surface acres being littoral area. Ballantyne Lake is classified in Lake Class 38, based on limnological variables. Other area lakes in this same lake class include Horseshoe Lake (Le Sueur County), Bass Lake (Faribault County), and Hunt Lake (Rice County). Ballantyne Lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike and secondarily for bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass. Walleye fry have been stocked according to a base stocking plan of 302,000 fish every other year (rate of 1,000 fish/littoral acre). Walleye fingerlings are stocked based on surplus availability. Ballantyne Lake was surveyed the week of June 30, 2014 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey consisted of deploying six gill nets and nine trap nets intended to assess the fish population. Water quality parameters were also recorded. This survey was conducted in conjunction with an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey, which is a watershed assessment tool that is being developed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. The IBI survey consisted of two near shore sampling methods; beach seining and backpack electrofishing. A repeat IBI survey was conducted the week of September 9, 2014, using the two near shore sampling methods only. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye  <br> \nWalleye abundance was very low during the 2014 survey. Only one walleye was sampled in the gill nets (0.2 fish/net). With the exception of a few years (1974, 1982, and 2003), walleye catch rates in gill nets have been below 1.0 fish/net in every survey conducted on Ballantyne Lake. The single walleye sampled in the gill nets was large, measuring 23.9 inches. The otolith was aged and determined to be 13 years old, which is considerably old for a walleye in southern Minnesota. Trap nets yielded two walleye (0.2 fish/net), both of which were also large, measuring 23.8 and 21.7 inches. In the spring of 2014, walleye fry were stocked (N = 303,240) as part of the base stocking plan for Ballantyne Lake. In the fall of 2014, walleye fingerlings were stocked (N = 11,783) as part of the surplus stocking plan. Walleye fry are planned to be stocked again in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nThroughout the survey history on Ballantyne Lake, adult yellow perch abundance has been relatively low. The survey conducted in 2014 was no exception, with gill nets yielding 1.7 fish/net. Yellow perch ranged in length from 5.7 to 6.3 inches and averaged 6.1 inches. Although the adult yellow perch abundance is low in Ballantyne Lake, the IBI surveys conducted in June and September, 2014 produced high numbers of juvenile yellow perch. The beach seines used in the IBI surveys produced 4,105 young yellow perch in June and 1,110 young yellow perch in September. These fish were not measured or aged, but were likely all age-0 and age-1 fish. These young yellow perch play a vital role in the fish community, serving as important prey fish. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nAfter extremely high catch rates in 1974 and 1982 (94.8 and 176.0 fish/trap net, respectively), bluegill abundance in Ballantyne Lake has remained relatively stable since 1984. In 2014, trap nets yielded 13.9 fish/trap net. Bluegill lengths ranged from 4.1 to 7.9 inches and averaged 7.0 inches, indicating a relatively small size structure for bluegill. The near shore sampling conducted in September produced a total of 504 young bluegills, most of which were age-0.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nBlack crappie abundance in Ballantyne Lake has been relatively high in the past two surveys; 22.3 fish/gill net in 2009 and 17.8 fish/gill net in 2014. Black crappie collected in gill nets ranged in length from 4.1 to 10.5 inches and averaged 7.9 inches, indicating a relatively small size structure. Black crappie were also collected in trap nets at a rate of 2.8 fish/net. The abundance of black crappie from year to year is dependent on year class strength, thus explaining the variable catch rates throughout the survey history at Ballantyne Lake. Spawning success does not appear to be limited, considering the near shore sampling conducted in June and September yielded 42 and 39 young black crappie, respectively. White crappie are also present in Ballantyne Lake. The 2014 gill net catch rate was 3.8 fish/net, which averaged 6.5 inches in length. White crappie can be distinguished from black crappie by dark vertical stripes on the side (compared to black mottling on the sides of black crappie) and by carefully counting the dorsal spines on the back (white crappie have 7-8 spines, while black crappie have 5-6 spines). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has varied throughout the years in Ballantyne Lake as catch rates have varied from 0.0 fish/gill net in 1995 to 11.3 fish/gill net in 2000. The 2014 catch rate of 3.7 fish/gill net fell slightly below the long-term lake average (4.5 fish/gill net). The length of northern pike ranged from 18.7 to 30.7 inches and averaged 25.3 inches, indicating a moderate size structure for northern pike in Ballantyne Lake. Northern pike in Ballantyne Lake grow fast compared to those in most of northern Minnesota. However, growth was slightly slower than other area lakes, as the average length of northern pike was 20.9 inches at age-2, 22.5 inches at age-3, 27.9 inches at age-4, and 29.5 inches at age-5. No stocking plan is in place for northern pike in Ballantyne Lake, suggesting the population is sustained through natural recruitment.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \nThe sampling gears used in the 2014 surveys do not effectively capture adult largemouth bass, thus the population was not accurately assessed. However, six largemouth bass were collected in gill nets (1.0 fish/net) and one largemouth bass was collected in the trap nets (0.1 fish/net). Fish from both net types ranged from 14.8 to 19.9 inches and averaged 18.3 inches, indicating good size structure of largemouth bass. Additionally, the near shore sampling in June collected a total of 450 young largemouth bass, which suggests successful natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nAdditional species collected the gill and trap nets in low abundance included common carp, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, bowfin, freshwater drum, bigmouth buffalo, and smallmouth buffalo. Near shore sampling produced numerous additional fish species including bluntnose minnow, Iowa darter, brook stickleback, emerald shiner, spottail shiner, spotfin shiner, and pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n</p>",

Black crappie are also present but in low abundance, with most fish being between 5 - 6 inches, and an occasional fish exceeding 12 inches.  Walleye were not well represented in our sampling, but angling reports suggest a fishable population does exist.  A moderate abundance of northern pike is also present with most being between 21 - 29 inches, and there is a chance of a fish exceeding 40 inches.Other species sampled include black bullhead, dogfish, carp, drum, yellow bullhead and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the fish community was conducted on July 8, 2019 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling included trap netting and nearshore sampling (seining and backpack electrofishing).  Nine trap net locations were sampled along the shoreline in multiple habitats. Nearshore sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations. A 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations and a 15-foot seine was used at one station. The nearshore sampling captured 17 native fish species including two species (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter) intolerant of habitat disturbance and three species (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Fathead Minnow) that are tolerant of disturbance.  The most abundant species by biomass in the trap nets were Black Bullhead, Bluegill, and Common Carp.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this nearshore survey and trap net survey is combined with data from a standard gill netting survey to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Ballantyne Lake based on this survey is very near the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Minnesota River - Mankato Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

This 350-acre lake has two separate deep basins surrounded by shallower water less than 10 ft. deep.  A fishery survey was conducted on Ballantyne Lake in 2003 to assess the fish community and aquatic habitat.  Black bullhead was the most abundant species in both gill net and trap net catches.  Walleye catch increased to the highest level in 20 years, this coincides with the initiation of fry stocking in 2001.  All walleye except two fish > 22 inches were from the 2001 year class and were around 12 to 15 inches.  Northern pike are present in moderately high numbers and ranged in length from 17 to 26 inches.  Bluegill trap net catch has been consistent from 1995 through 2003.  Most bluegill were around 6 inches long, the largest were 8.5 inches.  Black crappie catch per trap net increased from 2000 to 2003.  Most black crappie were around 6 to 7 inches in length; a few fish up to 12 inches were present.  Yellow bullhead were generally large and had an average length of 12 inches.  Other species present included bigmouth buffalo, bowfin, common carp, freshwater drum, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, white crappie, and yellow perch.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ballantyne Lake in Blue Earth County is a 350 acre lake north of the town of Madison Lake. A DNR-owned public access is located on the south shore of the eastern bay off 615th lane. The lake is located within the Minnesota River major watershed. <br> \n <br> \nBallantyne Lake was surveyed the week of June 29th, 2009 to monitor the fish community. Bluegills were the most abundant fish in the assessment in both trap and gill net catches. Bluegills averaged 22 fish per gill net lift and 25 fish per trap net lift. Average (mean) size of bluegill was 5.2 inches for trap nets and 5.9 inches for gill nets. Size structure is poor; only one bluegill was caught that was larger than seven inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance exceeds the upper quartile for class 38 lakes; 22 fish per gill net lift was observed. Observed sizes were poor in gill netted fish; average (mean) length was 6.7 inches. The largest gill netted fish was 8.3 inches. Trapnets, while unreliable at times for measuring crappie abundance, did show there is some size structure variability in the lake. Average (mean) size was 9.0 inches for trap netted black crappie, but more than a quarter of fish caught exceeded ten inches, including one 14.6 inch fish. <br> \n <br> \nWhite crappies are not as abundant as black crappies in Ballantyne Lake, registering 3 fish per gill net lift and 2 fish per trap net lift. Average (mean) size of white crappie between all gears was 8.9 inches. The largest white crappie observed was 12 inches. White and black crappies are known to hybridize, and the F1 generation exhibits faster growth than their pure strain counterparts. A resident black and white crappie population can result in occasional hybrids that can quickly grow to large sizes, which may explain a few large crappies found in the nets in a population of otherwise small fish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are the dominant predator in Ballantyne Lake. Pike abundance was 7.3 fish per gill net lift, a value intermediate of the lake class median and upper quartile. Average (mean) weight was 4.4 pounds. Pike ranged from 19 to 37 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye maintain a low level presence in Ballantyne Lake.  Walleye abundance was less than one fish per gill net lift, a decline from the 2003 rate of 3.2 fish per net. Walleye fry are currently stocked every other year at a rate of 100,000 fry per littoral acre.  <br> \n <br> \nFour largemouth bass was captured in gill nets. Bass are not well sampled by passive gears (gill nets and trap nets) and electrofishing is not scheduled until the next full fisheries survey. Anglers report good bass fishing along submerged weed edges and near emergent vegetation. Ballantyne lake has some good stands of bulrush. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish seen in the survey include pumpkinseed, bigmouth buffalo, common carp, freshwater drum, yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), and black bullhead. Missing from the 2009 survey were yellow perch. Perch were measured at a low level abundance during the last survey in 2003.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Ballantyne Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ballantyne Lake is a 350-acre lake located in Blue Earth County near the town of Madison Lake. A DNR-owned public access is located on the south shore at the end of 615th Lane. Ballantyne Lake has a maximum depth of 58 feet, which can be found in one of the two relatively deep holes in the lake. Most of the lake is comprised of shallower water, with about 81% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. Ballantyne Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass.  <br> \nBallantyne Lake was surveyed the week of June 24, 2019 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This standard survey consisted of deploying six gill nets and nine trap nets intended to assess the fish population. Water quality parameters were also recorded. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). The next standard survey for Ballantyne Lake is scheduled for 2025. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled Bluegills at a rate of 119 fish/ net in 2019.  This was the highest rate for Ballantyne Lake in nearly forty years.  However in 2019 size structure was on the smaller side with lengths ranging from 4.1 to 7.8 inches and averaging 6.4 inches. Bluegills were aged to help estimate the rate of growth.  Bluegills ranged in age from 1 year to 13 years - 13 years is a very old Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie abundance of 15.2 fish/ gill net in Ballantyne Lake was high in 2019 compared to similar lakes as well as the long term lake average. Black Crappie collected in gill nets ranged in length from 5.4 to 8.9 inches and averaged 7.4 inches, indicating a small size structure. Black Crappie were also collected in trap nets at a rate of 1.4 fish/net. White Crappie are also present in Ballantyne Lake. The 2019 gill net catch rate was 1.2 fish/net, these fish averaged 8.3 inches in length. White Crappie can be distinguished from Black Crappie by dark vertical stripes on the side (compared to black mottling on the sides of Black Crappie) and by carefully counting the dorsal spines on the back (White Crappie have 7-8 spines, while Black Crappie have 5-6 spines). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has varied throughout the years in Ballantyne Lake. The 2019 catch rate of 4.7 fish/gill net fell slightly above the long-term lake average (4.5 fish/gill net). The length of Northern Pike ranged from 21.3 to 36.2 inches and averaged 27.1 inches, indicating a moderate size structure for Northern Pike in Ballantyne Lake. Northern Pike in Ballantyne Lake grow fast compared to those in most of Minnesota. The Ballantyne Lake Northern Pike population is sustained through natural recruitment.   <br> \nBallantyne Lake is located in the Northern Pike southern regulation zone. The regulation for this zone is two Northern Pike daily with a minimum or 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe sampling gears typically used in surveys do not effectively capture adult Largemouth Bass. In 2019 Largemouth Bass were sampled using electrofishing for the first time.  Largemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 100 fish per hour.  The fish sampled ranged in length from 5.4 inches to 20.3 inches.  Most fish were between 12 to 15 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was low during the 2019 survey. Only four Walleye were sampled in gill nets (0.7 fish/net). Walleyes sampled in gill nets averaged 17.8 inches and ranged from 14.4 to 21.5 inches. Two year classes were present, 2017 and the more abundant 2014 year class. Trap nets yielded one Walleye (0.1 fish/net), this fish was 10.6 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nAdult Yellow Perch abundance has been low throughout the survey history on Ballantyne Lake. The survey conducted in 2019 was no exception, with gill nets yielding 5.7 fish/net. This catch rate however was the third highest recorded on Ballantyne Lake.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.3 to 7.7 inches and averaged 6.4 inches. <br> \nAdditional species collected in gill nets and trap nets in low abundance included Common Carp, Black bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), and Freshwater Drum. Fish species not sampled in 2019 but sampled in the previous survey include Bigmouth Buffalo and Smallmouth Buffalo. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nBallantyne Lake has an infested waters designation as Eurasian Watermilfoil has become established. It is important for all who use this waterbody to remember Clean In and Clean Out. CLEAN all visible aquatic plants, zebra mussels, and other prohibited invasive species from watercraft, trailers, and water-related equipment before leaving and entering any water access or shoreland. DRAIN water-related equipment (boat, ballast tanks, portable bait containers, and motor) and drain bilge, livewell and baitwell by removing drain plugs before leaving a water access or shoreline property. Keep drain plugs out and water-draining devices open while transporting watercraft. DISPOSE of unwanted bait, including minnows, leeches, and worms, in the trash. It is illegal to release bait into a waterbody or release aquatic animals from one waterbody to another. If you want to keep your bait, you must refill the bait container with bottled or tap water. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n? <br> \n</p>",
