Fish from the 1996 and 1994 stockings were found, but growth rates were relatively slow.  White sucker and green sunfish were also found, but not in excessive numbers for a lake of this type.  Even-year-only stocking prior to 1997 had resulted in the best fishing opportunities occurring in a cyclic manner (fall of odd years and spring of even years).  A switch to annual stocking of this lake was recommended, to create a population which could provide two or more catchable-size year classes on a more regular basis.</p>",
