Development is heavy, with 337 homes/cabins present along 11.7 miles of shoreline in 1995.  Water clarity was 15.5 feet in late June, 2005.  Being located between Whitefish and Cross lakes, boat traffic is extremely high in summer.Northern pike abundance was in the \"average\" category compared to similar type lakes.  Size averaged 23.5 inches and 3.2 pounds in 2005.  Walleye abundance was in the \"low\" category and size averaged 23.1 inches and 4.1 pounds, similar to values found in 2000.  Largemouth bass abundance was in the \"average\" category.  Most bass sampled were age 2 or 3 and growth ranged from good to slow.  Black crappie abundance was in the \"high\" category in 2005 and has increased since 2000.  Nearly 80% of sampled crappies were at least 8.0 inches long.  Bluegills also had \"high\" abundance in 2005 and about 22% of the catch was at least 7.0 inches long.As for important forage species, yellow perch abundance was in the \"low\" category and perch were slow growing.  Tullibees and lake whitefish both had \"high\" abundance, for the fourth straight netting.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rush-Hen Lake is an 891 acre lake located near the city of Crosslake.  Rush-Hen reaches depths of 105 feet, with 56% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. Water clarity is good with a secchi depth reading of 15 feet on 8/25/2011.  Rush-Hen is part of the Whitefish Chain and is connected to Cross Lake and Whitefish Lake.  Recreational use is extremely heavy, especially on weekends.  It is highly developed with 347 homes/cabins and 4 resorts on its shoreline.  A 2010 plant survey by the DNR division of ecological and water resources found 39 species of aquatic plants in Rush-Hen.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Also vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing cover for fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch of 9.0/gillnet was above average, though average size was on the small size at 19.0 inches, and 1.7 lbs.  Northern pike over 24 inches made up 11% of the catch with the largest at 31.9 inches.  Growth was average compared to area lakes.  Of all northern pike captured, 46% were from the 2008 year class.   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch of 1.2/gillnet was below average, but the average size was nice at 20.4 inches and 3.2 lbs.  In all past surveys of Rush-Hen walleye numbers have been low.  Walleyes are not stocked directly into Rush-Hen, but are stocked into connecting Whitefish and Cross lakes annually as fry, and every other year as fingerlings.   Eight year classes were present, with 69% of walleyes coming from fingerling stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled throughout the Whitefish Chain, including Rush-Hen, by a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 112.5/ hr of run time.  The average size was 12.8\" and 1.3 lbs.  Fish up to 18.7\" were sampled during electrofishing.  Additional data can be found in the Whitefish Lake report. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnet catch of 35.3/net was above average.  Some nicer bluegills were present with bluegills up to 9 inches captured.  Bluegills over 7 inches accounted for 28% of the catch.  Yellow perch are an important prey species and were found in low numbers in 2011.  Tullibee (cisco) and lake whitefish were captured in high numbers for the fifth survey in a row. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Temperature-dissolved oxygen profiles were collected in the deepest basins on Rush Lake on August 14th, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Two profiles were collected due to the size and complexity of the lake (i.e., Water Quality Station 1 and 2).  Based on the average of the two profiles, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 16 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 83.3 feet in Water Quality Station 1 (WQ 1) and 51.6 feet in WQ 2, both of which were well below the thermocline at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L in WQ 1 (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 4.6?C (40.3?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 17.2?C for Lake Whitefish or 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for these species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for these species was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. Data collected in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2010, and 2022 also indicated suitable oxythermal habitat. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Lake Whitefish or Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

While numbers have never been high in Rush-Hen (0.5/gill net in 2018), the fish were large, with all of the fish measuring over 19\" and an average length of 24.1\".   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike had impressive size and numbers (8.3/gill net).  Average length was 22.6\", while 40% of the fish were 24\" or larger.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers for the Whitefish Chain, which includes Rush-Hen, were 68.8/hr run-time during night electrofishing.  Average length was 13.5\".  Five smallmouth bass were also netted while electrofishing the chain.  All but one were over 17\". <br> \n <br> \nBoth bluegill (42.6/trap net) and black crappie (9.0/trap net) numbers were high, but size was small.  Average bluegill length was 5.8\", with 30% of the fish measuring 7\"or larger.  Black crappie average length was 7.8\", with only 5% of the fish measuring 8\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLake whitefish and tullibee (cisco) are two cold water species found in this lake.  Both species were found in good numbers in Rush-Hen.  Tullibee were caught at the rate of 4.5/gill net, with an average size of 11.5\".  The whitefish catch rate was 1.3/gill net, with an average length of 19.6\". <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Rush-Hen Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting July 30, 2018. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with two sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample ten sites, a 15-foot seine was used at two sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 28 native species of fish including 11 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Northern Sunfish, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Rush-Hen Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and indicates an exceptional fish community is present in this lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. </p>",

Boat traffic is extremely heavy during most summer days.In 2000 the northern pike were found present in very high numbers, but comparable to past nettings.  Sizes ranged from 10.2 to 36.9 inches.  Growth rate was excellent.  Walleye numbers were found in low to moderate numbers.  Size was very large with an average length of 23.0 inches and the majority of fish 10 years or older.  Largemouth bass numbers were found present in high numbers with six age classes present and 14.1% seven inches or longer.  Black crappie were present in moderate numbers with fish observed up to 10.2 inches.</p>",
