                "narrative": "<p>North Sunrise Pool is an impoundment of the Sunrise River managed by the Section of Wildlife for waterfowl production.  Water levels are managed to promote aquatic vegetation suitable to to waterfowl.  To enhance plant growth carp abundance is controlled by winter draw downs.  Low disssolved oxygen levels in winter, while limiting carp abundance, has likely led to the fishery dominated by rough fish.  During the 1998 survey of North Sunrise Pool, 9 trapnet sets were made.  Based on numbers, pumpkinseeds and black bullheads dominated the catch.  Both species ran small with 70% of the pumpkinseeds between 4.5 and 6.0 inches.  By weight, common carp and bowfin (dogfish) were dominant.  Carp averaged 8.5 pounds per set and per fish while bowfin averaged 3.8 each and 1.3 pounds per set.  Compared to the quartile ranges for the lake class the trapnet catch was  normal for all species except bluegill, black crappie, and bowfin which were low.  Mean weights were low for bluegill, black crappie, black bullhead, and yellow bullhead.  Carp weights were high and the remaining species were normal.Three gillnet sets were made during the survey.  Yellow, black, and brown bullheads combined accounted for 66% of the catch by weight and 80% by number.  Twenty two yellow perch averaged 8.9 inches and 0.4 pounds.  The 5 northern pike sampled by gillnet ranged from 17 to 30 inches in length and averaged 2.5 pounds.  Compared to the lake class quartile ranges the gillnet catch was low for walleye and bowfin, high for brown and yellow bullhead, and normal for the remaining species.Angling pressure is light and mostly from shore.  Northern pike and panfish are the targeted species.  The Section of Wildlife scheduled a winter draw down for 1998.  The Section of Fisheries plans to stock the impoundment with walleye fry the following spring.  If abundant in the fall, fingerling walleye will be harvested for stocking in area lakes.  Along with fish migrating from the river and those unaffected by the draw down, the remaining walleye will be left to help reestablish the fishery.</p>",
