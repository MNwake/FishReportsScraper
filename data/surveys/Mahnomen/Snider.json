                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Snider Lake was conducted on August 7th and 8th, 2023, by Detroit Lakes Fisheries Staff.  The survey consisted of 14 sampling stations evenly spaced around the lake.  All stations were sampled with a backpack electrofishing unit, and 11 were sampled with a 50-foot seine.  Three stations were not sampled with a seine because of dense vegetation (wild rice), or the conditions were too boggy to safely and effectively use a seine.  Nearshore sampling captured 15 native fish species, which included five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Pugnose Shiner) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish).  The three most common species captured during the nearshore survey in order of abundance were: Bluegill, Green Sunfish, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data was combined with the standard survey data from July 24th, 2023, to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Snider Lake is located in the Wild Rice River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Snider Lake is a 632-acre lake located approximately 12 miles east of Waubun in southeast Mahnomen County.  Much of the lake's shoreline remains undeveloped.  Extensive stands of bulrush are present along these shorelines and they should be preserved.  Submerged vegetation is common throughout near shore areas.  A standard fisheries survey was completed in July 2023 to assess the fish populations in Snider Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find a high number of Northern Pike in Snider Lake, however, most of these pike will be on the small side.  The average size of the pike captured was 21 inches, but one 32-inch fish was measured.  Walleye numbers were slightly below average for the lake and remains at a low abundance.  Walleye size was not as good as other area lakes.  About 54% of the Walleye captured in 2023 were over 15 inches and 21% were over 20 inches.  Anglers can expect to find good numbers of small Bluegills, but fish over eight inches are present.  About six percent of the Bluegills sampled in 2023 were over eight inches and Bluegills up to nine inches were measured.  Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were captured in low numbers in the nets, which is often the case with this sampling gear.  Black Crappie up to 10.5 inches were measured and Largemouth Bass up to 17.5 inches were observed.  Tullibee (Cisco) is a fish one would typically expect to find in deeper, colder lakes, but Tullibee have maintained a presence in this lake since the initial survey in 1958. In 2023 the gill net catch rate was 0.5 per gill net, slightly lower than the historic average of 2.0 Tullibee per net.  Other fish species observed were Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Snider Lake might be described as a lake without any strikingly unique or unusual characteristics - just a good lake.  It has moderate size, moderate depth, moderate water quality, and moderate fishing success.  Much of the lake's shoreline remains undeveloped and this is an attractive feature for those who enjoy a natural setting.  Extensive stands of bulrush are present along these undeveloped shorelines and every effort should be made to preserve them.  They are a critical component of the lake ecosystem.The 1997 test netting results indicate a dramatic change has occurred in the fish community of Snider Lake, primarily in the yellow perch population.  From a historic low of 5.8 per gill net in 1992, yellow perch have exploded in abundance to 75.8 per gill net in 1997.  This is far above what would be expected for a lake of this ecological type.  The reason for the yellow perch increase is uncertain but the decline in northern pike, walleye, bluegill, and bullhead abundance may be responsible.The recent decline in northern pike and walleye abundance has brought these populations into the normal range for this ecological lake type.  Mean length of northern pike sampled in 1997 was 20.9 inches with a maximum of 28.5 inches.  Mean length of walleye sampled was 13.9 inches with a maximum of 27.8 inches.  Both the northern pike and walleye populations show good numbers of young, fast growing fish.  The good growth may be a result of the abundant yellow perch population.  In contrast, the decline in bluegill abundance has been more severe, growth rates were slow, and younger year classes were not well represented.  The abundant yellow perch may be impacting bluegill recruitment and growth.Snider Lake also contains populations of black crappie and largemouth bass.  Anglers have reported that Snider Lake has generally been a good bass fishing lake.  Mid-summer trap nets do not catch either bass or crappies very well but nine crappies and twelve largemouth bass were sampled.  The black crappies were all three years old and exhibiting fast growth.  It's possible that the nine fish sampled represent the \"tip of the iceberg\" for a large, fast growing year class of black crappie that could produce excellent angling down the road.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Snider Lake is a 632 acre, 29 foot deep, Mahnomen County Lake with moderate water quality.  Much of the lake's shoreline remains undeveloped.  Extensive stands of bulrush are present along these shorelines and they should be preserved.The 2002 northern pike gill net catch was 6.6 per net.  In 1997, it was 9.0 per net.  Five age classes of northern pike were sampled in 2002 but two and three year old fish comprised 82% of the sample.  Growth rates were above average.  No pike over 30 inches were sampled.  The mean length of northern pike sampled in 2002 was 19.6 inches, compared to 20.9 inches in 1997.Walleye were sampled at a rate of 5.5 per gill net in 2002 compared to 2.9 per net in 1997.  Five walleye per gill net is near the historical average for Snider Lake.  Even though walleye spawning habitat in Snider Lake is considered marginal, occasionally large year classes of walleye are produced naturally.  In 2002, 80% of the walleye sampled were from non-stocking years.  Walleye fry are stocked everay third year in Snider Lake.  Walleye ages ranged from one to eleven years old and they exhibited average growth rates.  About 1/4 of the adult walleyes sampled were longer than 20 inches.  The mean length of walleye sampled in 2002 was 17.3 inches.Bluegills increased from a historically low trap net catch in 1997 (13.1 per net) to 21.4 per net in 2002.  Bluegills larger than eight inches in length were rare.  Bluegill ages ranged from one to five years old and the growth rate was average.  The mean length was 5.1 inches and nearly 60% of the fish sampled were two years old.Snider Lake trap net catches of largemouth bass increased from 1.0 per net in 1997 to 1.4 per net in 2002.  There were also 23 bass sampled with gill nets in 2002, compared to zero in 1997.  The mean length of bass was 11.2 inches.  Only one fish was more than six years old and nearly 80% were between two and four years old.  They exhibited average growth rates.A decline in yellow perch gill net catches occurred between 1997 and 2002, from a historical high of 75.8 per net in 1997 to 2.4 per net in 2002.  The historical mean for yellow perch in Snider Lake is 30 per gill net but it has fluctuated widely.  Another low point occurred in 1992, when the gill net catch was 5.8 per net.Snider Lake has black crappies but they have never been sampled in great numbers with test nets.  A tullibee population is also present, a species one would typically expect to find in deeper, colder lakes.Anglers have reported that Snider Lake has generally been a good bass fishing lake.  Test nets in 2002 confirmed the presence of a number of bass in the one to two pound range and a 20 inch bass was also sampled.</p>",

Extensive stands of bulrush are present along these shorelines and they should be preserved. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016, Northern Pike were found to be at a historic high abundance and fairly small.  Pike had an average size of almost 20 inches with very few over 23 inches. <br> \n <br> \nUnlike Northern Pike, Walleye were at a historic low abundance in 2016.  This is despite Walleye fry stocking and some private Walleye fingerling stocking.  Only two Walleye per gill net were sampled, and they had an average size of 18 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was below average for Snider Lake, with a mean length of almost six inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie have never been sampled in high numbers in Snider Lake, and that remained true in 2016.  The few Black Crappie that were sampled had an average size of around 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMany anglers consider Snider Lake to be a good bass fishing lake.  Test nets in 2016 confirmed the presence of good numbers of Largemouth Bass in the one to two pound range. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in 2016 were Yellow Perch, Cisco, Pumpkinseed, bullheads, and White Sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Although gillnet catches of cisco (tullibee) have never been high in Snider Lake, this is the only one of five evaluations since 1958 in which none have been caught in test nets.  The pelagic nature of this species makes it somewhat difficult to determine if the perceived population decline is real.  The situation deserves scrutiny in future surveys.  If the decline is significant, recent increases in the northern pike population may offer a partial explanation-predation.Gillnet catches of northern pike are currently higher (14.6/GN) than at any time in the past and are also higher than the third quartile for class 31 lakes.  A large majority of pike sampled (80 percent) were age 2 or 3.  Northern pike stocking has not been done since 1961.  Obviously, natural reproduction is excellent.  Growth rates (in length) appear to be normal although average individual weight of sampled fish is only 1.1 lb.  Relative weights were not examined but pike appeared thin.  PSD's and RSD(30)'s have not changed significantly since 1958.  The current PSD and RSD reveal the absence of large northern pike in Snider Lake; PSD=6 and RSD(30)=1.Yellow bullheads are also relatively abundant (16/GN, 10/TN).  Black and brown bullhead numbers are low but stable.  No commercial hoopnetting of ictalurids has been recorded since 1969.  Commercial fishing is currently under the authority of the White Earth tribal Conservation Department.Bluegill abundance is within the \"normal range\" for similar lakes at 31/TN.  There have been two peaks in abundance (each about double the present trapnet catch) recorded in 1971 and 1987.  In contrast, the mid-June 1958 net catch showed fewer (15/TN), though larger bluegills.  However, it is important to note that recent surveys were conducted in late July when centrarchid vulnerability to trapnets has changed significantly from mid-June.  Individual bluegill growth rates are slow.  The 1987 and 1988 cohorts made up the bulk of the sample.  Length frequency comparisons show relatively stable PSD/RSD values during the past twenty years.  However, the early summer survey in 1958 revealed numerous 8-10 inch fish (RSD(8)=26 percent).  Bluegills over eight inches in total length have been extremely rare in subsequent surveys.  In fact, the present RSD(8) is zero while the PSD is 71 percent, indicating a large number of 6-7.9 inch fish and none over 8 inches.  Again, the lack of large bluegills in the sample may be due to recent survey timing, exploitation of a slow-growing population, or a combination of those factors.Largemouth bass and black crappie populations appear to be stable but not plentiful.  Neither species is well-represented in the net catches since neither is particularly vulnerable to survey gear in mid-summer.  Individual growth rates for both species seem to be average.As northern pike numbers have increased over the past 34 years, yellow perch abundance has decreased significantly.  Gillnet catches of perch (5.75/GN) are currently at the low end of the inter-quartile range for class 31 lakes.The walleye population has remained quite stable since 1958.  The average gillnet catch (5.6/GN) is just above the third quartile for similar lakes.  Growth rates appear to be good and the mean weight of sampled walleyes is 1.7 lb.  The PSD is 62 percent and the RSD(21) is 9 percent for gillnet-captured walleyes.  The majority of walleyes sampled were from the '87, '88, or '89 year-classes.  Interestingly, each of those cohorts was represented about equally in the catch.  Since (1) walleye fry were stocked in 1987, (2) walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1988, and (3) no walleyes were stocked in 1989, the value of walleye stocking in Snider Lake is questionable.  Recent surveys have shown no correlation between walleye stocking and year-class strength in this lake.  Future evaluation of less frequent stocking (i.e. every third year) would probably confirm adequate natural reproduction and eliminate the need for walleye stocking in Snider Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Snider Lake is a 632-acre, 29 foot deep, Mahnomen County Lake with moderate water quality.  Much of the lake's shoreline remains undeveloped.  Extensive stands of bulrush are present along these shorelines and they should be preserved.  Most of the fish species here reproduce naturally in sufficient quantities to sustain the fishery.  Although some walleye reproduction occurs, natural recruitment is believed to be too sporadic to maintain the fishery and walleye fry are stocked in alternate years by the DNR. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for northern pike, walleye, bluegill, largemouth bass, and black crappie were above or near historic lake averages in 2009.  Unfortunately, yellow perch catch rates remained at historic lows.  Given the relatively stable populations of the primary perch predators (pike, walleye, and bass), it is not clear why perch numbers have not rebounded during the past decade. <br> \n <br> \nMany anglers consider Snider Lake to be a good bass fishing lake.  Test nets in 2009 confirmed the presence of good numbers of bass in the one to two pound range and a 20-inch bass was also sampled.</p>",
