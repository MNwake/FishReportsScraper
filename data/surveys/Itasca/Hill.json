                "narrative": "<p>Hill Lake is a 38 acre bass-panfish lake located 14 miles north of Grand Rapids, MN.  The lake has moderately stained water (5.5 ft visibility) and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  Hill Lake lies entirely within the Suomi Hills Semi-Primitive Area of the Chippewa National Forest.  A carry-in access is located off a non-motorized trail along the south shore of the lake.  Hill Lake contains a relatively simple fish community of largemouth bass, bluegill and yellow perch.  In general, these species appear to be present in modest numbers but with good average size.Only four largemouth bass were sampled in this assessment, ranging in size from 10.6 to 18.9 inches.  Standard mid-summer test-netting does not effectively sample largemouth bass, so it is difficult to characterize the bass population from such a small sample.  Electrofishing has never been conducted on Hill Lake, and would likely be difficult given the poor access conditions.  Anecdotal reports suggest that the lake has provided good fishing for largemouth bass in the past.As in previous assessments, bluegill were captured in low numbers.  Catch rates for bluegill were 2.4/trap net and 0.7/gill net.  Size structure was very good; fish from the trap net sample averaged 8.5 inches.  The 1995 and 1996 year classes made up 64% of the sample, and no fish younger than age 6 were identified from scale samples.  Growth rates were above the lake class average for ages 5 through 10.Yellow perch numbers have fluctuated more dramatically in Hill Lake.  Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers in the 2003 assessment, at 2.3/gill net and 2.3/trap net.  The gill net catch rate was the lowest of any assessment thus far, and a sharp decrease from the 87.5/gill net in the 1978 assessment.  Yellow perch were captured at 9.3/gill net in the 1990 survey.  Reasons for the drop in perch numbers are unclear, but growth of perch may have benefited from the decline in perch abundance.  Growth rates exceeded 115% of the statewide average for all ages.  Size structure was excellent; yellow perch averaged 10.5 inches from the gill net sample and 11.3 inches from the trap net sample.  Approximately half the perch examined were infected with the parasite Clinostomum (yellow grub), while a smaller percentage had Neascus (black spot).Small, low-fertility lakes such as Hill Lake are often vulnerable to over-harvest.  Hill Lake's location within a non-motorized area appears to help limit fishing pressure and exploitation, but catch and release should be encouraged to maintain the nice average size of fish available.  Hill Lake provides anglers with a quality fishing experience for largemouth bass and panfish in a quiet, semi-remote setting.  The land immediately surrounding Hill Lake is owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service and is essentially protected from development. </p>",
