                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey (summer gill netting and trap netting) was conducted at Preston Lake in 2015 to evaluate the fish population.  Walleye were listed as a primary management species, while northern pike and black crappie were listed as secondary management species in the lake management plan.  Winterkill continued to be a limiting factor at this boom-and-bust lake, with the latest partial kill occurring in 2013.  Partial winterkills also occurred in 2001 and 2010.  Frequency of winterkill increased at Preston Lake from 1-in-5 years for the 2001 to 2015 time period to 1-in-3 years for the 2010 to 2015 time period.  Fish populations can fluctuate greatly at Preston, depending on frequency and severity of the winterkill.  The cormorant rookery on the north island remained active in 2015.  Curly-leaf pondweed, an invasive non-native plant, was present at Preston Lake and can be abundant, especially during May and June.  A fishing pier is available to anglers at the public access on the west shore.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (123) of walleye for a catch rate of 13.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake, and the highest catch rate ever measured at Preston.  The 2010 catch rate was 10.2/net.  Past catch rates, from 1974 to 2015, were variable ranging from 0.0/net to 13.7/net with an average of 5.5/net.  In 2015, gill netted walleye were 11.2 inches to 20.1 inches long with an average of 15.3 inches.  Approximately 93% of the gill net catch was 14 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Walleye were 1 to 4 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Age-2 and age-3 fish corresponded to years when fry were stocked in Preston, accounting for 93% and 5% of the gill net sample, respectfully.  The 2013 year-class was strong and likely resulted from the fry stocking that immediately followed the 2013 winterkill.  Growth was fast, as would be expected following a winterkill.  The presence of age-1 and age-4 fish indicated that natural reproduction (at least 2% of gill net sample) was also occurring.  Possible migration of walleye from Allie Lake, which doesn't winterkill as frequently, confounds natural reproduction and stocking evaluations.  The latest walleye fry stocking regime (654,960 fry two-out-of-three years) was initiated in 1994.  Gill net catch rates during this time period (2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015) ranged from 5.2/net to 13.7/net with an average of 9.4/net, possibly indicating a successful strategy.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of northern pike (28) for a catch rate of 3.1/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was 1.3/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were highly variable ranging from 0.7/net to 39.5/net with an average of 8.0/net.  Northern pike catch rates have been low for the last 20+ years.  In 2015, gill netted northern pike were 8.8 to 29.8 inches long with an average of 17.3 inches.  Northern pike were not aged in 2015, but the size distributions indicated that multiple year-classes were present.  Northern pike tend to do best in lakes with clear water and moderate amounts submergent vegetation.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (16) of yellow perch for a catch rate of 1.8/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was 5.9/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were variable, but generally low, ranging from 0.4/net to 31.5/net with an average of 5.9/net.  Gill netted yellow perch were 5.9 inches to 9.1 inches long with an average of 7.0 inches.  Yellow perch were 1 to 2 years old with 2 year-classes present.  Age-1 fish accounted for 94% of the gill net sample.  Growth was fast.  Adult yellow perch (77 pounds) were stocked in 2013, following the winterkill.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (1) of channel catfish for a catch rate of 0.1/net.  The 2010 catch rate was also 0.1/net.  Historic gill net catch rates from 1974 to 2015 showed that the highest catch rate ever was 0.3/net.  The 2015 channel catfish was 9.1 inches long and was likely the result of natural reproduction, which may have occurred in either Preston or Allie Lake.  Channel catfish were first gill netted in Preston Lake in 1994, but have never been stocked there, and connected Allie Lake was last stocked in 1989.  Winterkill is likely a major limiting factor on channel catfish at Preston Lake.  Channel catfish are more sensitive to low oxygen levels compared to many other fish species.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (1) of black crappie for a catch rate of 0.1/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake and the second lowest ever recorded at Preston.  The 2010 catch rate was also low at 0.4/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were variable, ranging from 0.0/net to 62.0/net with an average of 12.4/net.  In 2015, the black crappie was 6.5 inches long.  In 2015, trap nets sampled no black crappie.  The 2010 trap net catch rate was 0.8/net.   Historic trap net catch rates were variable ranging from 0.0/net to 29.8/net with an average of 7.4/net.     <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (43) of bluegill for a catch rate of 3.9/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was 0.2/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were mostly low ranging from 0.1/net to 42.6/net with an average of 6.7/net.  Bluegill were 3.2 to 5.1 inches long with an average of 4.4 inches, indicating a poor size structure.  Winterkill, and subsequent low oxygen levels, was likely a major limiting factor on bluegill at Preston Lake.  Bluegill tend to do better in lakes with clear water, adequate oxygen throughout the winter, and moderate amounts of submergent vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (2) of common carp for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was 11.4/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were variable, ranging from 0.0/net to 23.1/net with an average of 3.5/net.  Gill netted common carp were 25.8 inches and 29.7 inches long.  The trap net catch rate was 1.1/net which was within the normal range.  The 2010 trap net catch rate was 2.3/net.  Trap net catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were variable, ranging from 0.0/net to 13.1/net, with an average of 2.4/net.  An estimated 10,000 dead common carp were found following the 2013 winterkill at Preston Lake.     <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (5) of black bullhead for a catch rate of 0.5/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake and the lowest ever recorded at Preston.  The catch rate in 2010 was also low (0.8/net) as was the case in 2005 (2.7net).  Most of the previous catches (1974 to 2000) were above the normal range.  Historic catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were variable, ranging from 0.5/net to 198.1/net with an average of 69.5/net.  Trap netted black bullhead were 6.3 inches to 8.0 inches long with an average of 7.3 inches.  Gill nets sampled low numbers (234) of black bullhead for a catch rate of 26.0/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was 0.4/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were highly variable ranging from 0.4 to 382.5/net with an average of 123.0/net.  Gill netted black bullhead were 4.7 inches to 9.0 inches long with an average of 7.3 inches.  Both trap net and gill net data indicated that some type of ecological shift had happened to the black bullhead population in the last 10 years.  The average gill net catch rate for the 1974 to 2000 time period was 164.0/net compared to the 2005 to 2015 time period average of 13.7/net (12 times lower now).  Long-term reduced frequency and severity of winterkill, water clarity changes, increasing numbers of predatory walleye, predation by channel catfish and Double Crested Cormorants were possible explanations for the current status of the black bullhead population at Preston Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Preston, Renville County, is a 670 acre lake with a maximum depth of 11 feet.  During the July 31, 2000, population assessment 11 species (including hybrid sunfish) of fish were sampled.  The lake management plan lists walleye and black crappie as primary management species.  Northern pike and black bullhead are listed as secondary species.  A total of 99 walleye were sampled by gill net for a catch rate of 8.3 per net.  Walleye ranged in length from 13.5 to 22.4 inches and averaged 17.8 inches.  Average weight was 2.1 pounds.  The catch rate was within the expected ranged for lakes of this type.  Growth was fast.  Walleye were from II to VI years old with five year classes represented.  Walleye fry (1,000 per littoral acre) are stocked on a two-out-of-three year rotation.  A total of 509 black crappie were sampled by gill nets for a catch rate of 42.4 per net.  Black crappie ranged in length from 4.3 to 7.5 inches and averaged 5.9 inches.  All crappie were age I and growth was fast.A total of 42 northern pike were sampled by gill net for a catch rate of 3.5 per net.  Northern pike ranged in length from 7.9 to 32.6 inches and averaged 17.5 inches.  Average weight was 1.7 pounds.  Northern pike were young-of-the-year to III years old with four year classes represented.  Growth was fast.A total of 378 yellow perch were sampled by gill net for a catch rate of 31.5 per net.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 5.2 to 13.1 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  The catch rate was within the expected range and the highest ever recorded.  Growth was fast.  Yellow perch were I to V years old.A total of 511 bluegill were sampled by trap net for a catch rate of 42.6 per net.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3.0 to 8.2 inches and averaged 4.8 inches.  The catch rate was above the expected ranged for lakes of this type and the highest ever recorded.  Growth was fast.A total of 2,377 black bullhead were sampled for a catch rate of 198.1 per net.  Black bullhead ranged in length from 4.1 to 13.5 inches and averaged 8.5 inches.  The catch rate was above the expected range.Low oxygen levels and angler complaints of dead fish prompted Hutchinson Area Fisheris personnel to open Lake Preston to unlimited fishing in February 2001.  Lake Preston has a history of winterkill.  Spearers reported taking many nice walleye and northern pike.

Walleyes are also above average median rates, with 6 per gill net set.  Walleye have average growth rates and are represented by mostly year classes of 1, 3, and 7 year old fish.  Bluegills are present and catch rates are 63% of local values.  Bluegill show accelerated growth, age class I represented 88% of catch.  Black crappies consisted mainly of 3 year olds (75% of catch) with a median length of 8.2 inches.  Catch rates exceeded state medians by 92%.  Green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish were also present but relatively low in numbers.  Black bullheads, with lengths from 3 to 13 inches (average length 10\"), were also present.  Catch rates for black bullheads were slightly lower than local averages.  Carp, with a median length of 14 inches, were also present.  Carp catch rates were below local averages. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Preston Lake beginning on July 15, 2019, to monitor the lake's fish population and to evaluate the 1994 Walleye fry stocking regime.  Preston is a class 43 lake and net catches were compared to other similar lakes around the state.  The 2016 MNDNR Fisheries lake management plan (LMP) listed Walleye as the primary management species at Preston Lake.  Black Crappie and Northern Pike were listed as secondary management species.  In 2019, a total of 11 species, plus hybrid sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets (GN) and trap nets (TN).  The dissolved oxygen concentration was 3.4 mg/l, one foot off the bottom in 10.4 feet of water, indicating a well oxygenated (top to bottom) lake.  Water clarity was poor with a secchi disk reading of 2.3 feet, due to an algae bloom.  Only Walleye were aged for this survey.  Preston has a history of winterkill, and a partial kill occurred in 2013.  Fish populations can fluctuate widely from year to year at Preston, depending on the frequency and severity of winterkill.  A fishing pier was available at the public access on the lake's western shore.  Submergent vegetation density can vary greatly from year to year at Preston, with aquatic plants being very sparse some years and others years, like 2019, being abundant.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Walleye (114) for a catch rate of 14.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake, and the highest ever recorded at Preston.  The 2016 LMP's long-range goal for Walleye (2.3 to 18.1/net) was met.  The 2015 GN catch rate was very similar at 13.7/net.  The latest six GN catch rates (1994 to 2019) were all within the normal range for this lake type.  Historic GN catch rates from 1974 to 2019 (n=12), under various stocking regimes, were variable ranging from 0.0 to 14.3/net with an average of 6.3.  In 2019, gill netted Walleye were 9.3 to 25.9 inches long averaging 17.2 inches.  Trap nets sampled Walleye up to 26.9 inches in length.  Approximately 93% of the GN catch was 15 inches or longer, indicating a high quality population.  Gill netted Walleye were estimated to be age-1 to age-6 with six year classes present.  The 2015 and 2016 year classes were both considered to be strong.  The other four year classes were all considered to be weak in size.  Growth for age-3 and age-4 fish was considered fast, when compared to statewide averages.  In 2019, non-stocked years accounted for 2% of the GN aged Walleye, possibly indicating that significant natural reproduction may not be occurring at Preston.  The contribution from natural reproduction during fry stocked years remained unknown, due to the inability to differentiate the two groups.  Gill net catch rates, from 2000 to 2019 (n=5), during the 1994 stocking regime (655,000 Walleye fry 2 of 3 years) ranged from 5.2 to 14.3/net with an average of 10.3, possibly indicating a successful stocking strategy.  A partial winterkill occurred in 2013, and the oldest Walleye aged in 2019 was age-6 (2013 year class).  Walleye anglers should expect good action and nice sized fish from Preston's 2019 population. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (>5/GN and <10/GN) of Northern Pike (43) for a catch rate of 5.4/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2015 catch rate was similar at 3.1/net.  The 2016 LMP's long-range goal (>1.1/net) was met.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2019 (n=12) were variable, ranging from 0.7 to 39.5/net with an average of 7.8.  Historically, recruitment would be classified as low to moderate.  Northern Pike were last stocked (64,040 fry) in 2010, following a partial winterkill.   In 2019, gill netted Northern Pike were 9.1 to 32.1 inches long with an average of 21.8 inches.  Lower Northern Pike abundance over the last 30 years has likely helped Walleye to flourish at Preston Lake.  Preston was included in the 2018 Northern Pike Southern Management Zone regulation area, which had a 24 inch minimum size limit (all pike less than 24 inches in length must be immediately released) in place.  The regulation was designed to increase pike abundance and improve the size of harvested fish.  Preston was occasionally clear enough for dark house spearing.    <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (17) of Black Crappie in 2019 for a catch rate of 1.6/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2016 LMP's long range goal (maintain presence) was met.  The 2015 Black Crappie TN catch rate was 0.0/net, the lowest ever recorded.  Trap net catch rates from 1974 to 2019 (n=12) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 29.8/net with an average of 6.9.  The four most recent TN catch rates (2005 to 2019) have all indicated low abundance for this species.  In 2019, trap netted Black Crappie were 5.2 to 9.0 inches long with an average of 6.3 inches.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers (2) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2019 GN catch rate was tied for the third lowest on record at Preston Lake, and indicated low abundance.  The latest three GN catch rates (2010, 2015, and 2019) were all low (<0.5/GN).  Historic GN catch rates from 1974 to 2019 (n=12) were generally low, ranging from 0.0 to 62.0/net with an average of 11.4.  In 2019, the two gill netted Black Crappie were 6.3 and 11.6 inches long.  The decline in Black Crappie abundance, since 2000, was of concern and was likely related to competition, forage, and/or predation.  A shift seems to have possibly occurred, with Black Crappie decreasing and Walleye (a known predator on small crappie) increasing over the last 14 years at Preston.  A similar change occurred at Allie over the same time period.  Since Black Crappie have such high reproductive potential they were rarely limited by reproduction.  Spawning habitat was believed to be sufficient for Black Crappie at Preston, however habitat favorable for the survival of young crappie may be lacking.  Black Crappie were last stocked (854 adults) in 2010.  Crappie anglers may want to try a different lake. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers of Bluegill (333) for a catch rate of 30.3/net which was above the normal range for this type of lake and the second highest catch rate on record at Preston.  Bluegill were the most abundant fish sampled in 2019 TN's.  The 2005, 2010, and 2015 catch rates were much lower, ranging from 0.2 to 6.8/net.  Historic TN catch rates from 1974 to 2019 (n=12) were mostly low, ranging from 0.1 to 42.6/net, with an average of 8.7.  Bluegill were intolerant of low oxygen levels and typically do not do well in winterkill lakes.  If there is a long enough gap between winterkill events a decent population can develop, but a stable and long-term Bluegill fishery would be unlikely.  In 2019, trap netted Bluegill were 3.0 to 9.9 inches long with an average of 4.4 inches.  Approximately 8% of the TN catch was 6 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure dominated by small fish.  Fish should grow to a more acceptable size to anglers in the next year or two.  Recent increases in submergent vegetation habitat may also be benefitting the Bluegill population. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Yellow Perch (126) for a catch rate of 15.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake and was the second highest catch ever recorded at Preston.  The 2015 GN catch rate was 1.8/net.  Historic GN catch rates from 1974 to 2019 (n=12) were variable ranging from 0.4 to 31.5/net with an average of 6.7.  In 2019, gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.2 to 7.4 inches long with averaging 6.3 inches.  Yellow Perch were probably an important forage item for Walleye at Preston Lake.  Perch occasionally reach acceptable sizes for angling at Preston.     <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate to high numbers of Common Carp (89) for a catch rate of 8.1/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake and was the second highest on record at Preston.  Historic TN catch rates (n=12) from 1974 to 2019 were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 13.1/net with an average of 2.9.  Trap netted Common Carp were 2.8 to 30.9 inches long with an average length of 6.1 inches.  Small (<4.5 inches in length) carp accounted for 90% of the trap net catch, possibly indicating a strong 2018 year class.  Gill nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (5) for a catch rate of 0.6/net.  Historic GN catch rates were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 23.1/net with an average of 3.3.  In 2019, gill netted Common Carp were 4.2 to 29.9 inches long averaging 21.5 inches.  Multiple Walleye and Yellow Perch were regurgitating young of the year Common Carp while being processed in 2019.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low (140) numbers of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 17.5/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The latest four catch rates (2005 to 2019) were all below the lakes normal range, indicating low numbers over the last 14 years.  Historic GN catch rates from 1974 to 2019 (n=12) were highly variable, ranging from 0.4 to 382.5/net with an average of 116.9.  In 2019, trap nets sampled low numbers (102) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 9.3/net which was below the normal range for this lake type.  Historic TN catch rates (n=12) were highly variable ranging from 0.5 to 198.1/net with an average of 64.5.  Trap net catches (n=4), from 2005 to 2019, showed a similar pattern to GN catches during that time period, with all the TN catch rates being below the lake class normal range, indicating a low abundance.  Preston Lake data indicated that an ecological shift, favoring lower numbers of Black Bullhead, had occurred over the last 20 years, but the exact reason for the trend was unknown.  A similar occurrence took place at nearby Allie Lake.  Reduced winterkill frequency along with increased predator abundance could be responsible for the low bullhead numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional fishes sampled in the standard gear included; Bigmouth Buffalo, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Preston to monitor the lake's physical, chemical and biological charecteristics.  The lakes watershed was dominated by row crop agriculture and a thin undeveloped wooded fringe accounted for most of the shoreline.  Submergent vegetation was rare in 2005, but abundance can vary greatly from year-to-year.  Preston Lake has a history of winterkill, and the fish community can vary considerably depending on the frequency and severity of this phenomenon.  A partial winterkill occurred as recently as 2001.   Moderate numbers of walleye were gill netted, ranging from 4.4-20.7 inches in length and averaging 10.4 inches.  Walleye fry are stocked on a two-out-of-three year rotation at Preston.  Low numbers of northern pike were gill netted, but average size was nice at 28.1 inches.  Pike up to 33.7 inches were sampled.  Fair numbers of black crappie were gill netted, ranging from 4.7-8.4 inches in length.  Moderate numbers of bluegill were trap netted, but sizes were small.  Bluegill ranged from 4.8-7.6 inches in length and averaged 6.2 inches.  Only 4% of the bluegill were 7 inches or longer.  Spring night-time electrofishing was used to sample the largemouth bass population.  Only 8 bass were captured, ranging in size from 12.1-16.7 inches.  Carp were the most abundant fish sampled in gill or trap nets, averaging 17.0 inches.  Low numbers of black bullhead were gill netted and most were small.  Trap nets did sample some longer black bullhead, up to 12.7 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Preston Lake in 2010.  Winterkill continued to be a limiting factor at Preston, with a partial kill occurring in 2010 (see separate report).  A partial winterkill also occurred in 2001.  A partial summerkill occurred in 2003 and dead black crappie were documented.  Preston was opened to liberalized fishing during the 2009-2010 winter and spearers took small walleye, channel catfish, black crappie, and yellow perch.  Despite the partial kill and liberalized harvest many carp and moderate numbers of walleye appeared to have survived the low oxygen event.  Walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie were stocked in 2010.  Near-shore seining and backpack electrofishing were conducted for a statewide Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) initiative.  That analysis was done by Fisheries Research.  The cormorant rookery on the north island remained active in 2010.  Angling activity on the fishing pier was light during netting week.  Water clarity was poor, due to an intense algal bloom, with a secchi disk reading of 1.4 feet.  The lake was well mixed with the dissolved oxygen concentration being 7.5 mg/l just off the bottom and 8.9 just under the surface.  Submergent vegetation density was rated as none at 11 of the IBI sampling stations and rare at 1 station.\n\nGill nets sampled 122 walleye for a catch rate of 10.2/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake and the highest ever measured at Preston.  The 2005 catch rate was 5.2/net.  Past catch rates (n=10) from 1974 to 2010 were variable ranging from 0.0 to 10.2/net averaging 4.6.  Walleye were 9.5 to 17.6 inches long averaging 12.4.  Approximately 34% of the gill net sample was 14 inches or longer.  Walleye were 1 to 4 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Age 1, 3, and 4 fish corresponded to years when fry were stocked in Preston.  Age 2 fish corresponded to a fry stocked year in connected Allie Lake, but they may have also been naturally reproduced.  Natural reproduction has been documented in past assessments, but to what extent remains unclear.  The latest walleye fry stocking regime (1,000/littoral acre two-out-of-three years) was initiated in 1994.  Catch rates during this time period (2000, 2005, 2001) ranged from 5.2 to 10.2/net averaging 7.9.  In 2010, most (61%) of the gill netted walleye were from the 2009 year-class and had an average length of 10.8 inches at time of capture.  Growth was moderate.\n\nGill nets sampled 16 northern pike for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was similar at 1.4/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2010 (n=10) ranged from 0.7 to 39.5/net averaging 8.5.  Northern pike have not been sampled in high numbers since the 1987 assessment (8.4/net).  In 2010, northern pike were 12.8 to 23.1 inches long averaging 15.8.  A young-of-the-year (YOY) northern pike (11.1 inches) was also gill netted.  Trap nets sampled 1 northern pike that was 25.6 inches in length.  Northern pike were YOY to 3 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Approximately 73% of the gill netted northern pike were age 1.  Growth was moderate.  \n\nGill nets sampled 71 yellow perch for a catch rate of 5.9/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 0.4/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2010 (n=10) were variable, but generally low, ranging from 0.4 to 31.5/net averaging 6.3.  Yellow perch were 5.5 to 10.4 inches long averaging 7.5.  Approximately 27% of the gill net sample was 8 inches or longer.  \n\nGill nets sampled 1 channel catfish for a catch rate of 0.1/net.  The 2005 catch rate was 0.3/net.  Historic catch rates show that high numbers of channel catfish have never been sampled at Preston.  The channel catfish was 20.5 inches long and 6 years old.  Channel catfish were first gill netted in Preston Lake in 1994, but have never been stocked there.  A creek connection to Allie Lake, which was last stocked with channel catfish in 1989, explains their presence in Preston.  Shoreline seining, during the IBI assessment, sampled 4 YOY channel catfish.  This indicated that either natural reproduction was occurring in Preston Lake or YOY's were migrating down from Allie Lake.\n\nGill nets sampled 5 black crappie for a catch rate of 0.4/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 2.8/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2010 (n=10) were variable ranging from 0.0 to 62.0/net averaging 13.6.  Black crappie were 5.7 to 9.5 inches long averaging 8.1.  Trap nets sampled 9 black crappie for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was also below the normal range.  The 2005 catch rate was 1.3/net.  Historic trap net catch rates (n=10) were variable ranging from 0.0 to 29.8/net averaging 8.2.  During the last three assessments both gill net catches and trap net catches indicate a decreasing trend in abundance for black crappie at Preston.  Black crappie were 1 to 3 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate.  \n\nTrap nets sampled 2 bluegill for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was tied for the second lowest on record at Preston.  The 2005 catch rate was 6.8.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2010 (n=10) were variable ranging from 0.1 to 42.6/net averaging 7.  The last three assessments (2000 to 2010) showed a decreasing trend in abundance.  Both of the bluegill sampled were 8.4 inches long.  The two bluegill were 8 and 9 years old.  Growth was slow.  Winterkill and the absence of submergent vegetation are limiting factors for bluegill at Preston Lake.  \n\nCarp were the most abundant fish sampled in both gill and trap nets.  Gill nets sampled 137 carp for a catch rate of 11.4/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was second only to the record 2005 catch rate (23.1/net).  Gill netted carp were 4.2 to 27.2 inches long averaging 14.3 inches.  The trap net catch rate was 2.3/net which was also within the normal range for this lake type.  High numbers (1,862) of YOY carp were captured during the first IBI shoreline seining assessment in late July.    \n\nTrap nets sampled 9 black bullhead for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The catch rate in 2005 was also low (2.7/net), while most previous catches were high (>42.0/net).  The average catch rate from 1974 to 2010 was 76.5/net.  Trap netted black bullhead were 6.9 to 12.4 inches long averaging 9.0 inches.  The gill net catch rate was 0.4/net and was below the normal range.  The 2005 catch rate was also low at 14.8/net.  Catch rate from 1974 to 2010 were highly variable ranging from 0.4 to 382.5/net averaging 132.7.  The 2010 gill net and trap net catch rates were both the lowest ever measured at Preston.  Gill net catches from 1992 to 2010 (n=5) showed a decreasing trend in abundance.  \n\nThe second IBI assessment sampled 3,258 fathead minnow in early September.  Fathead minnow may be an important forage fish for predators at Preston Lake.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Preston Lake has a moderate size (670 acres), shallow basin (maximum depth 11 feet) with very little aquatic vegetation.    A fisheries survey conducted on Preston Lake in 1994 included assessment of fish populations with standard lake survey gillnets, trapnets, shoreline seining and night electrofishing in the fall.  Fish species of particular interest captured during the survey included black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, channelcatfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch.  Non-game species sampled included blacknose dace andgolden shiner.Black bullhead were abundant with a gillnet catch more than three times greater than the lake class average.  Average length of black bullhead captured in gillnets was 9.4 inches.  Black bullhead size structure should be acceptable to anglers.Black crappie net catches were below average for this lake class.  Several age classes of black crappie were present and age three fish accounted for most of the sample.  Average length of age three black crappie was 8.5 inches.  Anglers were reported to be having good success for black crappie shortly after ice-out this year.    The bluegill trapnet catch was below the normal range for this lake class.  Although bluegill numbers were low, fish from four age classes were present in the sample.  Average length of age three bluegill was 7.7 inches.  A lack of submersed vegetation in Preston Lake, and the resulting lack of cover and food production, may limit bluegill and crappie populations. Three channel catfish were captured in the survey.  No channel catfish have been stocked in Preston Lake.  However, they were stocked in adjoining Lake Allie in 1989.  Based on age determination, the larger channel catfish may have been a fish that was stocked.  However, age of the two smaller individuals indicates that they may be the result of natural reproduction.No largemouth bass were taken in nets during the survey, but four largemouth bass were collected during nighttime, fall  electrofishing.  Three of these were determined to be young-of-year (YOY) fish.  A lack of submersed vegetation in LakePreston probably limits largemouth bass populations.Northern pike numbers were below the lake class average, but within the normal range for this lake class.  Northern pikethrough age five were represented in the sample, but most were age one and two fish.  Similar to what has been seen on other Area lakes, this is likely due to an increase in spawning habitat as water levels have risen.  Growth was good with an average length of 17 inches for age two northern pike. The walleye gillnet catch was near the lake class average.  Walleye captured in gillnets ranged in length from 9 to 19inches with an average length of 12 inches.  Walleye through age nine were sampled, but the catch was dominated by age one and three walleye.  Though age three walleye correspond to a year when walleye fingerlings were stocked, it is uncertain to what extent they contributed.  Natural reproduction could account for all or none of age three walleye sampled.  However, the strong year class of age one fish are probably the result of natural reproduction.  Good numbers of age three walleye may provide good angling opportunities in the next several years.The yellow perch gillnet catch was below normal for this lake class.  Only seven yellow perch were sampled and fish fromage two through six were present in the sample.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nNet catches of gamefish were compared to other lake class 43 lakes around the state to assess relative abundance.  Only four gamefish species, northern pike, black crappie, yellow perch and walleye, were sampled in significant numbers during this population assessment.  Bluegill and white crappie were also captured, but were represented by only one individual of each species.  Natural reproduction of gamefish appeared to be extremely poor in 1992.  The only gamefish young of the year sampled in shoreline seining were one bluegill and one largemouth bass.  The catch rate for northern pike (1.0/gillnet) and walleye (0.75/gillnet) were well below the lake class medians of 3.67 and 4.0, respectively.  The catch rates of these two species were below the normal range for this lake class.  Black crappies were the most abundant gamefish species sampled.  Trapnet catches of black crappie averaged 9.9 fish/net, which is higher than the lake class median of 7.0 fish/net.  Yellow perch were captured at rate of 2.75/net, which is below the normal range for this lake type.  Northern pike from ages 1 thru 4 were represented in the sample, with most fish being 3 or 4 years old.  Black crappies from 1 to 3 years old were sampled; with age 2 fish making up 78% of the total number.  Age 2 black crappies ranged in length from 6.8 to 7.2 inches.  Walleye age distribution included at least one individual in each age class from age 2 to age 8.  Fry stocking in Preston was conducted in 1991, 1988 and 1986.  Fish present in other age classes could be the result of walleye emigrating from Lake Allie or possibly from natural reproduction.  The low catch rate of yearling walleye may indicate poor survival of fry stocked in 1991.  It is also possible that yearling walleye had not reached a large enough size to be effectively captured with gill nets.</p>",
