                "narrative": "<p>Blue Lake is one of a very few lakes in southern Isanti County that provides quality fishing for a variety of game fish species.  Walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, crappie, and bluegill are the main species caught by anglers.       The walleye population has consistently been near the average for this lake type since regular stocking began.  Stocking fingerlings two out of every three years has produced a wide range of sizes, as well as a good average size (15 inches, 2.2 pounds).  With some walleyes over 25 inches in the lake, anglers have a chance at an occasional trophy walleye.     Northern pike are not as common as walleye in this lake, but the northerns that are present are large and fast-growing.  The average length seen during the last test netting was 25 inches, and the average weight was 4.4 pounds.     Largemouth bass are moderately abundant but sizes tend to be small; the average length in a recent electrofishing assessment was 10.5 inches.  The extreme southern end of the lake and the shallow northern basin are most likely the best areas for bass; the east and west shores of the main basin are steeply sloping and have less weedy cover.     Bluegill numbers are average for this type of lake, with nearly all being seven inches or less.  Crappies were more abundant than usual in 1994.  The mean length for crappie was 6.1 inches, but several ten inch crappies were seen.  Panfish anglers may also catch a few harvestable-sized perch.     Other species present in Blue Lake include white sucker, golden shiner, bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, and carp.  Bullhead numbers are low for this lake type.  Carp are known to be present, but none have been netted in the last two lake surveys so the population is probably not a big problem in this lake.Prepared by Deborah Sewell, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blue Lake is a fertile 309-acre lake located in southwestern Isanti County.  Two township owned public accesses are located on the lake; one along the southeast shore of the south basin and one along the northwest shore of the south basin.  The lake is characterized by a shallow north basin that is connected by a navigable channel to a deeper southern basin.  A long, narrow shape is characteristic of the entire basin.  Because Blue Lake is one of a few lakes in Isanti County that is larger in size, the lake is utilized during the summer months by many water sports enthusiasts other than anglers.  Boat navigation during May and June is affected by curled pondweed, which dominates the shallow water areas.  Boat mobility becomes easier after mid-summer when this plant naturally decreases in density.  Curled pondweed is not native to Minnesota and has been introduced accidently into many lakes throughout the state.  Water resource users should remove all plants from their boats and trailers before leaving the lake to prevent the further spread of this species.  The majority of the shoreline is surrounded by residential homes and land use within the immediate watershed consists of, in order of abundance, agricultural cropland, undeveloped forest or woodland, newly constructed homes on small lots, marshland, and livestock pasture.  The fishery in Blue Lake is managed primarily for walleye and largemouth bass with northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill sunfish as the secondary management species  Currently, the DNR Fisheries management plan calls for walleye fingerling stocking on an alternate year basis.During the open water season of 1999, a fish population assessment was conducted to evaluate the current status of the fish community in Blue Lake.  Sampling gear consisted of spring and fall night electrofishing, six gill nets, nine trap nets, and three shoreline seine hauls.  Walleye abundance and the average weight, at 1.4 pounds, were typical of lakes of this type.  The walleye population has consistently been near average since regular stocking began in the mid-seventies.  Measured walleye ranged from 8.7 to 23.8 inches with an average length of 15.5 inches.  A total of six year classes were represented with 50% of the sample made up of the 1997 year class.  Because a few fish were represented during non-stocked years and previous surveys recorded suitable spawning habitat along the east shore of the south basin, some limited natural reproduction may have occurred.  However, stocking has been the major contributor to walleye year class strength.  Walleye growth was found to be typical of normal.  Spring night electrofishing found good numbers of largemouth bass, but the average size was small, 0.7 pounds.  Bass lengths extended from 6.2 to 17.1 inches with an average length of 10.2 inches.  Largemouth growth was found to be slow at ages 1-3, and representative of normal thereafter.  Northern pike numbers were at a normal level while the average weight, at 3.7 pounds, was above average for this type of lake.  Historical pike abundance has consistently been below average and historical average weights have been on the larger side with sizes ranging from 3.5 to 4.3 pounds.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 16.2 to 37.8 inches with an average length of 22.7 inches.  Blue Lake northerns showed above average growth at ages 1-2 and normal growth thereafter.  Black crappie were found at normal abundance levels with their lengths extending from 2.1 to 9.7 inches.  The majority of crappie sampled were in the 7.0 to 8.0 inch category.  Bluegill sunfish numbers were found to be at a normal level for this lake type.  Lengths ranged from 3.7 to 8.9 inches with good numbers of sunfish in all length categories between 3.0 and 7.5 inches.  Yellow perch were found at normal abundance levels.  When compared to the most recent survey conducted in 1994, the perch catch rate had decreased by 40%.  This may be a result of increased predation by a more abundant northern pike and walleye population.  Good natural reproductive success was found for bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass while black crappie and yellow perch showed some success.  Blue Lakes fish community was also made up of black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, common carp, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, logperch, pumpkinseed sunfish, spottail shiner, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Because Blue Lake is one of a few lakes in southern Isanti County that is home to a wide variety of gamefish species, the lake does get a considerable amount of fishing pressure from local anglers.  An angler fishing Blue Lake is very likely to encounter a nice sized northern pike or an occasional nice sized largemouth bass, bluegill sunfish, or black crappie.  Currently, the majority of largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish are small, but their numbers are abundant.  Walleye fishing enthusiasts will find that a lot of walleye around 14.0 to 15.0 inches, but larger fish are present.  Anglers are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the smaller ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to experience catching a quality sized fish.  Because Blue Lake is primarily surrounded by residential development and agricultural cropland, the lake is subject to some degree of nutrient loading.  Since land uses within a watershed surrounding a lake influence a lakes water quality, additional nutrient input may decrease this lakes water quality and ultimately its overall health.  Prevention of further nutrient loading can be achieved by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips of native plants along the shoreline and along inlet streams, updating outdated or failing septic systems, discontinuing fertilizer use on surrounding lawns or if fertilizers are needed use of phosphorus free fertilizers is recommended for lawns and agricultural fields, utilizing crop farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removal of desired plant species, and limiting constuction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",

Water surface elevation (W.s.e.) =2.0' Benchmark #2 is the spike in a 1.25' diameter at breast height oak tree located 6' from the water's edge and 80' north of the public access on the southeast side of the lake.  Water surface elevation (W.s.e.) =7.9'. \n  Homes and cabins = 131, boats = 211. Wildlife noted: 4 common loons, 6 great herons, 2 green herons, and 41 painted turtles (in trapnets). \n  A population assessment was done on Blue Lake in August of 1989.  Six gill nets, six trapnets and shoreline seining were used to assess the current fish population. Based on respective local medians and other data, the status of the current fish population is as follows: northern pike net catch shows a real decrease from the previous survey and is lower than the local median. The length frequency distribution range is from 20.0 to 30.9 inches, with a median length group of 24.0 to 24.9 inches. The length frequency distribution of the previous survey was 14.0 to 29.9 inches. Mean weight in this survey is 4.0 pounds, compared to 3.4 pound mean weight in the previous survey. The fish were aged at age IV and age V. Growth is normal when compared to the statewide average. \n  The walleye net catch showed a real increase from the previous survey. The length frequency distribution range is from 10.5 to 26.9 inches, with a median length group of 18.0 to 18.9 inches. Mean weight is 2.4 pounds, compared to a 3.1 pound mean weight in the previous survey. The 20 fish aged ranged from age II to age XVI. Growth is normal when compared to the statewide average. \n  Largemouth bass were captured in all three types of gear. The fish captured in nets ranged from 8.5 to 16.9 inches. Although only four fish were caught in nets, 19 young-of-year and 16 older largemouth bass were captured in shoreline seining.\n  Bluegill sunfish net catch was higher than in the previous survey and is above the local median. The length frequency distribution ranges from 2.5 to 7.4 inches, with a median length group of 5.0 to 5.4 inches. Growth is normal when compared to the statewide average. Both young-of-year and older bluegill were captured in shoreline seining; numbers captured were 578 and 485, respectively. \n  Black crappie trap net catch is low, following the historical pattern. However, the gill net catch is near the local mean. Fish captured in both types of gear had a length frequency distribution ranging from 4.5 to 8.9 inches, with a median length group of 7.5 to 7.9 inches. Growth is normal when compared to the statewide average. \n  Yellow perch net catch increased for the first time since the 1974 survey, and shows a real increase when compared to the previous survey. This catch is higher than the local median. The length frequency distribution ranges from 5.0 to 7.9 inches, with a median length group of 5.5 to 5.9 inches. Growth is slow compared to the statewide average. Twenty-seven yellow perch older than young-of-year were captured in shoreline seining. \n  Green sunfish and hybrid sunfish net catches are above their respective local medians. Golden shiner and pumpkinseed sunfish net catches are near their respective local medians. The white sucker net catch is below the local median. Brown bullhead and yellow bullhead were caught at levels below the local medians in their appropriate selective gear, but in numbers near the local medians for gillnets. Seventy-six pumpkinseed sunfish and thirty-two hybrid sunfish older than young-of-year were captured in shoreline seining.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blue is a 309 acre lake in southwestern Isanti County.  Two township- owned public accesses are located on the lake; one on the southeast shore and one on the northwest.  Water clarity is moderate with algal blooms more likely as summer progresses.  Boat navigation during early summer is affected by dense stands of curled pondweed in shallower areas.  The lake is well developed and popular with local pleasure boaters.  Managed primarily for walleye and largemouth bass, 175 pounds of walleye fingerlings are stocked biennially.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers on Blue Lake can expect moderate fishing pressure.  Largemouth bass electrofishing found an increase in bass numbers but a drop in average size.  Lengths ranged from 6 to 17.7 inches with an average of 0.8 pounds and 10.6 inches.  Northern pike numbers in Blue Lake continue to be lower than in similar lakes.  Although pike size has decreased since the 2004 assessment, it is still above the norm.  Northerns averaged 22.5 inches and nearly 3 pounds.  Walleye abundance has rebounded to levels similar to comparable lakes.  Size quality remains very high.  Lengths ranged from 11.8 to 29.1 inches with an average of 4.3 pounds and 22.5 inches.  Yellow perch are both more plentiful and larger than they have been.  With nearly a fourth of the catch topping 8 inches, perch should provide an additional harvest opportunity.  Bluegill abundance in the trap nets rebounded back to normal levels but with only a moderate improvement in size.  Bluegills remain on the small side with a 5.7 inch average and a range from 2.9 to 7.6 inches.  Black crappie abundance and size is higher than previous assessments and most similar lakes.  With two thirds of the gill net catch topping 8.5 inches, harvestable black crappies are available to anglers.</p>",

The northern pike was low at 2.0 per gillnet set with an average weight for all fish of 3.32 pounds. The walleye was low at 1.67 per gillnet set with a combined average weight of 2.53 pounds. The yellow perch has shown a steady decline from a high of 92.75 per gillnet set in 1973 to a low of 7.00 in 1984. They are, however, well-represented in the shoreline seining as young of the year and yearling size. They bluegill was about average at 24.17 per trapnet set while the pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were low at 1.00 and 0.17 per set respectively. All sunfish are of a small average size. The black crappie was absent from the trap- net catch and only present at 1.50 per set in the gillnet. No crappie young of the year were taken in the shoreline seining results. The largemouth bass was also absent from the trapnet catch but was average at 0.50 in the gillnet sets and showed up well in the shoreline seining. The black, brown, and yellow bullhead all had low median figures and were of a fair to good size. The white sucker (0.67), bowfin (0.17) and carp (1.00) also had low population figures.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blue is a 309 acre lake in southwestern Isanti County.  Two township owned public accesses are located on the lake; one on the southeast shore and one on the northwest.  Water clarity is moderate with algal blooms more likely as summer progresses.  Boat navigation during early summer is affected by dense stands of curled pondweed in shallower areas.  The lakeshore is well developed with 151 residences.  The lake is popular with local pleasure boaters.  Managed primarily for walleye and largemouth bass, 175 pounds of walleye fingerlings are stocked biennially.  Anglers on Blue Lake can expect moderate fishing pressure and quality sized largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.  Largemouth bass electrofishing results have never been better.  Bass were abundant, as in 1999, but better sized.  Lengths ranged from 7.6 to 20.5 inches with an average of 1.1 pounds and 12 inches.  Northern pike numbers in Blue Lake continue to be lower than in similar lakes, but size is above normal.  Northerns averaged 24 inches and over 4 pounds.  Walleye abundance was lower than in recent assessments but like northerns exceed the lake class norm in size.  Lengths ranged from 14.4 to 25.2 inches with an average of 2.9 pounds and 19.6 inches.  Yellow perch are more plentiful than they have been, but few were over  8 inches in length.  Bluegill abundance in the trap nets decreased dramatically.  Unfortunately, there was no increase in size associated with this decline.  Bluegill remain on the small side with a 5.2 inch average and a range from 3.2 to 7.2 inches.  The black crappie catch was normal compared to similar lakes.  Gill netted crappies averaged a quarter pound and 7.4 inches.  Sixty percent of the catch was over 8 inches, a size acceptable to some anglers.  Other species present in the lake included; black, brown, and yellow bullheads, common carp, white sucker, spottail shiner, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blue is a 309 acre lake in southwestern Isanti County. Two township- owned public accesses are located on the lake; one on the southeast shore and one on the northwest. Water clarity is moderate with algal blooms more likely as summer progresses. Boat navigation during early summercan be affected by dense stands of curlyleaf pondweed in shallower areas. The lake is well developed and popular with local pleasure boaters. Managed primarily for Walleye and Largemouth Bass, the lake is stocked annually with134 pounds of Walleye fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers on Blue Lake can expect moderate fishing pressure.  Largemouth Bass electrofishing found high numbers of Bass and an increase in average size. Lengths ranged from 3.7 to 18.9 inches with an average of 11.3 inches and 1.0 pounds. Walleye abundance remains at levels similar to comparable lakes and size quality remains high. Lengths ranged from 10.0 to 26.7 inches with an average of 2.6 pounds and 18.9 inches.  Northern Pike numbers in Blue Lake continue to be lower than in similar lakes, but average size remains above normal. Northern Pike averaged 24.3 inches and nearly 3.3 pounds. Bluegill abundance in the trap nets increased for the second survey in a row and is back to normal levels.  Bluegill average sized decreased, but harvestable fist are present as Bluegills up to 8.8 inches were observed.  Black Crappie abundance and size declined from the previous assessment, but with one third of the gill net catch topping 8.0 inches, harvestable Black Crappies are available to anglers.  Yellow Perch are both less plentiful and smaller than they have been, with only a few fish over 8 inches being observed. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blue Lake is a 309 acre lake in southwest Isanti County. There are two public accesses located on the lake. Water clarity is moderate with algal blooms present as summer progresses. Blue Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Largemouth Bass; the lake is stocked biennially with 134 pounds of Walleye fingerlings. In 2021 a fisheries survey was conducted which included trap netting and gillnetting from August 2-5.  Six gill net sets and nine trap nets were used during the assessment.  The previous assessment on Blue Lake was conducted in 2013.  <br> \n <br> \nBoth numbers and sizes of Black Crappies and Bluegills have increased since the 2013 assessment. The abundance of Black Crappie was found to be above the normal range for this lake type, with lengths extending from 3.0 to 10.8 inches and an average of 7.8 inches. Just over 62% of the crappie sampled were greater than 8.0 inches in length. Bluegill numbers were within a normal range for this type of lake. Measured Bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 7.9 inches, with an average of 7.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring night electrofishing found good numbers of Largemouth Bass that had an average size of 1.1 pounds.  Lengths ranged from 6.4 to 19.2 inches with an average length of 11.7 inches. Anglers can expect to catch good numbers of moderate sized Largemouth Bass on Blue Lake. Walleye catch rates were 5.3 fish per net which is above average for this type of lake in Minnesota. Sampled Walleye ranged from 13.2 to 26.6 inches with a 19.2 inch average. Northern Pike catch rates were 1.7 fish per net which is below average for this type of lake in Minnesota. Pike ranged from 21.5 to 31.2 inches with a 26.6 inch average. Both Northern Pike and Walleye growth were normal.   <br> \n</p>",
