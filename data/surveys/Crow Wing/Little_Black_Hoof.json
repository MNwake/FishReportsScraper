                "narrative": "<p>Little Black Hoof is a 58 acre lake located a mile northeast of Riverton in Crow Wing County.  Little Black Hoof is fairly shallow with the deepest point being 13'.  A small earthen access is located on the northwest side off of county road 128.  Cattails and water lilies surround much of the lake.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas, providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life, and decreasing shoreline erosion, lake sedimentation, and nutrient uptake. <br> \n <br> \nMost fishing activity on Little Blackhoof is for panfish.  Black crappies were caught in average numbers in gillnets (4.7/net), and below average in trapnets (0.3/net).   Average length was 7.9\" for gillnets and 8.3\" for trapnets.  For both gears combined 59% measured at least 8\" in length.  A 9\" crappie is 5 years old in this lake.  Bluegills were captured in high numbers in trapnets (25.8/net).  Average length was 6.2\", with 30% at least 7\" in length.  An 8\" bluegill is 8-9 years old in Little Black Hoof. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were average at 6.0/gillnet. Average length was 23.1\".  A few nice pike were present with 33% at least 24\" in length. Voluntary catch and release of these large pike will help keep a balanced population.  This is especially true on a small lake like Little Blackhoof. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Little Blackhoof Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is a hardwater lake with high fertility.  Water clarity is below average for the area and the lake experiences heavy algal blooms in summer.  The entire lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Dominant soil types in the area are sand and glacial till.  Shallow water soils consist mostly of muck and some sand.  Aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of 13 feet.  A wide variety of aquatic plant species are present, with sago pondweed, yellow and white waterlily, coontail and cattail being most common.Northern pike were the most commonly netted gamefish during the 1995 survey.  They were present in \"average\" numbers and sizes when compared to catches in similar type lakes.  Lengths ranged from 16.4-29.6 inches and averaged 21.2 inches.  Average weight was 2.3 lbs..  Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers.  Bluegills were caught in average numbers and size averaged 6.4 inches.  Black crappies were caught in high numbers in gillnets.  Size ranged from 5.5-10.5 inches.  Yellow perch, an important forage fish, were caught in low numbers in 1995.  Other species were taken in numbers and sizes which were \"average\" for this type of lake.</p>",
