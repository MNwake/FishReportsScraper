Those caught below the average were northern pike, smallmouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, northern redhorse, and black crappie.  No muskies were caught.Management Recommendations:In view of the high perch population, continued walleye fingerling stocking could prove beneficial.  The muskie fishery does not seem to show up yet, therefore it would be wise to hold up on stocking additional fish, until more information can be obtained.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sand is located 2.5 miles north of Dorset in Hubbard County.  Big Sand has a surface area of 1,659 acres and a maximum depth of 135 feet.  A public access is located on the southeast shore of the lake at the outlet.  Access with small boats is also available from the inlet connecting to Lake Emma and from the outlet connecting to Lake Ida.  Big Sand is noted for its outstanding walleye fishery, especially for its production of large walleyes.  Big Sand has exceptional water clarity and lots of structure to challenge the fisherperson.  Experimental regulations were put into effect in 1995 that require the release of all walleyes between 18.0 and 26.0 inches (protected slot length limit), with only one fish allowed over 26.0 inches.  Public meetings were held in the fall of 2004 to gather input and public comment on the protected slot length limit.  There was overwhelmingly strong support to continue a protected slot length limit on Big Sand.  A decision was made to implement a 20.0 to 28.0 inch protected slot length limit starting with the fishing opener in 2005.  The decision to move up the bottom end of the slot from 18.0 to 20.0 inches was to give anglers the opportunity to harvest some walleye, especially male fish, before they move into the protected slot.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Big Sand is in lake class 22.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Lower Bottle, Kabekona, Long, and Potato. Walleye were sampled in high numbers (15.9 walleye/gillnet), above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and above the current management goal of 8.5 walleye/gillnet. This is the highest walleye gillnet catch rate in eleven surveys going back to 1951.  Walleye abundance was also high during the 2001 survey (15.3 walleye/gillnet), while walleye numbers in earlier surveys generally fluctuated around the current management goal.  A large 2002-year class (12-13 inch walleye) dominated the sample.  Multiple year classes and sizes of walleye were sampled.  Walleye exhibited good growth rates in Big Sand compared to other area lakes.  A four-year-old walleye had an average length of 17.1 inches.  Yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) provide an excellent forage base for the walleye population in Big Sand.  Some local anglers have expressed concern about low numbers of tullibee (cisco) in Big Sand the past several years and the poor condition of larger walleye (\"skinny walleye\").  They are not observing schools of tullibee on their graphs or seeing them surface in the evenings as has been common in past years.  Fall electrofishing surveys the past several years have shown excellent natural reproduction of walleye. Big Sand has several rock and rubble shoal areas that provide excellent walleye spawning habitat.  Big Sand has been receiving a light stocking of walleye fingerlings in even years to supplement the natural reproduction.  Big Sand has low numbers of northern pike, however, it is known for producing some large-size pike.  Northern pike abundance (2.0 pike/gillnet) was below the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.  Northern pike up to 37.0 inches were sampled.  Both smallmouth bass and largemouth bass are present in Big Sand, with smallmouth bass being the more abundant of the two species.  Big Sand has excellent smallmouth bass habitat of rock, rubble, and sand bottom areas.  Good numbers and sizes of these \"brown bass\" are present in Big Sand.  Largemouth bass are present in low to moderate numbers and are concentrated in areas of preferred largemouth bass habitat. Other species sampled included high numbers of rock bass, and moderate numbers of white sucker.  Black crappie, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sand is located 2.5 miles north of Dorset in Hubbard County.  Big Sand has a surface area of 1,659 acres and a maximum depth of 135 feet.  A public access is located on the southeast shore of the lake at the outlet.  Access with small boats is also available from the inlet connecting to Lake Emma and from the outlet connecting to Lake Ida.  Big Sand is noted for its outstanding walleye fishery, especially for its production of large walleyes.  Big Sand has exceptional water clarity and lots of structure to challenge the angler.  A protected slot length limit for walleye was implemented in 1995.  That regulation required the release of all walleye between 18 and 26 inches with only one fish allowed over 26 inches.  The regulation was modified in 2005 to a protected slot length limit that requires the release of all walleye between 20 inches and 28 inches with only one fish over 28 inches allowed in possession.  The decision to move up the bottom end of the slot from 18 to 20 inches was to give anglers the opportunity to harvest some walleye, especially male fish, before they grow into the protected slot and to reduce competition among walleyes for limited forage. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Big Sand is in lake class 22.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Lower Bottle, Kabekona, Long, and Potato. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was well above the current management goal.  Walleye gillnet catch rates were also high in the 2001 and 2004 surveys.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 14.7 inches and 1.1 pounds, with fish measured up to 26.2 inches.  Multiple year classes and sizes of walleye were sampled, however the 2001, 2002 and 2004 year classes dominated the catch.  Fall electrofishing surveys the past several years have shown excellent natural reproduction of walleye.  Big Sand has several rock and rubble shoal areas that provide excellent walleye spawning habitat.  In past years Big Sand was receiving light walleye fingerling stockings to supplement natural reproduction.  Walleye stocking was discontinued after 2004, when evaluations indicated natural reproduction could sustain the population. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and tullibee (cisco) provide an important forage base for walleye in Big Sand.  Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers, with the gillnet catch rate at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class, and the lowest gillnet catch rate in Big Sand since the 1951 survey.  Yellow perch abundance in past surveys has generally fluctuated within this \"typical\" range.  Tullibee were also sampled in low numbers.  Tullibee were not sampled in the 2001 or 2004 surveys.  Summer gillnet sampling of tullibee can be quite variable and gillnet catch rates in past surveys have fluctuated widely from low to high abundance.  Some local anglers have expressed concern about low numbers of tullibee in Big Sand the past several years.  Anglers are not observing schools of tullibee on their graphs or seeing them surface in the evenings as has been common in past years.  Anglers have also commented about poor condition and absence of larger walleye (>26 inches).  It is unknown whether low abundance of perch and tullibee and changes in walleye growth, condition and size structure are a trend or normal fluctuations of those populations, and whether the changes were caused by the walleye regulation or other environmental factors. <br> \n <br> \nBig Sand has a low northern pike population, however it is known for producing some large-sized pike.  Northern pike abundance was below the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.  Northern pike up to 37.4 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBoth smallmouth bass and largemouth bass are present in Big Sand, with smallmouth bass the more abundant of the two species.  Big Sand has excellent smallmouth bass habitat of rock, rubble, and sand bottom areas.  Good numbers and sizes of these \"brown bass\" are present in Big Sand.  Largemouth bass are present in low to moderate numbers and are concentrated in areas of preferred largemouth bass habitat. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find low numbers of panfish in Big Sand.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Bluegill abundance was up from past surveys.  Bluegill abundance in past surveys has generally been at low levels, below the range \"typical\" for this lake class. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of rock bass and moderate numbers of white sucker and yellow bullhead.  Pumpkinseed were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sand is located 2.5 miles north of Dorset in Hubbard County.  Big Sand has a surface area of 1,635 acres and a maximum depth of 135 feet.  A public access is located on the southeast shore of the lake at the outlet.  Access with small boats is also available from the inlet connecting to Lake Emma and from the outlet connecting to Lake Ida.  Big Sand is noted for its outstanding walleye fishery.  Big Sand has exceptional water clarity and lots of structure to challenge the angler.  Big Sand has a protected slot length limit on walleye that requires the release of all walleye between 20 to 28 inches, with only one fish over 28 inches allowed in possession.  An angler creel survey was conducted during the summer of 2011. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Big Sand is in lake class 22.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Lower Bottle, Kabekona, Long, and Potato. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (9.2 walleye/gillnet) was above the current management goal, and similar to past surveys.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 13.7 inches and 1.0 pounds, with fish measured up to 24.8 inches.  Multiple year classes and sizes of walleye were sampled, however, the 2007 and 2008 year classes were the strongest.  Fall electrofishing surveys the past several years have shown excellent natural reproduction of walleye.  Big Sand has several rock and rubble shoal areas that provide excellent walleye spawning habitat.  In past years Big Sand was receiving light walleye fingerling stockings to supplement natural reproduction.  Walleye stocking was discontinued after 2004, when evaluations indicated natural reproduction could sustain the population. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and tullibee (cisco) provide an important forage base for walleye in Big Sand.  Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers, with the gillnet catch rate of 4.1 perch/gillnet below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Yellow perch abundance in past surveys has generally fluctuated within this \"typical\" range.  Tullibee (cisco) were not sampled in 2011.  Summer gillnet sampling of tullibee (cisco) can be quite variable and gillnet catch rates in past surveys have fluctuated widely from low to high abundance.  Some local anglers have expressed concern about low numbers of tullibee in Big Sand the past decade.  Anglers are not observing schools of tullibee on their graphs or seeing them surface in the evenings as had been common in the 1970's and 1980's.  Anglers have aslo commented about the absence of larger walleye (> 25 inches).  It is unknown whether low abundance of yellow perch and tullibee and changes in walleye growth, condition and size structure are a trend or normal fluctuations of those populations, and whether the changes were caused by the walleye regulation (slot length limit) or other environmental factors. <br> \n <br> \nBig Sand has a low northern pike population, however, it is known for producing some large-sized pike.  Northern pike abundance was below the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.  Northern pike up to 36.2 inches were sampled.  Tullibee (cisco) and white sucker provide an excellent forage base for growing large pike. <br> \nBoth smallmouth bass and largemouth bass are present in Big Sand, with smallmouth bass the more abundant of the two species.  Big Sand has excellent smallmouth bass habitat of rock, rubble, and sand bottom areas.  Good numbers and sizes of these \"brown bass\" are present in Big Sand.  Largemouth bass are present in low to moderate numbers and are concentrated in areas of preferred largemouth bass habitat. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish abundance was up from past surveys.  Bluegill were sampled at their highest abundance (33.2 bluegill/trapnet) for all surveys on Big Sand.  Bluegill abundance in surveys prior to 2000 was low, generally below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find bluegill in the 6-7 inch size range.  Black crappie abundance was up slightly from past surveys, but still low compared to other area lakes.  Black crappie have been sampled in very low numbers in past surveys.  Rock bass were abundant, with catch rates well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Angler comments from the 2011 summer creel expressed concern about an overly-abundant and possibly increasing rock bass population.  Rock bass trapnet catch rates have been high for all surveys, however, gillnet catch rates have been very high the since 2001. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include moderate numbers of yellow bullhead and white sucker, and low numbers of pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catch rates (8.44 fish/net and 24.90 lbs/net) were above the third quartile for Lake Class 22.  Walleye abundance has usually been above the third quartile since 1951.  However, the mean individual weight in 1992 (2.85 pounds) was almost 2 times that of the next highest mean weight.  The size structure (PSD=83, RSD-P=39, RSD-M=1) indicates high numbers of quality and preferred-length fish; however, only one walleye sampled was over 25.0 inches.  Growth rates are variable among year classes, but are generally fast.  Mean length at age 5 for females is 18.19 inches and for males is 16.98 inches.  Some walleye natural reproduction or migration from adjoining lakes is occurring in Big Sand Lake, as evidenced by the 1985 and 1989 year classes.  A dominant 1987 year class accounted for 28% of the aged walleye.  It is not known if the strength of the 1987 year class is due to natural reproduction or the stocking of yearlings in 1988.  Experimental regulations were put into effect in 1989 to protect the walleye and northern pike populations.Gillnet catch rates of northern pike (1.33 fish/set and 5.66 lbs/set) were below the first quartile for lakes in Class 22.  The number of northern pike sampled has been below the first quartile since 1951.  However, the average pounds per net had been within the normal range since 1983.  The mean weight of individual northern pike in 1992 was, thererfore, the lowest it has been since 1978 although it remained high (4.26 pounds).  The size stucture of northern pike (PSD=75, RSD-P=17, RSD-M=8) is also indicative of large-sized population.  Northern pike exhibit fast growth through age 3, averaging 24.76 inches at age 4.  These fast growth rates contribute to the large size structure, even though all nothern pike sampled were age 5 or younger.  Analysis of northern pike age structure suggests consistently low recruitment.Smalllmouth bass and largemouth bass populations were not efficiently sampled with lake survey gear.  However, net catches indicate a low density largemouth bass population and an average abundance of smallmouth bass for Lake Class 22.  Gillnet catches of largemouth bass have been below the first quartile since 1951.  Smallmouth bass catch rates have been within the normal ranges since 1951.  Smallmouth bass sampled in 1992 ranged from 8.5 to 17.9 inches.Catch rates of pumpkinseed, bluegill and yellow perch were within the normal ranges in 1992.  Pumpkinseed and bluegill densities had been below the first quartile until 1992 and 1989 respectively.  Both species have small size structures (pumpkinseed PSD=17, bluegill PSD=38); only one bluegill sampled was > 8.0 inches.  Slow early growth rates may cause the small size structures.  Bluegill average 5.08 inches at age 4.  Rock bass catches were above the third quartile and have been for every survey since 1951, except 1986.  Yellow perch abundance dropped from a high year in 1989 (46.13 fish/gillnet) to settle within the normal range in 1992 (12.11 fish/gillnet).  A good proportion of yellow perch were quality-length (PSD=53), but few were > 10.0 inches (RSD-P=5).  This yellow perch forage base is contributing to the fast growth rates of walleye and northern pike.Yellow and brown bullhead catch rates have always been low and were below the first quartile in 1992.  Shorthead redhorse abundance was also low, but was within the normal range for lakes in Class 22.  The number of white sucker sample in 1992 was within the normal range, while pounds per set was above the third quartile.  White sucker are trapped, stripped and removed from Big Sand Lake each spring during the spawning run.  Gillnet catch of tullibee in regular net sets were below the first quartile; however, special deep sets revealed an abundant tullibee population (9.50 fish/gillnet).</p>",

Continue stocking muskellunge fingerlings for at least two more years, then evaluate the fishery with a survey.  The stocking of walleye fingerlings or fry should be limited in so far as the survey shows good natural reproduction.  With good spawning areas for walleyes, the natural reproduction should take care of the fishery.  In event of poor years of hatch, a fry stocking could be made.</p>",

Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 27, 2020 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Eighteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, two sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and sixteen sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 16 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured twenty species of fish including three species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Blackchin Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Stickleback, Common Shiner, Fathead Minnow, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Mimic Shiner, Molted Sculpin, Northern Redbelly Dace,  Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on July 20, 2020, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Big Sand Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Big Sand Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sand Lake is an 1,659 acre lake located 2.5 miles north of Dorset in Hubbard County.  Big Sand Lake is an extremely clear water lake with numerous sunken bars and humps.  Big Sand is noted for its exceptional walleye fishery, especially for its population of big walleyes.  Special regulations were put into effect in 1995 that requires the release of all walleyes between 18.0 to 26.0 inches, with only one walleye over 26.0 inches allowed. Walleye were sampled in high numbers with a gillnet catch of 9.1/net, similar to the previous survey in 1992 at 8.4/net.  Excluding 1983 (4.1/net), the walleye gillnet catch has been stable in the eight surveys going back to 1951.  The highest gillnet catch of 12.1/net occurred in 1986.  While the gillnet catch has remained stable in recent surveys, average weight of the walleyes has not.  Average weight of the walleyes has increased during the last two surveys in 1992 and 1995.  The average weight has increased from 1.4 lbs (1986) and 0.9 lbs (1989) to 2.9 lbs (1992) and 2.3 lbs (1995).  Surveys prior to 1986 had average weight similar to 1986 and 1989 figures. Walleyes sampled in 1995 had an average length of 16.8 inches, and with 31% of the sample 20.0 inches or larger.  Walleyes were measured up to 27.0 inches.  Thirty-eight percent of the 1995 walleye sample fell within the 18.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot length limit.  Big Sand Lake has excellent walleye spawning habitat and the walleye population is maintained primarily through natural reproduction.  However, walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year to supplement the natural reproduction.Big Sand has been known for having a low northern pike population composed of large fish, and the 1995 survey showed no different.  Northern pike catch was low at 3.2/gillnet, while average size was large, 3.3 lbs and 23.2 inches.  Northern pike up to 33.4 inches were measured with 25% of the sample 25.0 inches or larger.  Big Sand has an abundant tullibee (cisco) population which provides an exceptional forage base for the northern pike and walleye populations.Yellow perch were sampled in high numbers at 30.8/gillnet.  Size of the yellow perch was good, with an average length of 7.9 inches, and with 21% of the sample 9.0 inches or larger.  Yellow perch were measured up to 11.8 inches.  The yellow perch population in Big Sand provides a fine fishery to the angler as well as a forage base for the walleye population.Big Sand has a low bluegill population as evident of the trapnet catch of 3.0/net.  Historical bluegill catches have been similar.  While numbers of bluegills are low, size was good with 31% of the sample 7.0 inches or larger and with fish measured up to 8.8 inches.Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) is usually not effective in evaluation of black crappie, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass populations, but some general inferences can be made.  Big Sand has populations of both smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass, with smallmouth bass being the more abundant, while largemouth bass are at low levels.  Black crappie populations have historically been at low levels, however, large sized crappies have been reported by anglers. Rock bass are abundant in Big Sand and were sampled in high numbers at 22.2/trapnet.  Rock bass up to 10.7 inches were sampled.White sucker catches were high at 4.9/gillnet, and similar to past surveys.Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, shorthead redhorse, and brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sand Lake is located seven miles northeast of Park Rapids in central Hubbard County. Big Sand has a surface area of 1,635 acres and a maximum depth of 135 feet.  A state owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake off of Grouse Road, next to the outlet of the Sand River.  Access with small boats is also available from the inlet connecting to Lake Emma and from the outlet connecting to Lake Ida.  Big Sand provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Big Sand Lake is in lake class 22.  Class 22 lakes are generally very large, irregularly shaped lakes that are very deep, have clear and hard water.  Other class 22 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Lower Bottle, Kabekona, Long, and Potato.  <br> \n <br> \nThere is a protected slot limit for Walleyes on Big Sand Lake.  All Walleyes 20 to 28 inches must be immediately released, with one over 28 inches allowed in possession.  Walleye abundance has been good in recent years.  Walleyes from 6.5 to 28 inches were sampled, showing a few good year classes for anglers and smaller fish for the future. The average length was 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBoth Smallmouth and Largemouth Bass are found in Big Sand Lake.  They were both sampled in high numbers compared to previous years.  The average Largemouth Bass was 10 inches because of a number of smaller bass sampled, while Smallmouth Bass averaged 15 inches.  The largest of both bass species topped out around 18 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass are abundant and increasing size in recent years.  The average Rock Bass was 8 inches, with fish sampled over 11 inches.  There are also opportunities for Black Crappies, Bluegill and Pumpkinseeds of good size.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Big Sand. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

A public access is located on the southeast shore of the lake at the outlet.  Big Sand is noted for its Walleye population and exceptional water clarity.  Big Sand has a protected slot length limit regulation that requires the release of all Walleye between 20 to 28 inches, with only one fish allowed over 28.0 inches in possession. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Big Sand is in lake class 22.  Class 22 lakes have the characteristics of being deep, having hard water, and small littoral zone (lake area less than 15 feet in depth).  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Kabekona, Long, Lower Bottle, and Potato. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was high for this lake class, similar to recent survey on Big Sand.  An abundant 2017 and 2016 year classes are present and anglers will find good numbers of Walleye  in the 12-16 size range.  Sampled Walleye had an average length of 15.1 inches with fish measured up to 26 inches.  Yellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) populations provide important forage for Walleye in Big Sand.  Yellow Perch were sampled in low numbers for this lake class and their abundance has been low since the 2011 survey.  Yellow Perch are small in size, with few fish of an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nBig Sand has a low Northern Pike population, however, it is known for producing some large-sized fish.  Northern Pike up to 34.4 inches were sampled.  Tullibee (Cisco) and White Sucker provide an excellent forage base for growing large Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nBoth Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass are present in Big Sand, with Smallmouth Bass the more abundant of the two species.  Big Sand has excellent Smallmouth Bass habitat of rock, rubble, and sand bottom areas.  Good size range of Smallmouth Bass are present in Big Sand.  Largemouth Bass are present in low to moderate numbers and are concentrated in areas of preferred Largemouth Bass habitat. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Big Sand.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals form their watercraft and drain all water form their boats before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sand Lake is located seven miles northeast of Park Rapids in central Hubbard County. Big Sand has a surface area of 1,635 acres and a maximum depth of 135 feet.  A state owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake off Grouse Road, next to the outlet of the Sand River.  Access with small boats is also available from the inlet connecting to Lake Emma and from the outlet connecting to Lake Ida.  Big Sand provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Big Sand Lake is in lake class 22.  Class 22 lakes are generally very large, irregularly shaped lakes that are very deep, have clear and hard water.  Other class 22 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Lower Bottle, Kabekona, Long, and Potato.  <br> \n <br> \nThe unique protected slot limit for Walleye on Big Sand Lake was removed in 2024 and reverted to the statewide regulation.  Walleye abundance has been good in recent years.  Walleyes from 7.4 to 27 inches were sampled, showing a few good year classes for anglers and smaller fish for the future. The average length was close to 17 inches.   <br> \n  <br> \nBoth Smallmouth and Largemouth Bass are found in Big Sand Lake.  The average Largemouth Bass was 11 inches, while Smallmouth Bass averaged 14 inches.  The largest Largemouth Bass was 17 inches, and the largest Smallmouth Bass was 20 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass are abundant and increasing size in recent years.  The average Rock Bass was 7.6 inches, with fish sampled over 11 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Big Sand. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sand Lake is located 2.5 miles north of Dorset in Hubbard County.  Big Sand has a surface area of 1,659 acres and a maximum depth of 135 feet.  A public access is located on the southeast shore of the lake at the outlet.  Construction of an expanded parking area at the access occurred in 1997.  Access with small boats is also available from the inlet connecting to Lake Emma and from the outlet connecting to Lake Ida.  Big Sand is noted for it's outstanding walleye fishery, especially for it's population of big walleyes.  Big Sand Lake has exceptional water clarity and lots of structure to challenge the fisherperson.  Experimental Regulations were put into effect in 1995 that requires the release of all walleyes between 18.0 and 26.0 inches (protected slot length limit). The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Big Sand is in lake class 22.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Lower Bottle, Kabekona, Long, and Potato.Walleye abundance (4.6/net) was at the low end of the \"normal range\"for this lake class.  WAE abundance was higher in 1992 (8.4/net) and 1995 (9.0/net).  WAE abundance in historical surveys has fluctuated, but has generally been above the \"normal range\".  Sampled walleye were large-sized averaging 17.9 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Average weight of walleye has increased in the 1990's.  All three of the surveys in 1990's have had average weights of 2.3 pounds or larger, while earlier surveys had average weights of 1.4 pounds or less.  Big Sand has an abundant yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) population that provides an excellent forage base for producing large walleye and northern pike.  Walleye growth rates were faster than other lakes in this class.  Thirty-nine percent of the walleye sample fell within the 18.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot length limit, similar to the 1995 survey.  Natural reproduction of walleye is contributing to the population with 47% of the sample from non-stocked years.  Big Sand is stocked with walleye fingerlings in even years to supplement the natural reproduction.  Big Sand has several rock and rubble shoal areas that provide excellent walleye spawning habitat.  Fall electrofishing was conducted for the first time on Big Sand to assess the abundance of young walleye produced through natural reproduction.  Fourteen  walleye from the 1998 year class were sampled (6.2 walleye/hour).  Future fall electrofishing is planned to monitor the population of young walleye and to compare abundance with other lakes in the Park Rapids area. Big Sand has a low northern pike population, but is known for producing some large-size fish.  Northern pike abundance was below the \"normal range\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.  Average size of northern pike was large (25.1 inches & 4.3 pounds).  Northern pike growth rates in Big Sand are some of the fastest in the Park Rapids area.      The bass fishery in Big Sand is known more for size than numbers of fish. Both smallmouth bass and largemouth bass are present, with smallmouth bass being the more abundant of the two species.  Smallmouth bass have been sampled at low to moderate abundance, while largemouth bass numbers have been low.Yellow perch abundance was within the \"normal range\" for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  Yellow perch are of an acceptable size for angling.Other species sampled include rock bass, white sucker, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Rock bass and white sucker are abundant, while sunfish species were sampled in low numbers.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Big Sand and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",
