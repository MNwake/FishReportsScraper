                "narrative": "<p>Six Mile Lake is a 1288-acre lake located near Bena, MN that has 7.5 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 68 feet.  There is an US Forest Service public access located on east shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Six Mile Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are generally very large, deep, hard water, and regularly shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, yellow perch, and cisco.  Walleye abundance has been consistent with historical catch rates.  The 2001 year-class was dominant in our sampling gear, which will provide some fishing opportunities in the future.  The mean length for walleye was 16 inches and fish up to 25 inches were sampled.  Northern pike were abundant in Six Mile Lake when compared to similar lakes of Lake Class 27.  Fish up to 34 inches were sampled with an average length of 21 inches.  Fifty-four percent of the northern pike sampled were between 21 and 28 inches. Other fish species that are available for anglers to catch are black crappie, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, cisco, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Six Mile Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

NO TRAPNETS WERE USED DURING THE 1977 AND 1982 POPULATION ASSESSMENTS SO THIS SPECIES WAS NOT EVALUATED. FOUR NATURAL REPRODUC- TION CHECKS THIS YEAR, CAPTURED YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR AND SMALL BLUEGILLS THOUGH SO THEY ARE PRESENT IN THE LAKE. BLACK CRAPPIE IS IN LOW ABUNDANCE WHILE ALL OTHER SPECIES APPEAR TO BE WITHIN A NORMAL RANGE FOR THIS TYPE OF LAKE.</p>",

The walleye gill net catch rate (5.1/set) was within the expected range for this type of lake.  The mean length of sampled walleye was 16.8 inches, ranging from 8.2 to 28.0 inches.  Growth rates for walleye were near the statewide averages.  Most of the walleye sampled were from stocked year classes, indicating poor natural reproduction.     The yellow perch gill net catch rate (108.3/set) was much greater than the expected range.  Lengths ranged from 3.6 to 11.4 inches, with a mean length of 7.5 inches.  Six Mile Lake has historically had a high abundance of perch.  Trap nets also sampled yellow perch, with a catch rate of 5.8/set.  These perch ranged in length from 5.8 to 10.4 inches.     The northern pike gill net catch rate (2.9/set) was within the expected range.  Northern pike sampled in gill nets ranged from 15.5 to 29.8 inches (mean = 20.7 inches).       Other species sampled in test nets include: burbot, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Six Mile Lake is a 1,323-acre lake located near Bena, MN that has 7.7 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 68 feet.  There is a US Forest Service public access located on the east shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Six Mile Lake is in Lake Class 27; these lakes are generally large and deep with hard water and are regularly shaped.  This lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Tullibee (Cisco).   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population has been consistent with historical catch rates.  A wide range of Walleye age classes were present in our sampling gear, which should provide current and future fishing opportunities.  The average length for Walleye was 14 inches and fish up to 26 inches long were sampled.  Northern Pike were abundant in Six Mile Lake when compared to similar lakes in Class 27.  Fish up to 32 inches long were sampled with an average length of 21 inches.  Thirty five percent of Northern Pike were between 21 and 28 inches, but large year classes in 2010 and 2011 should yield larger numbers of fish in this size range in coming years. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that are available for anglers to catch are Black Crappie, Bluegill, Brown Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Six Mile Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Six Mile Lake is a 1,323-acre lake with 7.77 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 68 feet located southeast of Bena, MN in the Chippewa National Forest. A US Forest Service owned public access and campground is located on the northeast shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Six Mile Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are fairly large and deep, supporting diverse fisheries. Other area lakes in this class include Ada, Crooked, Lower Sucker, Pleasant, and Webb Lake. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch and secondarily for Largemouth Bass and Cisco. <br> \n  <br> \nSix Mile Lake provides multi-species angling opportunity. Walleye abundance was above the management goal and lengths ranged from 9 to 21 inches with multiple age classes present in catch. Northern Pike abundance was within the management goal range, though size goals were not met. Pike measured between 16 and 27 inches and averaged 20 inches long. Yellow Perch abundance reached a historic low, though size goals were achieved with the average perch measuring 7 inches. Bluegill abundance was high in 2022, while Black Crappie were not effectively captured in sampling gear. Cisco catch has shown a declining trend since early surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Six Mile Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
