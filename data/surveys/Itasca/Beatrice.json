                "narrative": "<p>Beatrice Lake is a small, heavily developed lake located four miles northwest of Side Lake.  Due to the small size of the lake, it may be vulnerable to over-harvest.  The lake has a concrete public access and state campground on the north side of the lake.  The lake management plan indicates black crappie as the primary species of management with bluegill and northern pike as secondary species.  Black crappie are difficult to sample during the summer because they often suspend in mid-lake areas where our nets are not set.  Despite these sampling challenges, the 2000 catch rates appeared to be average when compared to previous assessments and lakes that are similar to Beatrice.  Black crappie from the trap nets ranged from 3.9 to 9.8 inches and had an average length of 4.9 inches.  Nearly 87% of the fish sampled were one year old.  Growth was above statewide averages for all year classes.Bluegill numbers were similar to the last two assessments but low when compared to other similar lakes.  The population has never been real abundant which is likely a result of the lakes habitat and low productivity.  Bluegill ranged from 3.4 to 9.6 inches with an average length of 5.6 inches.  After aging the scales, it was determined that fish from two to eight years old were present.  Bluegill growth in Beatrice tended to be better than lakes with similar characteristics.  Northern pike numbers have always been fairly low.  Generally it's better to have low to moderate numbers of fish with better size distribution than to have a high population with only small fish.  The 2000 net catches were about average for Beatrice Lake.  Northern pike ranged from 15.4 to 31.4 inches and averaged 23.2 inches.  Six year classes were identified by aging fish scales ranging from one to six years old.  Northern pike averaged 24.6 inches in four years of growth which is above the statewide average of 20.5 inches.Since 1969, walleye numbers have ranged from 0.0 to 4.0 fish/net.  In 2000, the catch was 1.2 fish/net which is average for lakes similar to Beatrice.  Walleye have not been stocked since 1991.   Natural reproduction accounted for all the fish sampled with fish from one to five years old aged.  The fish ranged from 11.7 to 19.5 inches and had an average length of 16.3 inches.  Walleye averaged 14.9 inches after three years of growth which was above the statewide average of 12.3 inches.  In a lake like Beatrice, walleye will never be a dominant species due its habitat and productivity characteristics.Yellow perch catch rates declined from a high of 46.0 fish/net in 1969 to a low of 1.0 fish/net in 1986 and have since increased to 4.5 fish/net in 2000.  The 2000 catch rates were above average when compared to other lake similar to Beatrice.  Fish ranged 5.9 to 8.3 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  Two to four year old fish were sampled in 2000.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages.  The yellow perch population is probably more important to the fish community as a food item than to anglers for a recreational species.Largemouth bass have never been sampled with spring electrofishing which is the most effective tool for catching bass.  However, seven fish were sampled in the nets that ranged from 5.0 to 16.3 inches with an average length of 8.2 inches.  Three year classes were sampled with three age-1, two age-2, and one age-4 fish.  Low sample size precludes any meaningful discussion on growth.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural, forestry or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these can be areas of concern, lakeshore property owners may also contribute to water quality problems.  Some examples include putting in sand beaches, removing shoreline trees and vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Proper land use practices by everyone will help insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beatrice Lake is in ecological lake class #20.  Lakes in this class are small (mean=130 acres), moderately deep (mean 53.6=feet), low alkalinity (mean=34.3 ppm) and have a mean Secchi reading of 9.8 feet.The lake is predominantly a centrarchid lake, although walleyes have been stocked and a small population currently exists.  None of the fish species are present in high numbers which is reflective of the low fertility of this lake.  Only four gill nets were used during this assessment; therefore, the information presented here should be viewed cautiously.  Northern pike were sampled at only 1.0/gillnet with a mean weight of 2.0 pounds.  This is below the first quartile of 2.0/gillnet.  Growth rates of the one year-old fish sampled was good (11.7\"-N=3), but the sample was small.  Spawning area for this species is not abundant, but does occur as sedge shoreline, mostly in the bays.Walleye were sampled at 1.5/gillnet, above the lake class median of 1.3.  Eight of the 10 walleye (80%) sampled were from fingerling-stocked years of 1987 and 1989.  No fish, however, were sampled from 1985 when fry and fingerlings were stocked.Yellow perch were present in relatively low numbers when compared to the lake class median of 5.3.  Shoreline seining indicated good numbers fo young-of-the-year (300/acre).The panfish species were also present at low levels.  Bluegill were sampled at 4.3/trapnet and black crappies at 0.8/trapnet.  These numbers sampled reflect the first quartile for this lake class.  Growth of the bluegills was very slow during their first three years but then increased significantly for older fish (Age 2=2.2\" N=5; Age IV=5.0\" N=8).  No largemouth bass were sampled in the nets and only one young-of-the-year was found in the shoreline seining.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beatrice Lake is a 123-acre lake located four miles northwest of Side Lake, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 29 ft and four miles of shoreline with many points and bays.  A public access with limited parking and state campground are located in the northwest bay. Beatrice Lake was clear with Secchi disk reading of 9.2 ft and previous water chemistry samples indicated low productivity.  Primary fish species include northern pike, walleye and panfish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch rate was 0.8/net and was lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0.3 to 9.5/net and catch rates in the last three assessments have been lower, varying from 0.3 to 3.0/net.  Low catch rates generally correspond to good growth rates and size structure.  Size structure was good with fish up to 30 inches and growth was faster than the statewide average with fish averaging 24 inches by age 4.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch rate was 2.0/net, which was higher than the median catch rate of 1.3/net for similar lakes.  Catch rates in the last three assessments varied from 1.2 to 2.3/net.  Walleye varied in length from 12.3 to 19.5 inches.  Growth was faster than the statewide average with fish averaging 15 inches by age three.  Four year classes representing ages one to four were present.  Walleye have been stocked many times in the past and did not increase the population.  Natural reproduction is currently providing a better than average population with several year classes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate was 1.4/trap net and was lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have also been low, varying from 0 to 11.8/trap net and four of the five assessments were less than 5.0/net.  Size structure was poor and only one fish was larger than 8 inches.  Scales were not collected for age and growth in this assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for black crappie were 1.0/gill net and 0.7/trap net.  Catch rates were at the lower end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments varied from 0.2 to 3.5/trap net.  Although few fish were sampled, size structure was good with fish up to 11.9 inches sampled.  Growth was slower than the statewide average for ages one and two and faster than the average for ages three and four. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill net catch was 6.5/gill net; higher than any previous assessment, and within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have been low varying from 1.0 to 5.8/gill net.  Size structure was poor and only one fish exceeded 9 inches.  Yellow perch are an important prey species and while their abundance is higher than previous assessments, it is lower than other more productive lakes and affects the ability of the lake to support predator species such as northern pike and walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nBeatrice Lake has a fairly simple fish community and the only other species sampled were white sucker and largemouth bass.  Additional nearshore sampling using backpack electrofishing and seining sampled Johnny darter, bluntnose minnow, fathead minnow, golden shiner, mimic shiner and other young-of-the-year gamefish species previously sampled in gill nets and trap nets.   <br> \n</p>",
