During the 2003 survey black crappies were found to be the most abundant species. The average size sampled was approximately 7 inches. Northern pike and largemouth bass were also sampled. Neither species was sampled in abundance however. Northern pike up to approximately 31 inches in length were sampled. Black bullhead numbers decreased to average levels since the last survey when compared to similar lakes. The black bullheads caught averaged more than 12 inches and 1 pound in weight a piece. Pumpkinseed sunfish were captured in average numbers for this type of lake. Their size was also average.</p>",

Northern pike abundance was low for area lakes (2.5/gillnet).  Northern pike ranged in length from 8.7 to 31.7 inches.  Largemouth bass were present and ranged in size from 10.3 to 12.0 inches.  Black bullhead abundance was normal for area lakes, however average size was small (7.0 inches).  Yellow bullhead abundance was low.  Pumpkinseed abundance was low, and average size was small (4.0 inches).</p>",
