                "narrative": "<p>Everett Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 12, which consists of 90 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, have irregularly shaped shorelines, and have very soft and infertile water.Everett Lake was thermally stratified on 08/07/2000 and retained adequate oxygen (2 ppm) to a depth of 9 ft, where the water temperature was 69 F.  The bottom temperature was 60 F.  A shallow channel in the inlet from Fenske Lake limits fish movement.  The outlet to Twin Lake has a rocky rapids which probably limits fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates are mostly boulder, ledgerock, gravel, and muck, with small amounts of sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and are scattered along the shoreline with a concentration in the northwest bay near the outlet.This assessment consisted of 6 gillnets set in early August, and 9 trapnets set in early June.  The initial survey (1966) was done in early July; all nine subsequent gillnet investigations were done in early August.  Trapnets (5-9 sets) were done during six of these investigations.  The trapnetting date was moved from August to June in 1996 and 2000 to better sample panfish populations.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2000 of 15 fish/net (19 lb/net) was in the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the median catch of 12 fish/net (16 lb/net) in all ten gillnettings on Everett Lake dating back to 1966.  Lake Class 12 is one of the more productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 2000 of 14 fish/net (14 lb/net) was similar to the median catch of 14 fish/net (9 lb/net) in all six trapnettings on Everett Lake, dating back to 1966.  More northern pike and white sucker were captured in 2000 than in most previous trapnettings, which accounts for the larger catch in lbs/net.Fish populations in 2000, as in most previous investigations, were dominated by northern pike, followed by white sucker, walleye, and bluegill sunfish.  Pike numbers in 2000 (6.7/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 4.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2000 averaged 19.5\" (1.47 lb) which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average length of 20.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2000 was 28.5\".  Most pike in 2000 were ages 2-4.  Growth of pike in 2000 was normal for area lakes.White sucker numbers in 2000 (1.7/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 2.4/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2000 averaged 19.1\" (2.81 lb) which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 15.5\" in all investigations on this lake.Walleye numbers in 2000 (1.8/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 2.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2000 averaged 16.2\" (1.85 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was similar to the median size of 16.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye in 2000 was 28.7\" (8.0 lb).  Walleye in 2000 were scattered among six year classes.  Growth of walleye in 2000 was faster than normal for area lakes.Bluegill sunfish numbers in 2000 (5.8/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 6.2/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2000 averaged 5.8\" (0.22 lb) which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 5.6\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill in 2000 was 9.5\" (0.75 lb).  Most bluegill in 2000 were age 3-5.  Growth of bluegill in 2000 was normal for area lakes.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Everett Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 12, which consists of 90 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, have an irregularly shaped shoreline, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.   Everett Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index. <br> \n <br> \nEverett Lake was slightly thermally stratified on 07/09/2007 with a surface temperature of 76 F and a bottom temperature of 61 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 9 ft, where the temperature was 68 F.  Three small inlets drain local wetlands, while another inlet originates in Fenske Lake and has drops that limit fish movement.  The outlet to Twin Lake has rocky rapids that probably limit upstream fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Everett Lake are mostly boulder and rubble, followed by sand, silt, and ledge rock.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 5 ft, with concentrations in bays and shallows.  The most common plants are sweetgale, water shield, floatingleaf burreed, filamentous algae, water moss, and white waterlilies. <br> \n <br> \nAbout half of the shoreline on Everett Lake is in Federal ownership.  Riparian development on private land increased from 4 cottages and a resort with 6 cabins in 1966, to six year-round homes and one cottage in 1986, and to 17 homes and cottages in 2003.  Access is by a 190 yard portage from the Echo Trail or a 70 yard portage from Twin Lake.  Fishing pressure was light during the 2007 fish population assessment. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2007 were sampled with six gillnets and eight trapnets.  Eleven previous investigations, dating back to 1966, used 3-6 gillnets and 5-9 trapnets.  Shoreline seining was also done during the fisheries lake surveys in 1966, 1989, and 2003. Dates of these investigations were not consistent over time, ranging from early June through mid August. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2007, as in past investigations on Everett Lake, were dominated by northern pike and bluegill sunfish.  Fair numbers of black crappie, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch were also captured in 2007.  Bass populations were probably higher than indicated by their low numbers in the net catches, as they are known to be \"net shy\" and difficult to catch in standard gillnets and trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2007 (6.3/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 4.5/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2007 averaged 20.8\" (2.0 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 20.3\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2007, caught in a trapnet, was 32.7\".  Most of the pike captured in 2007 (55 percent) were age four.  Pike growth was normal by area standards.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2007 (16.6/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 8.9/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2007 averaged 5.0\" (0.12 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 5.4\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill caught in 2007 was 8.0\".  Half of the bluegill captured in 2007 were age two, most of the remainder were ages 4-6.  Bluegill growth was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in 2007 (2.1/trapnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were near the median value of 1.9/trapnet for all investigations on this lake.  Crappie sizes in 2007 averaged 9.6\" (0.66 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 9.4\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest crappie in 2007 (caught in a gillnet) was 12.8\".  Crappie growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked periodically in Everett Lake since 1912 and walleye fry have been stocked every other year since 1994.  Walleye numbers in 2007 (1.3/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 1.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2007 averaged 16.4\" (2.0 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 16.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye caught in 2007 was 21.6\".  Most walleye appeared to be from years in which walleye fry were stocked, but ageing of walleye age six and older was difficult and we have little confidence in the accuracy of ages of these older walleye.  Walleye growth appeared to be somewhat faster than normal (in the third or fourth quartile, depending on the age) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nPerch numbers in 2007 (4.2/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 2.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2007 averaged 6.0\" (0.1 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 6.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch in 2007 (caught in a trapnet) was 6.8\".  All perch captured in 2007 were ages 3-5.  Perch growth was slower than normal (in the first quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish examined in 2007 were mostly free of disease or parasites.  A few fish were infected with neascus (black spot), bass tapeworm, or yellow grub.  All of these parasites are native to the area and are common.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed when filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

The first is a 30 rod portage from a small parking lot off the Echo Trail (CR 116). The second is a 13 rod portage from East Twin Lake. There is one campsite located near the NW end of the lake for camping.\n\nBlluegill was the only species sampled in 2016 with numbers above average compared to other similar lakes in the area. Other species sampled in relatively low average abundance include walleye, black crappie, northern pike, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and white sucker.\n\nBluegill numbers in 2016 (5.6/trap net) were slightly below the historic average (7.5/trap net) for Everett Lake. The average bluegill was only 4.7 inches which is smaller than the historic average of 5.2 inches and the largest bluegill sampled was 7.6 inches. Sixty-five percent of the bluegill sampled in the trap nets were less than 5 inches in length.\n\nSeven walleye were sampled in the gill nets and the largest walleye sampled in 2016 was 20 inches long. Walleye fry are stocked during even numbered years in Everett Lake and 6 of the seven walleye were from years where fry were stocked.\n\nBlack crappie numbers in 2016 (1.2/trap net) were similar to the historic average. Abundance was low but the largest crappie was nearly 13 inches long. \n\nNorthern pike have historically been sampled in low numbers on Everett Lake and 2016 was no exception. The average pike sampled in the gill nets was 22 inches long while the largest pike was 29 inches.</p>",

The bottom temperature is 63 F.  A shallow channel in the inlet from Fenske Lake may limit fish movement.  The outlet to Twin Lake has a rocky rapids that prevents upstream fish movement.  The shoreline bottom is mostly boulder, ledgerock, gravel, and muck, with small amounts of sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse; there is a concentration of plants in the northwest bay near the outlet.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 1996 (all species combined) of 12 fish/net (16 lb/net) was lower than normal for this lake class, but was similar to previous gillnet catches in this lake.  The total catch of fish in the trapnets of 12 fish/net (7 lb/net) was similar to previous trapnet catches in this lake.Fish populations in 1996 were dominated by northern pike.  Pike numbers in 1996 were in the normal range for this lake class and were similar to  previous catches in this lake.  Pike sizes averaged 20 in (1.5 lb) which is normal for this lake class and similar to previous gillnet catches.  The largest pike in 1996 was 24 in.   Most pike were age two and three, from the 1994 and 1993 year classes.  Pike growth (19 in at age three) was average for the area.Bluegill numbers in 1996 were in the normal range for this lake class and were similar to previous catches in this lake.  Bluegill sizes averaged 6 in, the largest was 9 in (0.7 lb).  Many of the bluegill were age five.  Almost no bluegill were produced during the cold summers of 1992 and 1993.  Bluegill growth (5 in at age five) was average for the area.Walleye numbers in 1996 were lower than normal for this lake class, but were similar to previous catches in this lake.  Walleye sizes averaged 16 in, which is larger than normal for this lake class.  The largest walleye was 21 in (2.6 lb).  Walleye growth (9 in at age two, 17 in at age five) was average for the area.Crappie numbers in 1996, as in previous catches, were low.  Some large crappie were present, up to 12 in (0.9 lb).  Perch numbers were also low.  Perch were found in the stomachs of northern pike during this assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Everett Lake is 123-acre lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet located 5.5 miles north and 3 miles west of Ely off the Echo Trail in northeastern St. Louis County.  Access to the lake is via a 200 yard portage off Echo Trail or a 50 yard portage from Twin Lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Everett Lake is in lake class 12.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Angleworm, Ed Shave, Hobo, and Johnson Lakes.  Lakes in this lake class are small, shallow, and have soft, clear water.  Everett Lake is stocked by the DNR with walleye fry in even numbered years. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2011, the walleye abundance was the lowest of any assessment conducted on Everett Lake.  Walleye sampled ranged in length from 13.0 to 20.0 inches. Three of the four walleye captured were from stocked years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike abundance was low with pike from 16.7 to 24.4 inches in length.  No pike was aged older than age five.  Pike growth was slightly above average with an age three fish being 19.4 inches long compared to the Tower area mean of 18.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill was the most abundant species sampled in trap nets making up 81% of the catch.  Bluegill abundance was above what you would typically find in a class 12 lake but down from 2007.  Bluegill were generally small ranging from 3.2 to 6.9 inches in length.  Ages 3 through 7 were identified, with age 3 (2008) composing 61% of the catch.  Growth was slow.  By age three, Everett bluegill averaged 3.1 inches long compared to Tower area mean of 4.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nEven though only one adult largemouth bass was captured, 22 young-of\u0013the-year bass were captured in specialized gear.  Everett Lake was selected for fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) sampling.  This index is designed to help determine the overall health of the biological fish community of the lake.  This type of sampling will typically capture the non-game species and young-of-year game species.  Twelve different species were identified.  Blacknose shiner, golden shiner, central mudminnow, and tadpole madtom were non-game species sampled.  Black crappie, largemouth bass, and yellow perch young-of-year were also sampled.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Everett Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 12, which consists of 90 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, have irregularly shaped shorelines, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Everett Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index, with total phosphorus of 16 ppb, chlorophyll-a of 3.3 ppb, and Secchi water clarity of 2.5 m.Everett Lake was slightly thermally stratified on 07/28/2003 with a surface temperature of 76 F and a bottom temperature of 63 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 10 ft, where the temperature was 70 F.  Three small inlets drain local wetlands, while another inlet originates in Fenske Lake and has drops that limit fish movement.  The outlet to Twin Lake has rocky rapids that probably limits upstream fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Everett Lake are mostly boulder and rubble, followed by sand, silt, and ledgerock.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 5 ft, with concentrations in bays and shallows.  The most common plants are sweetgale, water shield, floatingleaf burreed, filamentous algae, water moss, and white waterlilies.About half of the shoreline on Everett Lake is in Federal ownership.  Riparian development on private land has increased from 4 cottages and a resort with 6 cabins in 1966, to six year-round homes and one cottage in 1986, and to 17 homes and cottages in 2003.  Access is by a 200 yard portage from the Echo Trail or a 50 yard portage from Twin Lake.  Fishing pressure during the 2003 fisheries lake survey was light.Fish populations in 2003 were sampled with six gillnets, nine trapnets, and three shoreline seine hauls.  Ten previous investigations, dating back to 1966, used 3-6 gillnets and 5-9 trapnets.  Shoreline seining was also done during the initial investigation in 1966.  The date of these investigations was not consistent over time, ranging from early June through mid August.Fish populations in 2003 were dominated by northern pike and bluegill sunfish.  Fair numbers of black crappie, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch were also captured.  Bass populations were probably higher than indicated by their numbers in the nets, as they are known to be \"net shy\" and difficult to catch in standard sampling nets.Northern pike numbers in 2003 (4.7/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 4.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2003 averaged 21.6\" (2.3 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 20.3\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2003, caught in a trapnet, was 34.8\".  Pike scales collected in 2003 were difficult to read, but pike recruitment appeared to be well distributed among year classes and pike growth appeared to be normal (in the second or third quartile, depending on the age) by area standards.Bluegill numbers in 2003 (11.1/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 6.6/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2003 averaged 4.8\" (0.1 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 5.5\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill in 2003 was 8.5\".  Most bluegill captured in 2003 (52 percent) were age two, the remainder were all ages 3-6.  Bluegill growth was slower than normal (in the first quartile) by area standards.  Black crappie numbers in 2002 (3.2/trapnet) were near the median for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 1.8/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Crappie sizes in 2003 averaged 9.7\" (0.6 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 9.4\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest crappie in 2003 was 14.1\".  Most crappie captured in 2003 were ages two, four, and five.  Crappie growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.Walleye have been stocked periodically in Everett Lake since 1912 and walleye fingerlings have been stocked biennially since 1986.  Walleye numbers in 2003 (1.7/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 2.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2003 averaged 16.6\" (1.5 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 16.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye in 2003 was 20.2\".  All walleye except one were from fingerling stocked years.  Walleye growth was somewhat faster than normal (in the third or fourth quartile, depending on the age) by area standards.Perch numbers in 2003 (3.3/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 2.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2003 averaged 5.8\" (0.1 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 6.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch was 6.5\".  All perch captured in 2003 were ages three or four.  Perch growth was slower than normal (in the first quartile) by area standards.The fish examined in 2003 were mostly free of disease or parasites.  Low incidences of neascus (black spot), yellow grub, and bass tapeworm were observed.  These are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Everett Lake is a 113 acre lake located 6 miles northwest of Ely.  The lake has two portage accesses, the main access is a 170 yard portage from the Echo Trail and the other is a 70 yard portage from Twin Lake.  The lake has a maximum depth of 15 feet and brown bog-stained water.  \n\nOn July 27, 2020 Everett Lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 77 F and a bottom temperature of 64 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 10 feet.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder and ledge rock with muck in the bays.   \n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 9.2 fish/net which was below average compared to past surveys on the lake.  Yield was 16.4 lbs/net which was right at the lakes historic average.  Fish species sampled were white sucker, yellow perch, northern pike, walleye, black crappie, largemouth bass, and bluegill.   \n\nWalleye fingerlings are currently stocked in Everett Lake every other year.  The 2020 walleye gillnet catch rate was 0.7 fish/net, which was low compared to other similar lakes as well as past surveys on Everett.  Lengths ranged from 11 to just over 21 inches with an average of 17.5 inches.  Weights were decent at an average of two pounds per fish.  Fish were aged up to 10 years old, and all fish came from stocked year classes.  \n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 1.7 fish/net which was the lowest on record since 1975.  Lengths ranged from 22 to 39 inches with an average of 26.5 inches.  The average weight was quite good at over four pounds per fish.  The 39 inch fish was also the largest pike sampled in all surveys on Everett Lake.  \n\nThe yellow perch catch rate was 2.7 fish/gill net which was below average compared to other similar lakes but right at the average for Everett Lake.  Sizes were similar to past surveys but relatively small with a range of 6 to 7 inches.  \n</p>",
