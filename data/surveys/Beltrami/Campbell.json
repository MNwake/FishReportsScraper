                "narrative": "<p>Campbell Lake is a 475-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet located in southern Beltrami County.  It is one of several lakes connected by the Turtle River.  A concrete DNR access is located on the southeast end of the lake off of county road 9.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Campbell Lake is in lake class 34.   <br> \n <br> \nWith the exception of carp and black bullhead, all species of fish typically found in a lake class 34 fish community are found in Campbell Lake.  The Campbell Lake fish community is dominated by northern pike and bluegill.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked on alternate years. <br> \n <br> \nCampbell Lake is included in a special northern pike regulation consistent for all lakes on the Turtle River chain. The regulation requires anglers to immediately release all pike from 24-36 inches, with only one over 36 inches allowed.  This regulation, implemented in 2003, is intended to improve the quality of pike population and help maintain a more balanced predator population.  A long-term objective of the protected size regulation is to eventually shift the population from a high-density small pike population to a lower density population of larger pike.  Unfortunately, northern pike abundance has nearly doubled since the 2003 assessment to over 17 per gill net set.  Just 19 of 155 northern pike sampled were large enough to fall within the protected size range. It may take a number of years for a quantity of pike to grow into the range of protection, and possibly even longer to shift size structure enough to suppress excessive production of young pike.  This regulation will be evaluated with another assessment in 2011 and be reviewed in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance over all of the assessments has been fairly constant within a range typical of other class 34 lakes.  There are still some quality-size bluegill in the lake.  Thirty percent of the sample were eight inches or larger.  In order to maintain the quality, anglers are encouraged to show some voluntary restraint when bluegill are biting well.  By practicing selective harvest, anglers can harvest the smaller more abundant bluegill for eating, and release more of the medium to large fish.  This will help maintain balance in the population and increase the opportunity to catch large bluegill in the future.  Other members of the sunfish family that were sampled include pumpkinseed, rock bass, black crappie, largemouth bass, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2007 a total of 26 walleye were sampled that ranged in length from 10.3 to 24.6 inches.  Most of walleye sampled were from the 2004-year class (age 3) and averaged 13 inches.  Walleye from this year-class that survive to age 4 will average about 16 inches long.  Natural reproduction is nearly nonexistent with most walleye aged to years of stocking.   <br> \n <br> \nDevelopment pressure is increasing around the shorelines and within the watershed on Minnesota lakes.  This can degrade water quality and impact valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients, and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on the shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.

                "narrative": "<p>Campbell Lake is a 475-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet.  It is located three miles south of Puposky in central Beltrami County.  There is a DNR public access of the southeast end of the lake.  DNR Fisheries management focuses mainly on northern pike, bluegill, black crappie and walleye.Campbell Lake is one of several lakes on the Turtle River chain.  A 24\" - 36\" protected slot for northern pike was implemented in 2003 on opening day of the fishing season for a number of lakes in this chain including Campbell Lake.  This means that anglers need to release all northern pike between 24 and 26 inches.  Only one northern more than 36 inches can be kept.  The goal is to improve the size of northern pike.Northern pike, based on the last four assessments, have been consistently abundant.  In 2003 pike ranged in length from 17.2 to 32.9 inches, but the average length of 20.9 inches and weight of 1.8 pounds indicates a high proportion of smaller pike in the population.  This situation is only made worse when anglers harvest only the more desirable sized fish.  In this assessment, 94% of the pike sampled were less than 24 inches in length.  Hopefully with the help of the experimental regulation the trend will reverse.Walleye fingerling are stocked every other year on even years.  This stocking regime has been consistent over the past 20 years.  There is, however, evidence that natural reproduction is also contributing walleye to the fishery.  Since Campbell Lake is part of a connected chain, it is likely that successful reproduction occurs within the system.  A diversity of habitat exists within a riverine system and significant movement can occur between lakes.  The combination of stocking and natural reproduction has provided anglers with a quality fishery.  In the 2003 assessment, 62% of the walleye sampled were greater than 15 inches in length.The bluegill catch rate in 2003 was up from 1999 findings and was within the historical range.  This higher catch rate in 2003 was the result of the strong 2001 year class that made up 46% of the aged sample.  This younger year class also affected the quality.  Only 30% of the bluegill were greater than seven inches in length.  In 1999 assessment 69% of the bluegill were greater than seven inches in length.  To improve quality, anglers need to use some restraint if large bluegill are really biting.  Release the larger bluegill and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size bluegill have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.Other species present and adding to the diversity of the population include yellow perch, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, largemouth bass and black crappie.As with many lakes in the Bemidji area, there has been much development and has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  Shoreline areas are critical areas for fish production and water quality.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife and clean water that is associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can greatly affect a lake's ability to produce fish and protect water quality.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting.  For more information on how to accomplish this, contact your nearest Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Campbell Lake is a 475-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet located 12 miles northwest of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  Campbell is one of eleven connected lakes known as the Turtle River Chain, although navigation between all lakes in the chain is not possible with much more than a canoe.  Public access consists of a concrete boat ramp with parking for about six trucks/trailers located on the south shore of the lake.  Anglers should consult a county road map, as the access is well off the beaten path down a series of gravel roads.  Development of Campbell Lake is low, with a handful of lake homes and one small resort situated along the mostly bog shoreline.  The fish community of Campbell Lake consists primarily of panfish (including black crappie), northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, yellow perch, sucker/redhorse and bullhead species. <br> \n <br> \nCampbell Lake northern pike were managed from 2003-2011 with a 24 to 36-inch protected slot limit, intended to improve the average size of northern pike and reduce the abundance of small pike in the population.  Due to Legislative action in 2011 that limited the total number of northern pike special regulation lakes statewide, Campbell was dropped from the list of lakes managed with special regulations.  The Campbell Lake regulation was selected for removal due to the lack of measured improvement in the pike population, although fisheries managers would have preferred a longer timeframe to evaluate the regulation's impact.  The special regulation for northern pike remains in place on the remainder of the lakes in the Turtle River Chain.  Although the gill net catch rate declined from 17.2/GN in 2007 to 9.9/GN in 2011 (one of the goals of the regulation was to reduce overall pike abundance), the population continues to be dominated by small fish, with an average size of 20.1 inches and 1.6 pounds/fish.  Abundance of forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee are currently at low levels in Campbell Lake, and growth rates of pike have declined since 2007.  While the Campbell Lake pike population will keep anglers busy with plenty of action (use a wire leader), those seeking an opportunity to catch larger pike may want to focus their efforts on other lakes in the Turtle River chain that currently hold better populations. <br> \n <br> \nOver the years, Campbell Lake has been a consistent producer of bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish and black crappie.  In fact, at one time the state record pumpkinseed was from Campbell Lake, and fish up to 10 inches in length are still caught by anglers occasionally.  The 2011 population assessment caught very few fish of these species, but this was due to extremely variable and cold weather during the late spring assessment timeframe and not because of low numbers of fish in the population.  Panfish habitat in Campbell Lake is excellent, with extensive bulrush stands and submerged vegetation.  Sharp drop-offs to deeper water provide good areas for anglers to focus on black crappie, although these fish utilize weedlines during spring and summer as well. <br> \n <br> \nCampbell Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings on alternating years.  Natural reproduction is difficult to evaluate due to Campbell's connection to other lakes in the Turtle River Chain, which is a fairly open system.  Walleye were captured at 3.6/GN in the 2011 population assessment, which is up from 2.9/GN in 2007 and above the median value of 2.8/GN for class 34 lakes.  Walleye up to 25 inches in length were present in the catch.  The walleye catch was dominated by age-2 and age-3 fish.  Age-3 walleye had an average length of 12.3 inches, and these fish will provide good angling opportunity for \"eater\" size walleye in the next few years.  Classic walleye structure (points, humps) is limited in Campbell Lake, so anglers should not forget about weedlines that can hold walleye during the summer and early fall. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough no assessments have been conducted on the lake's bass population, Campbell does contain a good population of largemouth bass.  Largemouth bass fishing in the Bemidji area is often overshadowed by high quality opportunities for walleye and muskellunge, but many lakes in the area offer good largemouth bass populations that are lightly fished, and Campbell Lake is a fine example.  Bass anglers that put in the effort on Campbell may find that they have the lake all to themselves.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Campbell Lake is a 462-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet located 10 miles northwest of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  There is a DNR public water access with a concrete ramp and parking for about 6 trucks/trailers located on the south shore of the lake and accessible from County Roads 9 and 22.  Campbell Lake is managed for Northern Pike, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Walleye.  A special regulation for Sunfish consisting of a reduced daily bag limit of 5 fish is in effect.  Statewide regulations apply to all other species.   <br> \n <br> \nCampbell Lake is known as a consistent producer of Bluegill and Black Crappie.  Numbers for both species were up in 2021 compared to the past few surveys, with good average sizes and larger fish present.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 survey documented a respectable Walleye population with good numbers of smaller fish captured showing that recent stocking efforts have been successful.  Walleye up to 22 inches in length were captured in this survey.  Anglers with the patience required to fish weed lines for Walleye can do well in Campbell Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were very abundant in Campbell Lake in the 2021 survey.  Pike can provide a lot of fishing action for anglers on days when other species refuse to cooperate.  A good portion of the pike catch exceeded 24 inches with fish up to 33 inches in length captured.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were not targeted in the 2021 survey, however Campbell Lake is known to have a healthy bass population similar to many smaller lakes in the Bemidji area.  While numbers may be lower than some area lakes the potential to catch large bass exists on Campbell Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2021 survey were Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Bullhead species, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Campbell Lake, a 475 acre lake in southern Beltrami County has a maximum depth of 25 feet, an irregular shaped shoreline, a high percentage of littoral area, and large stands of bulrush associated with sandy shoal areas.  It is a typical northern Minnesota bass/panfish lake managed secondarily for walleye through alternate year fingerling stocking.  Permits for development and vegetation removal are monitored closely to protect Campbell Lake from unnecessary habitat degradation and to preserve vital bulrush stands.Northern pike were sampled at a level similar to, or slightly higher than, that in all previous assessments.  A reported mean weight of 1.5 pounds is the lowest recorded in all assessments.  Maximum length recorded was 31.1 inches.  Aging suggests that successful natural reproduction occurs most years.  Campbell Lake has a history of some larger northern pike in the population and might benefit from a special regulation if it were socially acceptable.The walleye fingerling stocking rate has remained relatively constant over the past twenty years, but the assessment catch rate for walleye has more than doubled since the last survey.  Either survival of stocked fingerlings has improved or natural reproduction is having a greater contribution.  Prior to 1980 fry stocking was tried but it resulted in low assessment catch rates.  Seventy five percent of the walleye sampled in this assessment were between 13.0 and 16.0 inches.The panfish population is dominated by bluegills and pumpkinseed sunfish, but hybrid sunfish, black crappie and rock bass are also minor components of the panfish fishery.  Catch rates of bluegill and pumpkinseed were lower than in the last two assessments but were in line with the 1980 assessment.  Generally, in assessments with lower catch rates, mean weight has been higher and in assessments with higher catch rates, mean weight has been lower.  There is no apparent trend over time in size or population density of these two species.  Black crappie were sampled at a low rate consistent with past assessments.  Average weight was about one pound, with most of the sample around 12 inches.  No crappies smaller than 10.0 inches were sampled suggesting poor reproductive success in recent years.  Because of their low abundance, most crappies caught are incidental to other panfish.  Rock bass were common and had a maximum sampled length of 10.8 inches.  A few hybrid sunfish were sampled and all were larger individuals.Largemouth bass are present in Campbell Lake, but no electrofishing has been done to specifically target them.  They have been sampled in all assessments to date but little is known of their status.  Future assessments should include electrofishing, which is more effective in sampling largemouth bass.Yellow perch catch rate has been quite stable over all assessments.  Mean weight has not varied substantially from past assessments, but most are too small to be of interest to anglers.Other species sampled in low numbers in this assessment included tullibee, white sucker, brown bullhead, and bowfin.  Black bullheads have been sampled in the past.  Neascus (black spot) is common in northern pike and walleye, but is not prevalent in panfish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Campbell Lake is a 462-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet located 15 miles northwest of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  Campbell is part of a connected chain of lakes known as the Turtle River chain.  There is a DNR public water access with a concrete ramp and parking for about 6 trucks/trailers located on the south shore of the lake accessible from County Roads 9 and 22.  Campbell Lake is managed for Northern Pike, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Walleye.  Statewide fishing regulations apply to all species.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes based on similarities in lake basin (depth, size) water chemistry (alkalinity, water clarity) and the type of fish community present in the lake.  Campbell Lake is in lake class 34.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Campbell Lake and other class 34 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Little Turtle Lake and Boot Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Northern Pike catch rate was 4.89/gill net.  Northern Pike had an average size of 18.60 inches in length and 1.23 lbs/fish.  The largest Northern Pike captured measured 28.58 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Bluegill catch was 2.56/trap net, which was low compared to previous surveys of Campbell Lake.  Bluegill had a good average size of 6.94 inches in length and 0.34 lbs/fish.  Campbell has a good reputation for producing quality-size Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nFew Black Crappie were captured in the 2016 assessment.  The few fish captured were mostly young (age-2) fish 5.50 to 6.50 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Walleye catch rate was 2/gill net, which was low compared to previous surveys.  Average size of Walleye was on the small side at 13.06 inches in length and 0.74 lbs/fish.  <br> \nAn electrofishing assessment targeting Largemouth Bass was conducted as part of the 2016 assessment.  The catch rate of 8.07 bass per hour was lower than expected, although bass up to 19.84 inches in length were captured.  The average size of Largemouth Bass captured was 14.28 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2016 assessment were Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Tullibee (Cisco), Rock Bass, Bowfin, White Sucker, Yellow Perch, and Bullhead species.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Campbell Lake is a 463-acre lake, located 15 miles northwest of Bemidji, MN. A targeted survey was completed on Campbell Lake by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during June of 2021 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 10 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community. Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted where possible. A total of seven sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites. A total of 15 species of fish were sampled, which included six species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from standard survey completed in 2021 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Campbell Lake. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Tullibee (cisco), Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nResults of this survey indicate Campbell Lake is in exceptional health with a FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute towards the assessment of the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed with biological information about the health of the fish community. <br> \n</p>",
