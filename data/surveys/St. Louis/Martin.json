                "narrative": "<p>Martin is a 71 acre lake with 24 (31%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 77 feet.  There are 12 cabins or permanent homes around the lake and there is no public access to the lake.  Martin Lake is located west of Duluth, south of highway 2 near Brookston.       The fish community in Martin Lake is mainly composed of northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  All species sampled were within or exceeded the expected ranges of abundance for lake class 5.     Northern pike abundance of 10 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota Lakes of similar type.  Ten northern pike were sampled and mean length was 20.8 inches.  Growth was average with individuals reaching 19.1 inches by age four.  Seventy percent of the northern pike sampled were from the 1998 year class.           Largemouth bass abundance of 1.4 per trapnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota Lakes of similar type.  Growth rates were fast with individuals reaching 12.6 inches by age four.  Several larger individuals were sighted in the shallows, and 14 bass were sampled using angling methods, which supplemented the population structure and age data.  Sixty percent of the bass sampled were from the 1998 year class.  None of the other year classes appear to be very strong.     Black crappie abundance of 2 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota Lakes of similar type.  Growth rates were average to fast with individuals reaching 8.1 inches by age four.  Mean length of crappie was 9.1 inches and several fish exceeded 10 inches.  The 1996 and 1998 year classes appear to be equally strong.     Bluegill abundance of 8 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota Lakes of similar type.  Several larger bluegill were sampled by angling and growth rates were average from both trapnet and angling samples.  Bluegill from the trapnet sample averaged 4.3 inches and individuals caught while angling averaged 7.1 inches.  Several year classes were represented as far back as 1987, but the majority (75%) of the bluegill sampled were from strong 1997 and 1998 year classes.        Other fish species sampled in Martin Lake include pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow perch, and golden shiner.  Because there is no opportunity for the public to access Martin Lake, fishing pressure is relatively low.  Future DNR fisheries management activities will also be limited by the lack of public access.   </p>",
