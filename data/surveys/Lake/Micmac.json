Access to the lake requires a 1.6 mile walk on the state park service road, off of Lake County Road #4, to Tettegouche Camp.  Access can also be gained from within Tettegouche State Park, from the trailhead parking lot, by hiking 3.2 miles on maintained trails.  A State Park vehicle permit is required in the park.The 2002 survey on Micmac Lake sampled northern pike in very high numbers compared to other lakes of this type.  The northern pike averaged 3.1 pounds, and ranged in length from 9.5 inches to 31.0 inches (6.2 pounds).  The quality of the northern pike population in this lake was good with approximately 25% of the fish collected weighing at least 4.0 pounds.Yellow perch were sampled in high numbers; however, their size was small.  The largest yellow perch sampled was 8.7 inches.</p>",

The average length was 24.5 inches; the largest northern pike in the sample was 31.4 inches.   The present northern pike population should provide excellent fishing opportunities for walk-in anglers and cabin guests.  Yellow perch are present in good numbers with fish over 8 inches present.  Many of the yellow perch sampled in 2008 had yellow grub, or neascus (black spot), or both parasites. <br> \n <br> \nMicmac Lake is located within Tettegouche State Park.  Access from the trailhead off of the main Park entrance at State Highway 61or the service road off of Lake County Road 402 (Lax Lake Road).  Both routes require considerable hikes of more than a mile over steep terrain.  Check at the Tettegouche State Park Headquarters on State Highway 61 for information and maps regarding the Micmac Lake area and cabins. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Micmac Lake has an area of 137 acres, with a maximum depth of 20 feet and contains clear water with a green tint.  The lake is located five miles south of Finland in Tettegouche State Park.  There are two access trails to the lake, one is a 1.5 mile non-motorized road from Lake County Rd #402 (Lax Lake Road) to the camp on Micmac Lake.  The other is from the State Park trailhead off of a park road; then approximately 3 miles on hiking trail (by Nipisiquit Lake) to the north end of Micmac Lake.  Camper cabins and canoes are available for rental at the Tettegouche Camp from the State Park.  Micmac Lake is known as a good Northern Pike lake with a very nice average size, Yellow Perch on the other hand are rarely targeted because there are few fish large enough to be worth keeping.  As an added bonus, as per Minnesota statute, a fishing license is not required when fishing a lake that is entirely within State Park boundaries and it is not a designated stream trout lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch rate of 20.7/net in 2016 was well above average for similar lakes in the Finland Area.  The average length was 23.6 inches and average weight was 3.4 pounds. The largest pike sampled was 31.3 inches long and weighed 7.3 pounds.  Six year classes were sampled with age-4 and age-5 making up 72% of the catch.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch rate of 20.0/net was well above average for similar lakes in the Finland Area.  The average length was 6.6 inches and average weight was 0.13 pounds.  The largest Yellow Perch sampled was 8.9 inches long and weighed 0.29 pounds.  Five year classes were sampled with age-3 fish being the most abundant and making up 36.4% of the catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker gill net catch rate was 6.3/net, about average for similar lakes in the Finland Area. Average weight of 1.4 pounds was below the area norm. Golden Shiner, Fathead Minnow, and Iowa Darter were also sampled in quarter inch mesh trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough rare, some neascus (black spot) parasites are present in the fish in the lake. These parasites produce small black pigmentation that resemble black pepper sprinkled on the skin and flesh of infected fish. Some yellow grub are also present in the Yellow Perch and look like small yellow BBs in the meat.  However, although a bit unsightly, the meat is safe to eat if it is well cooked.  <br> \n</p>",
