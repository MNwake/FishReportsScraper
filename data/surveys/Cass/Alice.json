THE FISH RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 9.5 TO 26 INCHES, WITH THE MODE BEING 18 INCHES.  GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR ALL AGES.  NOP THAT ARE 18 INCHES LONG ARE THREE YEARS OLD. THERE WERE ALSO TWO SILVER PIKE CAUGHT THAT WERE 25 AND 27 INCHES LONG.  THE SILVER PIKE WERE INCLUDED IN THE PSD FOR NOP.  YEP INDICES (7.0/ GILLNET LIFT) WAS THE SAME AS THE MEDIAN FOR THE LAKE CLASS.  THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 5.5 TO 8 INCHES, WITH THE MODAL LENGTH GROUP BEING 6.5-6.9 INCHES.  THE BLG ABUNDANCE OF 93.8/TRAPNET LIFT WAS WELL ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE (45.13/LIFT). BLG RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 3 TO 8.5 INCHES, WITH A MODAL LENGTH GROUP OF 7.0-7.4 INCHES.  THE PSD WAS 69, WHILE THE RSD-7 WAS 43.  GROWTH WAS GOOD THE FIRST YEAR, SLOW DURING 2-4, THEN WAS GOOD AGAIN FOR THE ENSUING YEARS.  A 7-INCH BLG WAS FIVE YEARS OLD.  AN EXCELLENT SAMPLE OF LMB WERE CAUGHT NIGHT ELECTROFISHING.  THE CPE WAS 140.8 FISH/ HOUR.  THESE FISH RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 2.5 TO 17 INCHES.  SOME LARGER BASS WERE ABLE TO AVOID THE ELECTRICAL FIELD.  GROWTH WAS GOOD AT ALL AGES. BLC WERE CAUGHT AT A RATE OF 4.0/TRAPNET LIFT AND WERE SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN (3.20/ LIFT).  THE LENGTHS RANGED FROM 4.5 TO INCHES, WITH A MODAL LENGTH GROUP OF 8.0-8.4 INCHES. GROWTH WAS GOOD AT ALL AGES.  THE BLB WAS THE ONLY BLH SPECIES CAUGHT AND THEIR ABUNDANCE WAS LOW.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Alice Lake is a 57-acre lake with a maximum depth of 55 feet.  It is located three miles southwest of Walker.  It is within the Chippewa National Forest. The Minnesota Department ofNatural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Alice Lake is in lake class 28.  There is a user-developed carry-in public access on the north end of the lake.  Approximately 44% of the lake is fifteen feet or less in depth.Northern pike abundance is high.  Sampled fish ranged in length from 9 to 29 inches with an average length and weight of 18.5 inches and 1.4 pounds.  There is excellent natural reproduction of northern pike.A total of 74 largemouth bass were sampled during night electrofishing.  These fish ranged in length from 5 to 20 inches with an average length and weight of 11.65 inches and 0.9 pounds. Fifty-six percent of the bass were 12 inches or larger. A total of 29 black crappie were sampled that ranged in length from 5 to 11 inches with an average length and weight of 7.7 inches and 0.3 pounds.  Three year-old crappies made up 78%of the sample. Bluegill are abundant in Alice Lake.  The fish sampled in 1997 ranged in length from 3.4 to 9.6 inches with an average length and weight of 6.6 inches and 0.26 pound.  Forty-eight percent ofthe bluegill were 7 inches or longer. Yellow perch is the main food fish for predator fish such as northern pike in Alice Lake.  Perch sampled in the nets ranged from five to ten inches.Only two lake homes exist on the lake.  The rest of the shoreline is public land.To help maintain quality fish populations in Alice Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife.  They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff water.  They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Alice Lake is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the quality of the fishpopulation and provide anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.     </p>",
