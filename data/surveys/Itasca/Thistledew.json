                "narrative": "<p>Thistledew Lake is located 5 miles southwest of Togo MN, and within the Little Fork River Watershed.  The lake is entirely within Thistledew game refuge and development is very low with one state owned campground on the north end and a boys' camp on the east side.  The 318 acre lake has 73 littoral acres and a 45 foot max depth.  A state access is located on the northeast shore of the lake with parking available for six rigs. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye, a primary management species, were sampled at a rate of 2.9/gill net, similar to the lake class average, yet lower than the management goal of 5.0/net and the previous assessment (7.3/net).  Catch per unit effort was down from the previous three assessments which exceeded the expected range, but more similar to earlier catches.  Thistledew was part of a statewide stocking evaluation project (Study #635) during the period of high catch rates in which fryling were stocked at a rate of 150/littoral acre compared to a historical fry stocking rate of 1,000/surface acre.  Lengths ranged from 8.0 to 25.6 inches with an average length of 18 inches, which is similar to the 2008 average length of 17.3 inches.  Size structure appears favorable and similar to previous assessments.  Scale and bone analysis identified 9 age classes with fish from age 1 to 12 present.  Natural reproduction appears capable of maintaining a walleye fishery as 81% of the sample corresponded to non-stocked years.  The 2007 year class was well represented, comprising 26% of the aged sample.  Stocking has not occurred since 2005.  Back calculated length-at-age indicated growth was similar to the statewide average for all ages.  Walleye averaged nearly 17 inches by age 4. <br> \n\t <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 1.9/gill net, below the expected range.  Previous assessments have typically sampled pike below the lake class average.  Lengths ranged from 19.3 to 34.2 inches with an average length of 24.6 inches.  Size structure was moderate with 41% of the sample exceeding 24 inches.  Scale and bone analysis identified ages 2 through 6 present in the sample suggesting relatively consistent recruitment.  Back-calculated length-at-age determined growth was similar to the statewide average.  Northern pike typically exceeded 24 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at a rate of 0.8/trap net, within the expected range while the gill net sample (0.1/net) was lower than expected.  Previous catch rates have typically been inconsistent and variable.  Scale analysis identified one year class present in the sample (age 1) with an average length of 4.8 inches, suggesting a successful 2010 spawn. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 7.4/trap net.  Historically, catches have varied from 1.3 to 28.8 per trap net.  Lengths ranged from 3.2 to 7.8 inches with mean length of 5.7 inches.  Size structure was relatively poor with 25% of the sample exceeding seven inches and no fish above eight inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled at a rate of 4.4/gill net, near the lake class average, and slightly down from 9.2/gill net during the previous assessment.  Lengths ranged from 5.6 to 9.1 inches with an average length of 7.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test netting included largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker.  As part of IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) near shore sampling, Johnny darter, black crappie, blackchin shiner, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, brook stickleback, golden shiner, largemouth bass, and yellow perch were sampled in 10 seine hauls.  Backpack electrofishing sampled Iowa darter, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, and yellow perch in 10 stations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thistledew Lake is located five miles southwest of Togo, MN, and within the Little Fork River Watershed.  The lake is entirely within Thistledew game refuge and development is very low with one state owned campground on the north end and a MN Corrections camp on the east side.  The 318 acre lake has 73 littoral acres and a 45 foot max depth.  A state access is located on the northeast shore of the lake with parking available for six rigs.  Walleye and Black Crappie are primary management species while Northern Pike are considered a secondary management species.  Walleye were last stocked in 2005 and natural reproduction has maintained the population since.  The 2017 survey was one of ten surveys conducted since 1958, assessing the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate below what was expected for lakes similar to Thistledew and the previous assessment.  The catch was below the 2012 management goal of maintaining a gill net catch of 5.0/net with at least three year classes present through natural reproduction.  Higher catches were observed during periods of stocking and it appears natural reproduction alone is insufficient to reach management goals.  The five fish sampled had lengths from 18 to 25.6 inches.  Scale and otolith analysis identified three year classes with no fish prior to 2006 observed. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in both gill nets and trap nets at rates slightly lower than expected.  Previous catches have typically been variable.  Fish over ten inches were observed in both gears with the longest being 11.7 inches.  Black Crappie 2012 management goals of maintaining abundance at 0.5/trap net with fish over 10 inches present in the population were achieved.  Scale analysis identified ages 1 to 5 present and growth was fast, exceeding the statewide average for all ages.  Black Crappie averaged almost 10 inches by age four. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled within the expected range and similar to the previous assessment.  Size structure was favorable.  Lengths ranged from 15.9 to 38.6 inches with an average length of 23.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTo better assess Largemouth Bass, initial electrofishing was conducted at a rate of 72.6/hr on-time, indicating moderate abundance for Grand Rapids area lakes.  Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 18.0 inches with an average length of 11.2 inches.  Scale analysis identified ages 1 to 9 present indicating consistent recruitment.  Growth was slow, below the statewide average for five of the nine ages sampled.  Largemouth Bass averaged 14.3 inches by age 7. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were lower than expected, however past catches tended to be variable.  Lengths were small and likely of little interest to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.  One Smallmouth Bass (19 inches) was sampled for the first time. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thistledew Lake is a 318-acre lake in northeastern Itasca County located 30 miles north of Nashwauk, MN.  A state administered public access is located at the north end of the lake on Thistledew Rd. (County 551) off Highway 65.  The access has a cement ramp with parking for four rigs.  Thistledew Lake has a maximum depth of 45 ft and 23% of the lake is 15 ft or less.  The lake has low fertility.  The water is clear to light brown, resulting in visibility to a depth of 23 ft in mid-summer.  The depth of water at which oxygen levels limit fish presence was 26 ft in mid-summer.  One inlet on the western shore flows from Little Dew Lake while one outlet on the southwest shore flows into Moose Lake.  Other area lakes with similar habitat include Bluewater, Bello, Hartley, Loon, and Ruby.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 survey was the 13th survey of the fish community since 1958.  Surveys occur to monitor for changes in species composition, number, length distribution, and growth.  Gamefish species that are best suited for the lake are Walleye, Northern Pike, and Black Crappie.  No special regulations are present.   <br> \n  <br> \nThe Walleye population had a below average catch rate, an average length distribution, and above average growth.  Gill net catches were below average for the lake (1.9/net) and low compared to lakes with similar habitat.  The sampled Walleye ranged from 10 to 24 inches and averaged 16 inches.  The length distribution was average, as only 41% of Walleye exceeded 15 inches.  However, 29% exceeded 20 inches, and Walleye 25 to 27 inches have been sampled in six surveys.  Walleye ranged from age 2 to 11.  Growth rates were above the statewide average.  On average, Walleye took four years to exceed 15 inches.  Walleye have been stocked for many years because natural reproduction is limited, particularly in recent decades.  Twelve of the 17 Walleye sampled in 2020 were from stocked year classes, which is consistent with previous surveys.  The Walleye stocking guidelines recommend discontinuing stocking if it fails to produce a viable fishery supporting a catch rate of 2.0/gill net and perch catches are below 8/gill net.  Future of Walleye management will be considered based on these recommendations and data. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population had a low catch rate, average length distribution, and above average growth.  Gill net catches were below average for the lake and low compared to lakes with similar habitat.   However, higher catches are undesirable because they are usually associated with higher density populations having poor size structure and slow growth.  The sampled pike ranged from 13 to 31 inches and averaged 21 inches.  The length distribution was average, as 44% of pike exceeded 21 inches and 6% exceeded 28 inches.  However, pike over 30 inches were sampled in six surveys.  The largest fish sampled was a 38-inch fish in 2016, indicating the potential exists for producing larger pike.  Pike ranged from age 1 to 7.  Growth rates exceeded the statewide average.  On average, pike took four years to exceed 21 inches. The pike population may interest anglers and spearers due to its length distribution.  However, due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release pike over 26 inches and harvest up to 10 less than 22 inches to help maintain and improve size structure.  Spearers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike also.  Thistledew Lake is in the North-central Zone for pike management, which may contribute to modest improvements in size quality. <br> \n  <br> \nThe Black Crappie population had low catch rates and an above average length distribution.  Gill net catches were above average for the lake and low compared to lakes with similar habitat.   Only two crappie were sampled in 2020, which were 11 and 13 inches.  Only twice have the total number of crappie sampled by all gears exceeded eight fish.  Ten-inch fish were sampled in eight surveys, while 12-inch fish were sampled in three.  Therefore, the potential exists for producing larger crappie.  Growth rates from previous surveys were above average.  On average, crappie took four years to exceed eight inches.  Although the crappie population was lower in 2020, fish over 10 inches that interest anglers have been sampled in 62% of surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population had an average catch rate and length distribution in gill nets.  However, only seven bass were sampled with in 2020.  The most effective method to evaluate a bass population is spring night electrofishing, which has only occurred in 2016.  Electrofishing catches were twice the average for Grand Rapids area lakes.  The 97 bass sampled with electrofishing ranged from 3 to 17 inches and averaged 11 inches.  The length distribution was average, as 45% of bass exceeded 12 inches and 9% exceeded 15 inches.  The largest fish ever sampled was an 18-inch fish in 2016.  Bass ranged from age 1 to 9.  Growth rates were below the statewide average.  On average, bass took six years to exceed 12 inches.  Due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release bass exceeding 15 inches to help maintain or improve size structure. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population has consistently had low to average catch rates, length distributions, and growth.  Only 16 Bluegill were sampled in gill nets in 2020.  Bluegill populations are evaluated better with spring trap netting.  However, surveys on Thistledew Lake have occurred in August.  This timing likely results in lower trap net catches.  Trap net catches have been lower than those observed on lakes with similar habitat.  Length distributions from trap nets indicate the population has below average proportions of fish over 6 and 8 inches.  Growth was below the statewide average.  On average, Bluegill took six years to exceed six inches.  Due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release Bluegill exceeding 8 inches to help maintain or improve size structure. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population had a low catch rate.  The gill net catches were the lowest observed (1.1/net) and declined in each of the last three surveys.  Declining perch numbers are consistent with statewide trends that have occurred since the 1970s.  Reasons for statewide declines include increased predation by gamefish, higher Bluegill numbers resulting in perch having to share food resources, and loss of woody habitat along shorelines due to removal by property owners.  Lower perch numbers can limit the number of gamefish the lake can support.  The ten perch sampled ranged from 6 to 7 inches.  While 8-inch perch were sampled in the first eleven surveys, none were sampled in the last two.  Ten-inch perch have not been sampled since 1985.  Statewide Walleye stocking guidelines recommend discontinuing stocking if perch gill net catches fall below 8/net. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Rock Bass.   <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help slow the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thistledew Lake is 318 acres and is located 4 miles southwest of Togo, MN.  The only development on the lake is a boys camp and a state campground.  A public access is located on the north shore near the campground.  Water clarity is good with a Secchi disk reading of 13 ft.  The fish community is mainly comprised of walleye, northern pike, and black crappie.The walleye gill-net catch was 3.3/set which is within the range of similar lakes and is similar to the long-term average for Thistledew Lake.  Walleye growth is slower than average for the first three years, however after age three walleye growth is slightly faster than the statewide average.  Walleye reach 16 inches by age four and 22 inches by age eight.  Walleye size structure was good with an average length of 15 inches.Walleye stocking was reduced from every other year to every third year in 1994 to determine the extent of natural reproduction.  The majority of walleye sampled (79%) were from a stocked 1997 year class.  The gill-net catch in this assessment was equal to the highest gill net catch achieved in the last three assessments when walleye fry were stocked every other year.  Based on this assessment it appears that the current stocking strategy can maintain a quality walleye fishery. Beaver dams currently block the inlet stream from Little Thistledew Lake.  Potential exists to remove these dams and restore walleye spawning habitat.Black crappie abundance was 0.4/gill net and 0.7/trap net.  Both catch rates are near the low range for similar lakes and similar to the long-term average for Thistledew Lake.  Although abundance has historically been low, size structure is excellent with fish reaching 11 inches in this assessment.  Black crappie growth was slightly faster than statewide averages with fish reaching nine inches by age four.Northern pike gill-net catch was 3.3/set which within the range for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor few fish over 24 inches.    Bluegill trap-net catch was 10.6/set which lower than average for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with no fish larger than seven inches sampled.  Yellow perch gill-net catch was 12.4/set which is higher than average for similar lakes.  Size structure was also poor with no fish larger than 9 inches sampled.Smallmouth bass have not been sampled in any previous assessments, however, an angler reportedly caught smallmouth bass in 2000.  Other species sampled include largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker.Anglers can improve the size structure and abundance of the fish community by harvesting fish selectively and practicing catch and release.  Anglers should consider harvesting smaller fish and releasing larger fish which have escaped the early years of high natural mortality and have the potential to reach a quality size.  Releasing walleye greater than 19 inches, northern pike greater than 24 inches, and black crappie greater than 10 inches has the potential to improve the average size structure of these populations.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thistledew Lake is a class 23 lake located four miles southwest of Togo, MN.  The only development on the lake is a boys' camp and a state campground.  The public access is located on the north shore near the campground.  The lake management plan indicates the lake is primarily managed for walleye and black crappie with a secondary emphasis on northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThistledew Lake has been part of the fisheries research project F-26-R, Study 635, \u001cEvaluation of walleye stocking in 80-400 hectare Minnesota lakes.\u001d  The objective of the study is to determine which walleye stocking regime is most effective in moderate-sized lakes in Minnesota lake classes 23, 24, 25, and 31.  The study specifically evaluated walleye fry, small fingerlings, and three densities of large fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nThistledew Lake received walleye marked with oxytetracycline (OTC) in 2001, 2003 and 2005.  In 2001, fingerlings at a rate of 2 lbs/ littoral acre were stocked.  In 2003 and 2005 small fingerlings, typically called frylings, were stocked.  Frylings were stocked at a rate of approximately 150 per littoral acre.  The special assessment (gill nets only) conducted in 2004 and population assessment in 2006 were used to evaluate these stockings. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2004, walleye gill-net catch rates were the highest on record at 6.9 fish/net, exceeding the 3rd quartile of 5.0 fish/net.  In previous assessments, the walleye gill-net catch ranged from 1.2 to 6.7 fish/net.  Age analysis indicated eight year classes were sampled with age-4 fish representing 65% of the sample.  Age-4 fish corresponded to a 2000 fry stocking prior to the research study. The next strongest year-class was the natural 2002 year-class that represented 16% (10 fish) of the sample.  The 2001 stocking of 2 lbs of fingerlings/littoral acre and the 2003 stocking of small fingerlings only resulted in two fish (3%) from each of those years.  The growth rates were near average for 1 to 3 year old fish but above average for older fish compared to statewide averages.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 6.4 fish/gill net in 2006.  The catch exceeded the 3rd quartile for class 23 lakes and was near the highest catches ever recorded for Thistledew Lake.  Walleye ranged from 8.9 to 23.7 inches and averaged 15.3 inches.  Eight age classes were identified by scales and bony structures from age 1 to age 12.  Age-1 and age-4 fish represented 34 and 28 percent of the sample, respectively.  The age-1 fish corresponded to a marked fryling stocking in 2005 while the age-4 fish corresponded to a natural year class.  Age-6 walleye represented 14% of the sample and corresponded to a fry stocking in 2000 prior to the research study.  It appears fry, frylings, and natural reproduction each contributed to the sample but further investigation of the OTC marks will help determine how much was the result of natural or stocking. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates were 0.6/trap net and 0.1/gill net in 2006.  The catch rates have typically been below average for this lake class.  The mid to late summer sampling date may partially explain the lower catch rates because the fish are likely in areas that our standard sampling gears do not target.  The few fish collected in 2006 ranged from 5.5 to 11.1 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catch rates have been as low as 1.3 fish/net in 1976 to as high as 28.8 fish/net in 1985.  In 2006, the trap net catch of 10.7 fish/net was similar to the last three assessments.  Size structure has historically been poor with few fish reaching 8 inches in length.  Size structure remained poor in 2006; fish from 3.2 to 7.6 inches were sampled having a mean length of 4.9 inches.  Six age classes were identified from scales with fish from age 1 to age 6 represented.  Growth was similar to other class 23 lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from 1.8 to 4.8 fish/net since 1958.  In 2006, the catch of 2.3 fish/gill net was near the lake class 1st quartile.  The sampled northern pike ranged from 19.6 to 31.2 inches and averaged 23.9 inches.  Age-2 to age-10 fish were sampled with no dominant year classes.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for fish up to age 6 but slower for fish age 7 through 10. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and northern pike were collected for contaminant analysis during the 2006 assessment.  The bluegill sample included 10 fish having a mean length of 6.7 inches.  The mercury content was 0.061 ppm.  The Minnesota Department of Health recommends that pregnant women, women who may become pregnant, and children under age 15 should not have more than one meal/week of fish with mercury concentrations at this level.  Six northern pike from 20.7 to 29.8 inches were sampled for mercury and an average of 0.340 ppm was found.  For mercury concentrations at this level, the Minnesota Department of Health recommends that pregnant women, women who may become pregnant, and children under age 15 should not have more than one meal/month while all other people should limit their consumption to no more than one meal/week. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water\u0019s edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thistledew Lake has been part of a fisheries research project (Study #635) that is evaluating stocking regimes for walleye in four lake classes.  The statewide evaluation included fry, small fingerlings, and three densities of larger fingerlings.  As part of the evaluation, special assessments (gill net only) were conducted in 2004 and 2008, and a population assessment in 2006.  Thistledew Lake received OTC marked walleye in 2001, 2003, and 2005.  In 2001, walleye fingerlings rated at 13/pound were stocked at a density of 2 lbs. per littoral acre (LA), while about 11,000 frylings (150lbs./LA) were stocked in both 2003 and 2005. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch in 2008 was 7.3/gill net, above the lake class 3rd quartile.  Similarly, catch rates in 2004 and 2006 also exceeded the 3rd quartile.  The 2008 assessment had the highest observed catch.  Lengths ranged from 13 to 25 inches with a mean of 17.3 inches.  Size structure was moderate (PSD-15=80, RSD-20=23, RSD-25=0).  Age analysis indicated eight age classes with ages 2 through 9 present.  Age 3 fish were well represented, comprising 48% (n=32) of the sample.  The second largest age class was age 5, making up 17% (n=11) of the sample.  Age 7 fish made up 3% (n=2) of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nAges 3, 5, and 7 correspond to the stocking years of 2005, 2003, and 2001, respectively.  Distinguishing between stocked fish and natural reproduction can be determined with an OTC mark.  Otolith examination found a conclusive OTC mark on 31 of the 32 age 3 fish indicating that stocked fish dominated the 2005 year class in the sample.  Similarly, the 2005 year class was the strongest sampled in the 2006 assessment, comprising 34% (n=20) of the sample at age 1.  Of the 11 age 5 fish sampled, nine were analyzed for OTC marks.  Conclusive OTC marks were found on seven fish, one fish had no marks, and one was inconclusive.  The other two age 5 fish exceeded 20 inches and were not included as part of the study.  Again, it appears that stocking had a significant part of the 2005 year class.  Fish over 20 inches were not included in the study so the two age 7 (2001 year class) fish sampled were not analyzed for an OTC mark in 2008.  The high density fingerling stocking was not well represented in the 2006 or 2004 assessments either.  Only two fish were sampled from this year class in 2004 and none in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nFish without an OTC mark or year classes from a non-stocked year are considered to be from natural reproduction.  Ages 2, 4, 6, and 9 did not relate to a stocked year and combined were 27% of the sample.  These fish are assumed to be from natural reproduction.  Age 2 fish (2006 year class) made up 11% of the sample.  A strong natural 2002 year class was sampled in 2006 comprising 28% of the sample, the same year class represented 12% of the sample in 2008 (age-6).  Three age 8 fish were sampled from the 2000 year class.  This year class also contributed 14% of the 2006 sample, and 65% of the sample in the 2004 assessment.  Fry were stocked in 2000, but the contribution from that stocking cannot be determined. <br> \n <br> \nIt appears that Thistledew Lake has the potential to maintain a walleye population through natural reproduction, however fry and fryling stocking has contributed to year class strength.  Stocking may help in years with low natural reproduction, however it may also contribute to an artificially high population.  Catch rates have exceeded the lake class third quartile in the last three assessments. <br> \n</p>",

Spring night electrofishing was conducted to sample yearling walleye as part of a statewide fisheries research project (F-26-R, Study 635, \"Evaluation of walleye stocking in 80-400 hectare Minnesota lakes.\").  The objective of the study is to determine which walleye stocking regime (walleye fry, small fingerlings, and three densities of large fingerlings) is most effective in moderate-sized lakes in Minnesota lake classes 23, 24, 25, and 31.  The surface water temperature was 56 degrees F and water clarity was good.  Six 20 minute stations were sampled for a total on-time of 2.0 hours. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye frylings marked with oxytetracycline (OTC) were stocked in June of 2005.  In May of 2006, a total of 32 yearling walleye were collected for a catch rate of 16/hr on-time.  The fish ranged from 6.3 to 8.0 inches and had a mean length of 7.1 inches.  All the fish sampled had the OTC mark, indicating they were the result of stocking.</p>",

Age I and III, in particular, dominate the walleye sample, and coincide with years when walleye fry were stocked.  There also appears to be sporadic natural reproduction of walleyes in this lake.  Northern pike abundance at 4.8/gillnet is above the statewide mean but the average size is still good.  Age II northern pike comprise a large portion of the sample, with age II through VII represented.  Growth is good.  There appears to be a downward trend in gillnet CPUE for yellow perch.  In 1958 the gillnet catch for yellow perch was 50.9, in 1989 it was 4.0.  The bluegill trapnet CPUE at 15.0 is above the statewide average.  Growth is very slow, particularly for ages I-III.  Largemouth bass data is typically scanty, but shoreline seining indicates good reproduction of this species.</p>",
