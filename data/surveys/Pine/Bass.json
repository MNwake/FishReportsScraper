                "narrative": "<p>  Bass Lake has been part of the Acid Rain Intensive Lake Survey Program since 1988.  This program was initiated to monitor the biotic and chemical components of selected low pH lakes in Minnesota.  In July, 1991, a lake survey was conducted on Bass Lake.  To determine the status of the fish populations, two gillnets and four trapnets were set and two shoreline stations were seined.  Based on the results of these efforts the status of the fish populations compared to previous surveys and to lakes of the same classification statewide are described.\n  The northern pike net catch (4.00/set) was lower than the previous survey catch in 1988 (5.00/set).  This 1991 catch was lower than the statewide median catch (5.00/set) but falls within the first and third quartile range, 2.00/set and 8.20/set, respectively.  The northern pike captured ranged from 14.0 to 25.9 inches with a median length group of 21.0- 21.9 inches.  The mean weight was 2.21 pounds which is slightly above the statewide median weight for northern pike of this lake type (1.99 pounds).  Age analysis determined that these fish were from three to five years old.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were slightly lower than normal growth for northern pike throughout the state, indicating slightly below average growth.\n  The bluegill net catch (8.25/set) was well below the previous survey catch (56.00/set).  The 1991 catch was lower than the statewide median catch (19.75/set) but falls within the first and third quartile range, 7.75/set and 39.37/set, respectively.  The bluegills captured ranged from 3.5 to 6.9 inches with a median length group of 5.0-5.4 inches.  The mean weight was 0.11 pounds which is at the first quartile for statewide median weight for bluegills of this lake type (0.11 pounds).  Thus, indicating weights lower than average weights statewide.  Age analysis determined that these fish were from two to seven years old.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were below normal growth for bluegills statewide.  This indicates overall bluegill growth is on the slow and thin side of normal growth.  Seine hauls captured 9 young-of-year bluegills.\n  The black crappie net catch (2.00/set) was also down from the previous survey catch (5.66/set).  However, the 1991 catch was similar to the statewide median catch (2.08/set) and falls within the first and third quartile range, 0.81/set and 4.00/set, respectively.  The black crappies captured ranged from 6.0 to 9.9 inches with a median length group of 8.5- 8.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.29 pounds which is similar to the statewide median weight for black crappies of this lake type (0.30 pounds).  Age analysis determined that the fish were from four to seven years old.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were below normal growth for black crappies statewide.  Therefore, black crappies in Bass Lake grow slower than normal but maintain average size in weight.\n  Largemouth bass were not captured in gillnets or trapnets but 2 young-of-year were taken in the seine hauls.\n  Two other species were captured during the survey (yellow bullhead and brown bullhead).  Both species had net catches that fell within their respective first and third quartile ranges.\n</p>",

The northern population is average for its lake class in number and average weight, but this average weight (2.6 lbs.) is acceptable to many anglers.  Bluegills are abundant, but mostly fairly small.  Bluegill abundance has varied between surveys, and was below the median for the lake class in the 1991 survey.  Black crappies are average for the lake class.  The largemouth bass population appears to be small.  The current (1989) management plan calls for resurveys on a three year rotation, presumably ending with a 1997 survey.  These surveys have been conducted as part of the acid rain intensive survey program to monitor adverse impacts from acidic precipitation.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>IN JULY 1988 A LAKE SURVEY TOOK PLACE ON BASS LAKE THIS SURVEY WAS INITIATED, IN PART, FOR THE ACID RAIN INTENSIVE LAKE SURVEY PROGRAM COORDINA- TED BY THE MN PCA AND THE MN DNR. THE PROGRAM HAS THE INTENT TO MONITOR OF ACID DEPOSITION IN THE LAKE. GILLNETS AND TRAPNETS WERE SET ALONG WITH SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS TO ASSESS THE FISH POPULATION. AS INSTRUCTED BY MN PCA, FISH SAMPLES WERE NOT TO BE COLLECTED FOR ANALYSIS AT THAT TIME BASED ON RESPECTIVE LOCAL MEDIANS THE PRESENT FISH POPULATION IS AS FOLLOWS:  THE NORTHERN PIKE HAD A NET CATCH ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 16.0 TO 31.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 20.0  - 20.9 INCHES. THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 2.48 PDS. THE 14 FISH AGED WERE DISTRIBUTED FROM AGES II TO VI, WITH THEIR GROWTH RATES MAINTAINING NORMAL GROWTH WHEN COMPARED TO STATEWIDE AVERAGES. THE PREVIOUS SURVEY DID NOT USE GILLNETS FOR ASSESSING THE FISH POPUALTION, THEREFORE NET CATCH COMPARISONS COULD NOT BE MADE. IN THAT SURVEY, NORTHERN PIKE WERE NOT CAUGHT IN ANY OF THE SAMPLING GEAR USED. THE YELLOW PERCH NET CATCH WAS WELL BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THIS NET CATCH CONSISTED OF ONLY ONE YELLOW PERCH SAMPLED DURING THE SURVEY THE 1967 SURVEY SHOWED THE PRESENCE OF YELLOW PERCH WITH A TRAPNET CATCH OF 2.00/SET. IN BOTH SURVEYS, YELLOW PERCH WERE NOT TAKEN IN SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS. FUTURE SURVEY TESTING MAY PROVIDE A MORE CONCRETE DEFINITION RELATING TO THE LOW NUMBERS OF YELLOW PERCH IN BASS LAKE. THE LARGEMOUTH BASS NET CATCH WAS ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. ONE LARGEMOUTH BASS TAKEN IN THE GILLNETS WAS ALSO ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. OF ALL FISH CAUGHT, THEY RANGED FROM 5.0 TO 12.9 IN. INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 7.5 - 7-9 INCHES. MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.48 PDS AND AGE GROUP DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM I TO IV YEARS. SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF YOUNG-OF YEAR FISH. IN THE PREVIOUS SURVEY LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE NOT TAKEN IN SAMPLING GEAR USED. THE BLUEGILL SUNFISH NET CATCH HAS INCREASED SINCE THE PREVIOUS SURVEY AND WAS WELL ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRI- BUTION RANGED FROM 3.5 TO 9.4 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 6.0 - 6.4 INCHES. AGE GROUPS RE- REPRESENTED WERE FROM II - VIII YEARS. MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.16 PDS COMPARED TO 0.08 PDS IN 1967 WHERE THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP WAS 4.0-4.4 INCHES. SHORE- LINE SEINING IN AUGUST GATHERED ONLY ONE YOUNG-OF- YEAR. THIS COULD BE AN INDICATION OF BAD YEAR- CLASS RECRUITMENT. THE BLACK CRAPPIE NET CATCH WAS BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE GILLNET CATCH WAS ALSO BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRI- BUTION FROM BOTH GILLNETS AND TRAPNETS RANGED FROM 4.5 TO 11.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 5.0 - 5.4 INCHES. MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.18 PDS. THEY WERE NOT CATTURED IN SAMPLING GEAR USED IN 1967. BROWN BULLHEADS NET CATCH WAS ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THEIR LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRI- BUTION RANGED FROM 7.0 TO 10.9 INCHES. A TOTAL OF FOUR YELLOW BULLHEADS WERE CAPTURED IN TEST NET GEAR.</p>",
