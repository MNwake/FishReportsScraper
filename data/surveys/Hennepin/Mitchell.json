                "narrative": "<p>Mitchell Lake is a 112-acre Class 42 lake with a maximum depth of 19 feet.  The lake is within the city of Eden Prairie.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in even-numbered years since 2004.  Adults and fry have also been stocked occasionally.  Bluegill and Largemouth Bass were restocked following a 2010-11 partial winterkill.  The lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass, and secondarily for Northern Pike.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were highly abundant in 2015; the catch rate of 53.0 fish per trap net greatly exceeded the 75th percentile for this Lake Class.  Size structure revealed a population of small-sized individuals.  The average fish was 4.9 inches and 0.12 pounds.  The largest Bluegill in the trap net was 6.8 inches.  Only one Bluegill in the survey (sampled in a gill net) exceeded 7 inches, and it was 9.0 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were highly abundant and of quality size.  The 2015 catch rate of 22.5 fish per gill net is more than triple the 75th percentile for this Lake Class.  Eighty-four percent of the Northern Pike exceeded 21 inches, and the average size was 24.5 inches and 3.59 pounds.  Twenty-one percent of the fish exceeded 28 inches.  The largest fish was 34.3 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite recent and regular stockings, only two Walleye were sampled in the 2015 survey.  The fish were larger; one was 19.9 inches and the other was 26.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were caught at a rate of 4.9 per trap net, between the 25th percentile and median for this Lake Class.  The fish were smaller in size; the average fish measured 4.9 inches and 0.14 pounds.  Thirteen percent of Black Crappie exceeded 8 inches and the largest fish was 8.74 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were moderately abundant in the gill net sample; the catch rate of 35.0 fish per net is near to the median for this Lake Class.  Ninety-eight percent of the gill-netted fish exceeded 9 inches.  The average size was 10.4 inches and 0.7 pounds, and the largest Black Bullhead was 11.3 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes caught in lower abundance were Yellow Perch, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and Pumpkinseed.   <br> \n</p>",

NEARLY ALL OF THE BLB CAPTURED WERE BETWEEN 8.0 AND 9.9 INCHES. GSF GREATLY EXCEEDED STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS FOR BOTH TYPES OF SAMPLING GEAR.  THE AVERAGE RATE FOR THE GSF CAPTURED IN THIS ASSESSMENT WAS 5.5 FISH PER POUND.  ATER BEING SAMPLED AT A HISTORIC LOW IN 1990, BLGS WERE CAPTURED IN EXCESS OF MEDIAN LEVELS IN 1991.  THIS COULD BE DUE IN PART TO THE STOCKING OF 1640 ADULT BLG EARLIER IN THE YEAR. THE BLG SAMPLED AVERAGE 3.8 FISH PER POUND AND REPRESENT A PSD OF 89.13%.  ONLY ONE HSF WAS SAMPLED.  HOWEVER, WITH THE INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE OF BLG, HYBRIDIZATION CAN BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE AGAIN TO LEVELS PRESENT IN THE EARLY 1980'S.  LMB WERE SAMPLED IN EXCESS OF MEDIAN LEVELS FOR TRAPNETS.  HOWEVER ONLY ONE FISH WAS CAPTURED IN EXCESS OF 12.0 INCHES.  BASED ON THE NUMBER OF YOY INDIVIDUALS CAPTURED SHORELINE SEINING AND OBSERVED IN AND AROUND STANDS OF AQUATIC VEGETATION IN SHALLOW BAYS, LMB NATURAL REPRODUCTION WAS QUITE HIGH IN 1991.  ANALYSIS OF SCALE SAMPLES TAKEN FROM SAMPLED INDIVIDUALS INDICATE THAT GROWTH RATE FOR LMB IS WELL ABOVE AVERAGE.  ONE AGE VII+ WAE WAS CAPTURED VIA TRAPNET AND RELEASED.  BLC AND WHC WERE SAMPLED NEAR BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS.  THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN THE FOUR PREVIOUS FISH SURVEYS THAT THESE TWO SPECIES HAVE BEEN CAPTURED.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bluegill and black crappie are the most abundant fish species in Mitchell Lake.  Bluegill abundance appears to be down from 1999, but size is similar.  The mean length and weight in 1999 was 6.1 inches and 0.1 lb., respectively, and the mean length and weight in 2005 was 6.3 inches and 0.2 lb, respectively.  No bluegills sampled in 2005 trap nets were over 8 inches long and most fish were 3 and 4 years old (2001 and 2002 year class).Trap net catches of black crappie during this survey (8 fish per net) were similar to the 1999 survey (9 fish per net).  Likewise, size structure was similar.  Mean length was 7.7 in 1999 and 7.4 in 2005, with a majority of fish being 7-8.5 inches long.  Mean weight also remained unchanged at 0.2 lb with most fish being from the 2001-year class (4 years old).The current abundance of northern pike should provide good fishing in the coming years.  Gill net catches during this survey (14 per net) were the highest ever on record for this lake.  Ten fish were also caught in trap nets.  These numbers put Mitchell Lake twice as high as the upper 75% quartile range for class 42 lakes.  Fish up to 33 inches long were sampled with the mean length and weight of fish in gill nets being 27 inches and 5 lbs., respectively.  Growth was much above average, and most fish were the result of a 2001 year class (4 years old).Mitchell Lake will present limited angling opportunities for walleye.  Only three walleye (the largest being 17 inches) were sampled in both gill and trap nets, thus abundance appears to be low.  Other species sampled in minimal abundance include black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, and pumpkinseed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mitchell Lake is a 114-acre lake with a maximum depth of 19 feet.  The lake is within the city of Eden Prairie, and public boat access is provided on the southern end of the lake, at Miller Park.  A city ordinance restricts the size of motors in use on the lake to 10 horsepower.  Mitchell Lake is mostly shallow, with low water clarity and abundant vegetation.  Because of the lake's high fertility, in the summertime, dissolved oxygen levels become depleted in deeper water and fish will avoid the area.  In the summer of 2021, dissolved oxygen was low in depths greater than 10 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nMitchell is managed for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike.  A Standard Survey including trap nets, gill nets, and boat electrofishing was conducted in 2021 to monitor the fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were highly abundant in 2021, and their size tended to be small.  Fish lengths were between 2 and 8 inches, with the bulk of the fish measuring between 4.5 and 6.5 inches.  The largest Bluegill measured 7.5 inches.  Because they are highly abundant in the lake, Bluegill in Mitchell are likely competing with one another for food and that limits their growth.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled with nighttime boat electrofishing during the spring of 2021.  Good numbers of fish were sampled, and their size was also good.  Of the 86 fish sampled, the average size was 14.5 inches, 28% of the fish were larger than 18 inches, and the largest fish measured 20 inches.  Lily pads are abundant along the complex shoreline of Mitchell Lake, and the habitat is ideal for largemouth.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were highly abundant in the 2021 survey.  Twenty-four Northern Pike were sampled in 2 gill nets.  Fish lengths were between 16 and 32 inches, with a 25 inch average.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite stocking, Walleye have not become well established in Mitchell Lake, and only two of the fish were sampled in the 2021 survey.  The fish measured 10 and 24 inches in length.  Because Walleye haven't persisted in the lake, MN DNR has not stocked Mitchell Lake with Walleye since 2016.  In 2019, the Mitchell Lake Association stocked 500 fingerlings.   <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of Black Crappie were sampled in 2021.  Of the 128 fish sampled, 18% were larger than 8 inches, and the largest fish was 10.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes caught in lower abundance were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n</p>",
