                "narrative": "<p>Lost Lake is located in Wildwood Park within the city of Mahtomedi, south of County Road 244 and Old Wildwood Road. Lost lake (lake class 36) has nine surface acres and a maximum depth 26 feet. In 1987 Lost first came under DNR Fisheries management as kids fishing pond. The Fishing in The Neighborhood program (FiN) currently manages the fishery. A connection to White Bear Lake exists during normal water levels and can provide a mode for immigration and emigration to and from Lost Lake. Approximately 25% of the total lake shore is within the park and a fishing pier provides access to the lake for anglers. Lost provides opportunities for shorefishing to anglers that don't own a boat or have access to shoreline on White Bear Lake. The lake supports a very diverse population of native aquatic plants and all efforts should be made to protect this diversity from invasive species such as Eurasian watermilfoil. The lake experiences winterkill conditions occasionally, which can affect angling success in successive years. Aquatic vegetation can be dense and become problematic at times around the fishing pier.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most abundant species observed in the 2017 survey but they are still below average in abundance for lakes similar to Lost Lake. The average size is less than 5 inches and is considerably less than past surveys where average size was over 6 inches. Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish were also found in below average numbers for lakes like Lost. Hybrid Sunfish had an average size of 7.0 inches and Pumpkinseed a 5.3 inch average. Northern Pike had an average size of 16.5 inches and can be found in slightly above average abundance. The Northern Pike population has decreased considerably since the last survey when they could be found in very high abundance. Black Bullheads were found in below average abundance for lakes similar to Lost Lake. Other fish sampled in low number were two Green Sunfish. <br> \n</p>",

Ten fish species were caught in five trapnets during the 1993 survey, the first netting conducted on Lost Lake.  Black bullhead abundance was high (94.2/trapnet).  Northern pike were abundant (4.0/trapnet), however, average size was small (13.0 inches).  Both black and white crappies were sampled and ranged in length from 6.1 to 8.3 inches.  Hybrid sunfish abundance was normal (3.4/trapnet), while pumpkinseed abundance was low (0.6/trapnet).  Catches of bluegill, bowfin, golden shiner, and green sunfish were low, with only one fish of each species being sampled.</p>",

The lake has been managed as a Kids Fishing Pond since 1987 and is currently managed by the Fishing In the Neighborhood Program. Panfish stocking occurs on an annual basis and additionally fish can migrate into the lake from White Bear Lake.Bluegill were the most abundant fish species sampled in the 2005 survey. Their numbers have increased over time presumably due to the annual stockings. The majority of the fish sampled were between 6 and 7 inches long.  Black crappie were present but in low numbers and were small (5.5 inch average size). Northern pike had an average size of 19.8 inches and were present in moderate numbers.  Other fish sampled included black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker and common carp. Largemouth bass were not sampled but were stocked and have been caught by anglers. </p>",

In addition to our panfish stocking, it is presumed that fish find their way into Lost Lake from White Bear Lake.At the present time the fish population consists primarily of northern pike and bluegill.  Several Northern pike were sampled but were small(8-21\") and the bluegill were few in number but of a good average size.  The majority are 6.5-7.0\".  Other fish species present were black bullhead, bowfin(dogfish), hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead.  These species were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lost Lake is located in Wildwood Park within the city of Mahtomedi. Approximately 25% of the total lake shore is within the park and a fishing pier provides access to the lake for anglers. Lost Lake (Lake class 36) is nine acres and has a maximum depth of 26 feet.  In 1987 Lost first came under DNR Fisheries management as a kids fishing pond. The Fishing in The Neighborhood program (FiN) currently manages the fishery. Previous population assessments have been conducted in 1993, 1998 and 2005. A connection to White Bear Lake exists during normal water levels and can provide a mode for immigration and emigration to and from Lost Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were abundant in the 2012 survey, though their numbers have decreased since the last survey in 2005. The average size (6-7 inch) has remained similar to past surveys. For Lost Lake, annual stocking of bluegill has the most influence on their relative abundance. Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were also found in Lost Lake in moderate abundance with hybrid sunfish having an average size of over 6.5 inches. Northern pike had an average size of 15.2 inches but are found in high number. The abundance of northern pike has increased considerably since the last survey.  Largemouth bass can be found in moderate numbers as well but are very slow growing in Lost Lake when compared to statewide averages. Black bullheads were found in average abundance for lakes similar to Lost Lake. Other fish sampled in low number include yellow perch, green sunfish and bowfin. One walleye was sampled during this survey and it most likely moved into Lost Lake from White Bear Lake. <br> \n</p>",
