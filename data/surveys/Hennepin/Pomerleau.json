Largemouth bass were also sampled at high levels. However they only averaged 4.9 inches in length. Black crappies and black bullheads were sampled in average numbers. The mean length of the black crappies was only 5.7 inches. The bluegill population was found to be low. Of those bluegills sampled, the average weight per fish was nearly one half of a pound. Their mean length was 7.7 inches. All of the land around Pomerleau Lake is privately owned.     </p>",
