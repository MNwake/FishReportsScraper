                "narrative": "<p>Hungry Jack Lake is part of a cluster of medium sized easily-accessed lakes about 30 road miles from Grand Marais.  It is a moderately developed lake, with two resorts and several cabins on its shores.  The lake lacks a public boat launch; public access is limited to a carry-down trail.  Nevertheless, use of this lake by anglers has been fairly high, historically. <br> \n <br> \nIn the current (2014) lake management plan (LMP) primary and secondary management species in Hungry Jack Lake are Walleye and Smallmouth Bass.  The long range goal for Walleye is a population with a minimum gill net catch of 3.0 fish/set, with no size goal set.  The goal for Smallmouth Bass is to maintain a minimum proportional size distribution (PSD; stock = 7 in, quality = 11 in) of 50 for fish taken by angling, with a minimum gill net catch of 1.0 fish/set.  The Smallmouth Bass population in this lake has been managed under special regulations since 1996; first an 11-inch maximum size limit, then a 12-inch maximum size limit, and now (since 2018), a 14-inch maximum size limit, with the harvest of one fish over 20 inches allowed.  The 2020 survey was the second of three scheduled in the 2014 LMP to determine whether an increase in the walleye stocking rate that began in 2005 had resulted in an increase in walleye gill net catches, and to evaluate the 2018 change in the Smallmouth Bass regulation.  The first survey was completed as planned in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers appeared to have been fairly high in 2020, as did the average size of Walleye taken in gill nets and trap nets.  The Walleye gill net catch goal was met in 2020, as it was in 2016.  Walleye taken in gill nets in 2020 ranged in length from 10.8 to 25.6 inches, with about a third of the catch over 20 inches.  Nine year classes (fish 3-12 years old) were included in the catch.  Natural year classes apparently produced in 2016, 2014, and 2010 contributed a few fish to the catch, but years in which fingerlings were stocked accounted for 86% of the Walleye taken in this survey.  Some of those fish may have been naturally produced, but consistent higher strengths of stocked year classes indicated stocking since 2009 had contributing substantially to the walleye population.  Walleye growth had been average or better for the area; fish reached a mean length of 17.6 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to an area average of 16.5 inches.  Good Walleye growth was likely due to the presence of fairly high numbers of Yellow Perch, and access to a Rainbow Smelt forage base of unknown size. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey provided more evidence that stocking Walleye fingerlings at a higher rate (1.0 lb/littoral acre/year) since 2005 had resulted in a modest increase in Walleye abundance in this lake.  Stocked year classes apparently made fairly strong contributions to catches in 2016 and 2020.  As a result catches in both years met the Walleye goal in this lake for the first time since 2001. <br> \n <br> \nHungry Jack Lake continued to support a high-quality Smallmouth Bass population in 2020.  The gill net catch goal was not met in 2020, but it was clear from gill and trap net length distributions that the lake was still producing good numbers of larger Smallmouth Bass.  The mean weight for Smallmouth Bass taken in gill nets in 2020 (2.47 lb/fish) was the highest ever seen in this lake historically, mainly because no fish under 14 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of larger-than-average sized Northern Pike were present in Hungry Jack Lake in 2020.  The Northern Pike gill net catch was close to the median for a Class 3 lake, was similar to the catch seen in 2016, and was one of the higher catches observed in this lake since 1984.   All of the Northern Pike taken in gill nets were over 20 inches in length, and most were over 24 inches (up to 32.8 inches).   <br> \n <br> \nHungry Jack is one of just a small number of lakes in this area supporting significant Bluegill populations.  Bluegill appeared to have been abundant in 2020, with enough larger fish present to drive some good fishing.  The 2020 Bluegill trap net catch was well above the third quartile for the lake class, and was by far the highest ever seen in this lake.  About 19% of Bluegill sampled in trap nets exceeded six inches in length, and several fish over eight inches were sampled.  A few Hybrid Sunfish were also sampled in 2020, and some of those fish also exceeded eight inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were fairly abundant in Hungry Jack Lake in 2020, although most were small.  The Yellow Perch gill net catch was one of the higher catches seen in this lake since 1988, and was above the normal range for a lake of this type.  Although not supporting much angling opportunity, Yellow Perch were important as a key component of the forage base for Walleye and Northern Pike in this lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hungry Jack Lake has good numbers of walleye with many age classes present.  Average size of walleye collected in 2001 was excellent.  Stocked years are represented more heavily than unstocked years.  Despite the good walleye populations often seen in this lake, walleye fishing can be notoriously difficult.  Tough fishing may be due in part to the presence of a rainbow smelt forage base.  Walleye anglers may need to fish a variety of structure, with a variety of methods, to be successful.An experimental regulation was enacted for smallmouth bass, beginning in 1996, to increase the number of large bass available to anglers.  All smallmouth bass over 11 inches must be released.  The regulation has not had an obvious effect on the catch of bass during DNR assessments, but the 2001 survey showed a good percentage of bass over 14 inches.There are good numbers of bluegill in Hungry Jack Lake, but their average size is fairly small.  A good bluegill population is unusual for lakes in this area.Small numbers of northern pike and lake trout occur in the lake, but probably don't provide much of a fishery.Rainbow smelt and yellow perch occur in fairly high numbers and provide good forage for larger predators like walleye, lake trout, and northern pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hungry Jack Lake is managed for walleye and smallmouth bass.  The long range goal for walleye is a population with a minimum gill net catch of 3.0 fish/set.  The goal for smallmouth bass is to maintain a fishery where half of the stock-sized fish caught by anglers (seven inch or larger fish) are 11 inches or larger, and a population with a minimum gill net catch of 1.0 fish/set.  The smallmouth bass population in this lake is managed under a special regulation:  all fish 12-inches or larger must be released, except that one fish over 20 inches may be kept.  This was the second of two assessments scheduled in the 2005 lake management plan.  Objectives for those assessments were to determine whether an increase in the walleye stocking rate (doubled beginning in 2005) resulted in increased walleye abundance, and to determine the effect of the smallmouth bass regulation change implemented in 2004 (increased maximum size limit from 11 to 12 inches).  The current plan will be reviewed and revised in March 2014. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2012, Clean Water Legacy funding allowed areas across the state to do some nearshore fish community sampling to improve our ability to use a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) to identify disturbed aquatic ecosystems.  Hungry Jack Lake was selected for nearshore sampling because its accessibility allowed for use of the sampling gears required. <br> \n <br> \nHungry Jack Lake supported modest numbers of medium-sized walleye in 2012.  The walleye catch goal for this lake had not been met in the last two assessments (2004 and 2008), and was not met in 2012.  The increase in the walleye stocking rate, to 386 lb of fingerlings per stocking, beginning in 2005, did not result in an increase in walleye gill net catches in 2008 or 2012, compared to previous years.  However, lower catches may have been observed had the lake not been stocked.  Stocked year classes accounted for 13 of the 18 walleye taken in gill nets and trap nets.  Small natural year classes had apparently been produced in two years (2010 and 2008).  Growth of young walleye had been close to average.  Three-year-old fish reached a mean length of 12.1 inches at the end of their third year, compared to a mean of 11.7 inches in similar lakes in the area. <br> \n <br> \nAttainment of the size goal for smallmouth bass could not be directly measured in this assessment, since angling was not used to sample the population.  Too few fish were taken in gill nets and trap nets to allow us to say that the goal might have been met based on the sizes of those fish.  The gill net catch goal for smallmouth bass was not met in 2012; only one fish was taken, resulting in the lowest catch ever seen in this lake.  The trap net catch was also low, although it did fall within the normal range for the lake class.  Higher numbers of small smallmouth bass were collected in quarter-inch-mesh trap nets and backpack electrofishing gear used for nearshore fish community sampling, so there appeared to have been no danger of the population being lost.  <br> \n <br> \nThe low northern pike gill net catch in 2012 was not unusual for this lake, where the species has appeared in assessment catches only sporadically.  No young northern pike were collected in 2012, suggesting reproductive success had been very low. <br> \n   <br> \nHungry Jack Lake is one of very few lakes in Cook County to support a significant bluegill population.  Bluegill were abundant in 2012, and some were large enough to have been of interest to anglers.  The bluegill catch in 0.75-in-mesh trap nets exceeded the normal range for that gear, while the mean weight for bluegill taken in trap nets was about average for a lake of this type.  A third of the bluegill taken in trap nets were six inches or greater in length.  The bluegill catch was dominated by a strong 2009 year class that accounted for 69% of the trap net catch.  Despite their high numbers, growth of three-year-old fish had been close to average for the area; their mean length at the end of their third year (4.8 inches) was close to the area average of 4.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSampling of the nearshore fish community was done using quarter-in-mesh trap nets, a 15-ft beach seine, and backpack electrofishing gear.  Prior to sampling done in 2012, Hungry Jack Lake was known to have supported, at various times, walleye, smallmouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, bluegill, yellow perch, white sucker, northern pike, rainbow smelt, lake trout, sculpin, splake, rainbow trout, golden shiner, black crappie, central mudminnow, johnny darter, and coho salmon.  Nearshore sampling  in 2012 added no new species to that list. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hungry Jack Lake is currently managed for Walleye and Smallmouth Bass (2014 Lake Management Plan).  The long range goal for Walleye is a population with a minimum gill net catch of 3.0 fish/set, with no size goal set.  The goal for Smallmouth Bass is to maintain a population where half the fish over eight inches in length taken by angling are also over 11 inches in length.  The Smallmouth Bass population in this lake is managed under a special regulation:  all fish 12-inches or larger must be released, except that one fish over 20 inches may be kept.  This was the first of three standard surveys scheduled in the 2014 lake management plan to evaluate Walleye stocking in this lake.  The 2016 survey was also done to help determine whether a relaxation of the Smallmouth Bass regulation in 2004 resulted in any decline in the quality of the bass population. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were fairly high in 2016, and their average size was good.  The Walleye catch goal was met for the first time since 2001.  Walleye taken in gill nets ranged in length from 6.9 to 25.4 inches, with most in the 12-18-inch range.  Ten year classes contributed to the catch, including four that were apparently produced naturally.  However, the two year classes that contributed the most fish to the catch (2013 and 2011) had both been supplemented, if not produced, by fingerling stocking in those years. Walleye growth had been about average for the area; fish reached a mean length of 16.4 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to an area average of 16.0 inches.  Good Walleye growth was likely due to the presence of fairly high numbers of Yellow Perch, and access to a Rainbow Smelt forage base of unknown size.  A creel survey done on Hungry Jack Lake over the summer of 2016 found Walleye anglers enjoying some success. <br> \n <br> \nAttainment of the size goal for Smallmouth Bass could not be directly measured in this survey, since angling was not used to sample the population.  However, during the 2016 creel survey an estimated 2,113 eight-inch or larger fish were caught by anglers, of which 60% were 11 inches or larger.  Almost all Smallmouth Bass bass caught by anglers in 2016 were released, regardless of their size.  The bass catch goal was met in 2016, since gill net sets yielded a catch of 1.33 fish/set.  That catch was not unusually high for this lake, even though it was near the top of the normal range for a lake of this type.  The mean weight for Smallmouth Bass taken in gill nets (1.89 lb/fish) was the highest ever seen in this lake historically.  Ten year classes (and fish up to 15 years old) contributed to the 2016 catch, although none appeared to have been particularly strong.  Recruitment may have been low, since no fish younger than four years were taken in any sampling gear used.  Smallmouth Bass growth had been slow; fish reached a mean length of 7.6 inches at the end of their fourth year, compared to an area average of 9.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of Northern Pike were found in Hungry Jack Lake in 2016, and those fish were above average in size.  The 2016 Northern Pike gill net catch was one of the higher catches observed in this lake since 1984.  Most of the fish taken were over 24 inches in length.  Six year classes contributed to the catch, but none appeared to have been strong, and few fish younger than four years were taken.  Northern Pike growth had been slow; by the end of their third year fish reached an average length of 16.4 inches, compared to an area mean of 18.8 inches.  Anglers interviewed during the 2016 creel survey reported catching only a few Northern Pike, and reported releasing all they caught. <br> \n <br> \nHungry Jack is one of just a small number of lakes in this area that support significant Bluegill populations.  Bluegill were abundant but small in 2016.  The trap net catch was above the normal range for a lake of this type, and was the second highest ever seen in this lake.  Most of the Bluegill taken in trap nets were under six inches in length, although fish up to eight inches were sampled.  The high catch appeared to be the result of a strong 2012 year class that accounted for 67% of fish taken, with lengths at capture that ranged from 3.7 to 6.3 inches.  In all, six year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the 2016 catch.  Bluegill growth had been slow; after four years fish reached a mean length of just 4.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were fairly abundant in Hungry Jack Lake in 2016, although most were too small to have been of much interest to anglers.  The Yellow perch gill net catch was the highest seen in this lake since 1988, and was well above normal for a lake of this type.  Although no Yellow Perch were aged, their length distribution suggested the high catch may have been due to the presence of one unusually strong year class, five to six inches in length in 2016. <br> \n</p>",

Several year classes were identified, but it was not clear from this small sample whether recent stocking of fingerlings (in odd years) had contributed significantly to the catch.The smallmouth bass catch was normal for this lake and for the lake class.  Bass were larger than average for the lake, but about average in size for the lake class.  Several year classes were present.Three lake trout were caught.  All were yearlings that had been stocked in spring 2004.  Yearlings had also been stocked in 2002 and 2000, but these fish were not caught in 2004.  The stocking is an attempt to re-establish lake trout in this lake.The catch of northern pike was the highest observed in recent assessments in this lake, and was slightly above average for the lake class.  Northern pike were smaller than usual for the lake, and smaller than average for the lake class.  Several year classes were present.  Pike had grown faster than average for the lake class.  Age-3 fish had averaged 18.7 inches long at the end of their third year, compared to the lake-class average of 16.8 inches for the same age.Yellow perch abundance appeared to be low for the lake, but was normal for the  lake class.  The average size was typical for the lake.  The largest fish measured 10.6 inches, but most were less than 9.5 inches.Rainbow smelt numbers have fluctuated widely, and were low at the time of this assessment.Bluegill abundance appeared to be typical for this lake, but was higher than average for the lake class.  Bluegill were small and grew slowly; all were less than 7 inches long.A small number of green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and white sucker were also caught.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hungry Jack Lake supported modest numbers of walleye in 2008, most of which were in the 13 to 15-inch size range.  The walleye gill net catch fell within the normal range for a Class 3 lake, but it failed to meet the long range goal in the current lake management plan (3.0 fish/net).  The 2008 walleye gill net catch was higher than the catch observed in the last assessment (2004), but it was lower than catches observed in assessments done in 1984-2001.  Most of the walleye taken in 2008 were three-year-old fish, and were likely survivors of the 2005 fingerling stocking.  There was little evidence of any natural reproduction.  Growth rates for three-year-old walleye collected in 2008 had been fast. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have rarely been taken in Hungry Jack Lake, and have generally not been an important part of the fishery.  Although the 2008 gill net catch was below the first quartile for the lake class, it was actually one of the higher catches seen in this lake historically.  Northern pike collected in 2008 were large, and all were old.  Reproductive success appeared to have been very limited. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass in Hungry Jack Lake are managed under a special regulation.  All fish 12 inches or larger must be immediately released, except that one fish over 20 inches may be kept.  The 2008 smallmouth bass gill net catch was typical of catches seen in this lake since 1997.  Although few smallmouth bass were taken, the lake did seem to support a high quality population in 2008.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 assessment provided another indication that lake trout stocking in Hungry Jack Lake failed completely.  Many of the gill net sets used in 2008 sampled waters cool enough to support lake trout, but none were taken. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch in trap nets in 2008 was within the normal range for a Class 3 lake, but bluegill are rare in Cook County, and Hungry Jack lake actually supports one of the largest populations in the area.  As has been the case in past assessments, bluegill taken in 2008 were small; no fish larger than eight inches were taken, and most fish taken in trap nets were smaller than six inches.   <br> \n <br> \nForage for walleye and northern pike was provided by a modest yellow perch population, and by rainbow smelt.  Smelt are generally too small to be taken in standard gill net sets, and the failure to take any in 2008 was not unusual. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Stocking appeared to contribute most to the walleye population, although     a few fish were produced naturally.  Walleye growth was fairly fast by local standards, probably due to an excellent forage base     consisting of rainbow smelt and yellow perch.  Smallmouth bass were also relatively abundant, and some larger fish were present.  Five-     year-old smallmouth bass accounted for 53% of the bass collected, and averaged 11.5 inches in length at the time of the assessment.  No     northern pike were collected in the 1994 assessment or in the 1994 summer creel survey, and a 1992 stocking of northern pike appeared to     have been a failure.  Yellow perch were abundant, and some were large enough to be of interest to anglers.  Bluegill were relatively     abundant, but the fish were generally too small to be of much interest to anglers.  The rainbow trout collected in the 1994 assessment     came from nearby Leo Lake, a Designated Stream Trout Lake.</p>",

It appeared that the population was largely supported by stocking, although some natural reproduction had occurred.  Walleye growth had been fast by area standards, probably due to the presence of a rainbow smelt forage base.The catch of smallmouth bass in gill nets and trap nets was low for this lake historically, although the fish taken were relatively large.  More smallmouth bass were collected by electrofishing, including several smaller fish missed by the other gears.  Smallmouth bass growth had been slow by area standards.  Reproduction appeared to have been good in most years, although the 1992 year class was weak or missing.Catches of yellow perch, bluegill, and green sunfish were low for this lake.  </p>",
