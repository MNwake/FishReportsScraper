Night electrofishing was conducted on May 22, 2006 to determine the over-winter survival of fingerlings stocked at a rate of 2 lbs/littoral acre in the fall of 2005, as part of a state wide research project to evaluate several different stocking strategies.  Six 20-minute stations were selected similar to the 2002 special assessment.  A Smith-Root GPP 5.0 electrofishing boat equipped with a spider array anode using pulsed DC current was used for the assessment, operating at 5 amps and 200 volts.  The temperature of the water was 14.3 C (57.7 F), conductivity was 203 umhos, and visibility was good. <br> \n <br> \nTwo yearling walleye were captured in the assessment, 5.3 and 5.4 inches, at a rate of 1.1 per hour (on-time).  The catch rate was similar to the 2004 assessment of 1.0 fish/hour on-time, but those fish were twice as long (stocked 3.3 fish/pound) as the fish sampled in 2006 (stocked 35 fish/pound) and only one was a yearling.  Following research guidelines, the sampled fish were sent in to analyze for oxytetracycline to differentiate between natural reproduction and stocking. <br> \n</p>",

There is one inlet from Forest Lake and Jack the Horse Lake, and one outlet to Rice Lake and ultimately the Rice River.  Johnson Lake has suitable habitat to produce moderate populations of Northern Pike and panfish, and has a low-density Walleye population supported by stocking. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan (LMP) was last revised in 2009.  Walleye were considered primary management species because of annual fry stocking.  Northern Pike, Black Crappie and Bluegill were considered secondary management species.  A standard survey was conducted in 2018 to assess the status of the fish community and the effectiveness of Walleye fry stocking. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill-net catch was typical for the lake and lakes with similar habitat.  Four year classes were identified with age 4 fish the most frequently sampled.  All fish corresponded to stocked years, although nine of the previous ten years were stocked.  Sampled Walleye ranged from 15 to 28 inches with an average length of 20 inches.  Growth was average; Walleye averaged 16 inches at age 4.  Johnson Lake provides anglers the opportunity to catch an occasional Walleye, though they are not abundant. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill-net catch was average compared to similar lakes and had decreased from the three previous surveys.  This is considered an improvement, since Northern Pike size quality is generally better when they occur at lower densities.  Northern Pike size structure was still fairly poor; sampled pike ranged from 18 to 29 inches with an average length of 22 inches.  Ages 2-8 were represented in the sample, with age 3 and 4 fish the most frequently sampled.  Pike averaged 21 inches at age 4.  Poor size quality may limit the popularity of the pike fishery.  The north central pike zone regulation implemented in 2018 requires anglers to release pike from 22-26 inches, while allowing for more harvest of small pike.  It is hoped that this regulation will improve size quality on Johnson Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch for Bluegill was the highest on record, but within the typical range for lakes with similar habitat.  A trend of increased Bluegill catches has been noted in many area lakes in recent years and is consistent with statewide trends.  Size structure was modest.  Sampled Bluegill ranged from 3 to 9 inches with an average length of 5 inches.  The age distribution suggested frequent but irregular recruitment.  Ages 3-10 were represented, with ages 3, 6 and 7 the most frequently sampled.  About half the sample was age 6 or older, with average growth.  Bluegill averaged 6.5 inches at age 6.  Poor size quality may limit the popularity of the Bluegill fishery. <br> \n <br> \nJohnson Lake has generally produced a modest crappie fishery.  Gill-net catches have typically exceeded trap-net catches over time.  The 2018 gill-net catch was typical for the lake and lakes with comparable habitat.  The size and age distributions suggested irregular recruitment and a population composed of mostly young fish under age 5.  Sampled crappie ranged from 5 to 10 inches.  Growth appeared slow; crappie averaged 7.5 inches at age 4. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers have been quite variable, but generally above the average for similar lakes.  The 2018 gill-net catch for Yellow Perch was the lowest on record and below the typical range for lakes like Johnson.  A low perch population is likely a limiting factor for production of gamefish like Northern Pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe Tullibee gill-net catch was typical for Johnson Lake but lower than average compared to lakes with similar habitat.  Sampled Tullibee range from 11 to 14 inches.  Tullibee are an important prey species in addition to Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nStandard test netting is generally not an effective way to evaluate Largemouth Bass.  Largemouth have been sampled in low numbers in previous surveys, and catches in 2018 were within the typical range for similar lakes.  Targeted spring electrofishing would likely provide better information on the bass population, but it has not been conducted on Johnson. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included Bowfin, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Johnson Lake is a small, 305 acre, infertile lake located two miles north of Marcell.  The lake has a user developed access on the south side of the lake off U.S.F.S. road 2182.  The management plan indicates northern pike and walleye as the primary species of management with bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch as secondary species.  The northern pike catch declined from 12.2 fish/net in 1993 to 4.3 fish/net in 2000.  Northern pike catch rates have varied from 2.4 to 12.2 fish/net since 1969.  Moderate northern pike population levels are more desirable because they generally have better size distributions.  In contrast, high population levels often are associated with slow growth, high natural mortality and smaller size distributions.  The fish sample in 2000 ranged from 15.4 to 31.8 inches and averaged 20.9 inches.Since 1969, walleye catch rates have ranged from 1.0 to 6.7 fish/net.  In 2000, the catch was 1.7 fish/net which falls below the management goal to exceed 2.4 fish/net.  Walleye have been stocked as fry in 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1997.  Four year classes were identified with fish sampled from age 2 to age 7.  Seventy percent of the fish corresponded to a fry stocking in 1997 and all other fish were aged from years with no stocking.  The fish ranged from 12.0 to 21.1 inches and had an average length of 13.7 inches.  Walleye averaged 13.8 inches after four years of growth which was below the statewide average of 15.1 inches.The bluegill population has always been relatively low in Johnson Lake.  The bluegill trap-net catch rate was 4.0 in 2000 which is about average for the lake.  Fish ranged from 3.1 to 6.9 inches with an average length of 4.1 inches.  Scales were not collected during the 2000 assessment so growth and age information is not available.Night electrofishing is the most effective way to sample largemouth bass because they tend to avoid our more traditional nets. Therefore, the largemouth bass population is somewhat of an unknown for the lake since they have never been sampled with spring electrofishing. Yellow perch catch rates have ranged from a low of 2.4 fish/net in 1969 to a high of 22.5 fish/net in 1993.  In 2000, the catch declined to 11.8 fish/net.  However, when compared to other lakes similar to Johnson, the catch was above average.  Fish ranged 5.3 to 8.4 inches and had a mean length of 6.2 inches.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural, forestry or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these can be areas of concern, lakeshore property owners may also contribute to water quality problems.  Some examples include putting in sand beaches, removing shoreline trees and vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Proper land use practices by everyone will help insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Johnson Lake has been part of a fisheries research project (Study #635) that is evaluating stocking regimes for walleye in four lake classes.  The evaluation included fry, small fingerlings, and three densities of larger fingerlings.  As part of the evaluation, special assessments (gill net only) were conducted in 2002, 2004, and 2006, and the 2008 population assessment was also included.  Johnson Lake received OTC marked walleye fingerlings in 2001, 2003, and 2005.  In 2001, walleye fingerlings rated at 13/pound were stocked at a density of 1 lbs. per littoral acre (LA), in 2003 fingerlings 3.3/pound were stocked at 2lbs./LA, and in 2005 fingerlings 35/pound were stocked at 0.5lbs./LA.  The greatest numbers of walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2005, even though the stocking rate was the lowest. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate in 2008 was 1.7/gill net, which was at the lower end of the expected range.  This is a modest increase from the 2006 assessment (1.3/net).  Lengths ranged from 11-22 inches with a mean of 15 inches.  Of the 10 fish sampled in gill nets, nine were aged.  Six of these fish were age 3 and had an OTC mark indicating they were stocked.  The remaining three were age 8 from the 2000 year class, which was a fry stocked year.  The fry in 2000 were not treated with OTC and the contribution from that stocking cannot be determined.  Growth was similar to the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nIt appears that the small fingerling stocking, even at a low density, was better at establishing a year class in Johnson Lake.  Similar to the previous assessment, no fish were sampled from the large fingerling/high density stocking that occurred in 2003.  While no fish were sampled from the moderate fingerling density in 2008, one was sampled in 2006, and two were sampled in 2004.  Fisheries research staff will analyze the data for all the lakes involved to determine the most effective stocking regime. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at the upper end of the expected range.  Catch rates from previous assessments tended to be variable with rates at either the high end or low end of the expected range.  Lengths ranged from 15-29 inches with a mean of 20 inches.  Size structure was poor with only four fish exceeding 24 inches in the sample.  Scale and bone analysis indicated six year classes with fish age 2 through 7 present.  Growth was similar to the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate near the middle of the expected range.  Previous rates have never been observed within the expected range.  Lengths ranged from 3.5-8.7 inches with a mean of 6.1 inches.  Black crappie were sampled above the expected range, however most lengths were typically small, eight inches or less. <br> \n <br> \nImportant prey species like yellow perch and white sucker were sampled within the expected range.  Yellow perch were typically small and would not interest most anglers.  Tullibee catch rates were lower than expected, yet similar to previous assessments.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, one largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The study specifically evaluated walleye fry, small fingerlings, and three densities of large fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nJohnson Lake received walleye marked with oxytetracycline (OTC) in 2001, 2003 and 2005.  Large fingerlings were stocked in 2001 at a rate of  l lb/ littoral acre, in 2003 at a rate of 2 lbs/littoral acre, and in 2005 at a rate of 0.5 lbs/littoral acre.  The special assessments (gill nets only) conducted in 2004 and 2006 were used to evaluate these stockings. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2006, the walleye gill-net catch (1.3 fish/net) was within the interquartile range for class 23 lakes.  In all previous assessments except 1972 (6.7 fish/net), the walleye gill-net catch varied from 1.0 to 3.3 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 10.4 to 24.8 inches and had a mean length of 18.4 inches.  Age analysis indicated four age classes were sampled from age 2 to age 7.  Mean length-at-age were similar to statewide averages. <br> \n <br> \nIn this study, it appears the large fingerling stockings were not effective in establishing year classes in Johnson Lake.  In 2006, only one fish was collected from any of the marked fingerling stockings.  The fish corresponded to the 2001 fingerling stocking (1 lb/littoral acre).  In 2004, two fish also corresponded to the 2001 stocking.  No fish have been sampled from the highest density of fingerling stockings (2 lbs/littoral acre) that occurred in 2003.  No fish from the fall 2005 fingerling stocking were observed in the 2006 assessment, however, this is may be due to how small the fish would be relative to the gill net mesh sizes.  Fisheries research staff will be analyzing the data for all lakes involved to determine the most effective stocking regime for these types of lakes.</p>",
