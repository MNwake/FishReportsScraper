                "narrative": "<p>     Dayton Hollow Reservoir is a 209-acre impoundment located approximately 3.5 miles southwest of Fergus Falls, Minnesota.  Dayton Hollow Reservoir is part of the Otter Tail River system.  The dam creating the reservoir is part of a small hydropower facility owned by Otter Tail Power Company.  The maximum depth is 32 feet and 66% of the reservoir is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 5.9 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have  ranged from 3.0 to 5.0 feet.  <br> \n    Development around Dayton Hollow Reservoir is very limited.  There is a DNR owned public access located on the east shoreline.  The habitat in the reservoir is riverine in nature, and the fish population reflects that.  Some of the most abundant species are those associated with rivers: various redhorse species, Common Carp, Walleye, Channel Catfish, Bigmouth Buffalo, and Smallmouth Bass.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) is located in various areas throughout the reservoir.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for many fish species.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  Zebra Mussels have been documented in Dayton Hollow Reservoir and it is designated as an infested body of water. <br> \n     Walleye abundance is moderate.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.8 to 18.5 inches with an average length of 13.5 inches.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.3 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     The Channel Catfish population is also moderately abundant.  Channel Catfish ranged in length from 12.2 to 32.3 inches with an average length of 27.9 inches.     <br> \n    Smallmouth Bass were introduced into the Otter Tail River in 1992 and were sampled for the first time during the 1998 survey.  Data from the most recent survey indicates that a self-sustaining Smallmouth Bass population has developed.  Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 7.3 to 16.7 inches with an average length of 13.5 inches.  Smallmouth Bass attain an average length of 12.9 inches at four years of age. There is a mandatory catch and release regulation for Smallmouth Bass on the Otter Tail River and its impoundments which includes Dayton Hollow Reservoir.  <br> \n    The Black Crappie population is abundant.  Crappies ranged in length from 4.3 to 14.7 inches with an average length of 9.7 inches.  Sixty-eight percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length. Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.5 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n    The Bluegill population appears to be increasing in abundance. Bluegills ranged in length from 3.2 to 8.4 inches with an average length of 4.8 inches. Thirteen percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length. Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at three years of age. <br> \n    Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in Dayton Hollow Reservoir by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

Net indices also indicate declines in rough fish abundance. A possible explanation for these apparent declines in fish species abundance is that as the reservoir ages and becomes silted in, suitable habitat is no longer available for most species. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance declined from 1.8 per gill net lift to 0.3 per net. Bluegill abundance declined from 3.4 per trap net lift to 0.9 per net.  Yellow perch abundance decreased from 1.7 per gill lift to 0.0 per net.  Walleye abundance declined from 4.3 per gill net lift to 1.5 per net.  Black crappie age data indicates good reproduction as age-classes II+ and IV+ through IX+ were sampled.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Dayton Hollow Reservoir is a 209-acre impoundment located approximately 3.5 miles southwest of Fergus Falls, Minnesota.  Dayton Hollow Reservoir is part of the Otter Tail River system.  The maximum depth is 32 feet and 66% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 6.0 feet in 2010 and has ranged from 3.0 to 5.0 feet in the past.  The dam creating the reservoir is part of a small hydropower facility owned by Otter Tail Power Company. <br> \n    Very limited development has occurred around Dayton Hollow Reservior.  There is a DNR owned public access located on the east shoreline.  The access was semi-developed in 2010 and is considered a carry-in access.  The habitat in the reservoir is riverine in nature, and the fish population reflects that.  Some of the most abundant species are those associated with rivers: various redhorse species, carp, walleye, channel catfish, bigmouth buffalo, and smallmouth bass.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) is located in various areas throughout the reservoir.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for many fish species.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.\t <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management species in Dayton Hollow Reservoir.  Walleyes ranged in length from 10.1 to 22.3 inches with an average length and weight of 15.6 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.3 inches at three years of age.   <br> \n     The channel catfish population appears to be increasing in abundance.  Channel catfish ranged in length from 8.7 to 28.9 inches with an average length and weight of 25.4 inches and 6.6 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2001 year class is strong.    <br> \n    Smallmouth bass were introduced into the Otter Tail River in 1992 and were sampled for the first time during the 1998 survey.  Data from the most recent survey shows a healthy, self-sustaining smallmouth bass population.   Smallmouth bass ranged in length from 8.3 to 16.5 inches with an average length of 13.4 inches.  Smallmouth bass attain an average length of 12.0 inches at four years of age.  There is a no-harvest regulation for smallmouth bass on the Otter Tail River and its impoundments. <br> \n    The black crappie population is abundant.  Crappies ranged in length from 7.1 to 13.8 inches with an average length and weight of 10.5 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Black crappies attain an average length of 8.7 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n    Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in Dayton Hollow Reservoir by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n     Zebra mussels, which are an invasive species, have been found in the Pelican watershed.  The Pelican River enters the Otter Tail River just above Dayton Hollow Reservoir.  At this time no zebra mussels have been found in Dayton Hollow and the reservoir is not listed as infested, however special precautions should be taken when entering and leaving the waterbody. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
