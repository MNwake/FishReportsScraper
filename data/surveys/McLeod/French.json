Growth rate above average, age class III well represented.  White crappie, black crappies show above average growth rates and numbers.  Age class III strongest for black crappies and age class IV for white crappies.  Above average populations of roughfish (bowfin, black and brown bullheads).

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at French Lake July 9, 2018, to monitor the lake's fish population.   French is a class 30 lake (Schupp's Lake Classification System) and net catches were compared to similar lakes around the state.  The 2009 lake management plan (LMP) listed Bluegill and Northern Pike as primary management species, while Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were ranked as secondary species at French.  In 2018, a total of 12 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets (GN) and trap nets (TN).  The dissolved oxygen concentration fell below 2.0 mg/l at 7 feet, indicating a lack of suitable oxygenated habitat below this depth on this date.  Water clarity was fair with a secchi disk reading of 5.5 feet.  French Lake has experienced partial winterkills in the past and was opened to liberalized fishing as recently as 2008 due to low oxygen levels and expected winterkill.  Fish populations on French would be expected to fluctuate widely based on the frequency and severity of the latest winterkill.  Immigrants from connected Stahls Lake are believed to quickly help restore fish populations at French following severe winterkills.  French Lake is mostly undeveloped and the abundant lily pads make for an enjoyable angling adventure.  Small boats should have no problem navigating through the culvert between French and Stahls Lakes, unless water levels are unusually low.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 1 Walleye for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the lake's normal range.  Historic catch rates from 1973 to 2018 (n=8) were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 2.0/net with an average of 0.8.  The Walleye, captured in the GN's, was 19.4 inches long.  The fish was most likely an immigrant from Stahls Lake, which wass routinely stocked with Walleye in recent years.  Past GN catch rates indicate that few Walleye move out of Stahls and into French.      <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Northern Pike (46) for a catch rate of 11.5/net, which was above the lake's normal range and the second highest catch ever recorded at French.  The 2009 LMP's long range goal (>5.0 and <12.3/net) was met.  The 2008 catch rate was at 4.5/net.  Catch rates from 1973 to 2018 (n=8) were variable, ranging from 1.0 to 14.5/net with an average of 8.1.  Historically, recruitment would be classified as moderate most years.  In 2018, gill netted Northern Pike were 16.2 to 33.1 inches long with an average of 20.9.  Only 1 GN sampled Northern Pike was over 24 inches in length, indicating a poor size structure.  Natural reproduction provided sufficient recruitment at French Lake.  Northern Pike were not aged but size distribution data indicated that multiple year classes were present.  New Northern Pike zone regulations went into effect in the spring of 2018.  French is in the north central regulation zone, which has a 10 fish bag limit, where all fish from 22 to 26 inches in length have to be immediately released and only two harvested fish can be over 26 inches long.  Darkhouse spearers are allowed to have one fish in the protected slot limit.  Over the last two decades, French was usually clear enough for darkhouse spearing.  Northern Pike anglers should expect plenty of action from mostly smaller sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (1) of Black Crappie in 2018 for a catch rate of 0.1/net, which was below the lake's normal range and the second lowest ever recorded at French.  The 2009 LMP's long range goal (>1.8 and <18.1/net) was not met in 2018 or 2008 (0.2/net).  Catch rates from 1973 to 2018 (n=10) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 4.3/net with an average of 1.8.  The trap netted Black Crappie was 6.1 inches long.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (11) for a catch rate of 2.8/net, which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2008 GN catch rate was 8.8/net.  Catch rates from 1973 to 2018 (n=8) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 8.8/net with an average of 2.4.  Gill netted Black Crappie were 5.4 to 9.2 inches long with an average of 7.0.  Black Crappie were not aged, but length frequency distributions indicated inconsistent recruitment.  Spring angling pressure is often high in the channel between French and Stahls Lakes, with many fishermen targeting Black Crappie.       <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers of Bluegill (163) for a catch rate of 18.1/net which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2009 LMP's long range goal for Bluegill (>24.6 and <59.6) was not met.  The 2008 TN catch rate was 63.6/net.  Catch rates from 1973 to 2018 (n=10) were highly variable, ranging from 3.0 to 92.0/net, with an average of 33.6.  In 2018, trap netted Bluegill were 3.2 to 7.9 inches long with an average of 5.3.  Approximately 5% of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure.  Data indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Every spring, Bluegill are targeted by anglers fishing the channel between French and Stahls Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets and trap nets sampled a total of 4 Largemouth Bass, meeting the LMP's long range goal of maintaining the presence of this species. Largemouth Bass from GN's and TN's were 11.6 to 14.2 inches long.  Electrofishing is the preferred sampling method for Largemouth Bass but was not conducted due to the boats inability to fit through the culvert that connected French to Stahls Lake.  Largemouth Bass anglers might expect some decent action at French Lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (1) for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the lake's normal range.  The 2008 catch rate was 1.5/net.  Catch rates from 1973 to 2018 (n=8) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 7.0/net with an average of 2.6.  The gill netted Yellow Perch was 5.7 inches long.  Yellow Perch were not aged and data indicated inconsistent recruitment.  Over the years, moderate to high numbers of Northern Pike have likely limited the adult Yellow Perch population at French Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (1) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 0.1/net, which was below the lake's normal range.  The 2008 catch rate was 0.2/net.  Historic catch rates (n=10) from 1973 to 2018 were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 2.3/net with an average of 0.3.  All historic TN catch rates were below the lake's normal range, except 1977 (2.3/net).  In 2018, the trap netted Common Carp was 24.0 inches long.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers of Common Carp (1) for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the lake's normal range.  Historic GN catch rates (n=8) were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 0.8/net with an average of 0.2.  The gill netted Common Carp was not measured.  Low numbers of Common Carp over the years have likely benefited the quality submergent plant community present at French Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (86) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 21.5/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Black Bullhead were the most abundant fish sampled in the GN's.  The 2008 catch rate was 5.0/net.  Historic GN catch rates from 1973 to 2018 (n=8) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 159.0/net with an average of 57.3.   Gill netted Black Bullhead were 6.9 to 12.7 inches long with an average of 8.9.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (3) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.3/net which was below the lake's normal range.  Trap netted Black Bullhead were 8.3 to 10.5 inches long with an average of 9.6.  Black Bullhead catch rates have not been high since 1990 (153.8/GN), likely reflecting reduced winterkill frequency over the last 28 years. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included; Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake is a small lake (94 acres) in Mcleod County with a maximum depth of 23 feet.  This lake experiences periodic winterkills and fish populations tend to fluctuate.  French Lake is directly connected to Stahls Lake, which does not winterkill, so most fish species are able to quickly reestablish their populations following a winterkill.  In 1993, DNR fisheries personnel used trapnets to sample the fish population in French Lake.  Fish species captured in trapnets included bowfin, northern pike, common carp, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, bluegill, black crappie and yellow perch.      Only two northern pike were captured during the survey for a trapnet catch of 0.2 fish per net.  This is below average for lakes of this type and is lower than the 1.5 per trapnet rate observed during a survey in 1990.  This decrease in northern pike numbers is typical of many area lakes and is probably due to drought conditions of the late 1980's.       Black bullhead were captured in trapnets at a rate of 2.4 per net.  This is well below average for lakes of this type.  Black bullhead numbers have also decreased since the 1990 survey (8.7 per trapnet).  The average length of black bullhead was 9 inches.  The yellow bullhead catch was near the average for this lake and the mean length was over 10 inches.  The size of both bullhead species should be attractive to anglers.       Pumpkinseed sunfish numbers were near average for this lake but most were small, with a mean length of 5.5 inches.  Bluegill sunfish numbers appear to have declined from previous surveys.  This years catch of 39.6 per net was above the average for this lake type, but within the normal range.  Nearly 60% of the bluegill were 4 years old, with fish from age 2 through 5 represented in the sample, indicating consistent natural reproduction.  Bluegill growth was good with four year old fish averaging 6 inches long.       Only three black crappie were captured during the survey for a catch of 0.3 per net.  This is well below average for this lake.  Recent surveys have shown that black crappie numbers have been consistantly below average in French Lake.  Only one yellow perch was sampled during the survey.       Night electrofishing was done in the spring to attempt to sample largemouth bass.  No bass were sighted and field notes indicated high numbers of bluegill and black bullhead, along with a few black crappie.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY: <br> \nBoth French and Stahls Lakes were reclaimed with rotenone in fall 1977.  Black bullheads have found entry into the lake and despite intensive removal of young of the year catches of this species, equal 17 per trap-net.  The bullheads average 7.5 inches in length and weigh three to the pound.  Northern pike populations are high (14.5/gillnet).  Most of the sample was composed of fish 0-3 years old and they averaged 15 inches in length.  Over 5000 northern pike were stocked in French Lake and Stahls Lake during winter 1979 as they were obtained from winter rescue operations.  Bluegills were captured at a rate of 15.2 per trapnet, which is comparable to catch-rates for other area lakes.  Adult female sunfish have been stocked in order to provide a trophy fishery with only limited natural reproduction.  Some males were included in the stocking and natural reproduction has produced fast growing progeny.  A one year old bluegill averages three inches in length.  The stocked brood fish appear slower growing but actually represent different slow growing populations of the lakes from which they were obtained.  Adult fish are eight inches in length and .5 pounds each.  Shoreline seining is difficult in French Lake due to muck soils but observations are that all species present successfully reproduced in the lake. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake, McLeod County, is a 94-acre lake with a maximum depth of 23 feet.  The 1998 lake survey utilized standard lake survey gill nets and trap nets.  Special 1/4 inch mesh, trap nets were used to assess natural reproduction.  French Lake net catch data were compared to other lakes with a similar lake classification (class 30).  The lake management plan lists bluegill and largemouth bass as the primary management species and northern pike, black crappie, and yellow perch as secondary management species.During the 1998 survey, Hutchinson Fisheries personnel set four 250-foot experimental gill nets and nine standard 3/4 inch mesh double-frame trap nets.  The three most abundant species in gill nets were black bullhead, northern pike, and yellow perch.  The three most abundant species in trap nets were bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, and black crappie.Trap nets sampled 323 bluegills, for a catch rate of 35.9 per net.  This compared to historical catch rates of 92.0 in 1990 and 58.8 in 1985.  Bluegills ranged in length from 30 to 9 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches.Gill nets sampled 37 northern pike, for a catch rate of 9.3 per net.  Historic catch rates have been highly variable at 5.8 in 1990, 7.5 in 1985, 38 in 1980, and 1 in 1973.  Northern pike ranged in length from 13.3 to 27.9 inches in the 1998 survey.  Average length for northerns was 18.7 inches.Gill nets sampled 24 yellow perch for a catch rate of 6.0 per net.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 5.3 to 8.3 inches with an average length of 6.1 inches.Trap nets sampled 31 black crappies for a catch rate of 3.4 per net.  Catch rates for black crappies has been in the normal range for lakes of this type.  Black crappies ranged in length from 6.6 to 9.1 inches with an average length of 8.1 inches.</p>",

Though not indicated by the netting results, there have been very large bluegills taken at French lake since rehabilitation in 1977.  Northerns were taken at 7.5/gillnet lift with sizes from 13 to 29\".  Five bass sampled averaging 10\".  There are large numbers of black bullheads as well as a few yellow bullheads.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at French Lake in 2008 to evaluate the lake's physical, chemical, biological characteristics.  A total of 14 different species of fish were sampled, plus hybrid sunfish.  Some fishing occurred in the channel between French and Stahl's, but overall fishing pressure was light during this survey.  French Lake has a history of taking partial winterkills.  The lake was opened to liberalized fishing during the 2007-2008 winter because dissolved oxygen tests indicated that a partial winterkill was likely. <br> \n <br> \nFrench's lakeshed (690 acres) was dominated by row crop agriculture.  The lakeshed to lake ratio was 16:1.  Most of the shoreline remained undeveloped, with forest and marshland being the dominant coverage's.  Aquatic vegetation was fairly diverse (17 varieties) and plentiful.  Coontail, cattail, yellow waterlily, and bladderwort were all ranked as abundant.  Detritus was the dominant shoalwater substrate.  Dissolved oxygen dropped below 2 mg/l at 12 foot during netting week.  Water clarity was good, with a secchi disk reading of 9.3 feet in early July. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 4 walleye for a catch rate of 1.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 1998 catch rate was also 1.0/net.  Walleye were 13.2 to 24.7 inches long averaging 19.4 inches.  Walleye were 3 to 8 years old with 2 year-classes present.  Fish were likely migrants from Stahl's Lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 18 northern pike for a catch rate of 4.5/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 1998 catch rate was 9.3/net.  Northern pike were 21.5 to 35.4 inches long averaging 24.7 inches.  Northern pike were 2 to 5 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Winter spearers often congregate on French Lake because of the better water clarity.      <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 6 yellow perch for a catch rate of 1.5/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 1998 catch rate was 6.0/net.  Yellow perch were 5.4 to 5.7 inches long averaging 5.7 inches.  Yellow perch were 2 to 4 years old with 3 year-classes present.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 8 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 13.5/hr of electrofisher on-time.  The catch rate in 2003 was 25.3/hr.  Catch rates (n=5) from 1991 to 2008 ranged from 0.0 to 25.3/hr, averaging 12.3 inches.  Largemouth bass were 13.5 to 17.5 inches long averaging 15.8 inches.  Trap nets sampled largemouth bass up to 20.5 inches in length.  Largemouth bass were 3 to 9 years old with 5 year-classes present.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 3 carp for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was within the normal range for lakes of this type.  The 1998 catch rate was also low at 0.5/net.  Carp were 20.3 to 25.6 inches long averaging 23.3 inches.  The trap net catch rate was 0.2/net. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 20 black bullhead for a catch rate of 5.0/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 1998 catch rate was 18.8/net.  Black bullhead were 9.1 to 11.3 inches long averaging 10.6 inches.  The trap net catch rate was 0.2/net, which was the lowest ever recorded at French Lake.  Trap nets sampled 7 yellow bullhead for a catch rate of 0.8/net.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 2 black crappie for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was the lowest ever recorded at French Lake.  The 1998 catch rate was 3.4/net.  Black crappie were 6.6 to 7.8 inches long averaging 7.2 inches.  Gill nets sampled 35 black crappie for a catch rate of 8.8/net, with fish lengths ranging from 5.4 to 7.9 inches.  Black crappie were 3 to 5 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Growth was slow.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 572 bluegill for a catch rate of 63.6/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 1998 catch rate was 35.9/net.  Bluegill were 3.3 to 6.7 inches long averaging 5.2 inches.  Bluegill were 2 to 6 years old with 5 year-classes present.   <br> \n <br> \nQuarter inch trap nets sampled young-of-the-year: black bullhead (1), black crappie (7), bluegill (1), largemouth bass (20), northern pike (2), and yellow bullhead (3).  A tadpole madtom (1) was also trap netted.</p>",

Female bluegill sunfish were stocked after reclamation in fall of 1977.  Length tables show that 90.5% of the sunfish are greater than or equal to 6 inches total length, a size acceptable to most anglers.  However, trapnet catches are relatively low:  Stahls Lake = 1.5/lift and French Lake = 6.83/lift.  Natural reproduction is occurring and sex ratios are 1:1 but it appears that some other factor is limiting bluegill numbers.  There seems to be a difference in growth as French Lake fish age II are larger than Stahls; but age classes I and III are absent.  I propose to discontinue special sampling until formal assessment netting in 1983. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Trap net catches of black bullheads, at 8.75 fish per lift, slightly exceeded the median by lake class (8.67 fish/lift), however gillnet catch of 153.75 fish per lift, exceeded the normal range start point of 61.50 fish per lift.  Gill net catch for northern pike (5.75 fish/lift) exceeded the lake class median (4.00 fish/lift).  Bluegill trap net catch was high (92.0 fish/lift), falling into the normal range for the lake class.  Trap net catch for black crappies (4.0 fish/lift) and gill net catch for walleye (0.75 fish/lift) were both below the median catch rate for lakes of the same classification, 8.60 and 3.00 fish per lift, respectively.  Walleye population in French Lake is maintained through stocking.  A channel connecting French and Stahls Lake permits passage of fish, and may allow game fish to repopulate French Lake after winterkill.</p>",
