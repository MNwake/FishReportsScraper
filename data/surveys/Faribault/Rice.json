In addition to the boat launch on the north shore, a county park is located on the east shore.  Rice Lake was reclaimed in 1998 and again in 1999 because of greater than desired black bullhead survival.  Good reproduction of black crappie and yellow perch occurred in 2000 following the reclamation.  However, despite the installation of an aeration system in 2000 winterkill occurred in the winter of 2000 u 2001.  A fishery assessment was conducted in August 2003 to monitor the fish community status.  Small bluegill, around 4 inches, were abundant, while some bluegill were over 7 inches.  Yellow perch from 6 to 11 inches were common.  Some northern pike around 20 to 25 inches are present.  Black bullhead from 5 to 8 inches long were abundant.  Black crappie are also present with some fish up to 8 inches in the 2003 assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rice Lake is a shallow, highly productive, 266-acre lake located in Faribault County near the Town of Wells.  Residential development around the lake is moderate, with much of the shoreline remaining intact.  A forested buffer zone ranging in width from approximately 50 to 450 feet surrounds much of the lake, except for a 1,400-ft section of shoreline in the northwest corner.  The buffer separates Rice Lake from adjacent agricultural fields and aids in trapping excess nutrients from rain water runoff. Rice Lake was reclaimed in 1998 and 1999.  A winter kill occurred during the winter of 2000 \u0013 2001.  A DNR owned ramp located on the north shore of the lake provides access for the public.  The sport fish community consists of northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch.   Walleye fry were stocked in 2003 and northern pike fry were stocked in 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011.  The current management plan calls for northern pike fry to be stocked in two out of three years.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch rates (12.3/gill net) in 2011 were the highest catch rates observed during a survey at Rice Lake.  Northern pike catch rates increased four-fold from 2006, when northern pike were captured at a rate of 3.0/gill net.  The size structure of northern pike was stable, with fish ranging from 9.2 to 34.3 inches in length and averaging 17.8 inches.  Forty percent of northern pike sampled were less than 12.0 inches, indicating a successful fry stocking or natural reproduction, and forty-nine percent were between 20.0 and 26.0 inches.  One northern pike larger than 30.0 inches was captured.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were extremely abundant immediately after reclamation in 1999 and subsequent stocking.  Trap net and gill net catch rates decreased since 2006, with catch rates decreasing from 27.0/trap net and 31.0/gill net in 2006 to 2.3/trap net and 7.7/gill net in 2011.  Although black crappie abundance is down from previous years, the size structure of the population is larger.  In 2011 black crappies sampled in gill nets ranged from 6.6 to 12.9 inches in length and averaged almost 10.0 inches compared to 3.9 to 9.5 inches with an average length of 8.0 inches in 2006.  Nearly half of black crappies sampled in 2011 were greater than 10.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \n Bluegills were captured at a rate of 14.0/trap net in 2011 which is markedly less than the 120.8/trap net reported in 2006.  Bluegill catch rates in 2011 were slightly above average when compared to similar lakes.  Bluegill size structure decreased from the 2006 survey, when bluegills ranged from 0.4 to 8.6 inches in length and averaged 6.0 inches.  In 2011, bluegills were small, ranging from 3.7 to 7.8 inches in length and averaging 5.3 inches.  Approximately three-fourths of bluegills sampled were less than 6.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to black crappies, yellow perch were extremely abundant after the reclamation and initial stocking (624.7/trap net), and were abundant until the winterkill during the winter of 2000-2001.  The 2011 survey indicated a low abundance population as catch rates averaged 0.3/trap net and 2.7/gill net, which are below average when compared to similar lakes.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 9.0 to 10.5 inches and averaged 9.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads continued to occur in high abundance in Rice Lake.  Since 1988, black bullhead catch rates have ranged from 100.5/gill net in 2006 to 333.0/gill net in 1990.  Black bullhead catch rates in 2011 fell within this range, and were captured at a rate of 296.7/gill net.  <br> \n <br> \nPost reclamation, common carp had not been sampled in Rice Lake.  In 2011, common carp reappeared and were captured at a rate of 16.3/gill net and 5.0/trap net.  Common carp that were sampled were likely age-0 fish that ranged from 4.5 to 9.9 inches in length and averaged 7.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nGreen sunfish and hybrid sunfish were present but occurred in low numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

Black bullhead catches were high at over 100 per net for both gill nets and trap nets.  Size distribution was well balanced suggesting consistent reproduction.  The size distribution includes a good proportion of large individual and should provide good angling opportunity of this species.  Black crappies were also netted in high numbers.  Size structure was favorable with many fish exceeding 8 inches in length.  Bluegills were also present in high numbers but the average size was relatively small.  Bluegill were general age-5 or younger and if growth remains good, the fishery for this species should improve in the near future.  Despite frequent stocking of northern pike and walleye, viable populations apparently failed to establish as the only 3 pike and no walleye were captured.</p>",
