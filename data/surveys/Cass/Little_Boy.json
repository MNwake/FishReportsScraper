                "narrative": "<p>Little Boy Lake has an area of 1,372 acres and a maximum depth of 74 feet.  It is located four miles south of Longville Minnesota. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Little Boy Lake is in lake class 22.  Other lakes in this same class include: Woman (located two miles west of Longville), Ten Mile (located two miles north and 2 miles west of Hackensack), and Wabedo (adjoining Little Boy to the southwest)  Previous surveys and population assessments were conducted in 1955, 1976, 1985, 1990, and 1993.  Special muskellunge assessments were conducted from 1991 through 94. These assessments are scheduled to be repeated beginning in 1997.Walleye were sampled at a rate similar to previous assessments. Sampled walleye ranged in length from 7.6 to 29.8 inches and had an average length and weight of 14.8 inches and 1.2 pounds. Size distribution and age and growth analysis indicated good natural reproduction. Growth was similar to other lakes in the same lake class. The average length of Little Boy Lake walleye at age 5 was 16.7 inches.  All age classes from age 1 through 10 were found in the netting sample. The presence of numerous year classes should ensure good walleye angling in upcoming years.Northern pike were sampled at a rate higher than long range goals outlined in the lake management plan. Sampled northern pike ranged in length from 12.8 to 35.6 inches and had an average length and weight of 19.8 inches and 1.9 pounds. A slight decline in average size and weight was noted because of  strong 1994 and 1993 year classes dominating the sample. This decline should change as these fish continue to grow. On average growth was slow for the first year, but good thereafter when compared to other area class 22 lakes. Little Boy Lake is a natural muskellunge lake. A ten year study to determine the effects of stocking muskellunge into a naturally reproducing population began in 1990.  Stocking of fin-clipped muskellunge fingerlings occurred from 1991 through 1993. From 1990 through 1994, spring trapnetting and fall electrofishing were used to better sample the muskellunge population. No muskellunge were sampled during the 1996 summer assessment, however spring trap netting  will resume in 1997. Upon completion of this study, a better understanding of muskellunge in Little Boy Lake will result.  Sampled bluegill ranged in length from 3.0 - 8.3 inches and had an average length and weight of 5.8 inches and 0.2 pounds. Bluegill were sampled at rates similar to previous assessments. Natural reproduction was consistent with seven different year classes present in the sample.  Growth was good the first year but slow for the succeeding years when compared to other area class 22 lakes. Spring trapnetting for muskellunge indicated many larger bluegill are in the population than was sampled during the summer assessment.Only one black crappie was sampled in 1996.  Spring trapnetting is typically a better method of sampling black crappie. In the 1993 spring trapnetting on Little Boy Lake, 82 black crappie were sampled. These black crappie ranged in length from 4.7 - 14.5 inches and had an average length of 10.5 inches. In 1996 five largemouth and six smallmouth bass were sampled by all sampling efforts.  Sampled largemouth bass ranged in length from 8.0 - 14.0 inches; smallmouth bass ranged in length from 9.0 - 18.1 inches.  Casual reports indicate that fishing for these species can be excellent at times. Rock bass (RKB) showed excellent quality in Little Boy Lake.  A total of 96 RKB were sampled that ranged in length from < 4 - 11.9 inches and had a mean length of 8.5 inches.  PSD and RSD-P values were 84 and 46.Yellow perch (YEP) were sampled at a rate (8.6/GN lift) within the historical (7.9 - 43.4) and interquartile ranges (7.1 - 33.9). Sampled YEP ranged in length from 5.3 to 11.3The 1996 cisco (TLC) gill net catch rate (4.7/GN) was the second-highest of any previous assessment and was within the interquartile range.  Catch rates have been quite variable over time.  Length frequency of TLC shows the presence of at least two different year classes.Other species sampled include: white sucker (1.6/GN lift), bowfin (1.1/TN lift), black bullhead (0.2/TN lift), yellow bullhead (0.6/TN lift), brown bullhead (0.7/TN lift), pumpkinseed (4.2/TN lift), and burbot (0.1/TN lift).In 1993 there were 120 lake homes inventoried on Little Boy Lake.  This compares to 73 lake homes counted in 1976 and 54 counted in 1955.  To help maintain quality fish populations in Little Boy Lake, users should safeguard aquatic habitats by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife.  They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters.  They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the Little Boy Lake watershed is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Little Boy Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Boy Lake (DOW # 11 0167) is a 1,372 acre lake located about two miles south of Longville, MN.  Little Boy Lake is connected to Wabedo Lake by a navigable channel.  Little Boy Lake has 10.02 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 74 ft. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Little Boy Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in the class are generally clear, large, deep lakes with a low percentage of shallow water area and have very irregularly shaped shorelines with many bays or points. The lake is primarily managed for muskellunge, northern pike and walleye, and secondarily for smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, cisco (tullibee), and yellow perch.   <br> \nThe abundance and size of muskellunge has not been recently assessed.  Spring sampling with large traps nets is needed to properly sample the population, and this was last completed in 2000.  Northern pike numbers are above average when compared to similar lakes in the Walker Fisheries Area, with lengths of sampled pike ranging from 11 to 36 inches. Walleye numbers are also above average.  The average walleye sampled in 2012 was 14 inches long with fish up to 23 inches present in the sample. Low numbers of smallmouth and largemouth bass were caught in gill nets, trap nets and spring electrofishing. Smallmouth bass up to 18 inches and largemouth bass up to 16 inches were found.  Bluegill numbers are within the range of other Class 22 lakes.  Bluegill in the summer sample averaged 5 inches long with fish up to 9 inches observed.  Sizes of black crappie sampled in gill and trap nets were good with fish averaging 11 inches. Yellow perch abundance has declined since 2005 but is still above average compared to similar lakes.  Yellow perch up to 12 inches were caught and averaged 6.5 inches.  Other fish species that are present include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker.   <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that has been identified in Little Boy Lake is the rusty crayfish.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Boy Lake (DOW# 11-0167; Lake Class 22) is a 1,452 acre lake located near Longville, MN. There is a DNR owned public access on the southwest shore. Little Boy Lake is connected to Wabedo Lake (DOW# 11-0171; Lake Class 22) via a short navigable channel. Little Boy Lake has 10.02 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 74 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Little Boy Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in the class are generally clear, large, deep lakes with a low percentage of shallow water area and have very irregularly shaped shorelines with many bays or points. Other Lake Class 22 lakes in the Walker Area include Ten Mile, Woman, Wabedo, and Steamboat. A 24\" to 36\" Protected Slot Limit three in possession with one over 36\" allowed in possession special regulation for Northern Pike, was implemented in 2003. An experimental regulation for Walleye of an 18\" to 26\" Protected Slot Limit, possession limit of four with one over 26\" allowed in possession was implemented in 2018. The purpose of the 2018 survey was to assess gamefish populations in Little Boy Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Boy Lake is a great multi-species lake with the potential to produce trophy size fish. Muskellunge up to 49 inches were sampled in the spring of 2015, with several fish captured from 36 to 44 inches long. Walleye are abundant and ranged from 11 to 25 inches long. A high number of two year old Walleye that ranged in length from 13 to nearly 14 inches long were present and will be of acceptable size for harvest starting in 2019. In addition, Smallmouth Bass are common with fish up to 21 inches sampled. Northern Pike are abundant and the majority of Northern Pike sampled were 18 to 23 inches long with fish up to 34 inches long present. Largemouth Bass are not very abundant but fish over 18 inches long were sampled in the spring. Bluegill were moderately abundant but fish over 8 inches long were not common. Black Crappie are scarce in Little Boy Lake. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish  Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Little Boy Lake are Rusty Crayfish and Chinese Mystery Snails. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Boy Lake is a 1,452 acre lake with 10.02 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 74 feet located south of Longville, MN. There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned public access on the southwest shore. Little Boy Lake is connected to Wabedo Lake via a short navigable channel. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Little Boy Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in the class are generally clear, large, deep lakes with a low percentage of shallow water area and have very irregularly shaped shorelines with many bays or points. Other Lake Class 22 lakes in the Walker Area include Ten Mile, Woman, Wabedo, and Steamboat. A 24 to 36 inches Protected Slot Limit three in possession with one over 36\" allowed in possession special regulation for Northern Pike, was implemented in 2003. An experimental regulation for Walleye of an 18 to 26 inches Protected Slot Limit, possession limit of four with one over 26\" allowed in possession was implemented in 2018. A standard lake survey was completed in 2021. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Boy Lake is a great multi-species lake with the potential to produce trophy size fish. Muskellunge up to 50 inches were sampled in the spring of 2019, with several fish captured exceeding 45 inches long. Walleye abundance was above the management goal and lengths ranged from 11 to 25 inches long. Smallmouth Bass up to 20 inches were sampled. Additional sampling is required to develop management goals for Smallmouth Bass. Northern Pike abundance was above the maximum management goal and ranged in length from 13 to 30 inches. Northern Pike size goals were not met in 2021. Bluegill catch rates were below the management goal however, exceeded size goals with fish measuring up to 9 inches present. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include Black Crappie, Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Little Boy Lake are Rusty Crayfish and Chinese Mystery Snails. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

Little Boy Lake belongs to Lake Class 27.  Other lakes in the same lakeclass are:  Woman (1.5 miles west), Pleasant (12 miles west), and Ada (6 miles southwest) Lakes.Spring (ice-out) trapnetting, summer survey and fall electro-fishing were conducted in 1993.  Game fish caughtwere muskellunge, northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, rock bass,pumpkinseed, and yellow perch. Other species capture included bullheads, cisco and white sucker.Walleye were caught at a rate that was typical of past assessments and for other lake class 27 lakes.  Walleyeshave consistently showed good quality and excellent natural reproduction.  Northern pike also exhibit consistencyin both numbers and quality.  Most of the muskellunge captured were from the spring trapnetting (adults) and fallelectrofishing (yearlings and young-of-year).  Panfish were of quality size and fairly abundant. Though apparentlynot abundant, Largemouth and smallmouth bass were of quality size.Overall, Little Boy Lake can best be described as having an excellent fish population that has abundant numbersexhibiting very good growth.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Little Boy Lake on August 1st, 2022, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 23 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 24.2 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 20.0?C (68.0?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values near 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are marginal for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations near the thermocline indicate that oxythermal habitat was adequate for Cisco at limited depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2022. However, low dissolved oxygen concentrations (i.e., less than 3 mg/L) below the thermocline and warm surface temperatures would likely limit available Cisco habitat within the water column to an extent. Data collected in 2004 further indicates marginal oxythermal habitat. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 18 sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 14 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured 26 species of fish including 12 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Tadpole Madtom) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Little Boy Lake is in exceptional health as indicated by an FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 17 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 20.2 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 17.0?C (62.6?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C for Cisco generally indicate that oxythermal conditions are marginally favorable for these species, the oxythermal habitat available during this profile was limited to a narrow range of depths. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>IN 1990 LITTLE BOY LAKE WAS CHOSEN AS A PROJECT LAKE FOR EVALUATING STOCKING MUE INTO A NATURALLY OCCURRING POPULATION.  AS A RESULT, AN EXTENSIVE FISH MONITORING PROGRAM WAS IMPLEMENTED.  SAMPLING TECHNIQUES OTHER THAN ONES USED IN THE STANDARD LAKE SURVEY INCLUDED SPRING TRAPNETTING AND ALSO FALL ELECTROFISHING.  THESE TECHNIQUES HAVE PROVEN VERY EFFECTIVE FOR MONITORING VARIOUS LIFE STAGES OF MANY FISH SPECIES.  AS A RESULT, THIS INFORMATION IS INCLUDED AND REFERRED TO WHEN EVALUATING THE PRESENT FISH POPULATION OF LITTLE BOY LAKE.  THE 1990 LAKE SURVEY YIELDED A GILLNET CATCH OF 9.25 WAE/LIFT, WITH A MEAN WEIGHT OF 1.29 LBS/WAE.  THIS GILLNET CATCH IS WELL WITHIN THE HISTORICAL RANGE.  AGE AND GROWTH ANALYSIS FURTHER INDICATED A HEALTHY, NATURALLY REPRODUCING WAE POPULATION WITH EXPECTED YEAR-CLASSES BEING WELL REPRESENTED.  THE 1990 FALL ELECTROFISHING INDICATES A STRONG 1990 YEAR-CLASS.  THIS WAS ILLUSTRATED BY A CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT (CPUE) OF 26 YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR (YOY) WAE/HR.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE TARGET SPECIES DURING THE FALL ELECTROFISHING WAS YOY MUE AND THAT AN EVEN GREATER CPUE COULD BE EXPECTED IF YOY WAE WERE TARGETED.  THE GILLNET CATCH OF 7.25 NOP/LIFT IS WITHIN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 2.11 NOP/LIFT (1955) AND 12.16 NOP/LIFT (1985).  NOP POPULATIONS IN MANY LAKES IN THE WALKER FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AREA APPEAR TO HAVE INCREASED SINCE THE 1940'S. THE MOST POPULAR THEORY FOR THIS IS THE LOW-WATER CONDITIONS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE 1930'S, WHICH LIKELY REDUCED SPAWNING HABITAT FOR THE NOP.  THUS REDUCING THE NUMBERS OF NOP IN THE FISHERY.  SINCE THE RETURN OF MORE NORMAL WATER LEVELS, THE NOP POPULATIONS HAVE INCREASED.  HOWEVER, THE 1990 GILLNET CATCH (7.25 NOP/LIFT) IS SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH OCCURRED IN 1976 (7.00 NOP/LIFT), YET SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE GILLNET CATCH OF 1985 (12.16 NOP/LIFT) AND MAY INDICATE THAT NOP POPULATIONS HAVE STABILIZED IN LITTLE BOY LAKE. ALTHOUGH MUE POPULATIONS WERE NOT SAMPLED DURING THE REGULAR LAKE SURVEY, THE INCREASED SAMPLING EFFORT OF SPRING TRAPNETTING AND FALL ELECTROFISH- ING ALLOWED MORE INFORMATION TO BE OBTAINED O MUE IN LITTLE BOY LAKE THAN DURING PREVIOUS SURVEYS. A TOTAL OF 44 MUE WERE SAMPLED THAT RANGED IN SIZE FROM 6.4 INCHES TO 48.5 INCHES.  NINE NATURALLY OCCURRING YOY MUE WERE SAMPLED DURING THE FALL ELECTROFISHING.  YOY MUE RANGED IN SIZE FORM 6.4 INCHES TO 9.5 INCHES.  ONLY SEXUALLY MATURE MUE WERE SAMPLED DURING THE SPRING TRAPNETTING. SEXUAL MATURITY FOR MALE MUE OCCURRED AT AGE 5 OR 6 YEARS AND FOR FEMALES AT AGE 7.  THESE AGES AT MATURITY ARE SIMILAR TO THAT FOUND ON LEECH LAKE AND ARE TYPICAL OF NATURALLY OCCURRING MUE POPULATIONS.  AGE AND GROWTH ANALYSIS INDICATED A HEALTHY, NATURALLY REPRODUCING POPULATION THAT EXHIBITED GROWTH RATES SIMILAR TO OTHER NATIVE MUE LAKES.  A TOTAL OF 110 RKB WERE CAPTURED BY TRAPNETS IN THE 1990 LAKE SURVEY, REPRESENTING A MEAN CATCH OF 8.25 RKB/TRAPNET THAT AVERAGED 0.50 LBS/RKB.  THIS TRAPNET CATCH IS VIRTUALLY THE SAME AS IN ALL PREVIOUS SURVEYS.  PMKS WERE SAMPLED QUITE WELL IN BOTH THE SPRING AND SUMMER TRAPNETTING.  A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS NOT ENCOUNTERED BETWEEN THE TWO LENGTH-FREQUENCIES. THE SUMMER TRAPNET CATCH OF 9.17 PMK/LIFT IS HIGHER THAN ANY OF THE PREVIOUS SURVEYS.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS CATCH AND THAT WHICH OCCURRED IN PREVIOUS SURVEYS IS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF SMALL PMKS (TL < 4 INCHES) BEING SAMPLED.  THE AVERAGE WEIGHT OF 0.11/PMK IS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN IN PREVIOUS SURVEYS.  IT APPEARS THAT GREATER NUMBER OF BLG WERE FIRST NOTED IN THE 1976 SURVEY WHEN A TOTAL OF 5 WERE SAMPLED.  SUBSEQUENT POPULATION ASSESSMENTS APPEAR TO INDICATE THAT THE BLG POPULATION HAS INCREASED WITH 72 BEING SAMPLED IN 1985 AND 333 IN 1990.  DURING THE 1990 SPRING TRAPNETTING, THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL 493 SAMPLED.  INTERESTINGLY, THERE APPEARD TO BE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE LENGTHS OF BLG SAMPLED IN THE SPRING AND THOSE SAMPLED IN THE SUMMER DURING THE LAKE SURVEY.  THIS WAS FIRST ILLUSTRATED BY DIFFERENCES IN THE PROPORTIONAL STOCK DENSITY VALUE (PSD) AND THE RELATIVE STOCK DENSITY VALUE (RSD).  THESE VALUES WERE CALCULATED FOR THE SPRING TRAPNETTING AND ALSO THE SUMMER LAKE SURVEY.  AS A RESULT, A CHI-SQUARE AND ALSO A KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV TEST WAS RUN TO DETERMINE IF THESE DIFFERENCES WERE SIGNIFICANT.  THE OVERALL CHI-SQUARE SCORE (226.6) AND P VALUE (0.0000) INDICATED THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO LENGTH FREQUENCIES.  THE KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV FURTHER INDICATED THAT BLG CAPTURED IN THE SPRING TRAPNETTING WERE LARGE ON AVERAGE THAN THOSE CAPTURED DURING THE REGULAR LAKE SURVEY (HYPOTHESES:BLG1 (SPRING) > BLG2 (SURVEY) = P VALUE OF 1.0000).  SO, BEFORE MAKING DETERMINATIONS OF SIZE STRUCTURE OF BLG POPULATIONS, AT LEAST IN LITTLE BOY LAKE, ONE MUST DETERMINE IF THE DATA MAY BE BIASED BY SAMPLING TIME.  AGE AND GROWTH ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ONLY ON BLG SAMPLED DURING THE SUMMER SURVEY AND INDICATED A  RELATIVELY SLOW GROWING POPULATION, WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE.  VERY FEW SMB AND LMB WERE SAMPLED DURING THE REGULAR SURVEY IN FACT, NO INDIVIDUAL SAMPLING TECHNIQUE APPEARED TO ADEQUATELY SAMPLE THESE SPECIES IN LITTLE BOY LAKE.  HOWEVER, THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF SPRING TRAPNETTING, SUMMER TRAPNETTING, SUMMER GILL- NETTING FALL ELECTROFISHING DID SAMPLE ENOUGH FISH TO CREATE A LENGTH-FREQUENCY FOR THESE SPECIES THAT INDICATES A HEALTHY, NATURALLY REPRODUCING POPULATION WITH NO OBVIOUS YEAR-CLASS GAPS.  THE PSD AND RSD VALUE FOR THESE SPECIES INDICATE THAT BOTH POPULAIONS HAVE LARGE NUMBERS OF FISH PERCEIVED TO BE OF QUALITY AND EVEN SOME OF TROPHY SIZE.  SPRING ELECTROFISHING MAY PROVE TO BE HELP- FUL FOR BETTER EVALUATING THE LMB POPULATION AND WILL BE INCORPORTED INTO THE 1991 SAMPLING.  BLC WERE NOT SAMPLED DURING THE 1990 REGULAR LAKE SURVEY.  IN FACT, COMBINING ALL BLC SAMPLED DURING ALL PREVIOUS LAKE SURVEYS WOULD TOTAL ONLY 14. HOWEVER, USING TRAPNETS DURING THE 1990 SPRING MUE ASSESSMENT, A TOTAL OF 132 BLC (1.59/BLC/LIFT) WERE CAPTURED.  THESE CRAPPIES WERE GENERALLY EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE, WITH 34% (45) BEING GREATER THAN 12 INCHES.  AGE AND GROWTH ANALYSIS INDICATES AN EXTREMELY FAST GROWING POPUALTION THAT IS RECRUITED TO A SIZE ACCEPTABLE TO THE ANGLER BY AGE 3.  EVERY YEAR-CLASS THROUGH AGE 6 IS REPRESENTED.  IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT ANGLERS WERE ENCOUNTERED ON THE LAKE THAT WERE FISHING FOR CRAPPIE.  THESE ANGLERS SPOKE OF THEIR SUCCESS ANGLING CRAPPIE ON LITTLE BOY LAKE.  WITH INCREASED ASSESSMENT CONTINUING THROUGH 1999, A MORE COMPLETE DATA BASE WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR THIS IMPORTANT, BUT OFTEN UNDER SAMPLED.  SPECIES THE 1990 POPULATION ASSESSMENT INDICATED VERY LITTLE CHANGE IN THE MAJOR FORAGE SPECIES IN LITTLE BOY LAKE.  CISCO AND WTS CATCHES WERE WITHIN THE HISTORICAL RANGES AND THE YEP CATCH WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN IN PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Boy Lake is a 1372-acre lake located near Longville, MN.  With a maximum depth of 74 feet, approximately 34% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  A public access is located on the southwest corner of the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Little Boy Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are generally very large, low littoral area, clear and irregular shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for muskellunge, walleye, and northern pike and secondarily for smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, cisco, and yellow perch.  Little Boy Lake is an excellent muskellunge lake and several muskellunge were sampled.  Walleye were abundant and the catch rate exceeded most other lakes in this lake class.  The abundance of walleye will provide fishing opportunities in the future.  Walleye up to 24 inches were sampled and they averaged 15 inches.  Northern pike were abundant, but most were below 24 inches.  Northern pike up to 26 inches were sampled and their average length was 21 inches.  Beginning in May 2003, no northern pike from 24 to 36 inches may be kept in Little Boy and Wabedo Lakes.  This \"protected slot limit\" regulation is intended to help increase the number of larger northern pike in these waters.  Other fish species available for anglers to catch are black crappie, bluegill, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, cisco, greater redhorse, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and, yellow perch.    Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Little Boy Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Boy Lake is a 1372-acre lake with a maximum depth of 74 feet.  The lake is located 1.5 miles south of Longville.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Little Boy Lake is in lake class 22.  Lakes in this lake class are typically large in size, moderately deep, and moderately clear.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Pine Mountain, Ten Mile, Wabedo, and Woman Lakes.  Approximately 34% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  There is a DNR public access on the southwest corner of the lake.  Little Boy Lake supports good fishing for northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and muskellunge.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and muskellunge.Walleye were caught at a rate that was the highest recorded of any survey conducted on Little Boy Lake.  Anglers can expect to catch walleye of many sizes.  Most of the walleye present in Little Boy Lake are the result of natural reproduction.  Little Boy Lake has abundant rock rubble areas around the entire lake that need to be protected if walleye abundance is to continue.  Fish were growing at a rate that was typical of other area lake class 22 lakes.Little Boy Lake is known for its excellent muskellunge fishing.  These fish are the result of natural reproduction.  Muskellunge over 50 inches are present.Little Boy Lake has smallmouth and largemouth bass in the lake.  Though not abundant, fish of trophy size are present.There are many kinds of panfish anglers can fish for in Little Boy Lake.  Panfish of quality size include bluegill, black crappie, rock bass , and yellow perch.  To maintain such good quality, anglers need to use some restraint if large panfish are really biting.  Release the larger panfish such as bluegill and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size panfish have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.Northern pike are abundant.  Most are small although there are a few quality size fish for anglers to catch.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing medium to large size fish will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future and can help maintain balance in the fish community.  Shorelines areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Boy Lake (DOW # 110167) is a 1,372-acre lake located about two miles south of the City of Longville, MN.  Little Boy Lake is connected to Wabedo Lake by a navigable channel. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.   Little Boy Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are generally clear, very large, very deep, have a low percentage of shallow water area, and have very irregularly shaped shoreline with many bays or points.  Little Boy Lake is managed primarily for muskellunge, walleye and northern pike and secondarily for smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, cisco (tullibee), and yellow perch.The 2005 survey did not target muskellunge, however there is a good population of this species in Little Boy Lake.  Walleye abundance in the 2005 sampling in Little Boy Lake was similar to the average for ecologically similar lakes.  Fish from 7 to 27 inches were sampled in MNDNR test nets.  For several decades, Little Boy Lake has been stocked with walleye fry (small, newly-hatched fish) about every third year.  The management plan for this lake has been revised so that Little Boy Lake will be stocked with fry every other year.  However, natural reproduction plays a major role in maintaining a healthy walleye population in this lake.   Both the number and average size of northern pike in Little Boy Lake is good; sampled fish ranged from 14 to 31 inches and had an average length of 23 inches.  There is a 24 to 36-inch protected slot limit regulation in effect on this lake.  The bluegill population is comparable to other lakes of this type.  Yellow perch are abundant in Little Boy Lake.  Most of the yellow perch sampled in MNDNR test nets were small, and ranged in size from 4.5 to 10.6 inches.  Other species present include bluegill, black crappie, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, cisco (tullibee), hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, smallmouth bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.   Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Little Boy Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Boy Lake (DOW# 11-0167-00; Lake Class 22) is a 1,452-acre lake with 466 littoral acres, 10.02 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 74 feet located south of Longville, MN. A MNDNR owned public access is located on the south end of the lake. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Muskellunge, Northern Pike, and Walleye and secondarily for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), and Yellow Perch. The lake was initially surveyed in 1955 with 12 population assessment surveys occurring since. The 2023 survey was the first spring survey targeting Black Crappie and Bluegill completed on Little Boy Lake. The purpose of this survey was to collect population metrics for Bluegill and Black Crappie. The survey was completed May 12th, 2023. <br> \n <br> \nBoth Black Crappie and Bluegill provide quality angling opportunities. Black Crappie ranged in length from 6 to 14 inches with an average length and weight of 11 inches and 0.7 pounds. Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches with an average length and weight of 4.5 inches and 0.08 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the survey include Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Muskellunge, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Little Boy Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> <br> \nLittle Boy Lake (DOW# 11-0167; Lake Class 22) is a 1,452 acre lake located near Longville, MN. A DNR owned public access on the southwest shore. Little Boy Lake has 10.02 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 74 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Little Boy Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in the class are generally clear, large, deep lakes with a low percentage of shallow water area and have very irregularly shaped shorelines with many bays or points. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Boy Lake is a great multi-species lake with the potential to produce many trophy fish of different types. Muskellunge up to 49 inches were sampled in the spring, with many more between 36 and 44 inches. Walleye catch rates tend to range between 7 and 13 fish per gill net. Walleye sampled by netting ranged from 8 to 27 inches, with many fish from 12 to 16 inches collected in 2015. In addition, Little Boy Lake has a very good Smallmouth Bass population with fish up to 19 inches sampled. Panfish opportunities are also good with Bluegill up 9 inches found in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish  Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. No aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Little Boy Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
