                "narrative": "<p>Scotch Lake in Le Sueur County is a 565 acre lake located south of the city of Cleveland. A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake, off 271st Avenue. Scotch Lake is a Migratory Waterfowl Feeding and Resting Area, so during the waterfowl hunting season (usually during October and November in Minnesota), motors are prohibited on Scotch to protect waterfowl from disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nScotch Lake was surveyed the week of June 22nd, 2009 to monitor the fish community. Black bullheads were the most abundant fish in trap and gill nets, which is expected in this type of lake classification. Bullheads were variable in size, ranging from 4 to 13 inches. Average bullhead length for all gears was 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp were observed in trap and gill nets. This marks the first time carp were observed in test nets since the initial Minnesota DNR Fisheries survey in 1990. It is unclear how the fish got into the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nLow level crappie abundance has been consistent through twenty years of test netting data. In the 2009 assessment, one white crappie and eight black crappies were found. Bluegills are also present at low abundance levels; 22 bluegills were caught in the 2009 assessment. Low bluegill recruitment has brought on large average size with five bluegill exceeding 8.5 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nYellow perch have fared well in Scotch Lake. Perch averaged 12 fish per gill net lift, a slightly better than average result for lakes of Scotch's classification (class 43). Perch size ran large. Scotch Lake's average perch size was 9 inches and the largest individual sampled was just under 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike fry were stocked into the lake in 2006, 2008, and 2009. Fry stocking and natural reproduction have produced an abundant northern pike population. Gill netting returned 14 fish per gill net lift. Fish ranged between 12 and 33 inches, with an average size of 21 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye continue to be the draw for anglers to Scotch Lake. Walleye averaged 22 fish per gill net lift, landing Scotch in the upper quartile of class 43 lakes. Usually when gill net catches are high, average size is low. Scotch walleyes exceeded the third quartile for mean weight, averaging nearly 3 pounds per fish. Gill net walleyes ranged between 8 and 24 inches, with an average size of 19 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Scotch Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Scotch Lake is a 565-acre lake located in Le Sueur County near the city of Cleveland.  A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake, just off 271st Avenue.  Scotch Lake is a shallow basin with a maximum depth of 11 feet.   <br> \nScotch Lake experienced a strong winterkill during the winter of 2022-2023. Members of the public reported dead fish along the shoreline following ice out. High water clarity and large amounts of aquatic vegetation pointed toward a mostly fishless community so it was decided a targeted survey would be conducted the week of August 23, 2023. This targeted survey consisted of deploying 2 gill nets to monitor the fish community. <br> \n  <br> \nA targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Results from this targeted survey should not be compared to results from standard surveys. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads were the most abundant species in the nets. A total of 122 black bullhead were collected.  Black Bullhead ranged in length from 6.6 to 12.5 inches, with an average length of 10.6 inches.  Black Bullheads thrive in shallow lakes with high productivity, so their high abundance in Scotch Lake is expected.  <br> \n  <br> \nCommon Carp had become well established in recent years. Common Carp abundance was low in 2023 with 3 individuals sampled for a catch rate of 1.5/gill net. Common Carp averaged 9.2 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 13/gillnet in 2023.  These fish ranged in size from 6.5 inches to 9.1 inches and averaged 7.5 inches in total length. One northern pike was sampled in 2023, it was 15.6 inches in length. Golden Shiners were sampled at a rate of 4.0/ gill net. They ranged in size from 6.0 inches to 7.4 inches and averaged 6.4 inches in total length. <br> \n <br> \nApproximately 141,000 Walleye fry were stocked in 2023 following the winter kill. Walleye were the primary predator fish species observed during the 2023 survey.  The gillnets averaged 24.5/net.  The length of walleye ranged from 6.7 to 9.1 inches and averaged over 7.5 inches. A walleye maintenance stocking program has been in place at Scotch Lake for years to sustain the population.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Scotch Lake is a 565 acre lake located in Le Sueur County near the city of Cleveland.  A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake, just off 271st Avenue.  Scotch Lake is a eutrophic, shallow basin with a maximum depth of 11 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nScotch Lake was surveyed the week of July 22, 2013 as part of a regular monitoring program.  This survey consisted of deploying trap and gill nets to monitor the fish community.  Black bullheads and common carp were the most abundant fish species in the nets.  A total of 1,789.0 black bullhead were collected.  Black bullhead ranged in length from 4.0 to 9.0 inches, with an average length of 5.0 inches.  Black bullheads thrive in shallow lakes with high productivity, so their high abundance in Scotch Lake is expected.  Similarly, common carp abundance was high in 2013.  Common carp became re-established in recent years and have since increased in population.  Throughout the 2013 survey, 438.0 carp were collected in the nets compared to a total of 47.0 carp in 2009.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch were captured in low numbers during 2013.  Although black crappie abundance has increased since the last survey, the overall population status remained low in 2013.  A total of 57.0 black crappies were collected in the 2013 assessment, compared to 8.0 fish in 2009.  The length of black crappies averaged 8.0 inches, ranging from 7.0 to 10.5 inches.  Bluegill abundance in Scotch Lake continues to be low, with only 4.0 fish collected throughout the survey and averaging 5.6 inches in total length.  Yellow perch abundance has decreased in recent years, from 12.0 fish per gill net in 2009 to 0.0 fish in 2013.  Yellow perch adults were stocked in Scotch Lake in 2004. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and walleye were the primary predator fish species observed during the 2013 survey.  Northern pike fry were stocked in Scotch Lake in 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2012.  The 2013 survey yielded 14.0 northern pike total, all of which were collected in trap nets.  Although low in abundance, the sizes of northern pike in Scotch Lake during 2013 were large ranging from 23.0 to 33.0 inches, with an average total length of 30.0 inches.  Although walleye abundance has remained relatively stable over the last decade, catch rates decreased in 2013.  From 2003-2009, gill nets averaged over 24.0 walleye/net.  However, the 2013 average was only 4.0 walleye/gill net.  The length of walleye ranged from 13.0 to 28.0 inches and averaged over 18.0 inches.  The average weight of walleye from gill nets was 2.6 pounds, which was above average for similar lakes in the area.  A walleye maintenance stocking program has been in place at Scotch Lake for years to sustain the population.  The most recent walleye fry stockings were in 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2013. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Prepared by:  Kip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

Scotch Lake had low oxygen in the winter of 2000 - 2001 that resulted in winterkill of fish.  An aeration system was installed in 2003 that may help to prevent future winterkill.  A fishery population assessment was conducted on Scotch Lake in lake July 2003 to assess the recovery of the fish community and success of recent stockings.  Both the gill net and trap net catch was comprised primarily of black bullhead.  Most black bullhead were around 7 inches with a range from about 3 to 13 inches.  Walleye gill net catch was relatively high at 27 per net.  All walleye were age 1 - from the 2002 fry stocking and most were around 11 to 13 inches long.  The 2001 northern pike fry stocking established a sizeable number of pike in Scotch Lake.  These age-2 fish ranged from 19 to 26 inches long.  Only one bluegill and no black crappie were captured despite the addition of over 2000 of these panfish in 2001.  </p>",
