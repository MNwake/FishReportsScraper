IBI data was collected in conjunction with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency watershed sampling. Fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.  Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Eleven fish species were represented, including young of the year game fish species such as Largemouth Bass and Bluegill. Non-game species sampled included White Sucker, Johnny Darter, and Iowa Darter.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Little McDonald Lake is a 1,174-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles west of Perham, MN.  The maximum depth is 109 feet; however, 35% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth. The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Shoalwater substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  The secchi disk reading was 20.0 feet, indicating excellent water clarity.  Secchi disk readings from previous surveys have ranged from 10.0 to 19.1 feet.  Little McDonald Lake has two public accesses.  One is located along the north shoreline and the other is located along the south shoreline.   <br> \n     Heavy development exists around the lake.  One hundred fifty-seven homes/cabins were located along the shoreline during the 2000 lake survey.  Areas of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent in the western portion of the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They are also important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the normal range for this class of lake.  Age data indicate that the 2004 and 2005 year classes are strong.  Northern pike ranged in length from 11.0 to 30.1 inches with an average length and weight of 20.6 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 20.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for this class of lake.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegill size structure is good with 38% of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.9 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Black crappie and largemouth bass are abundant.  Test-net catch rates for these species have consistently exceeded their respective normal ranges.  Age data for these species indicates that reproduction is consistently good.  Black crappie ranged in length from 4.5 to 13.2 inches and largemouth bass ranged in length from 4.9 to 15.6 inches. <br> \n     The walleye test-net catch rate was within the normal range for this class of lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.5 to 27.6 inches with an average length and weight of 18.8 inches and 2.6 pounds.   <br> \n     An experimental walleye regulation (18.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot with one fish allowed over 26.0 inches) was implemented in May of 1998 and will remain in effect until March of 2010.  Five spring trap net assessments for walleye were conducted between 1997 and 2008 to monitor the population and evaluate the effectiveness of the regulation.  Data from these assessments, as well as the 2008 creel survey indicate that the regulation has been effective at maintaining a quality walleye size structure.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling for other species by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium and large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting August 16, 2017. Eighteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. One site was not sampled at all due to no shore existing at that location. Backpack electrofishing was completed at the other 17 sites with one site sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 11 sites, a 15-foot seine was used at five sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at one sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 15 native species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner and Rock Bass) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2016 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Little McDonald Lake from this survey is below an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little McDonald Lake is a 1,174-acre lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles westof the city of Perham, MN.  It has a maximum depth of 109 feet and 35% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 19.1 feet in 2004.  Secchi disk readings from previous surveys have ranged from 10.0 to 14.5.  Little McDonald has two public accesses.  A new concrete access was opened in 2004 and is located on the north shoreline.  The old access is located on the south shoreline; however, due to high water levels, the access is partially submerged ,making accessibility difficult.  Little McDonald Lake is included in class 27 of the Minnesota DNR lake classification scheme.     Heavy development exists around the lake.  One hundred fifty-seven homes/cabins were located along the shoreline during the 2000 lake survey.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush and cattail) is prevalent in the western portion of the lake basin.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They are also important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Little McDonald Lake contains good populations of the popular game fish species.  Northern pike abundance is at amoderate level and some large fish (> 30 inches) are present.  Pike ranged in length from 13.2 to 31.2 inches with an average length and weight of 20.2 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Pike exhibit slower than average growth rates with an average length of 20.2 inches at four years of age.     Bluegill abundance increased from the 2000 assessment; however, the number of fish over seven inches in length decreased.  Twenty-seven percent of the bluegill were at least seven inches in length.  Bluegill reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Growth rates are moderate with an average length of 6.3 inches at six years of age.     Black crappie and largemouth bass are abundant.  Test-net catch rates for these species have consistently exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 27.  Reproduction for these species also appears to be consistently good.  Black crappie ranged in length from 5.4 to 9.8 inches, while bass ranged in length from 6.7 to 19.4 inches.     Although the walleye catch rate in 2004 was lower than the 2000 catch rate, it remains good and is in the upper range for class 27 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.1 to 25.8 inches with a mean length and weight of 19.4 inches and 3.0 pounds.  Past and present surveys have documented that walleye natural reproduction is limited.  It appears that walleye fingerling/yearling stocking is supplementing natural reproduction to produce viable walleye year classes.  The lake management plan includes stocking walleye fingerlings every two out of three years.  A spring trap net assessment in April 2004 sampled 203 walleye ranging in length from 14.6 to 28.8 inches.     An experimental walleye slot length limit regulation (18 to 26 inch protected slot with one over 26 inches) went in effect in 1998.  This regulation is also in effect on Kerbs Lake, a 69-acre private lake that is connected to Little McDonald.  During high water periods fish can pass between the two lakes.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain a target walleye gill net catch rate with 40% of the fish within this slot length limit.  This assessment along with one scheduled in 2008 will be used to evaluate the experimental regulation.  The regulation will end in March of 2010.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling for other species by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium and large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Little McDonald Lake is a 1,174-acre mestrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles west of Perham, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 109 feet; however, 35% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.The secchi disk reading was 30.5 feet, indicating excellent water clarity.  Secchi disk readings in previous surveys ranged from 10.0 to 20.5 feet.   <br> \n     Heavy development (homes/cabins) exists around the entire lake.  DNR owned public water accesses are located along the north and south shorelines.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Areas of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent in the western portion of the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They are also important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 11.8 to 29.1 inches with an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 21.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill size structure is excellent; 59% of the sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.6 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Black crappie and largemouth bass are abundant.  Age data for these species indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Black crappies ranged in length from 4.9 to 12.0 inches and largemouth bass ranged in length from 5.5 to 19.3 inches. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie for this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.6 to 26.4 inches with an average length and weight of 15.1 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.2 inches at four years of age.  There is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot limit for walleye on Little McDonald Lake.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium and large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

The average weight of northern pike increased slightly from 2.3 lbs. in 1983 to 2.5 lbs.  Northern pike ages I+ to III+ were well represented in the sample.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased substantially from 119.6 per trap net lift in 1983 to 270.4 per trap net lift.  In each of these two surveys there has been no more than 12% of the bluegill sample greater than 7.0 inches in length. <br> \n     Age data indicates good reproduction and growth rates for both largemouth bass and black crappie.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance declined from 11.2 per gill net lift in 1983 to 4.0 per gill net lift.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance declined from 14.0 per gill net lift in 1983 to 8.5 per net; however, this catch rate still exceeds the area median.

                "narrative": "<p>     Little McDonald Lake is a 1,174-acre mestrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles west of Perham, MN. The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots. The maximum depth is 109 feet; however, 35% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth. The secchi disk reading was 19.8 feet, indicating excellent water clarity. Secchi disk readings in previous surveys ranged from 10.0 to 30.5 feet.   <br> \n     The entire shoreline of the lake has been developed. Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development. DNR owned public water accesses are located along the north and south shorelines.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel. Areas of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent in the western portion of the lake. Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality. Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They are also important nursery areas for all species of fish. Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations. <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.8 to 31.8 inches with an average length and weight of 21.3 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 19.8 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically been stable but the Walleye numbers in the 2020 survey were the lowest recorded. Walleyes ranged in length from 7.5 to 28.4 inches with an average length and weight of 20.7 inches and 3.5 pounds. Walleyes attain an average length of 14.8 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     An experimental regulation designed to maintain or improve the Walleye size structure in Little McDonald Lake was implemented in 1998 and was in effect through 2010. The regulation was an 18.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot limit with one Walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession. The regulation was reviewed and a public input meeting was held in the fall of 2010. In 2011, after overwhelming public support, the experimental regulation was amended and made into a special regulation and is now permanent. The amended regulation is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot limit with one Walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare. Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n      Little McDonald Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2013. Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters. Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations. Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Little McDonald Lake is a 1,174-acre mestrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles west of Perham, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 109 feet; however, 35% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 19.2 feet, indicating excellent water clarity.  Secchi disk readings in previous surveys ranged from 10.0 to 30.5 feet.   <br> \n     The entire shoreline of the lake has been extensively developed.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  DNR owned public water accesses are located along the north and south shorelines.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Areas of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent in the western portion of the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They are also important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Little McDonald Lake is a popular angling lake.  Species most sought after include Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well. <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 11.6 to 30.6 inches with an average length and weight of 20.0 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 21.9 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill size structure is good as 32% of the sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is also consistently good.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.5 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     The long-term trend has been an increase in Black Crappie abundance.  The 2012 year class is strong and should provide good crappie angling for several years.  Forty-seven percent of the Black Crappie sample was 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 8.8 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie for this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.0 to 28.0 inches with an average length and weight of 18.9 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.6 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     An experimental regulation designed to maintain or improve the Walleye size structure in Little McDonald Lake was implemented in 1998 and was in effect through 2010.  The regulation was an 18.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot limit with one Walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The regulation was reviewed and a public input meeting was held in the fall of 2010.  In 2011, after overwhelming public support, the experimental regulation was amended and made into a special regulation and is now permanent.  The amended regulation is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot limit with one Walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium and large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little McDonald Lake is a 1,174-acre lake located in north-central Otter Tail County, approximately six miles west of the city of Perham, MN.  It has a maximum depth of 109 feet and 35% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 13.2 feet.  Secchi disk readings from previous surveys have ranged from 10.0 to 14.5 feet.  A public access is located on the south shoreline; however, due to high water levels, the access is partially submerged making accessability difficult.  Little McDonald Lake is included in lake class 27 of the Minnesota DNR's lake classification scheme.      Heavy development exists around the lake.  One resort and 157 homes/cabins were located along the shoreline during the 2000 lake survey.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush and cattail) is prevalent in the western portion of the lake basin.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northen pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Little McDonald Lake contains good populations of the popular game fish species.  Northern pike abundance is at a moderate level and some large fish (> 30 inches) are present.  Pike ranged in length from 10.3 to 44.9 inches with an average length and weight of 20.0 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Pike exhibit good growth rates with an average length of 23.9 inches at five years of age.     Bluegill abundance has declined from previous surveys; however, there are good numbers of fish over seven inches in length present.  Forty-one percent of the bluegill were at least seven inches in length.  Bluegill reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Growth rates are moderate with an average length of 6.9 inches at six years of age.     Black crappie and largemouth bass are abundant. Test-net catch rates for these species have consistently exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 27.  Reproduction for these species also appears to be consistently good.  Black crappie ranged in length from 4.2 to 9.9 inches while bass ranged in length from 7.1 to 16.5 inches.     The walleye catch rate is up from the previous survey and exceeds the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 27.  Walleye ranged in length from 10.6 to 27.0 inches with a mean length and weight of 18.4 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Previous surveys and assessments have documented that walleye natural reproduction is limited.  It appears that walleye fingerling/yearling stocking is supplementing natural reproduction to produce viable walleye year classes.  Current walleye management includes stocking walleye fingerlings every two out of three years.  A spring trap net assessment in April of 2000 sampled 224 walleye ranging in length from 21.1 to 31.0 inches.      An experimental walleye slot length limit regulation (18 to 26 inch protected slot with one over 26 inches) went into effect in 1998.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain a target walleye gill net catch rate with 40% of the fish within this slot length limit.  Fish assessments in 2004 and 2008 will be used to evaluate the experimental regulation.  The regulation will end in March of 2010.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling for other species by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",
