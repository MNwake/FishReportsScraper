                "narrative": "<p>Whiteface Reservoir was established in 1923 as a hydropower water storage reservoir when earthen dams were constructed on the Whiteface River and Skunk Creek.  Much of the reservoir basin is flooded forest.  At summertime highs, the reservoir occupies 5600 acres and has a maximum depth of 35 feet.  The reservoir is located 1 mile east of Markham, MN.  Whiteface was last assessed in 2012.  Whiteface was surveyed during the summer of 2017 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye is the primary management species for Whiteface Reservoir.  Walleye have not been stocked into Whiteface since 1970 because sufficient natural reproduction has been documented to sustain the Walleye fishery.  Walleye abundance of 7.1 per gillnet lift was down from 2012 (7.7) but was still average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 12.5 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  However, growth has historically been slow for Walleye in Whiteface and is likely a function of the low relative productivity of the reservoir compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Several year-classes of young Walleye were evident in the sample suggesting angling for Walleye should remain strong for the next few years as these year-classes mature. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 1.0 per gillnet lift was nearly unchanged from 2012 (0.9) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was small at 18.7 inches but the catch was dominated by a strong 2014 year-class.  Anglers should expect improved size of Northern Pike as this year-class matures in 2018 and beyond.     <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 5.2 per trapnet lift represents a historic high catch rate for Whiteface but remains average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length was large at 7.9 inches.  The catch was dominated by a strong 2011 year-class.  Black Crappie abundance of 1.8 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes.  Average length was 11.0 inches with fish up to 12.3 inches sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whiteface Reservior was established in 1923 as a hydropower water storage reservoir when earthen dams were constructed on the Whiteface River and Skunk Creek.  Much of the reservoir basin is flooded forest.  At summertime highs, the reservoir occupies 5600 acres with a maximum depth of 35 feet.  Whiteface Reservoir is in lake class 16.  The fish community has been sampled 8 times since 1955.       Walleye abundance of 8.1 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 12.9 inches and length at age four was 12.8 inches, which is slow growth compared to other walleye populations in the Duluth Area.  Growth rate has remained slow over the past three investigations.  Age distribution was even with 9 year classes represented.  The 1998 and 1999 year classes appear strong, representing 48% of the walleye sample.  The walleye population in Whiteface Reservoir is healthy and should continue to provide some of the best walleye angling opportunities in the Duluth area.             Northern pike abundance of 1.7 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Catch rates have remained relatively low over the past 5 investigations.  Mean length was 20.8 inches and length at age four was 22.1 inches, which represents average growth compared to northern pike populations from other Duluth Area lakes. Age distribution was even, with 5 year classes from 1995 through 1999 represented.           Yellow perch abundance of 2.4 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Catch rates have remained relatively low over the past 5 investigations.  Mean length was 9.1 inches.  Stock, age, and growth parameters were not evaluated because yellow perch are primarily a forage species, and do not significantly contribute to the sport fishery.       Black crappie abundance of 1.4 per lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The 2001 catch rate was the highest to date on Whiteface Reservoir.  Mean length from the 2001 sample was 9.8 inches and length at age four was 8.3 inches, which represents average to fast growth compared to black crappie populations from other Duluth Area lakes.  Age distribution was even, with year classes from 1995 through 1999 represented.  Black crappies are slowly increasing in abundance and should provide good future angling opportunities.          Bluegill abundance of 3.1 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The 2001 catch rate was the highest to date on Whiteface Reservoir.  Mean length from 2001 was 7.3 inches and several individuals over \"preferred\" size (8 inches) were sampled.  Length at age four was 6.1 inches, which represents fast growth compared to other bluegill populations from within the Duluth Area.  While 7 year classes were represented, 1996, 1997, and 1998 were the strongest year classes.  Bluegills are slowly increasing in abundance and should provide good future angling opportunities.     Other species sampled during this assessment include rock bass, white sucker, painted turtle, and snapping turtle.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whiteface Reservoir is a 5600 acre, soft-water impoundment with a maximum depth of 33 feet.  There are two major inlets and two outlets controlled by earthern dikes with hand operated mechanical gates.  The Whiteface River runs through the reservoir and provides the majority of the inflow.  Access is possible at several points including a major US Forest Service campground on the north side.  Shoal water soils are composed mostly of a sandy gravel base with extensive areas of rubble and boulders in some areas.  There are two large marsh areas on the west and north sides with the remainder of the shoreline wooded with mixed conifers and hardwoods.  Cabin developments are heavy on the southern perimeter of the reservoir.     Water levels were high during the survey.  Vegetation is sparse due to wide variations of water levels during the year.  Temperatures are warm, typical of shallow lakes in the area, and dissolved oxygen levels are normal.  The waters are neutral having an average pH of 7.0 for three samples taken in June, July and August 1968 and are very soft with an average total alkalinity of 21.0 ppm.     Test netting indicated a very good walleye population with a test net catch of 5.67 fish per set, well above the watershed median of 3.24.  Walleye taken were well distributed in length from 6.0 to 21.0 inches.  The northern pike catch was about one-half the watershed median (1.5 per set compared to 3.0 per set).  Northern pike were well distributed throughout the reservoir, however.  A fair population of suckers and a low population of perch is indicated by the net catches.  Other species taken in very small numbers included bluegill, rock bass, black crappie and burbot.     Spawning conditions are good for walleyes in many parts of the reservoir.  Shoreline marshes and several inlets provide northern pike spawning areas.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whiteface Reservoir was established in 1923 as a hydropower water storage reservoir when earthen dams were constructed on the Whiteface River and Skunk Creek.  Much of the reservoir basin is flooded forest.  At summertime highs, the reservoir occupies 5600 acres and has a maximum depth of 35 feet.  The reservoir is located 1 mile east of Markham, MN.  Whiteface was surveyed during the summer of 2007 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have not been stocked into Whiteface since 1970 because sufficient natural reproduction has been documented to sustain the walleye fishery.  Walleye abundance of 9.6 per gillnet lift was up from 2001 (8.1) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 11.5 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Only 13% of the walleyes sampled were over 15 inches in length.  All year-classes from 1996 to 2006 were represented, except 2000.  Eighty-eight percent of the walleye catch was age one through four. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 1.2 per gillnet lift was up from 2001 (1.7) but was still below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Catch rates have remained relatively low over the past several investigations.  Average length was 19.0 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 1998 to 2005 were represented, except 1999. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 2.9 per trapnet lift was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was good at 8.7 inches, and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Twenty-three percent of the fish sampled were over 10 inches in length.  All year-classes from 2000 to 2007 were represented, with strong 2004 and 2005 year-classes.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 2.9 per trapnet lift was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and relatively unchanged from 2001 (3.1).  Average size was 7.5 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Fifty-three percent of the fish captured were greater than 8 inches.  All year classes from 1998 to 2007 were represented, with a strong 2002 year-class (30%).  Overall, both black crappie and bluegill catch has been increasing steadily for the past four investigations, dating back to 1986. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 1.6 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and down from the 2001 population assessment (2.4).  Average length of perch was good at 8.9 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Thirty percent of the perch sampled were over 10 inches in length.  The 1998 and 2000 year-classes were absent, but all other year-classes from 1997 through 2005 were represented.    <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include Johnny darters, rock bass, trout perch, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiners, logperch, mottled sculpin, spottail shiners, tadpole madtoms and white suckers.    <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was good with 32 species or species groups identified along 40 transects.  Most of the plants documented were either emergent or floating leaf plant types.  Submergent plants are rare in Whiteface likely because of the abundance of rocky substrate, poor water clarity due to bog stain and frequent water level fluctuations.  Reed canary grass was the most frequently found plant (58% of transects) followed by wool-grass and cattail group (28% and 25% of transects, respectively).  The most common substrate types were rubble, gravel and boulder which were identified along 75%, 73% and 68% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Whiteface is a slightly alkaline, slightly hard water lake with moderate fertility.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whiteface was established in 1923 as a hydropower water storage reservoir when earthen dams were constructed on the Whiteface River and Skunk Creek.  Much of the lake contains flooded forest.  At summertime highs, the reservoir occupies 5600 acres with a maximum depth of 35 feet.  Annual water levels fluctuate drastically, 8 to 10 feet, reaching the lowest level in early spring.  The fish community is primarily composed of walleye, northern pike, white sucker and yellow perch.  Black crappie and bluegill are more recent inhabitants.     Results of the 1996 survey indicated a very good walleye population with an average gillnet catch of 7.6 per net.  Sizes ranged from 6.2 to 22.3 inches with many walleyes measuring from 14 to 18 inches.  Northern pike numbers were on the low side of average with 2.6 pike caught per net.  Average length was 19.9 inches with an occasional fish over 30 inches.  Yellow perch numbers remained low, however, the average length was 9.4 inches and several were measured over 11 inches.     Black crappie and bluegill numbers, although quite low, increased slightly from previous investigations.  Average length was 9.7 inches for crappies and 8.0 inches for bluegills making for some nice catches when anglers can find them.  Anglers also might catch rock bass, pumpkinseed or white suckers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whiteface Reservoir was established in 1923 as a hydropower water storage reservoir when earthen dams were constructed on the Whiteface River and Skunk Creek.  Much of the reservoir basin is flooded forest.  At summertime highs, the reservoir occupies 5600 acres and has a maximum depth of 35 feet.  The reservoir is located 1 mile east of Markham, MN.  Whiteface was last surveyed in 2007.  Whiteface was assessed during the summer of 2012 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have not been stocked into Whiteface since 1970 because sufficient natural reproduction has been documented to sustain the walleye fishery.  Walleye abundance of 7.7 per gillnet lift was down from 2007 (9.6) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 12.3 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Growth has remained slow for walleyes in Whiteface over the past five investigations.  Recruitment was consistent with all year-classes present from 2001 through 2012.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 0.9 per gillnet lift was up from 2007 (1.2) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  This sample represents the lowest abundance of northern pike on Whiteface, and abundance has been decreasing steadily over the last 5 investigations dating back to 1989.  Average length was good at 24.5 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2005 through 2011 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 3.1 per trapnet lift was up from 2007 (2.9) and average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie abundance has been increasing steadily for the past five investigations, dating back to 1986.  Black crappie mean length was 7.8 inches, and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2006 to 2011 were represented, except 2007.  The 2010 year-class was strong, contributing to 72% of the overall catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 2.7 per trapnet lift was down from 2007 (2.9) and average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 6.7 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Thirty-one percent of the fish captured were greater than 8 inches.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2010 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 1.8 per gillnet lift was up from 2007 (1.6) but still below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 7.3 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2006 to 2010 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.</p>",

There is a back-in concrete boat ramp located on the south end near the outlet dam off of the Blais Road.  Another public access with a boat ramp exists on the north end of the lake near the US Forest Service campground that is also open to public use.   <br> \n <br> \nWhiteface has a history of producing large Bluegill and Black Crappie and new angling regulations to improve and protect these species are under consideration.  The proposed regulation is a daily limit of 5 sunfish, possession limit of 20 and a daily limit of 5 Black Crappie, possession limit 10.  The objective of this targeted survey was to obtain baseline information to describe Bluegill and Black Crappie size structure, age structure and growth prior to implementation of the reduced bag limit angling regulation change.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill spring trapnet abundance was 16.7 per lift.  Average length of Bluegill was 8.2 inches and maximum size was 9.7 inches.  The proportion of adult Bluegill that exceeded quality size (greater than 6 inches) was 99%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 8 inches) was 67%.  Recruitment was consistent with all year-classes from 2010 to 2019 represented.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie spring trapnet abundance was 2.1 per lift.  Average length of Black Crappie was 9.7 inches and maximum size was 12.1 inches.  The proportion of adult Black Crappie that exceeded quality size (greater than 8 inches) was 97%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 10 inches) was 33%.  The proportion that exceeded memorable size (greater than 12 inches) was 4%.  Recruitment was consistent with all year-classes from 2013 to 2018 represented.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whiteface Reservoir was established in 1923 as a hydropower water storage reservoir when earthen dams were constructed on the Whiteface River and Skunk Creek.  Much of the reservoir basin is flooded forest.  At summertime highs, the reservoir occupies 4,567 acres and has a maximum depth of 35 feet.  The reservoir is located one mile east of Markham, MN.  There is a back-in concrete boat ramp located on the south end near the outlet dam off of the Blais Road.  Another public access with a boat ramp exists on the north end of the lake near the US Forest Service campground that is also open to public use.   <br> \n <br> \nSpecial angling regulations designed to protect and improve Whiteface Reservoir's high quality sunfish and Black Crappie populations were implemented in 2021.  The regulations are a daily limit of five sunfish, possession limit of 20 and a daily limit of five Black Crappie, possession limit 10.  Walleye have not been stocked into Whiteface since 1970 because sufficient natural reproduction has been documented to sustain the Walleye fishery.  Whiteface was last surveyed by DNR Fisheries in 2017.  Whiteface was surveyed during the summer of 2022 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 9.6 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 12.5 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  However, growth has historically been slow for Walleye in Whiteface and is likely a function of the low relative productivity of the reservoir compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Several strong year-classes of young Walleye were evident in the sample suggesting angling for Walleye should remain strong for the next few years as these year-classes mature. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 3.3 per trapnet lift was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length was large at 7.9 inches with fish over 10 inches sampled.  The proportion of adult Bluegill that exceeded quality size (greater than 6 inches) was 82%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 8 inches) was 69%.  Recruitment was consistent with all year-classes from 2013 to 2020 represented.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 1.4 per trapnet lift was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length was 9.6 inches.  The proportion of adult Black Crappie that exceeded quality size (greater than 8 inches) was 84%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 10 inches) was 52%.  Recruitment was consistent with all year-classes from 2015 to 2021 represented.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 2.3 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was small at 19.5 inches.  Channel Catfish may provide an incidental fishery as one large fish was captured.</p>",
