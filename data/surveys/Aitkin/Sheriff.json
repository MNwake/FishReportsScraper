Data from this survey will be used to evaluate the current stocking strategy, which began in 2009, and calls for walleye fingerling stocking at a rate of 2 lbs/littoral acre in even numbered years as well as annual adult yellow perch stocking at a rate of up to 10 lbs/surface acre when available.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked at or above the target rate in 2010, 2012, and 2014.  However, availability of yellow perch has been inconsistent, therefore they were stocked only in 2009 (361 lbs), 2010 (351 lbs), and 2011 (13 lbs).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch (0.5/net) was similar to 2006 (0.3/net) and remained low compared to historic high catches observed in 1970 (12.0/net) and 1980 (7.3/net).  Yellow perch catch (1 fish) was also similar to 2006 (no fish) and well below the historic high catch in 1985 (16.3/net). <br> \nNorthern pike catch (9.3/net) was above the interquartile range for lake class 20 for the fourth consecutive survey since 1990.  Size ranged from 16.7 to 30.5\" and averaged 21.8\" and 2.3 pounds.  Pike were stocked regularly from 1962 to 1972 with the most recent stocking in 1982 and 1984 indicating natural reproduction is responsible for maintaining the population at the current high level. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass catch (2.3/net) was similar to 2006 (2.8/net) and above the interquartile range for lake class 20. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch (20.8/net) increased significantly since the previous high catch (6.8/net) in 2006 (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test: n=4, p=0.10).  Size averaged 6.6\" with fish up to 13.4\" sampled. <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullhead catch (8.5/net) also increased significantly since the previous high catch (5.3/net) in 2006 (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test: n=4, p=0.10). <br> \n</p>",

Walleyes are stocked regularly in the lake, and stocking has contributed substantially to the population. The gillnet catch of 2.3 walleyes per set in this survey is above average for lakes of this type, which are small, deep, infertile, clear and mostly bowl-shaped. The mean weight of the walleyes is also above average, mostly due to acceptable growth and the survival of larger fish.      Northern pike in Sheriff Lake are relatively abundant and are relatively small, averaging only 17.6 inches long, and growth is slow for older pike. Yellow perch, a major prey for pike, have decreased in abundance since the 1980 and 1985 surveys. Fewer perch result in slower growth and smaller mean size for pike in this lake. The largest pike in this survey was only 26.9 inches long.    Black crappies grow well and their size distribution is good. Abundance is relatively low, yet the average length is a respectable 9.6 inches.    Bluegills grow slowly and are below average in abundance for this lake type. The lake's infertility leads to less production in shallow areas and sunfishes tend to grow slowly as a result. Yellow perch also grow slowly because of low prey availability in shallow areas.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sheriff Lake is an 85-acre lake located in east central Aitkin County.  The lake supports a variety of game fish populations including walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, largemouth bass, bluegill and black crappie. Historically, walleye stocking supported a decent walleye fishery for a lake of this type varying from 2 to 12 per gill net from 1970 through 1996. However, recent surveys (2006, 2014, 2016) have found walleye fingerling survival to be minimal. In 2016, there were no walleye sampled in the gill nets prompting a management change to discontinue walleye fingerling stocking, let forage base rebuild and implement a fry stocking strategy.  <br> \n <br> \nWhen available, yellow perch from Rice Lake refuge are also stocked to provide forage for gamefish and opportunities for anglers.  The gill net catch for yellow perch increased to 7.5 per net, indicating good survival from a mixed age stocking in 2014 and January 2016.  This marks the highest recorded abundance of yellow perch since the mid 1990's.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike sampled in gillnets ranged from 13 to 28 inches in length with an average length of 23 inches.  Northern pike are relatively abundant for this lake type at 7.8 fish per gill net lift and catch rates have been stable for the last 27 years. Northern pike growth rates are above average with 38% larger than 24 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catches decreased from a spike in 2014 (20.8/gill net) to 2016 (2.8/gill net), which is within the normal range for this type of lake and near the long term median for Sheriff Lake.  Bluegill catches increased since 2006, but size remained small with a mean length of 5.0 inches and only one fish over 8 inches observed in the samples. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sheriff Lake is an 85-acre lake located in east central Aitkin County.  The lake supports a varied game fish population including walleye, northern pike, bluegill and black crappie. Stocking supports the walleye population with fingerling walleye being stocked every third year at a rate of three pounds per littoral acre. Northern pike sampled in gillnets ranged from 13 to 34 inches in length with an average length of 21 inches.  Northern pike are relatively abundant for this lake type at 8 fish per gillnet lift. Northern pike growth rates are above average and some acceptable sized fish were sampled.  Almost 20 percent of the fish sampled were 25 inches or more in length.  Walleye catch rates reached an all time low in 2006 at 0.25 fish per gillnet and size ranged from 22 to 27 inches indicating poor survival of stocked fingerlings.  Bluegill and black crappie catches were low for this lake type and mean lengths were 5.5 inches for bluegill and 7.6 inches for crappie.  Yellow perch numbers have decreased dramatically over the years likely due to increased predation by northern pike and walleye.  Low perch numbers can have negative effects on the survival and growth of walleye and northern pike.</p>",

Perch are stocked as adults, when available, from nearby Rice Lake during an annual Northern Pike trapping project in an effort to rebuild the forage base and potentially provide an opportunity for anglers. Yellow Perch were first stocked in 2009 and a survey of the lake in 2016 showed increasing numbers. Seven seine hauls caught a total of 18 Yellow Perch ranging in size from 3.5 to 5.2 inches indicating some survival and reproduction, yet no young-of-the-year perch were found. Yellow Perch provide beneficial forage for Northern Pike and Walleye and may benefit those populations if they can recover in Sheriff Lake.</p>",

The trap net index for yellow bullhead was below the lake class 20 first quartile.  The trap net index for pumpkinseed was above the lake class 20 third quartile. Northern pike sampled (42 of 51 aged) ranged from one to eight plus years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1988 and 1989.  The growth rates for the first and second increments were faster than normal.  The growth rates for the third through the fifth increments were slower. Length at the fifth annulus formation was normal. Bluegill sampled (44 of 70 aged) ranged from two to eight years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1986 and 1987.  The growth rates for the first, second and third increments were slower than normal. Black crappie sampled (13 of 13 aged) ranged from one to seven years of age with a strong 1989 year class.  The growth rate for the third increment was faster than normal.  Length at the formation of the sixth annulus was normal. Yellow perch sampled (26 of 30 aged) ranged from three to eight years of age with strong year classes indicated in 1986 and 1987.  The growth rates for the first and second increments were slower than normal.  Length at the formation of the fifth annulus was smaller than normal. Walleye sampled (13 of 18 aged) ranged from two to eight plus years of age with strong years classes in 1984 and 1986.  The strong year classes indicate a positive influence of the yearling walleye stocking in 1985 and 1987.  The fish from the 1989 stocking were not large enough to be efficiently sampled in 1990.  Growth rates were normal. Northern pike have increased significantly (237%) in abundance, from 4.75 to 11.25 per gill net, since the 1985 population assessment (based on four gill net sets). Yellow perch have shown a significant decrease in abundance since 1985, from 16.5 to 7.0 per gill net (58%). Walleye decreased significantly in abundance from 7.33 to 2.0 per gill net (73%) from 1980 to 1985.  The gillnet catch index for 1990 indicates that the abundance of walleye has not changed since 1985.</p>",
