                "narrative": "<p>A fish survey was conducted at Glen Lake on the 5-8 of July 2005.  Glen Lake is a 98-acre lake located in Minnetonka. There are no fishing piers or shorefishing structures, and limited opportunities for open water fishing.  The lake is accessible for ice fishing via city owned land located on the northern shoreline off Kinsel Road and on the eastern shoreline off Mayview Road, Minnetonka.   Glen Lake's fish community is influenced by occasional winterkill events.  Small panfish dominate the fish community. Bluegills were sampled at an abundance above the third quartile level for similar lakes, 57.2 fish per trap net.  Bluegills sampled had a mean length of 5.1 inches and normal growth rates.  Black crappie abundance was low; only 7 crappies (7.1 inches mean length) were sampled during the survey.   Northern pike abundance was above median levels for similar lakes, with an average of 7.0 fish per gill net.  Two year classes were represented in the survey, ages two and three (15 of 15 aged); growth rates were normal.  Northern pike ranged from 16.9 to 26.1 inches, with a mean length of 21.5 inches and mean weight of 2.1 pounds.    Largemouth bass were present in the gill net and trap net samples representing 2 year classes (3 of 3 aged).  The mean length and weight of largemouth bass sampled were 13.8 inches and 1.3 pounds. Anglers contacted during the survey indicated that bass are often caught on Glen Lake.Other species sampled included black bullheads and low numbers of green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and brown bullheads.  A large number of turtles were also sampled during the survey: 14 snapping turtles and 65 painted turtles.Water quality measurements were taken in 25.5 feet of water.  Dissolved oxygen was present (7.1 ppm) down to 8 feet with a water temperature of 23.0 C above the thermocline.  The secchi depth measurement was 10.0 feet. Glen Lake has a diverse native aquatic plant community.  A point-intercept vegetation survey was conducted on Glen Lake to describe the aquatic plant community (Madsen, 1999; Donna Perleberg, personal communication 2005).  The survey was primarily focused on submerged vegetation.  Areas of floating leaf vegetation, bulrush and cattails were also noted.  Prior to the survey, 146 regularly spaced sample points were established in the open water area of Glen Lake using ArcView GIS 3.3.  During the survey, where floating leaf vegetation was dense, no submerged vegetation was sampled in order to protect floating leaf vegetation from disturbance.  Therefore, percent occurrence for submerged vegetation is reported as a percent of the 115 points where submerged vegetation samples were taken.Floating leaf vegetation, including white waterlily, Nympaea odorata; yellow waterlily, Nuphar variegatum; and watershield, Brasenia schreberi were present at 32% of the sample points (29.5%, 15%, and 3% respectively).  Coontail, Ceratophyllum demersum was the most common submerged vegetation, present at 62.6% of the sampling points.  Other common submerged vegetation and their percent occurrence included: canada waterweed, Elodea canadensis (53.9%); flat stem pondweed, Potamogeton zosteriformis (50.4%); northern water milfoil, Myriophyllum exalbescens (18.3%); large leafed pondweed, Potamogeton amplifolius (13.9%), and muskgrass, Chara spp. (12.2%).  Sago pondweed, Potamogeton pectinatus; bushy pondweed, Najas flexilis; and bladderwort, Utricularia spp. were present, but uncommon (<1% of sample points).Submerged vegetation was present out to 14 feet of water, and occasionally present at depths up to 20 feet.  The number of submerged vegetation species per sampling point ranged from 0 to 5, with an average of 2.2 species per point.  </p>",
