Shell Lake is 3,140 acres, located 21 miles northeast of Detroit Lakes, MN.  During this survey, 24 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with either a 50-foot or a 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this survey, seven sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine, and nine were was sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Site conditions prevented the use of seines at eight sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at 24 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including one species intolerant of disturbance and/or poor water quality (Iowa Darter).  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brown Bullhead, Central Mudminnow, Common Shiner, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Tadpole Madtom, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from an August, 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Shell Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> Shell Lake is a large, shallow, fertile lake that is subject to occasional winterkills.  Some winterkill was observed in 2014 that reduced populations of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye.  As a result, 136 Black Crappie adults, 720 Bluegill adults, and approximately 3.4 million Walleye fry were stocked into Shell Lake in spring of 2014.   Each of these species has now been reestablished, and the 2016 assessment catch rates confirmed the winterkill was not 100% and good recovery of most species has occurred.  Natural immigration is also possible via the Shell River, Shell Lake's outlet stream.  Extensive stands of wild rice are found in shoal waters throughout much of the lake, and waterfowl hunting is an important recreational use of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes sampled in the 2016 assessment averaged 19.4 inches in length and 3.0 pounds in weight.  Catch rates were near the historical average for Shell Lake, at 2.9 per net.  Walleyes from eight year classes were sampled, and the population appears to have rebounded following the winterkill of 2014. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates remained relatively high, well above the historical average for Shell Lake, at 36.1 per net.  Young Bluegills were most abundant, but some over eight inches were also found.  Bluegills reach 5.7 inches in four years, and eight to ten years to grow to a desirable size of eight inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate is above the historical average for Shell Lake, with the average size sampled of 8.0 inches.  Crappies up to 12.1 inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nA high population of young, relatively small Northern Pike was present.  Catch rates for Northern Pike were well above the historical average for Shell Lake.  The size range of Pike sampled was between 9.2 inches and 34.4 inches, with an average length of 20.1 inches, and an average weight of 2.0 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nCarp, White Sucker, Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow and Brown Bullheads were also found in standard gill nets and trap nets during the 2016 study.  Carp are likely immigrants via the Shell River.  No Black Bullheads were sampled during the 2016 assessment, following a steady decrease in catch rates since the 2000 assessment.  Yellow and Brown Bullheads are present, with average lengths 9.5 inches and 11.6 inches, respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in any lake are reflections of their habitat and watershed.  Shell Lake and its surrounding watershed are primarily forested, yet increased development may put the watershed at risk for increased surface runoff and increased nutrients coming into the lake.  Following shoreland regulation established by the DNR, PCA, and Becker County can help ensure that the water quality and overall health of Shell Lake withstands the environmental pressure within the watershed.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shell Lake is a large, shallow, fertile lake that is subject to occasional winterkills.  A severe winterkill in 1996 reduced gamefish populations leaving mostly bullheads, white suckers, and a few northern pike.  Walleye, bluegills, largemouth bass, and black crappie were stocked following the winterkill in 1996.  Each of these species has been reestablished and the 2005 assessment showed catch rates were generally at or above historical averages for Shell Lake.  Natural immigration is also possible via the Shell River, Shell Lake's outlet stream.  No winterkills have occurred since 1996 and it appears the formerly abundant black bullhead population is slowly being replaced by fish more desirable to anglers.  Extensive stands of wild rice are found in shoal waters throughout much of the lake and waterfowl hunting has traditionally been another important recreational use of the lake.Most of the common gamefish and panfish species sustain their populations in Shell Lake by natural reproduction unless they are impacted by winterkill.  Regular fry stocking, however, sustains the walleye fishery.  Other species are stocked only as brood fish after winterkills.  Walleyes sampled in the 2005 assessment averaged 16.6 inches in length and 1.8 pounds in weight.  The mean weight of northern pike was also 1.8 pounds, but the mean length was 20.4 inches.  Bluegill catches were higher than during any previous study.  Young fish were most abundant, but some large ones were also found.  Growth rates were good for all species and the relatively young populations of northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill should add to the fishery in the next couple of years if no winter kill occurs.It is important that nutrient input to shallow, winterkill-susceptible lakes like Shell Lake be minimized to lessen the winterkill potential and protect water quality.  Lakeshore residents can help by following shoreland best management practices that include leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact (especially bulrush and cattail beds), not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, ensuring compliance of septic systems, and using practices described in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality.\"</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shell Lake is a 3,140-acre lake located in east central Becker County.  .  There is a state-owned access on the west shore of the lake.  Extensive stands of wild rice are found in shoal waters throughout much of the lake, and waterfowl hunting is an important recreational use of the lake.  It is shallow (16-foot maximum depth), fertile, and is subject to occasional winterkills.  A couple of minor kills took place between 1989 and 1993, the winter of 2017-2018, and the winter of 2021 to 2022.  Severe events have happened in 1996, 2014, and the winter of 2022 to 2023.  A standard fisheries survey was conducted in mid-August 2022 to assess the fish populations at Shell Lake, but results should be used with caution due to the winterkill observed after this survey was completed. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish population in Shell Lake is still recovering from past winterkill events.  In 2022, Walleye abundance was near average for Shell Lake.  Walleye size was 16 to 23 inches with an average length of 18 inches.  Northern Pike abundance was at an all-time high in 2022, with the population dominated by small fish.  The average pike was 19 inches long with the largest fish measuring 37 inches.  Only 2% of the pike measured were 24 inches or longer.  The abundance of Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie was below average in 2022.  Bluegill were five to six inches long, and Yellow Perch averaged seven inches long.  Largemouth Bass had an average length of 16 inches and Black Crappie were 10 inches or less in length.  Brown Bullheads were captured in record high numbers in gill nets in 2022.  Other fish species sampled in 2022 include Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shell Lake is recognized as one of those \"in between\" lakes that is too shallow for a permanent fish lake and too deep for maximum waterfowl use.  While severe winterkill is not frequent in Shell Lake (most recently 1971 and 1996), light winterkill occurs more often.  However, the lake's northern pike and bullhead populations survive and thrive without help.  Walleye, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass are stocked following winterkill and have provided productive fisheries between heavy winterkills.While severe winterkills can be disheartening to anglers,lakeshore owners, and resort operators, it must be recognized they are natural occurrences that have been taking place in this type of lake for hundreds of years.  Winterkill occurs when snow and ice cover prevent sunlight from reaching oxygen-producing plants and algae.  The decay and respiration processes for plants and fish consume dissolved oxygen faster than it can be produced.  This results in death for fish that cannot tolerate low levels of dissolved oxygen.  Walleye, bluegill, and largemouth bass are some of the more sensitive species.The good side of winterkill is that surviving fish and those that are stocked shortly thereafter have little competition for available food and space.  This allows faster than normal growth for most fish species in winterkill lakes, at least for several years following a heavy winterkill.The 1996 winterkill occurred after the 1995 test netting study was completed but before this report was written.  Consequently, the fish information in this report no longer applies to the current fish community.  Walleye, bass, and panfish populations were devastated in early 1996.  Those species were restocked in spring 1996.  A quick recovery of the fishery for those species (3-5 years) is expected if no heavy winterkill occurs.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shell Lake is a large shallow lake that is subject to occasional winterkills.  It is a lightly developed lake located in eastern Becker County.  A severe winterkill in 1996 decimated the gamefish population leaving mostly bullheads, white suckers, and a few northern pike.  Walleye, bluegills, largemouth bass, and black crappie were stocked following the winterkill in 1996.  Natural immigration is also possible via the Shell River, Shell Lake's outlet stream.  No winterkills have occurred since 1996.The gamefish populations in Shell Lake are still in the process of recovering from the 1996 winterkill.  The 2000 survey indicated northern pike, bluegills, largemouth bass and black crappies are producing offspring but numbers are still low.  Stocked walleye fry from 1996, 1997, and 1999 are exhibiting good growth and a modest population of \"keeper\" walleyes is now present.  Walleye fry will again be stocked in 2001.It is important that nutrient input to shallow, winterkill susceptible lakes like Shell Lake be minimized to lessen the winterkill potential.  Lakeshore residents can help significantly in this regard by following shoreland best management practices that include: (1) leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, (2) leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail beds, (3) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4) ensuring compliance of septic systems, and (5) utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shell Lake is a large, shallow, fertile lake that is subject to occasional winterkills.  A severe winterkill in 1996 reduced gamefish populations leaving mostly bullheads, white suckers, and a few northern pike.  Walleye, bluegills, largemouth bass, and black crappie were reintroduced following the winterkill in 1996.  Each of these species has now been reestablished and the 2010 assessment showed catch rates were generally near or above historical averages for Shell Lake.  Natural immigration is also possible via the Shell River, Shell Lake's outlet stream.  No winterkills have occurred since 1996 and it appears the formerly abundant black bullhead population is being replaced by fish more desirable to anglers.  Extensive stands of wild rice are found in shoal waters throughout much of the lake and waterfowl hunting has traditionally been another important recreational use of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nMost of the common gamefish and panfish species sustain their populations in Shell Lake by natural reproduction unless they are impacted by winterkill.  Regular fry stocking, however, sustains the walleye fishery.  Other species are stocked only as brood fish after winterkills.  Walleyes sampled in the 2010 assessment averaged 16.2 inches in length and 1.6 pounds in weight.  The mean weight of northern pike has increased to 2.3 pounds and the mean length was 21.6 inches.  Bluegill catches remained relatively high.  Young fish were most abundant but some over eight inches were also found.  It takes about eight to ten years to grow an eight-inch bluegill in Shell Lake.  As one Fisheries Manager stated, \"You can grow two trophy bucks in the amount of time it takes to grow one trophy fish.\"  Growth rates were moderate to good for all species and the relatively young populations of northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill should add to the fishery in the next couple of years if no winterkill occurs. <br> \n <br> \nIt is important that nutrient input to shallow, winterkill-susceptible lakes like Shell Lake be minimized to lessen the winterkill potential and protect water quality.  Lakeshore residents can help by following shoreland best management practices that include leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact (especially bulrush and cattail beds), not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, ensuring compliance of septic systems, and using practices described in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality.\" <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shell Lake is a 3,140-acre lake located in east central Becker County.  Extensive stands of wild rice are found in shoal waters throughout much of the lake, and waterfowl hunting is an important recreational use of the lake.  Because much of the lake is shallow, Shell Lake is subject to occasional winterkills.  A couple of minor kills took place between 1989 and 1993, the winter of 2017-2018, and the winter of 2021-2022.  Severe events have happened in 1996, 2014, and the winter of 2022-2023.  Property owners reported abundant dead fish in the spring of 2023.  A targeted fisheries survey was conducted on 05/10/2023 to 05/11/2023 to assess the severity of the winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nDead fish of all species were observed while surveying.  Trap nets captured Northern Pike, White Sucker, Yellow Perch, and three species of Bullhead, all species which are more tolerant to low oxygen conditions.  Bullheads were abundant.  Northern Pike were caught in good numbers with an average length of 19 inches.  Shell Lake appears to have experienced a significant winterkill for Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass during the 2022-2023 winter.  Walleye were reintroduced during 2023. Angling opportunities for Northern Pike are still available, but it will take a few years to have quality fishing for other species.</p>",

Though the largest walleye year class is 1989, a year of fry stocking, there are two fairly well-represented age groups from non-stocking years as well.  Walleye abundance has increased significantly since the seventies and early eighties-probably due to relatively mild winters during the past decade.  Bluegills have steadily increased to above average numbers, below average size and faster than average growth.  Coincidentally, bluegills were the most observed species during the 1989 partial winterkill.  Black crappies remain somewhat low in abundance with average sizes and growth rates.  The bullhead population, mostly blacks and browns, is very high with small average weights.  Yellow perch numbers caught are within the average range for similar lakes but they remain on the low end of that range.</p>",
