                "narrative": "<p>Little Hanging Horn is a 117 acre lake with 51 (44%) acres of littoral aea and a maximum depth of 70 feet.  Little Hanging Horn is located just southeast of Barnum, MN off Highway #13.  Little Hanging Horn has a Township administered public access at the northern most point of the lake.  Access can also be gained at the Highway #13 causeway at the south corner of the west arm.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in 1998, 1995, 1993 and 1991.  Walleye fry have been stocked in 1989 and 1987.  Fish population investigations have been conducted in 1959, 1971, 1983, 1986, 1990, 1996 and 2000.  Largemouth bass have been sampled with electrofishing in 1992, 1996 and 2000.     Walleye abundance indexed with assessment nets was 0.5 per lift.  This index value was below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Too few walleye were sampled to make an accurate determination of size and growth rate.  From a sample of aged walleye it was determined that 2 of 6 were born in years that walleye fingerlings were stocked.     Northern pike abundance indexed with assessment nets was 6.3 per lift.  This value was near average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of northern pike was poor and growth was slow.  Mean length of sampled northern pike was 19.3 inches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 19.4 inches.  From a sample of aged northern pike it was determined that 69% were born in 1997 or 1998.     Black crappie abundance indexed with assessment nets was 1.8 per lift.  This index value was near average compared to other minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of black crappie was poor but growth was fast.  Mean length of sampled black crappie was 6.5 inches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 8.5 inches.  From a sample of aged black crappie it was determined that no crappie were older than age IV.     Bluegill abundance indexed with assessment nets was 6.3 per lift.  This index value was much below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of bluegill was poor and growth was very slow.  Mean length of sampled bluegill was 5.0 iches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 3.4 inches.  From a sample of aged bluegill it was determined that 1995 and 1997 were strong year classes.     Largemouth bass were sampled during a spring electrofishing assessment conducted on the night of 5/22/2000.  A total of 28 largemouth bass were sampled for a catch rate of 57.7 per hour of electrofishing.  Size was good and growth rate was fast.  Mean length of sampled bass was 11.8 inches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 12.5 inches.  A sample of aged largemouth bass showed every year class from 1992 through 1999 represented.     Other fish species sampled included pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee, white sucker, green sunfish, silver redhorse, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, common shiner and spottail shiner.  Tullibee are much less abundant in Little Hanging Horn than Big Hanging Horn.</p>",

Although 70 feet deep, during the summer only the upper 16 feet is suitable as fish habitat.  The fish community is comprised of northern pike and largemouth bass and an occasional walleye as the primary predators while bluegill, black crappie, pumpkinseed and tullibee are the primary prey species.     Northern pike numbers were low with pike averaging 19.6 inches in length and ranging between 13.6 and 28.0 inches.  Largemouth bass numbers were average with a size range between 4.7 and 19.6 inches and averaging 11.4 inches in length.  While only 9 walleyes were captured in the 1996 assessment, they tend to be large, averaging 19.4 inches with a maximum length of 25.4 inches.     Overall, panfish numbers were low with small average sizes, 6.8 inches for bluegill, 4.6 inches for pumpkinseed and 6.8 inches for black crappie.  Anglers might also encounter tullibee, white sucker and shorthead redhorse.  The angler should be aware of aggressive snapping turtles which will dine on their fish should they be left on the stringer too long.</p>",
