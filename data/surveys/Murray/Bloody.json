                "narrative": "<p>Bloody Lake is a shallow basin (maximum depth of 9 feet) that is 248 acres and is located in Murray County. Bloody Lake is connected to Lake Shetek by a channel large enough for watercraft to pass through, thus its fishery is influenced heavily by management activities and the existing fish community on Lake Shetek. Bloody Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nBloody Lake experienced a major fish kill during the winter of 2022-2023. Prior to the fish kill, stocking had not occurred since 2010 with fish maintained successfully via migration from Lake Shetek. After the winterkill, Bloody Lake was restocked with 248,000 Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) Walleye fry from the Lake Sarah egg take operation. Lake Shetek was restocked with 1.7 million LMS Walleye fry as well. Black Crappie were reared in ponds at Lake Shetek State Park with age-0 fish produced in the ponds drained into Lake Shetek. Yellow Perch were not restocked because they were observed in good numbers (5.5 per gill net) during a netting survey in May. Two Northern Pike were also caught in nets during the Lake Shetek survey and a private rearing pond connected to Bloody Lake (Malone's Pond) was stocked and operated to boost the population in Bloody and Shetek Lakes. Bloody Lake was surveyed using one gill net and three trap nets the week of August 10, 2023 to determine the recovery of Bloody Lake after the winterkill and restocking efforts. <br> \n <br> \nEleven species of fish were captured during sampling (see GN and TN results). Four species (Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Green Sunfish, and Orangespotted Sunfish) were not sampled in 2023 but were present before the winterkill event in 2022-2023. One species, White Sucker, was captured in 2023 but not prior to the winterkill. When looking at the management species, Walleye (2 per GN, 7 per TN), Black Crappie (6 per GN, 11 per TN), Northern Pike (2 per GN, 6.33 per TN), and Yellow Perch (9 per GN, 5.67 per TN) all showed large reductions in adult fish present. In fact, only age-0 Walleye, age-0 Black Crappie, and age-0 Northern Pike were sampled with no adult members of each of those species. Similar to Lake Shetek winterkill, Yellow Perch adults seemed to fair best of all management species. Encouragingly, Walleye, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike restocking and/or natural recruitment seem adequate to quickly repopulate the lake. Harvest oriented angling will be tough with many small fish caught over the next year or two, however, when these fish reach harvestable size the angling success could be very good.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile Bloody Lake did experience a major fish kill during the winter of 2022-2023, there is much to be encouraged about. Walleye, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike restocking or natural recruitment all seem adequate to quickly repopulation the lake. In addition, Lake Shetek is poised to have a very strong year-class of stocked age-0 Walleye that should move in and out of Bloody Lake as well. Also, Yellow Perch adults faired very well in Bloody and Shetek Lakes and should add some angling attention over the next year or two as the rest of the fish community continues to recover and grow to larger harvestable sizes. Walleye should reach harvestable size (13-14 inches) by the winter of 2024-2025. Black Crappie should reach harvestable size (9 inches) by the spring of 2025. Northern Pike should reach the southern zone minimum length limit of 24 inches (2 Northern Pike 24 inches or greater daily bag limit) by spring of 2025. Another lake survey will be conducted on Lake Shetek during August 2024 with the ability to evaluate the fish community of Bloody Lake as well.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bloody Lake, near the town of Currie in Murray County, is a 248 acre lake with a maximum depth of 9 feet.  Bloody is connected to Lake Shetek via a boat channel which also allows fish to move between lakes.  Bloody Lake is managed primarily for walleyes and secondarily for yellow perch, black crappie, and northern pike.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of July 8, 2002 using 2 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and 4 seining stations. The walleye catch rate was above average which indicates walleye numbers are quite good.   Due to the connection between Lake Shetek and Bloody Lake, the walleye catch rates, as well as those of other species, can vary due to the ability of fish to move between the lakes.  Total lengths of walleyes captured averaged 9.70 inches.  Despite the relatively good numbers of walleyes, only 2 year classes of fish were captured with Age 1 fish dominating the catch.  Most of these fish were in good condition and \"plump\".  The take home message is that walleye numbers are good but the average size is small.  Give these fish a few years of growth and good fishing could be possible.The yellow perch catch rate in gill nets was higher than average but most perch were only around 7 inches in length.  Previous assessments have had high catch rates, which indicates relatively consistent reproduction in Bloody or from Lake Shetek.  Most of the fish captured were from the 2000 year class.The black crappie catch rate was much higher than average.  Most of the fish (99% of the catch) were produced in 2001, while the average length fish caught was 10.63 inches.  The black crappie caught were in excellent condition with most of the fish \"plump\" and healthy.  The crappie fishing would likely produce some excellent action but you may have to sort quite a few fish before you have many \"keepers\".The northern pike catch rate in trap nets was below average but their average weight was 5.30 pounds.  Total lengths of northern pike in trap nets ranged from 17.09 to 36.02 inches and averaged 27.13 inches.  It is likely that northern pike stocking efforts in Lake Shetek will also improve Bloody Lake catch rates.The white sucker catch rate in gill nets was near the upper average range.  Catch rates have never been higher which may be a secondary result of a below average northern pike population abundance.The black bullhead catch rate in trap nets was the highest ever seen.  Their average length was 10.63 inches.Bigmouth buffalo were also seen in greater abundance than ever before.Other species captured were brown bullhead, common carp, channel catfish, orangespotted sunfish, white crappie, yellow bullhead, and bluegill.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Bloody Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Ryan Doorenbos</p>",

THE YEP GILL NET CATCH OF 20.50 APPROXIMATES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  YEP GROWTH WAS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR YEP POPULATIONS IN THE AREA. CAP AND BLB TRAP NET CATCHES WERE BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS, HOWEVER, THIS SAMPLING WAS DONE IN THE SPRING WHEN ACTIVITY OF THESE SPECIES IS RELATIVELY LOW.

                "narrative": "<p>Bloody Lake covers 248 acres and has a maximum depth of 9 feet.  Because of low dissolved oxygen problems during the winter months, Bloody Lake has been opened to liberalized fishing a number of times in the past.  An aeration system was installed in the winter of 1993-94.  In most years, Bloody Lake is connected via a narrow boat channel to Lake Shetek.  Thus, the management objectives of Bloody Lake are correlated to the management of Lake Shetek.  Bloody Lake was last stocked officially in 1975.  Currently, the lake is primarily managed for walleye while providing secondary populations of yellow perch and black crappie.Walleye numbers are considered normal compared to similar area lakes.  Walleye sampled during the 1996 survey ranged in length from 13 ? to 22 ? inches.  Because Bloody Lake and Lake Shetek are connected, and walleye migration between lakes is probable, walleye have not been stocked in Bloody Lake in the past.  Walleye are stocked via Lake Shetek which was last stocked with walleye fry in 1996.  Perch continue to thrive in Bloody Lake.  Perch numbers have increased since our 1990 survey and are currently considered high.  Perch collected in gillnets ranged in length from 5 to almost 8 ? inches with an average length of 6 ? inches.  The current population is dominated by small fish, but with adequate growth, the population should provide anglers with good numbers of quality size fish (greater than 8 inches) in subsequent years.  The perch population is supported through natural reproduction and/or immigration from Lake Shetek.   Black crappie numbers are also considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Black crappie collected in trapnets ranged in length from 4 to over 13 ? inches with an average length of approximately 7 inches.  The majority of the fish sampled were below 8 inches in length; however, a fair number of fish are of preferred size (greater than 10 inches).  The black crappie population is also supported through natural reproduction and/or immigration from Lake Shetek.Bloody Lake also supports low numbers of bluegill and northern pike.  The average length of bluegill collected during our 1996 survey was almost 7 inches.  An individual northern pike was sampled during the 1996 survey; this fish was a \"whopping\" 39.4 inches in length.Black bullhead numbers are considered normal compared to other lakes in our area.  Black bullhead collected in trapnets ranged in length from 4 ? to almost 12 ? inches with an average length of approximately 9 ? inches.Yellow bullhead numbers are also considered normal.  Yellow bullhead sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 5 to more than 13 inches with an average length of 10 inches.Bloody Lake also supports high abundances of carp and bigmouth buffalo.  Since 1990, commercial fishermen removed 35,025 pounds of carp and 56,401 pounds of bigmouth buffalo from Bloody Lake.Other fish species observed during the 1996 survey include white sucker, channel catfish, green sunfish, and orangespotted sunfish.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Bloody Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bloody Lake covers 248 acres and has a maximum depth of nine feet.  Because of low dissolved oxygen levels during the winter months, Bloody Lake has been opened to liberalized fishing a number of times in the past.  An aeration system was installed in the winter of 1993-94.  Oxygen levels did drop to 0.19 parts per million (ppm) in February of 2010 indicating a partial winterkill may have occurred.  Eight different species were sampled in the spring when trap nets were set to determine the extent of the winterkill.  Apparently the winterkill was minimal in Bloody Lake or the lake had been repopulated with fish from Shetek.  In most years, Bloody Lake is connected via a narrow boat channel to Lake Shetek (51004600).  Thus, the management objectives of Bloody Lake are correlated to the management of Lake Shetek.  Currently, the lake is primarily managed for walleye while black crappie, yellow perch, and northern pike are managed secondarily.  Immigration and emigration of walleye and other species will always play a role as long as passage between Bloody Lake and Shetek exists.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were lower in 2010 compared to the catch rate in 2002, but still what we would expect for lakes similar to Bloody.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets in 2010 ranged from 12.8 to 14.8 inches and averaged 13.6 inches.  Larger fish are usually more susceptible to low oxygen levels and  may be part of the reason why the largest fish sampled in gill nets in 2010 was only 14.8 inches.  Two walleye over 20 inches were sampled in the spring with trap nets when a winterkill check was conducted.  These fish may have immigrated into Bloody from Shetek to spawn after the ice went out.  Once the larger fish had spawned, they may have moved back into Shetek therefore not be available for sampling during the 2010 population assessment on Bloody.  Because of the apparent winterkill of 2009-2010, walleye fry were stocked in both Bloody Lake and Lake Shetek.  Bloody has not been stocked in the past due to the connecting to Shetek, but we felt the winterkill was significant enough to try walleye fry. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch rates were also lower in 2010 than in 2002, but still within the range of what we would expect for lakes similar to Bloody Lake.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 6.0 to 9.1 inches with an average length of 7.1 inches.  The average length of 7.2 inches during the 2010 winterkill check was similar to the average length observed during the summer population assessment. <br> \n <br> \nAs with the walleye and yellow perch catch rates, the black crappie catch rates were lower in 2010 than catch rates observed in trap nets in 2002.  Even thought black crappie numbers are down some, the population is still doing very well.  Lengths of black crappie sampled in trap nets ranged from 3.8 to 12.9 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch rates were up slightly when compared to the 2002 and the 1996 population assessments.  Ponds upstream of Bloody are being used as northern pike rearing ponds and the offspring are being released into Bloody Lake.  Because of this annual influx of northern pike fingerlings, it is likely that the northern pike population will increase in Bloody Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included bigmouth buffalo, brown bullhead, channel catfish, orangespotted sunfish, quillback, white crappie, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Bloody Lake; we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bloody Lake is shallow basin (maximum depth of 9 feet) that is 248 acres and is located in Murray County. Historically, Bloody Lake has been prone to partial winterkills; however, low oxygen was last observed in Feb. 2010.  An aeration system was installed in 1993, with the intent to reduce the frequency and/or severity of winterkill.  Bloody Lake is connected to Lake Shetek by a narrow channel, thus its fishery is influenced heavily by management activities on Lake Shetek. Bloody Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike.  Bloody Lake was surveyed the week of July 5, 2016 to monitor fish populations using one gill net and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Walleye catch rate was 9.0 per gill net, which exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 11.0 to 23.9 inches and averaged 14.5 inches, with most being between 11.0 and 14.0 inches.  In previous surveys, Walleye growth has been fast, as total length at age-3 averaged 15.3 inches; however, in 2016, average total length at age-3 was 12.2 inches, which is slow growth compared to similar lakes.  The slow growth could be attributed to an abundant year class and/or limited prey availability.  Sixty percent of the Walleye were age-3, corresponding to a strong year class in Lake Shetek. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016, the Yellow Perch catch rate was 6.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes, but below the average since 1996 (30.5 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 8.4 to 8.7 inches, indicating the presence of one year class and limited natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 22.0 per gill net, which is higher than expected catch rates in similar lakes.  Multiple year classes were present, with lengths ranging from 5.0 to 10.3 inches and averaging 8.4 inches, suggesting that the population is sustained through natural reproduction.  Crappie fishing should be good in the spring when they are up shallow spawning. Try targeting downed trees in the water for best angling.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates have not exceeded 0.6 per trap net and 0.0 per gill net since 1996.  The 2016 catch rates were the highest observed catch rates at 1.2 per trap net and 2.0 per gill net.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 17.3 to 27.8 inches and averaged 23.7 inches.  The operation of the Northern Pike rearing pond likely contributed to this slight increase in catch rates.  <br> \n  <br> \nBlack Bullhead catch rates in gill nets (29.0) and trap nets (0.7) remained below long term averages.  Black bullheads ranged in length from 8.6 to 11.1 inches and averaged 10.1 inches.  Channel Catfish abundance increased drastically from 1.5 per gill net in 2010 to 8.0 per gill net in 2016, which is similar to what was observed on Lake Shetek. Channel Catfish ranged from 11.7 to 25.7 inches and averaged 19.2 inches. Common Carp were sampled at a rate of 0.6 per trap net, which is below expected catch rates in similar lakes. Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Bluegill, Orangespotted Sunfish, Quillback, White Crappie, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bloody Lake is a shallow basin (maximum depth of 9 feet) that is 248 acres and is located in Murray County.  Bloody Lake is connected to Lake Shetek by a channel large enough for watercraft to pass through, thus its fishery is influenced heavily by management activities on Lake Shetek. Bloody Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike.  Fish stocking has not occurred at Bloody Lake since 2010, therefore it appears fish migration from Lake Shetek is sufficient for maintaining a fishable Walleye population.  Bloody Lake likely receives Northern Pike fingerlings annually, as a Northern Pike rearing pond that drains into Bloody Lake is operated in cooperation with a private landowner.  Yellow Perch and Black Crappie have not been stocked in recent history because they have maintained their populations through natural reproduction or migration from Shetek.  Bloody Lake was surveyed the week of July 11, 2022 to monitor fish populations using one gill net and nine trap nets. Bloody Lake experienced a significant fish kill during the winter of 2022-2023 so the description of the fish community in 2022 may not accurately reflect what could be observed in 2023 or beyond.  Additional netting will be conducted to determine the impact of the fish kill.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Walleye catch rate was 25.0 per gill net, exceeding the long term average of 11.0 per gill net and exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 7.3 per gill net).  The 2022 catch rate of 25.0 per gill net is the highest Walleye catch rate ever observed on Bloody Lake.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 9.7 inches to 22.0 inches and averaged 14.0 inches.  Walleye growth was fast compared to Walleye growth in similar lakes across Minnesota. Mean length at age-1 was 11.6 inches, at age-2 was 14.6 inches, and at age-3 was 16.6 inches.  Age-1 Walleye accounted for nearly 60 percent of sampled Walleye, which corresponds to a high numbers of age-1 Walleye in Lake Shetek, which was stocked in 2021.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has been highly variable with catch rates ranging from 5.0 per gill net in 2010 to 83.0 per gill net in 1996.  In 2022, the Yellow Perch catch rate was 34.0 per gill net, higher than the long term average of 31.2 per gill net, and higher than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 26.5 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 5.0 to 10.9 inches and averaged 8.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Black Crappie catch rate was 4.8 per trap net, which is similar to the 2016 catch rate of 4.2 per trap net and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.4 to 15.1 per trap net).  Multiple year classes were present, with lengths ranging from 5.3 to 11.3 inches and averaging 9.7 inches.  The population is likely sustained through natural reproduction and migration from Shetek.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have historically occurred in low abundance in Bloody Lake.  In 2022, five Northern Pike were sampled in trap nets (0.6 per trap net).  Northern Pike ranged in length from 17.6 to 24.9 inches and averaged 21.1 inches.  The annual contribution of fingerlings from the Northern Pike rearing pond that drains into Bloody Lake is not known because there is not a catch basin below the pond to quantify the young of the year Northern Pike.  The Northern Pike rearing pond will likely continue to be operated to supplement Northern Pike populations in Bloody Lake and Lake Shetek.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate in 2022 was 3.0 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.88 to 29.5 per trap net).  Although abundance was low, size structure of the Bluegills was large, with Bluegills ranging in length from 3.6 to 10.1 inches and averaging 7.9 inches.  The potential to catch a Bluegill larger than 9.0 inches exists in Bloody Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead catch rates in the gill net (6.0 per gill net) and trap nets (0.2 per trap net)remained below long term averages and their expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (9.6 to 91.4 per gill net and 2.2 to 60.5 per trap net).  Channel Catfish abundance was unchanged from the 2016 catch rate of 8.0 per gill net.  Channel Catfish lengths ranged from 14.6 to 24.9 inches and averaged 20.7 inches.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, Quillback, White Crappie, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",
