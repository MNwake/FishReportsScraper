                "narrative": "<p>Giles Lake is located three miles southwest of Cohasset, Minnesota.  The lake is a small bass/panfish lake with moderate aquatic vegetation.  There is a county owned, gravel boat access on the northeast side of the lake.Black crappie are difficult to sample during the summer because they are often dispersed and suspended.  The population seemed to be in good shape in 1999 and when compared to similar lakes was near the top 25 percent.  Fish ranged from 4.5 to 9.8 inches with an average length near 6.5 inches.  Black crappie from two to seven years old were aged with the 1994 year class representing more than 50% of the sample.  Growth was slower than the statewide averages for all ages.  Slower growth rates generally occur in higher density populations.Bluegill numbers have been average in all assessments.  In 1999, the number of fish caught in trap nets were higher than in previous samples.  These fish ranged from 3.3 to 7.7 inches with an average length of 6.1 inches.  Bluegill were not aged in 1999 but based on the length frequency distribution, multiple year classes were present.Northern pike numbers were average when compared to lakes similar to Giles.  Fish ranged from 19.1 to 33.5 inches and had an average length of 23.7 inches.  Five year classes were identified by age analysis ranging from two to eight years old.  The 1996 and 1997 year classes represented nearly 85 percent of the sample.  Growth was good and exceeded statewide averages for all ages.  The yellow perch population has experienced extreme highs and lows in the last 20 years.  From 1978 to 1989, net catch rates went from 195.0 fish/net to zero.  A variety of things took place during that period but one notable change was that northern pike numbers increased substantially.  In 1999, yellow perch numbers rebounded to 39.0 fish/net which puts the population back to a healthy level for lakes like Giles.  These fish ranged from 5.4 to 10.2 inches and had an average length of 6.4 inches.Other species sampled in 1999 included bowfin, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead.  Since electrofishing was not used to sample largemouth bass in 1999 it is difficult to characterize the population.  To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, water quality must be protected.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural, forestry or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these can be areas of concern, lakeshore property owners also contribute to water quality problems.  Some examples include putting in sand beaches, removing shoreline trees and vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Continued good land use practices by everyone should insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Guile Lake is a 103-acre lake located seven miles west of Grand Rapids, MN.  A county administered public access is located on the north side of the lake off Guile Lake Rd, with parking for two rigs.  Guile Lake has a maximum depth of 60 feet and 54% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  The lake has low to moderate fertility.  The water color is clear to light green, resulting in visibility to depths of 19 feet in mid-summer.  The depth of water at which oxygen levels limit fish presence was 17 ft.  Other area lakes with similar habitat include Five Island, Jay Gould, Little Sand, and Little Split Hand.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 survey was the fourth survey of the fish community since 1978.  Surveys occur to monitor for changes in species composition, number, size structure, and growth.  Gamefish species that are best suited for the lake are Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass.  No special regulations are present.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population had a moderate catch rate, with above average length distribution and growth.  The gill net catches were below average.  Higher catches are undesirable because they are usually associated with higher density populations having poor size structure and slow growth.  The sampled pike ranged from 15 to 29 inches and averaged 22 inches.  The length distribution was above average, as 59% of pike exceeded 21 inches and 4% exceeded 28 inches.  The population continues to have a higher proportion of fish over 21 inches.  Pike over 28 inches were sampled in three of four surveys.  The largest fish ever sampled was a 36-inch pike in 1978.  Pike ranged from age 1 to 7.  Growth rates were above average for the second consecutive survey.  On average, pike took four years to exceed 21 inches.  The pike population may interest anglers and spearers due to its length distribution.  However, due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release pike over 26 inches and harvest up to 10 less than 22 inches to help maintain and improve size structure.  Spearers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike also.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie population had above average catch rates, with below average length distribution and growth.  The gill net and trap net catches were above average.  Sampling in July and August likely results in lower trap net catches than would occur in June, as most crappie occupy deeper depths during summer months.  The sampled crappie ranged from 4 to 9 inches, and averaged 7.3 and 7.6 inches in gill nets and trap nets.  The length distribution was below average, as 54% of crappie exceeded 8 inches and none exceeded 10 inches.  No crappie 10 inches or greater have ever been sampled, indicating the population continues to have smaller individuals.  Crappie were aged in the two most recent surveys.  The majority of fish sampled were from two year-classes in both surveys (76% and 85%), which is typical of most crappie populations.  Growth rates were below average.  On average, crappie took five years to exceed eight inches.  Although the crappie population lacks ten-inch fish, eight and nine inch fish have been consistently sampled and may interest anglers with realistic expectations.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population had a low catch rate, with average length distribution and growth.  The trap net catches were the lowest ever observed.  Sampling in July and August likely results in lower trap net catches than would occur in June, as larger Bluegill occupy deeper depths throughout summer months.  However, this is when the lake has been sampled.  Higher catches are undesirable because they are usually associated with higher density populations having poor size structure and slow growth.  The sampled Bluegill ranged from 3 to 8 inches, and averaged 5.3 and 5.7 inches in gill nets and trap nets.  Only 32% of Bluegill sampled exceeded six inches, while only 3% exceeded 8 inches.  Bluegill over 8 inches were sampled for the first time in 2020.  Growth was similar to lakes with similar habitat, but below the statewide average.  Nine age-classes were sampled, with Bluegill that ranged from age 2 to 10.  Recruitment appeared consistent, and Bluegill took six years to exceed six inches.  Bluegill likely provide angling opportunities for kids; however, realistic expectations are necessary as few Bluegill over 8 inches are present.  Due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release Bluegill exceeding 8 inches to help improve size structure. <br> \n <br> \nSpring nighttime electrofishing targeting bass is the most appropriate method to evaluate the status of a bass population.  It has not been used on this lake due to other area priorities.  Gill and trap nets observed a Largemouth Bass population with low catch rates and a below average length distribution and growth rate.  Nine bass were sampled in 2020 that ranged from 9 to 14 inches.  Growth was assessed for the first time in 2020, and was below the statewide average.  An 18-inch bass was sampled in 1999, indicating the potential has existed for producing some larger bass.  Largemouth Bass likely provide angling opportunities; however, realistic expectations are necessary as few Largemouth Bass over 18 inches are present.  Due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release bass exceeding 15 inches to help maintain or improve size structure.     <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population appeared to be quite low.  A total of three perch were sampled in trap nets, while none were sampled in gill nets.  The sampled perch ranged from 4 to 6 inches.  Declining perch numbers are consistent with statewide trends observed since the 1970s.  Age and growth information has not been evaluated.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help slow the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.  <br> \n</p>",
