THE AGE DISTRIBUTIONS OF LARGEMOUTH BASS, BLACK CRAPPIES, BLUEGILLS AND YELLOW PERCH INDICATE THAT A SUCCESSFUL YEAR CLASS FOR EACH OF THESE SPECIES WAS PRODUCED IN 1987 (AS ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM THE POST-RECLAMATION STOCKING OF ADULT BROOD STOCK IN 1987). THE WALLEYES AND CHANNEL CATFISH POPULA- TIONS ARE DIRECTLY FROM POST-RECLAMATION FINGER- LING STOCKINGS. FIRST YEAR GROWTH WAS VERY GOOD FOR BLUEGILL, LARGEMOUTH BASS, BLACK CRAPPIE AND YELLOW PERCH. THE MEAN LENGTH AT TIME OF FIRST ANNULUS FORMATION WAS 3.2, 6.7, 4.2 AND 5.2 INCHES, RESPECTIVELY. THE BLACK BULLHEAD, NORTHERN PIKE AND GREEN SUN- FISH THAT WERE SAMPLED ARE THE RESULT OF UNAUTHOR- IZED STOCKING OR POSSIBLE SURVIVORS OF THE RECLA- MATION. A SAMPLE OF 7 TO 9 INCH BULLHEADS WERE AGED AT 1+.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Split Rock is a 81 acre Resevoir located at Split Rock State Park in Pipestone County.  The resevoir has a maximum depth of 16 feet and 3.2 miles of shoreline.  The Split Rock dam was washed out in May of 1983 and the resevoir was restocked in 1994 with adult walleye, bluegill, and largemouth bass.  The resevoir is presently managed for northern pike and black crappie as the primary species while yellow perch, bluegill, largemouth bass, walleye, and channel catfish are managed secondarily.  We assessed the fish population during the week of 07/09/2001 using electrofishing, nine trapnets, and three gillnets.The abundance of northern pike is fair compared to lakes similar to Split Rock.  Lengths of northern pike sampled during our assessment ranged from 22.0 to 34.3 inches and averaged about 27 inches.  The average weight of northern pike sampled in trapnets was 4.3 pounds.The abundance of black crappie was high compared to lakes similar to Split Rock.  Lengths of black crappie sampled in our trapnets ranged from 3.9 to 10.3 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.  There were several black crappie in the 7 to 9 inch range.The abundance of bluegill was normal compared to lakes like Split Rock.  Lengths of bluegill sampled ranged from 4.2 to 7.1 inches and averaged 5.9 inches.  The bluegill should grow by the end of summer in 2002 and provide a decent fishery for anglers searching for bluegill.  Walleye, yellow perch, and channel catfish numbers were low when compared to lakes similar to Split Rock.  Walleye sampled in our nets ranged from 17 to 21 inches while most of the yellow perch were less than 10 inches.The abundance of largemouth bass was low compared to similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 8.0 to 16.1 inches and averaged around 12 inches.Other fish sampled in our nets included common carp, black bullhead, orangespotted sunfish, quillback, and white sucker.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Split Rock Resevoir through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

ALTHOUGH GILL AND TRAP NETTING YIELDED MINIMAL RESULTS, (0.33 AND 0.0 RESPECTIVELY), AN ELECTROFISHING SURVEY CONDUCTED IN LAT OCTOBER YIELDED 25 LARGEMOUTH BASS AND A CPUE OF TEN FISH PER HOUR OF EFFORT. THE MAJORITY OF THE FISH ARE SMALL (<7 ONE.  ALTHOUGH THE SAMPLE SIZE IS SMALL AND ONLY REPRESENTS ONE SAMPLING DATE, A PROPORTIONAL STOCK DENSITY WAS CALCULATED FOR THE LARGEMOUTH BASS POPULATION.  THE PSD VALUE OF 14 IS LOW, AND REFLECTS THE LARGE NUMBER OF STOCK-SIZED FISH. GROWTH OF LARGEMOUTH BASS IS GOOD, YET FEW LARGE FISH ARE PRESENT IN THE POPULATION.  AN ESTIMATE OF TOTAL ANNUAL MORTALITY OF LARGEMOUTH BASS, AGE 1-4, CALCULATED FROM CATCH-CURVE ANALYSIS, WAS 89.9 PERCENT, A RATE WHICH IS EXCESSIVE FOR LARGEMOUTH BASS.  DUE TO THE FACT THAT SPLIT ROCK LAKE IS ONE OF THE FEW FISHING AREAS IN EXTREME SOUTHWEST MINNESOTA, AND THAT MUCH OF THE LAKE LIES WITHING THE BOUNDARIES OF A STATE PARK, IT MAY BE SAFE TO ASSUME THAT SPLIT ROCK LAKE RECEIVES A GREAT DEAL OF SUMMER FISHING PRESSURE AND THE MAJORITY OF THE MORTALITY CAN BE ATTRIBUT- ED TO ANGLING. THE BLUEGILL TRAP NET CATCH OF 5.00 FISH PER NET WAS TWO TIMES GREATER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE SIZE AND AGE STRUCTURE OF THE BLUEGILL POPULATION ARE WELL DISTRIBUTED, INDICATING SUCCESSFUL YEAR CLASSES HAVE BEEN PRODUCED EVERY YEAR SINCE RECLAMATION.  BLUEGILL GROWTH IS GOOD FOR ALL AGES CLASSES.  HOWEVER, SINCE MOST OF THE PREDATORS REGULATING THE BLUEGILL POPULATION ARE FEW IN NUMBER, (WALLEYE AND NORTHERN PIKE), OR SMALL IN SIZE, (LARGEMOUTH BASS), THE POTENTIAL FOR SLOWED GROWTH AND EVENTUAL STUNTING EXISTS. THE BLACK CRAPPIE TRAP NET CATCH OF 13.9 FISH PER NET WAS MORE THAN TWO TIMES GREATER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 6.0 FISH PER NET.  THE BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATION IS CURRENTLY DOMINATED BY TWO LARGE YEAR CLASSES, 1989 (1) AND 1987 (3).  BOTH COHERTS EXHIBIT GROWTH RATES SIMILAR TO OTHER BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATIONS IN THE AREA.  HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LACK OF PREDATORS IN THE RESERVOIR, GROWTH MAY SLOW IF ANOTHER LARGE YEAR CLASS WAS TO BE PRODUCED. WALLEYE, YELLOW PERCH AND BLACK BULLHEAD CATCH RATES WERE ALL BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS FOR THE RESPECTIVE INDICATOR GEARS.  NO AGE ONE WALLEYE WERE COLLECTED, INDICATING THE 1989 FINGERLING STOCKING WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. NOTE: AGES OF FISH EXTEND PAST THE RECLAMATION DATE, ADULTS OF MOST SPECIES WERE STOCKED HOWEVER.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Split Rock Lake is an 82 acre reservoir located seven miles southwest of Pipestone.  In the spring of 1993, flooding caused the dam to wash out.  The 1997 survey was the first since fish had been restocked.  The management plan indicates Split Rock is primarily managed for bluegill and largemouth bass with secondary species including walleye, channel catfish, black crappie, and yellow perch.  Once the fish populations have a couple years to mature, fishing should improve.In June of 1994, 540 adult bluegill were stocked.  Survey nets indicated the bluegill were doing well.  When compared to lakes similar to Split Rock, the bluegill population was higher than most.  Bluegill ranged from 3.7 to 9.0 inches with a mean length of 5.1.  The stocked adults have successfully produced young in 1994 and 1995, representing 68 and 26% of the sample.In May of 1994, 16 adult largemouth bass were stocked in Split Rock.  Spring electrofishing for largemouth bass resulted in 2.3 fish/hr or a total of four fish.  Based on age analysis, two of the fish were from the original stocking and two were produced in 1994.  Nine YOY largemouth bass were sampled in shoreline seining.  Nearly 2,300 fingerling largemouth bass were stocked in the fall of 1997.In the spring of 1994, 144 yearling and 168 adult walleye were stocked in Split Rock.  No walleye were observed in the survey in 1997.  Approximately 320 walleye fingerlings were stocked in the fall of 1997.Channel catfish yearlings were stocked in September of 1994, but were probably not large enough to be sampled in 1997.  Three channel catfish were sampled in gill nets and they likely came from Split Rock Creek.  Spine sectioning indicated one channel catfish was age 6+ at 14.7 inches, one was age 7+ at 17.1 inches, and one was age 8+ at 19.5 inches.In May of 1995, 106 black crappie adults were stocked in Split Rock.  Black crappie numbers were higher than 75% of lakes similar to Split Rock.  Black crappie ranged from 3.9 to 10.9 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  Successful reproduction produced fish in every year since they were stocked.  A strong 1995 year class was produced which represented nearly 85% of the black crappie sampled.  The 1995 year class averaged 6.3 inches after two years of growth.Adult yellow perch (n=522) were stocked in April of 1995.  Yellow perch survival and later reproduction appeared to be poor.  No yellow perch were caught in gill nets and only three were caught in trap nets.  However, 13 YOY yellow perch were sampled by shoreline seining.Despite there being no stocking of northern pike since the dam failure, northern pike numbers were average compared to lakes like Split Rock.  Northern pike ranged from 20.0 to 31.4 inches and averaged 25.7 inches.  Northern pike averaged nearly 29.0 inches after four years of growth.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Split Rock through watershed management.  Improved land use practices will help insure this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

It has a surface area of 80 acres, a maximum depth of 16 feet, transparency depth of 2.0 feet, and is in lake class 42.  Minnesota DNR Fisheries classifies lakes with similar characteristics, such as size, depth, water chemistry, and other metrics on a statewide basis for comparison of fish communities.  A winter aeration system is operated on the lake but occasional partial winterkills still occur.  This lake is only one of four small reservoirs in Pipestone County which has no \"natural\" lakes.  To increase angling opportunities in the area, a shoreline fishing pier is maintained on the northwest corner of the reservoir.  The lake is managed primarily for yellow perch, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie with no secondary management species.  Due to the presence of the endangered Topeka Shiner within Split Rock Creek, the division of fisheries is not allowed to stock predators such as walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, or channel catfish in the reservoir.  To evaluate fish populations and management goals, an assessment utilizing one gill net and nine trap nets was conducted during the week of July 8, 2013 with the following results. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rate in trap nets, of 5.7 per net, is slightly under the long-term average for this lake.  Although this is a decline from the record high catch of 42 per net in 2007, good numbers of crappie remain.  Lengths of fish sampled in trap nets ranged from 4.4 to 12.4 inches with a mean length of 8 inches.  The fish are healthy and foraging successfully resulting in good growth rates.  No aging of crappies was done, but length frequency groupings appear to indicate at least five year classes present.  They are reproducing successfully, and should continue to provide an angling opportunity for years to come. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish catch rates have shown a steady decline from a peak of 19 per trap net in 1997, to 8.6 in 2001, 4.4 in 2007, and 0.6 during 2013.  Declining bluegill populations appear to be directly related to elevated common carp catches since 1997, along with the lack of submergent vegetation associated with poor water clarity.   Lengths for bluegill from trap nets ranged from 4.9 to 8.6 inches with a mean length of 6.6 inches.  These fish are foraging successfully indicated by healthy fish in the sample.  Length frequency distribution groupings appear to indicate four year classes of bluegill present during this survey.  Since bluegill numbers are low and sizes are somewhat small, more adult bluegills will be stocked to boost the population in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nGill net catch rates for yellow perch have dropped from 3 per net in 2007 to zero per net during 2013.  Although no perch were sampled in gill nets, a total of seven fish were captured in the trap nets for a catch rate of 0.8 per net.  This is equal to the long term average for trap nets from seven surveys on this lake dating back to 1987.  Perch lengths in trap nets ranged from 5.3 to 8.5 inches with a mean length of 6.4 inches.  There appear to be two year classes of perch present based on length frequency groups.  Long-range plan goals are not being met for perch numbers, therefore yellow perch adults will be stocked to enhance the population in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker catch rates of 38.0 per gill net are six times the long-term average for this lake.  Trap net catches of 2.6 per net were also more than double the long-term average.  Since no white suckers were sampled prior to 2001, catches from both gear types are at all time high levels and rising rapidly.  Lengths from both gears ranged from 7.5 to 15.4 inches with an overall mean length of 13.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead catch rates of 46.0 per gill net and 6.0 per trap net were both very near the long-term average catch rates for this reservoir.  Lengths of bullheads from both gear types ranged from 4.6 to 8.8 inches with an overall mean length of 6.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp catch rates of 23.0 per gill net and 2.7 per trap net were both nearly double the long-term average catch rates for Split Rock reservoir.  Lengths of carp from both gear types ranged from 13.0 to 22.0 inches with an average weight of 2.0 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during this assessment in low densities included Northern Pike, Orange Spotted Sunfish, Green Sunfish, and Channel Catfish. <br> \n <br> \nSplit Rock reservoir also provides excellent turtle habitat with 24 painted turtles and 18 snapping turtles captured in the nine trap net sets. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Split Rock Reservoir, located in Split Rock State Park, is an 81-acre impoundment in Pipestone County.  Split Rock Reservoir has a watershed ratio of 128:1, which makes it highly vulnerable to landscape uses and precipitation events.  Its maximum depth is 16 feet, but most of the reservoir averages around 6 feet deep.  Water quality issues have made fish management a challenge.  Significant effort has been made during its history to improve the water quality and fishery with the reservoir with limited success.  In November of 1986, Split Rock Reservoir and other upstream bodies of water within the watershed were reclaimed.  Although the reclamation was not completely successful in eradicating all bullheads, a respectable largemouth bass, crappie, bluegill, yellow perch, and walleye fishery became established a few years later.  In 1993, a portion of the Split Rock Reservoir\u0019s earthen dam was breached, which essentially returned it to a free flowing creek.  Soon after the repair in fall of 1993/winter of 1994, adult largemouth bass, walleye and bluegill were restocked to create a fishery.  Assessments following those restocking efforts saw a more diverse fishery, with panfish dominating the fish community.  Unfortunately, the failure of the dam in 1993 enabled common carp to become reestablished in the Split Rock Reservoir and upstream.  The Split Rock Creek watershed has Topeka shiners, a federally listed endangered species.  The DNR and US Fish and Wildlife Service issued a directive ceasing any future predator stockings (channel catfish, largemouth bass, walleye, and northern pike) within the watershed because of the potential threat of predation on Topeka Shiners.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of July 9, 2007 using a gill net, 5 trap nets, and 2 seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in the reservoir is very limited.  The last walleye fingerling stockings occurred in 2000 and 2001.  As a result, only 1 19-inch walleye was sampled during the survey.  Anglers should consider themselves quite fortunate if they were to catch a few of the remaining walleye. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers have been historically much higher.  The catch rate was within the normal range and proves there is natural reproduction, as they have not been stocked since 1983.  Total lengths ranged from 18.7 to 22.2 inches with an average of 20.5 inches.  It is possible northern pike numbers could sporadically increase in the future as northern pike abundance is often influenced by seasonal weather patterns and habitat availability.  With a little luck, an angler may get one of these generally aggressive fish to latch on to their lure.   <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate was the highest ever seen in Split Rock Reservoir, at nearly 3 times the expected range.  Total lengths ranged from 4.0 to 9.4 inches with an average of 6.4 inches.  A majority (56%) of the fish were 6.5-8.5 inches.  The condition of the crappies indicates they were finding plenty of forage and were healthy.  Great shore fishing areas within the park may be a great way to spend some time fishing with the kids.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate in trap nets was 4.4/set, which was within the expected range.  Total lengths ranged from 4.2 to 7.3 inches with a mean of 6.4 inches.  Bluegill natural reproduction appears to have been successful in 2007 as seine hauls captured 147 young of the year Age 0 bluegill.  If submergent vegetation improves within the reservoir, it would likely improve the bluegill fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nNo largemouth bass were sampled in gill nets or trap nets.  However, 4 Age 0 largemouth bass were sampled in a seine haul, which indicated the presence of mature largemouth within the reservoir and indicates some natural reproduction occurred in 2007.   <br> \n <br> \nOnly 2 channel catfish were sampled in gill nets and trap nets combined.  Natural reproduction occurred in 2007 as 1 3-inch channel catfish was sampled in a seine haul in 2007.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of black bullhead in gill nets was 32/set, which was within the expected range.  Total lengths of bullheads in gill nets ranged from 4.9 to 8.7 inches with a mean of 7.8 inches.  Although numbers have been higher, Split Rock Reservoir would still be a good destination for some good fishing action for the kids.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of common carp in gill nets was 13.0/set, which was 3 times the expected range.  All of the fish were 17-20 inches.  Unfortunately these fish can impact a small fishery by rooting up aquatic vegetation and making the water more turbid.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were green sunfish, white sucker, fathead minnow, orangespotted sunfish, and shiners.   <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Ryan Doorenbos     <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
