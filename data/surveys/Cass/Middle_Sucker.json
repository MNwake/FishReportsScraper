                "narrative": "<p>Middle Sucker Lake is a 200-acre lake with a maximum depth of 20 feet.  It is located eight miles east and one mile south of Cass Lake in northern Cass County.  Based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types.  Middle Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 34.  The only other area lakes in this same class include Lind (located one mile east of Backus) and Rice (located two miles southeast of Longville) Lakes.  There is a user-developed access between Upper and Middle Sucker Lakes.There was an abundant northern pike population in Middle Sucker Lake.  More abundant than what is typically found in class 34 lakes.  Sampled northern pike ranged in length from 9 to 28 inches and had an average size of 17.75 inches.  Northern pike grew at a good rate and have had consistent natural reproduction.  Fish can migrate among all three Sucker Lakes and Leech Lake by way of the Sucker River.Sampled bluegill ranged  in length from 4 to 10 inches with 54 percent of the sample were greater than seven inches.   Ten year-classes present in the sample indicating consistent natural reproduction. Bluegill were growing at an excellent rate that was faster than other area lakes.Only seven black crappie were collected in the nets.  Electrofishing in 1990 indicated an excellent population.From the results of the last two surveys, very few largemouth bass exist in Middle Sucker Lake.Only one largemouth bass was sampled in the last two surveys.Only two walleye were sampled in 1995.  Both fish were 17 inches long and the same age.  These fish are likely from migration from Leech Lake via Sucker Creek.The main food for large predator fish is yellow perch.  Yellow perch were more abundant than what is typically found in class 34 lakes.  Sampled yellow perch ranged in length from 5 to 10 inches and had an average length of 7 inches.  Some yellow perch were of the size acceptable to anglers.    Other fish captured include bowfin, white sucker, pumpkinseed, and bullheads.To help maintain quality fish populations in Middle Sucker Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife. They also help protect shorelines from erosion and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young. Protection of the Middle Sucker Lake watershed is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Middle Sucker Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Sucker Lake is a 200-acre lake located near Cass Lake, Minnesota that has 3.13 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 20 feet.  An earthen access is located in the channel between Middle Sucker Lake and Upper Sucker Lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Middle Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 34; lakes in the class are turbid, shallow, and regularly shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie and secondarily for largemouth bass.     The dominant fish species sampled was black bullhead, which indicates the Middle Sucker can experience partial winterkill.  However, northern pike are abundant in Middle Sucker and fish up to 29 inches were sampled.  Few bluegill were sampled; however, the mean length was 7 inches and fish up to 10 inches were sampled.  Black crappie sampled averaged 9 inches though fish up to 13 inches were found.   Other fish species that are available to anglers are bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Middle Sucker Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Sucker Lake is a 286-acre lake located approximately nine miles ESE of Cass Lake, Minnesota, that has 3.13 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 20 feet.  There is a US Forest Service owned earthen access on the channel between Middle Sucker and Upper Sucker lakes. The access is suitable for small boats, canoes, and kayaks due to the shallow water and limited maneuvering area at the launch.  Parking space is also limited.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Middle Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 34; lakes in the class are turbid, shallow, and regularly shaped lakes.  Other Walker Area Lake Class 34 lakes include Lind (DOW# 11-0367) and Rice (DOW# 11-0367). The entire shoreline of Middle Sucker Lake is undeveloped and publicly owned by the US Forest Service and the State of Minnesota.   <br> \n <br> \nMiddle Sucker Lake offers a near wilderness setting. Historically, partial winterkills have occurred on Sucker Lake. Fish populations recover to healthy levels naturally during extended periods when winterkills do not occur.  Angling for Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Black Crappie can be quite productive on Middle Sucker Lake. Black Crappie catch rates were down from 2011, but the average length of fish sampled increased from 9 inches in 2011 to 10 inches in 2016. Northern Pike were abundant with an average length of 21 inches with fish up to 34 inches long in the sample.  The average length of Bluegill was 8 inches and 70 percent of the sample were 8 inches or greater in length. Other fish species that are available to anglers are Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Middle Sucker Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Sucker Lake (DOW#11-0317, Lake Class 34) is a 286-acre lake with 150 littoral acres, 3.2 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 20 feet. Middle Sucker Lake is located nine miles southeast of Cass Lake, MN. There is a US Forest Service owned earthen access on the channel between Middle Sucker and Upper Sucker lakes. The access is suitable for small boats, canoes, and kayaks due to the shallow water and limited maneuvering area at the launch. Parking space is also limited. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Middle Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 34; lakes in the class are turbid, shallow, and regularly shaped lakes. Other Walker Area Lake Class 34 lakes include Lind and Rice. The entire shoreline of Middle Sucker Lake is undeveloped and publicly owned by the US Forest Service and the State of Minnesota. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch and secondarily for Bluegill. Special Regulations on the Sucker chain of lakes include 5 fish daily limits for Sunfish and Black Crappie; statewide possession limits of 20 and 10, respectively, remain in place. The regulations are intended to maintain the existing size quality and more information can be found at (Quality Sunfish Initiative).  <br> \n <br> \nMiddle Sucker Lake is a good multi-species lake, particularly for panfish and bass. Black Crappie abundance was below the management goal but fish from 5 to 11 inches were sampled. Northern Pike are abundant and numbers were well above the management goal, with pike lengths ranging from 10 to 30 inches. Yellow Perch numbers were also well above the management goal and very high compared to similar lakes, with fish up to 10 inches long present. Bluegill abundance was below the management goal but fish up to 10 inches were sampled.  Middle and Upper Sucker lakes are known to occasionally winterkill and are replenished naturally from their connection with Lower Sucker Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Middle Sucker Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Sucker Lake is a 200-acre lake located approximately nine miles ESE of Cass Lake, Minnesota, that has 3.13 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 20 feet.  There is a US Forest Service owned earthen access on the channel between Middle Sucker and Upper Sucker lakes. The access is suitable for small boats, canoes, and kayaks due to the shallow water and limited maneuvering area at the launch.  Parking space is also limited.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Middle Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 34; lakes in the class are turbid, shallow, and regularly shaped lakes.  Other Walker Area Lake Class 34 lakes include Lind (DOW# 11-0367) and Rice (DOW# 11-0367). The entire shoreline of Middle Sucker Lake is undeveloped and publicly owned by the US Forest Service and the State of Minnesota.  Middle Sucker Lake offers a near wilderness setting. Historically, partial winterkills have occurred on Sucker Lake. Fish populations recover to healthy levels naturally during extended periods during which winterkills do not occur due in large part to the connectedness of all three lakes.  No aquatic invasive species have been documented in Middle Sucker Lake. Angling for northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie can be quite productive on Middle Sucker Lake. Numbers and sizes preferred by anglers of all three species have increased since the 2000 assessment, which bodes well for angling opportunities. Northern pike were abundant, averaging 22 inches long with fish up to 32 inches long also sampled.  Bluegill catch, when compared to the 2005 results, was down slightly in the trap nets, but the gill net catch was much higher. The average length of bluegills was 7 inches and 12 percent were 8 inches or greater in length. Black crappies averaged 9 inches in length with 40 percent 10 inches or greater in length. Other fish species that are available to anglers are bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Selective harvest by anglers (harvest of smaller to medium-sized fish) promotes balanced fish communities and sustainable fishing quality.  Removal of shoreline vegetation on private lake lots and mowing grass to the water's edge can reduce water quality, which in turn can adversely affect fish populations.  Similarly, removal of woody debris and aquatic plants from near-shore areas reduces critical habitat needed to support quality fish populations.  Finally, aquatic invasive species (AIS) can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  These species are primarily moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake-shore owners.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat away before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us/). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Sucker Lake is a 200-acre lake with a maximum depth of 20 feet.  It is located eight miles east of Cass Lake in northern Cass County. The entire shoreline on Middle Sucker Lake is under public ownership and is within both the Leech Lake Indian Reservation and the Chippewa National Forest.  Approximately 75% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  There is an earthen access at the channel between Middle and Upper Sucker Lakes off of US Forest Service Road  2930 south of U.S. Highway 2.  The above lakes along with Lower Sucker Lake are connected via the Sucker River to Leech Lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Middle Sucker  Lake is in lake class 34.  Lakes in this lake class are typically moderate in size (average size = 240 acres) with a high percentage of the lake area being fifteen feet or less in depth.  Water clarity is low.  Middle Sucker Lake is managed primarily      for northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie.Middle Sucker Lake experienced a partial winterkill in the winter of 1995 - 96.  Northern pike are abundant though most are small.  Northern pike survive winterkill better than most fish species.  Bluegill abundance is down, however, many small fish are present and they exhibit a fast growth rate.  The bluegill fishery should recover in 2 to 3 years.  Black crappies up to 11 inches long were sampled in 2000.  Yellow perch are abundant, and there      are numerous fish greater than 10 inches long in the population.  A few largemouth bass are present.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing medium to large size fish will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future and can help maintain balance in the fish community.</p>",
