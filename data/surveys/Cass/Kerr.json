                "narrative": "<p>The catch rate for northern pike (NOP)in Kerr Lake was 6.0 fish/gillnet, which equals the median catch for this lake class.  The weight of NOP taken was 31.5 lbs/gillnet, which is well above the third quartile catch of 19.75 lbs/net.  NOP taken by gillnets were large, with a mean weight of 5.2 lbs.  NOP growth was good.   The average length of Kerr Lake NOP at formation of annulus 3 was 24.6 inches - considerably above the 17.7 inch average for other class 28 lakes in this area.  Good fishing is reportd for NOP.The trapnet catch for bluegill (BLG) was 35.4 fish/lift, which falls in the upper part of the interquartile range for lake class 28.  The gillnet catch of BLG was 24.3 fish/net, which is higher than most lakes in this class.  Most BLG (77%) were less than 6.0 inches, though 23% were 6.0 inches or more.  No BLG were greater than 7.9 inches.  At formation of annulus 5, the average length of BLG sampled was 4.8 inches.  Most sampled BLG reached 6.0 inches only after formation of their seventh or eighth annulus.The pumpkinseed (PMK) catch rate of 7.2 fish/net was greater than most lakes in this lake class.  About 27% of the PMK sampled were 6.0 inches or longer, but none exceeded 7.4 inches.There were 2.3 black crappie (BLC) caught per gillnet in Kerr Lake, which falls within the interquartile range for this class of lakes.  The sampled BLC were all 10.4 inches or less.  BLC averaged 8.2 inches at the time they formed annulus 5.  This growth appears to be slower than that observed in other class 28 lakes in this area.Four small (5.5 - 8.9) largemouth bass (LMB) were sampled during the survey.  Local reports indicate bass fishing is good, but limited access keeps fishing pressure low.Yellow perch (YEP) were caught at a rate of 7.0 fish/gillnet.  This rate was close to the median for class 28 lakes.  The perch sampled were small, ranging from 4.0 to 7.9 inches.</p>",
