                "narrative": "<p>Shoal Lake is a 286-acre lake in central Itasca County within the Mississippi River watershed.  Shoal Lake is located approximately 5 miles north of Nashwauk, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 77 ft and 114 littoral acres.  An earthen boat ramp is located off CR 532.  Shoal Lake is primarily managed for largemouth bass, panfish, and northern pike.  The northern pike gill-net catch was 8.3/net, which is towards the upper end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance has generally been high compared to similar lake class 23 lakes and has varied from 6.8 to 8.8/gill net in past assessments.  Size structure was poor with few fish exceeding 24 inches.  Growth was slower than statewide averages for ages one to two, and similar to statewide averages for ages three to seven.  High abundance of northern pike, often leads to slow growth and poor size structure.Black crappie gill-net catch was 4.3/net and exceeded the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance has varied from 2.0 to 3.3/gill net in past assessments.  Size structure was generally poor with a only four fish exceeding nine inches.  Growth was slower than statewide averages for ages one to three and similar to statewide averages for ages four to seven.  Bluegill trap-net catch was 3.3/net, which is lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance in past assessments has varied from 4.3 to 11.0/trap net in past assessments.  Size structure was poor with no fish exceeding 8 inches.  Scales were not collected in this assessment for growth analysis.Largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 36.1/hour, which indicates an abundant population.  Size structure was moderate with a fish up to 17 inches sampled.  Growth was slower than statewide averages for age one and similar to statewide averages for ages two to nine.Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in the past; however, stocking has not resulted in a fishable population.  Fingerlings stocked in 1985, were not sampled in this assessment, and natural reproduction is not evident.  Shoal lake is best suited for largemouth bass, panfish, and northern pike.Other species sampled include, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by practicing selective harvest.  </p>",

Brown bullheads appear to have been displaced by yellow bullheads which are moderately abundant.  Yellow perch are not very abundant in the lake.  They were only captured during seining.  Walleyes do not appear to be present in the lake.  Walleye stocking was of little benefit to the lake.  The largemouth bass population is fairly abundant and maintaining itself by natural reproduction.  The panfish and black crappie populations are at normal levels for this type of lake.</p>",
