Currently there is no public access to the lake, but the city has purchased property adjacent to the lake and future plans may include the development of public fishing access.  The pond is deep, has relatively clear water and supports a population of panfish.  Residents on the pond and citizens in the community have expressed concern over the water quality and how additional stormwater may negatively affect it.  Meetings have been held to discuss alternatives in an effort to preserve the condition of the pond. </p>",
