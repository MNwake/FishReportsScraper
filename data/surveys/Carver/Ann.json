Boats are restricted to electric trolling motors only.  Largemouth bass fishing is catch-and-release only.  Northern pike are at an all time high in abundance for the lake.  The average size is 23.5 inches, and the largest individual was 34.4 inches.  Bluegill abundance and average size have dropped from previous surveys.  Average size is 5.5 inches, but 18% of fish sampled were above 7 inches.  Black crappie numbers are typical for this type of lake, and they average 8.1 inches.  There are good numbers of largemouth bass in Lake Ann with an average size of 15.0 inches.  Sixty eight percent are over 16 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann Lake is a 116-acre lake in Chanhassen just north of highway 5 in Carver County.  The lake has shoreland and a boat ramp owned by City of Chanhassen, and Ann's shoreline is largely undeveloped and in a natural condition.  Recreationists have the opportunity to swim at two beaches, fish at a pier, rent kayaks and other boats, and enjoy the lakeside trail.  There is a public boat launch on the southeast shoreline; however, the use of gas motors is prohibited on Ann.  A special fishing regulation protects Northern Pike between 24 and 36 inches, and all Largemouth Bass must be immediately released.  A narrow channel on the northeast shoreline connects Ann to Lucy, a shallow basin with no public boat launch.  During the summer, Ann is a popular spot for swimmers and boaters.   <br> \n <br> \nThirty percent of the Northern Pike sample exceeded 24 inches in the summer survey of 2017, and the largest fish was 34.5 inches long. Most of the sample was dominated by fish between 20 and 23 inches.  These fish are growing at a fast rate and should enter the protected slot within one to three years.   <br> \n <br> \nNighttime electrofishing for bass was conducted in May of 2017. Average size of bass in 2017 was 14.4 inches and 2.11 pounds.  The largest sampled fish measured 22.1 inches and 6.80 pounds.  Forty-eight percent of sampled fish exceeded 16 inches, and 21 percent exceeded 18 inches. The Largemouth Bass population is healthy, with many year classes of fish.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are abundant in Ann Lake.  Twenty percent of the trap netted Bluegill exceeded 7 inches, with the average fish measuring 5.8 inches and 0.16 pounds.  The largest Bluegill was 8.3 inches and 0.37 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was average in 2017, however, all perch were small in size, averaging 6.1 inches and 0.10 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance has commonly been low on Ann, and 2017 was no different.  Forty percent of the 2017 catch were greater than 8 inches and the largest measured was 8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance include Yellow Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed Sunfish.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Ann Lake was conducted on August 26th, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from the week of June 5th, 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish, Iowa Darters, Smallmouth Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish, Black Bullhead, Common Carp).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Lower Minnesota River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Ann Lake was conducted on August 16-22, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due soft sediments and vegetation. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured ten species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured nine species of fish, including one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). Black Crappie and Bluegill comprised a majority of the biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a May 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Ann Lake is adversely impacted by stressors, as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Lower Minnesota River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann is a 116-acre lake located in Chanhassen, Carver County.   The lakeshore is undeveloped and Lake Ann Park surrounds the majority of the lake.  This city-run park includes a concrete boat ramp and fishing pier.  Boats are restricted to electric trolling motors only.  During high water, the lake is connected to Lake Lucy to the north.  Largemouth bass angling is catch-and-release only and there is a 24- to 36-inch protected slot limit for northern pike.  All pike within this slot range must be immediately released. One over 36 inches is allowed in possession.   A population assessment, including spring electrofishing, was conducted in 2012 to characterize the status of the fish community in Lake Ann. <br> \n <br> \nIt appears the 24-to 36-inch slot limit on northern pike that was instituted in 2003 has had a positive effect on the size structure of the population.  Gill nets averaged 15.0 pike per set, which is similar to the previous assessment in 2006 (15.5/net), however mean length and weight of pike has increased since 2006.  Northern pike averaged 23.8 inches and 3.50 lbs in 2006, compared to 25.3 inches and 3.92 lbs in 2012.  In the 2012 population assessment, size structure was skewed towards larger individuals where 81% were 21 inches or longer, 29% were 28 inches or longer, and 2% were 34 inches or longer.  The largest pike measured 35.9 inches.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the sample.  Ages 4 and 6 were the most abundant comprising 30 and 25%, respectively.  Northern pike grew faster than the statewide average, reaching 21 inches by age 3, and 28.7 inches by age 6.     <br> \n <br> \nNighttime boat electrofishing, targeting largemouth bass, was conducted in May, 2012.  Seventy-four largemouth bass were collected at a rate of 40.6 per hour.  Bass averaged 10.5 inches and 1.01 lbs, with the largest measuring 19.4 inches and 4.14 lbs.  Size structure was large where 41% were 12 inches or larger, and 24% were 15 inches or larger.  Ages ranged from 1 to 9, with 30% age 3.  Other ages were relatively evenly distributed.  Growth was similar to statewide averages.    Bass reached 7.6 inches by age 3 and 15.6 inches by age 6.       <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance is high in Ann Lake.  Catch averaged 69.4 per trap net which is near the 75th percentile compared to other similar lakes lakes.  Bluegill numbers have remained consistent over the years averaging 61.2 per trap net from the previous 3 assessments dating back to 1995.  Bluegill had a balanced size structure where 55% were 6 inches or longer and 0.5% were 8 inches or longer.  Mean length was 6.1 inches and 0.18 lbs with the largest reaching 8.6 inches and 0.44 lbs.  Ages ranged from 2 to 8, with the majority (72%) age 4 or 5.  Growth was near statewide averages.  Bluegill averaged 4.5 inches by age 3 and 7.6 inches by age 6.    <br> \n <br> \nIn the 2012 population assessment, black crappie abundance was low.  A total of 11 were netted.  Gill net abundance was below the 25th percentile when compared to other similar lakes.  Black crappie abundance is commonly low in Ann Lake, averaging 2.1/gill net in the previous 3 assessments.  Fifty percent were greater than 8 inches and the largest measured was 8.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was low (2.3/gill net, near the 25th percentile).  Perch numbers were higher than the previous assessments in 2006 (0.5/gill net) and 2000 (0.5 /gill net), however considerably lower the historical high of 28.7/gill net in 1995.  In 2012, size structure was small; all measured fish were between 5.0 and 7.4 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nAn assessment of fish in the shallow, nearshore habitats was also conducted using backpack electrofishing and seining.  Nine species were sampled which included banded killifish, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, central mudminnow, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead.  The purpose of the nearshore sampling is to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity score.  An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is estimated based on all fish sampled in this assessment.  The absence of sensitive species such as minnows and darters contribute to a low IBI score.  In August, Ann Lake scored 74.6 out of a maximum of 160, indicating possible water quality and habitat impairment.  In September, the nearshore survey was replicated to look at the repeatability of scores.  The second score was 76.4, very similar to the first. <br> \n</p>",

Boats are restricted to electric trolling motors only. Largemouth bass fishing is catch-and-release only.  Northern pike catch increased from 12 fish per net in 2000 to 15.5 fish per net in 2006.  Average length remained the same at about 24 inches and average weight increased to 3.5 pounds.  The largest northern pike sampled as 39.5 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nAverage size of bluegills sampled increased to 6.1 inches and 48% of all bluegills sampled were over seven inches.  Overall catch dropped from 52.6 fish per trapnet in 2000 to 51.2 fish per trapnet in 2006.  Black crappie catch declined slightly since the last survey and average length per fish dropped to 6.5 inches from 8.1 inches in 2000.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough population assessments do not adequately sample largemouth bass, four were caught during the 2006 survey.  Average length was 15.8 inches and average weight was 2.3 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species collected included: black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann is a 116-acre, Class 24 lake located in Chanhassen, Carver County.  The lakeshore is undeveloped and Lake Ann Park surrounds the majority of the lake.  This city-run park includes a concrete boat ramp and fishing pier.  Boats are restricted to electric trolling motors only.  During high water, the lake is connected to Lake Lucy to the north.  Largemouth bass angling is catch-and-release only.   In 2003, a 24- to 36-inch protected slot limit for northern pike was implemented on Ann Lake.  One pike over 36 inches is allowed in possession.  An ice-out trap net assessment was conducted in 2012 to characterize the adult northern pike population in Lake Ann. <br> \n  <br> \nIce-out occurred on March 18.  Ten trap nets were set in historical locations on March 19.  Surface water temperature was 46 F on the first set day and rose to 49 F on the last lift day.  It appeared some northern pike spawned under the ice as spent individuals were observed.  A total of 29 net lifts over 3 days captured 122 northern pike (4.2/net).  Mean length and weight were 20.2 inches and 2.52 lbs, with the largest reaching 33.5 inches and 9.92 lbs.  Size structure was balanced with a PSD of 56 and RSD-P of 20.  Ages ranged from 1 to 8.  Recruitment appeared consistent as 24% were age 3, 16% were age 6, and other ages were relatively evenly distributed.  Growth was near the statewide average.  Northern pike were 17.7 inches by age 3, and 27.3 inches by age 6.  The two previous ice-out assessments of Ann Lake northern pike were in 2002 and 2003.  Based on the difference between the 2003 and 2012 assessments, mean weight and size structure of the population has improved since the implementation of the slot regulation.  CPUE has fluctuated over time and mean length has remained the same.       <br> \n               Year    CPUE\t   Mean         Mean      Total #        #<20\" (%)      #>24\" (%)     #>30\" (%) <br> \n  (#/TN)    Length       Weight\t\t\t <br> \n2012     4.2\t    20.2 2.52         122\t    64 (52)  34 (28)\t 10 (8) <br> \n2003   12.7\t    20.3 2.13         254\t  128 (50)  43 (17)    7 (3) <br> \n2002     5.3\t    20.6 2.27         105\t    34 (32)  20 (19)\t   4 (4) <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 ice-out assessment was accompanied by a summer population assessment.  It is important to recognize how time of year and gear type can influence the estimation of population characteristics.  Summer gill nets show larger mean size and larger size structure than the spring trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nDate    Season     Gear Mean    Mean     Total    #<20\"      #<24\"     #<30\"   PSD  RSD-P  <br> \n          Length  Weight     # (%) (%) (%) <br> \n3/19    Spring\t    Trap net    20.2       2.52     122      64 (52)     34 (28)     10 (8)     56    20 <br> \n6/4      Summer     Gill net      25.3       3.92       90      15 (17)     59 (66)     11(12)    82    29 <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \nForty largemouth bass were sampled at a rate of 1.4/trap net.  Mean length and weight were 17.4 inches and 3.39 lbs.  Size structure was highly skewed toward large individuals (PSD = 97, RSD-P = 92, RSD-M = 13).  Ages ranged from 1 to 10, and 51% were age 7 or 8.  A nighttime electrofishing survey was conducted in May of 2012 targeting largemouth bass.   This is described in more detail n the population assessment report.  More bass were sampled during the electrofishing, however more large individuals were collected in trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nDate  Season\tGear         Mean    Mean   Total    PSD     RSD-P    RSD-M <br> \n     Length Weight    # <br> \n3/19  Spring\tTrap net    17.4     3.39      40       97        92 13 <br> \n5/19  Spring\tElectrofishing\t   10.5     1.01\t    74       77\t   46   0 <br> \n</p>",

Nine species were sampled which included banded killifish, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, central mudminnow, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead.  The purpose of the nearshore sampling is to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity score.  An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is estimated based on all fish sampled in this assessment.  The absence of sensitive species such as minnows and darters contribute to a low IBI score.  In August, Ann Lake scored 74.6 out of a maximum of 160, indicating possible water quality and habitat impairment.  In September, the nearshore survey was replicated to look at the repeatability of scores.  The second score was 76.4, very similar to the first.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann Lake is a 116-acre (45 littoral acres) lake with a maximum depth of 45 feet, located north of Chanhassen in northeast Carver County. Ann is primarily managed for Northern Pike (special regulation: 24-36\" protected slot, possession limit three, with one over 36\") and Largemouth Bass (special regulation: catch-and-release), but also supports catchable populations of Bluegill and Black Crappie. Public water access is provided by the City of Chanhassen on the southeast side of the lake off State Highway 5, within the Ann Lake City Park (up to 13 vehicle/trailer parking spaces). <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was conducted on Ann Lake during the week of 5/31/2022 to assess the fishery. Ann Lake had moderate water clarity, measured at 13 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen was zero parts per million (ppm) below 24 feet during the survey period. Eurasian Watermilfoil has been found in Ann Lake and remains present. <br> \n <br> \nVery high numbers of Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets (17.3/net). The 2022 survey marked the highest Northern Pike catch rate in the previous 25 years. There were 104 Northern Pike sampled, with an average size of 19.1 inches and the longest measured at 33.5 inches. Despite high numbers, Northern Pike growth was moderate compared to similar lakes across the metro, with an average length of 17.6 inches by age 3, and 22.1 inches by age 5. Despite consistent recruitment, with 8 consecutive year classes present during sampling and age analysis; over 67% of the total catch was represented by the 2019 year class (17.6 inch average length). Northern Pike in Ann Lake are currently dominated by small, young individuals. Due to these factors future discussions should focus on a reevaluation of the current special regulation to provide additional harvest opportunity of these small individuals. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during spring 2022 with nighttime boat electrofishing, the third time such a survey was conducted here. Catch rates were high, with 51.5 fish/hour. A total of 103 bass were sampled, with an average length of 12.4 inches and the largest measured at 19.8 inches. Size and count data describe a balanced population (an intermediate between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish. Over 57% of Largemouth Bass sampled were greater than 12 inches, while 23% were over 15 inches. The special catch-and-release regulation appears to have maintained desirable numbers and sizes of Largemouth Bass and should provide excellent angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (16.9/net). The 2022 catch rate was the lowest Bluegill catch rate on Ann Lake in the previous 25 years. There were 152 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2022 survey, with an average length of 5.6 inches and the largest measured at 9.3 inches. The historic reduction in Bluegill numbers likely reduced competition among other Bluegill, increasing food and habitat availability which increases growth and sizes, as we saw with multiple 9\" fish being sampled. <br> \n  <br> \nLow numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (2.8/net) and trap nets (1.0/net). There were 26 Black Crappie sampled during the 2022 survey, with an average length of 7.8 inches and the largest measured at 11.2 inches. Similar to Bluegill, low numbers of Black Crappie are likely benefiting from reduced competition with an increase to growth and size. The results can be seen during the 2022 sampling with a handful of 10\"+ fish measured, providing excellent angling opportunity for those that can find them. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
