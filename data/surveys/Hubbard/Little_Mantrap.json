                "narrative": "<p>Little Mantrap Lake is located thirteen miles north of Park Rapids on the border of Becker and Hubbard County. Little Mantrap has a surface area of 381 acres and a maximum depth of 54 feet. A DNR owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake. Little Mantrap provides angling opportunities for Largemouth Bass, panfish, Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Little Mantrap is in class 25. Class 25 lakes are generally deep, very clear, have hard water, and are irregularly shaped. Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids management include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, Big Mantrap, Dead, Eagle, Island, Little Sand, Spider, Straight, Third Crow Wing, Two Inlets, and West Crooked. <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in good numbers again in 2022, with fish averaging 12.5 inches.  The longest Largemouth Bass sampled was 17.8 inches in length.  Currently, there is a special regulation for bass on Little Mantrap which states all fish from 12 - 20 inches must be immediately released, and one over 20 inches allowed in possession. <br> \nLittle Mantrap has an abundant sunfish population, including Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish and their hybrids.  Most fish sampled were too small for anglers, but there were some nicer fish ranging up to 8 inches in length. Little Mantrap supports a healthy Black Crappie population.  Special spring sampling targeting Crappies took place in 2022, with most of the fish in the 9.5 - 11.5 inch range.  <br> \nWalleye abundance was better than recent years in Little Mantrap, with one trophy fish sampled at 30 inches in length. Walleyes averaged 17.8 inches in length and were spread out evenly from 13 to 20 inches. Yellow Perch, an important forage species, were sampled in very low numbers and all were under 7 inches in length. <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was at the high end of recent surveys in Little Mantrap. Anglers will find most northern from 15 - 21 inches in length, a great opportunity to take advantage of the current Northern Pike regulation. Northern Pike sampled had an average length of 18.3 inches and weighed 1.3 pounds. <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Little Mantrap Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

Abundance and growth are above average for this area.  Spawning area is fair.  Northern pike are much higher in numbers than the local average but of small size.  Northern pike spawning area is very good.Yellow perch are twice the local average.  Suckers, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and black crappie are present in low numbers.  Bluegills are slightly below the area average and of small size.  Yellow and brown bullheads are present in fairly high numbers but are not considered a problem at this time.Management Recommendations:Walleye fingerling stocking is necessary to maintain a fishable population.  Stock fingerlings (50/lb.) at the rate of one pound per littoral acre in alternate years.</p>",

A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on July 13, 2017 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish. Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, two sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and five were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at three sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all ten sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured several species of fish including three species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Blacknose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a standard fisheries survey on August 7, 2017, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Little Mantrap Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Little Mantrap Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Mantrap is located  on the Hubbard and Becker County lines, sixteen miles north or Park Rapids.  Little Mantrap has a surface area of 381 acres and a maximum depth of 54 feet.  The lake is irregular shaped with two main basins and several smaller bays.  A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the southern bay.  Little Mantrap is a popular lake for Largemouth Bass, Panfish, and Northern Pike fishing, but also supports a bonus Walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Little Mantrap is in lake class 25.  Class 25 lakes are generally deep, clear, hard water lakes, with irregular shaped shoreline.  Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, Eagle, West Crooked, Third Crow Wing, Island, Big Mantrap, Ojbway, and Two Inlets. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should be aware that a special regulation for Largemouth Bass is in place on Little Mantrap that requires the release of all Bass between 12 to 20 inches in length with only one Bass over 20 inches in possession.  Little Mantrap has an excellent Largemouth Bass population, made up of both numbers and sizes of Bass.  Spring electrofishing sampling found good numbers of Largemouth Bass within the protected slot (12-20 inches).  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass in Little Mantrap. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish and Northern Pike are also popular species on Little Mantrap.  The Bluegill and Pumpkinseed population in Little Mantrap are probably known more for numbers than size, however there are enough fish in the 6-8 inch size range to provide good fishing.  Past and present surveys have shown the Black Crappie population in Little Mantrap to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers.  Anglers can expect to find Black Crappie in the 9-11 inch size range.  Anglers will find an abundant Northern Pike population, dominated by small Pike in the 19-21 inch size range.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 18.8 inches and 1.4 pounds, with Pike measured up to 30.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThough not know as a Walleye lake, Little Mantrap does support a low to moderate Walleye population.  Walleye abundance was down slightly from past years with sampled Walleye ranging in length from 15.7 to 24.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included an abundant Yellow Bullhead population and low numbers of Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Rock Bass, and Hybrid Sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Little Mantrap.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Mantrap Lake is located on the Hubbard and Becker County line, sixteen miles north or Park Rapids.  Little Mantrap has a surface area of 348 acres and a maximum depth of 54 feet.  The lake is irregularly shaped with two main basins and several small bays.  A county-owned public access with an earthern ramp is located on the southern bay.  Little Mantrap is a popular lake for largemouth bass, panfish, and northern pike fishing and also contains a bonus walleye population.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Little Mantrap is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Third Crow Wing, Eagle, Island, Big Mantrap, Ojibway, Spider, Straight, and Two Inlets.Demand for larger fish by Minnesota anglers has led to the development of restrictive harvest regulations on certain lakes.  These regulations are part of an experiment to increase the numbers of large fish in Minnesota's lakes.  Little Mantrap was chosen for an experimental regulation for largemouth bass based on its present and past largemouth bass population and its estimated capacity to produce large bass.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Little Mantrap.  Starting in 1997, all largemouth bass from 12.0 to 18.0 inches must be immediately returned to the water (12-18 inch protected slot).  Special sampling such as spring electrofishing was conducted in 2002 to evaluate largemouth bass abundance and size stucture.  Electrofishing results found high numbers of largemouth bass within the protected slot (12-18 inches) with bass measured up to 20.0 inches.  The excellent largemouth bass population found in Little Mantrap will be maintained with the continued strong angler support and compliance of the protected slot regulation.Northern pike and panfish are also popular species on Little Mantrap.  While larger northern pike are present, anglers will find lots of small, \"hammer handle\" pike in the lake.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19.0 inches and 1.5 pounds.  The northern pike population in Little Mantrap is limited by moderate to high recruitment of young pike, and very slow growth rates.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers (21.5 bluegill/trapnet), similar to past surveys and within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  The bluegill population in Little Mantrap is probably known more for numbers than size, however, there are enough fish in the 6-8 inch size range that you can sort through the small ones and still get enough \"eaters\".  Little Mantrap can provide good crappie fishing in the spring.  Anglers can expect to find black crappie in the 9-11 inch size range.Though not known as a walleye lake, Little Mantrap does support a \"bonus\" walleye population.  Walleye abundance (2.3 walleye/gillnet) was near the management goal of 3.0 walleye/gillnet and within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Little Mantrap is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.Other species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead, and low numbers of yellow perch, black bullhead, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and hybrid sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Mantrap is located on the Hubbard and Becker County lines, sixteen miles north of Park Rapids.  Little Mantrap has a surface area of 381 acres and a maximum depth of 54 feet.  The lake is irregularly shaped with two main basins and several small bays.  A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the southern bay.  Little Mantrap is a popular lake for largemouth bass, panfish, and northern pike fishing, but also supports a bonus walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical chemical and other characteristics.  Little Mantrap is in lake class 25, generally characterized by being deep, clear, hard water lakes with irregularly shaped shorelines.  Similar lakes in the Park Rapids area Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Third Crow Wing, Eagle, Island, Big Mantrap, Ojibway, Little Sand, Spider, Straight, and Two Inlets. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should be aware that a special regulation for largemouth bass is in place on Little Mantrap that requires the release of all bass between 12 to 20 inches in length (12-20 inch protected slot length limit), with only one bass over 20 inches in possession.  Past and present surveys have shown Little Mantrap to have an excellent largemouth bass population, made up of both numbers and sizes of bass.  Spring electrofishing sampling found high numbers of largemouth bass within the protected slot (12-20 inches).  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Little Mantrap. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish and northern pike are also popular species on Little Mantrap.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers, similar to past surveys and within the range for similar type lakes.  The bluegill population in Little Mantrap is probably know more for numbers than size, however there are enough fish in the 6-8 inch size range to provide good fishing.  Present and past surveys have shown a good black crappie population in Little Mantrap.  Anglers can expect to find black crappie in the 9-11 inch size range.  While larger northern pike are present, anglers will find lots of small, \"hammer handle\" pike in the lake.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 18 inches and 1.1 pounds, with pike measured up to 27 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThough not known as a walleye lake, Little Mantrap does support a low to moderate walleye population.  Walleye abundance was at the low end of the range for similar type lakes.  Little Mantrap is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead, and low numbers of brown bullhead, rock bass, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Little Mantrap Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

Historical walleye gillnet catches have ranged from a low of 1.0 per net (1992) to a high of 4.33 per net (1982).  Walleye up to 26.8 inches were measured.  Walleye growth was good compared to area lakes.  Northern pike were sampled in high numbers (11.3 per gillnet).  Size of northern pike was small, with an average length and weight of 18.9 inches and 1.7 lbs, respectively.  Historical northern pike gillnet catches have ranged from 4.55 per net (1961) to 11.3 per net (1994, 1987, 1982).  Northern pike up to 30.5 inches were measured; their growth was slow.  Bluegill were sampled at moderate numbers for area lakes (27.6 per trapnet).  Bluegills had an average length of 6.2 inches, with fish measured up to 7.6 inches.  Historical bluegill trapnet catches have ranged from 7.8/net (1982) to 34.1/net (1961).  Yellow perch were sampled in moderate numbers (19.9 per gillnet).  Yellow perch catches have fluctuated from 3.83/net (1992) to 29.3 per net (1982).  Yellow perch were small in size, with an average length of 6.9 inches with fish measuring up to 9.2 inches.  Largemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers for standard survey gear types (1.0 per gillnet and 0.3 per trapnet).  Largemouth bass up to 13.9 inches were measured.  Special sampling is needed to better evaluate population parameters for this species.  Yellow bullhead were sampled in high numbers (12.7 per gillnet).  Historical gillnet catches of yellow bullhead have been much higher: 63.7 per net (1992) and 70.8 per net (1987).  Yellow bullhead were measured up to 10.8 inches.  Brown bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers (2.3 per gillnet), and were large in size, with an average length of 11.4 inches.  Brown bullhead up to 13.2 inches were measured.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, with a catch of 0.3 per net and 0.1 per net for gillnets and trapnets, respectively.  Historical catches of black crappie have been low.  Black crappie up to 8.9 inches were measured. Pumpkinseed were sampled in low numbers (2.9 per trapnet).  Pumpkinseed were small in size, with an average length of 5.5 inches.  Hybrid sunfish were present (3.8 per trapnet), with fish measured up to 7.9 inches.  White sucker were sampled in low numbers (1.0 per gillnet).</p>",

This was reflected in fishing reports from residents.Management Recommendations:Continue to manage as a largemouth bass, northern pike lake.  Walleye fingerlings may be stocked, but not in large numbers, so as not to interfer with the largemouth bass population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Number of walleye sampled (1.00 fish/gillnet) was slightly below the first quartile, whereas 3.12 lbs/gillnet was within the normal range for Lake Class 25.  1992 was the first year abundance was not within the normal range, but was also the year with the highest mean weight (3.12 pounds).  The size structure (PSD=67, RSD-P=50) indicates high proportions of quality and preferred-length fish in the population.  However, no walleye sampled in 1992 were >24.0 inches, even though three walleye were age 9 or 10.  Walleye exhibit good growth, averaging 15.16 inches at age 4.  Some walleye natural reproduction is occurring in Little Mantrap Lake, as evidenced by the 1982 and 1989 year classes, which account for 71% of the sampled fish.  Walleye year classes from years of fingerling stocking were poorly represented in net catches.Northern pike abundance had been increasing until 1992, when the number sampled (6.83 fish/gillnet) fell to within the normal range while pounds per gillnet (17.30) remained above the third quartile.  Mean individual weight has also been increasing to a high of 2.53 pounds in 1992.  Northern pike size structure (PSD=48) indicates good numbers of quality-length fish; however, no northern pike sampled were >28.0 inches.  Slow growth rates appear to contribute to the absence of preferred-length northern pike.  Mean length at age 4 is only 18.06 inches.  Consistently high northern pike recruitment, along with declining yellow perch abundance, results in the slow growth rates exhibited by northern pike.Largemouth bass gillnet catch rates have been above the third quartile since 1987.  There are abundant quality-length largemouth bass (PSD=56), but none were taken over 15.0 inches.  Largemouth bass exhibit good growth rates after a very slow start the first two years.  Mean length at age 4 is 9.27 inches.  Black crappie, yellow perch and bluegill net catches were within the normal ranges for lakes in Class 25.  Black crappie ranged in length from 5.5 to 8.9 inches.  Yellow perch also have a small size structure (PSD=14).  A large decrease has occurred in yellow perch abundance, which fell from 29.33 fish/gillnet in 1982 to 3.83 fish/gillnet in 1992.  Both gillnet and trapnet catches of bluegill have increased substantially since 1982.  Bluegill exhibit slow growth, averaging 4.82 inches at age 5.  These slow growth rates contribute to the absence of preferred-length fish.  Although high numbers of bluegill are quality-length (PSD=54), none sampled were >8.0 inches.  Pumpkinseed have a size structure (PSD=40) similar to bluegill.  Both pumpkinseed and rock bass trapnet catches were below the first quartile in 1992.  The white sucker population has always been low in Little Mantrap Lake, and gillnet catches were below the first quartile in 1992.  Both yellow and brown bullhead gillnet catch rates were above the third quartile in 1992.  Yellow bullhead were first sampled in 1982 and since that time have increased greatly in abundance.  In contrast, brown bullhead density has been decreasing since 1975.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Mantrap Lake is located just south of Itasca Park, and part of its watershed includes some of the park.  The lake covers about 327 acres and is located in both Hubbard and Becker counties.  It has a maximum depth of 51 feet with 52 percent of this lake being 15 feet or shallower.  Shoal water soils are mostly gravel and boulder with a small amount of sand and marl.Shoreline development has been limited mainly to the northeast bay of the lake.  At the time of the survey (1961) there were four resorts with 39 cabins, 22 private homes and cottages, and 49 boats located on this lake.Fish showing up in test nets in numbers larger than the state-wide median were northern pike, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, and bluegill.  During the summer of 1961 there was approximately 22,639 man-hours of fishing pressure expended on this lake.  There were ten fish houses located on this lake during the peak of winter fishing in 1961-62.Fish StockingThe continued stocking of walleye is apparently necessary to maintain a good fishery.  Discontinue sunfish stocking because at the present time there is a good resident population in this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Mantrap Lake is located on the Hubbard and Becker County line, sixteen miles north of Park Rapids.  Little Mantrap has a surface area of 348 acres and a maximum depth of 54 feet.  The lake is irregularly shaped with two main basins and several small bays.  Little Mantrap is a popular lake for panfish, northern pike, and largemouth bass fishing.  A county-owned access with an earthen ramp is located on the southern bay.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Little Mantrap is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same class include: Bad Axe (2 miles northeast of Emmaville), Belle Taine (west of Nevis), West Crooked (7 miles northwest of Nevis), Third Crow Wing (8 miles east of Hubbard), Eagle (7 miles north of Park Rapids), Island (9 miles north of Park Rapids), Big Mantrap (2 miles east of Emmaville), Ojibway (5 miles north of Dorset), Spider (2.5 miles north of Nevis), Straight (borders Osage), and Two Inlets (2 miles south of the town of Two Inlets).  Demand for larger fish by Minnesota anglers has led to the development of restrictive harvest regulations on certain lakes.  These regulations are part of an experiment to increase the numbers of large fish in Minnesota's lakes.  Little Mantrap was chosen for an experimental regulation for largemouth bass based on its present and past largemouth bass population and its estimated capacity to produce large bass.  Starting with the 1997 open water season, all largemouth bass from 12.0 to 18.0 inches must be immediately returned to the water.  Spring electrofishing was conducted on Little Mantrap in 1995 and 1996 and will be conducted in future years to evaluate the regulation.  The 1995 electrofishing survey found 24% of the largemouth sampled (46 fish) were 15.0 inches or greater in length, while 13% of the largemouth sample (14 fish) in 1996 were greater than 15.0 inches.  Largemouth bass up to 19.4 inches were sampled in both 1995 and 1996.  Largemouth bass growth rates were slow after age two when compared to other class 25 lakes.  With angler support and compliance of the largemouth bass regulation, an increase in larger bass (greater than 15.0 inches) should be observed.Northern pike were sampled in high numbers (15.5/gillnet), above the range typical for lake class 25.  Of the five previous surveys dating back to 1961, two surveys have been at high numbers (11.3/gillnet in 1982, 87), and three surveys at moderate levels ranging from 4.5/gillnet (1961) to 6.8/net (1992).  Average size of northern pike in the 1997 survey was small (19.1 inches and 1.9 pounds).  Larger northern pike are present, however, with fish measured up to 34.3 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were below other class 25 lakes.The bluegill trapnet catch rate of 21.3/net is within the range typical for lake class 25.  Three of the previous five surveys have had similar bluegill trapnet catch rates ranging from 20.9/net (1975) to 34.2/net (1961) while two surveys were at low levels, 7.8/net (1982) and 8.2/net (1987).  Sampled bluegill were an average length of 6.0 inches with fish measured up to 8.0 inches.  Bluegill growth rates were similar to other class 25 lakes.The black crappie gillnet catch rate of 2.4/net and the trapnet catch rate of 1.1/net are both within the range typical for lake class 25 and similar to past surveys.  Sampled black crappie were an average length of 7.9 inches with fish measured up to 11.3 inches.  Black crappie growth rates began to slow at age five when compared to other class 25 lakes.The walleye gillnet catch rate of 1.9/net is within the range typical for class 25 and similar to past surveys.  Previous surveys have had similar walleye gillnet catch rates ranging from 1.0/net (1992) to 4.3/net (1982).  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 14.7 to 25.7 inches.  The walleye population in Little Mantrap is maintained through walleye fingerling stockings on even calendar years.  All walleye that were aged corresponded to years of walleye stocking.  Walleye growth rates were slow when compared to other class 25 lakes.  The yellow perch gillnet catch rate of 3.3/net is within the range typical for lake class 25 and similar to the previous survey in 1992 (3.8/net).  Historical yellow perch gillnet catch rates have ranged from 0.0/net (1975) to 29.3/net (1982).  The yellow perch population in Little Mantrap primarily provide forage for the northern and walleye populations.  Perch are generally too small in size to provide much of a fishery.  Sampled yellow perch were an average length of 7.3 inches with fish measured up to 8.7 inches.Yellow bullhead were sampled in high numbers (17.4/gillnet), above the range typical for lake class 25.  Historical yellow bullhead gillnet catches have fluctuated.  No yellow bullhead were sampled in the 1961 or 1975 surveys, while other survey gillnet catch rates have ranged from 16.3/net (1982) to 70.8/net (1987).  Brown bullhead were not sampled in the 1997 survey, but have been sampled at moderate to high numbers in the past.  Black bullhead were sampled in the  1961 and 1987 surveys at low levels (0.5/gillnet).Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Little Mantrap and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Mantrap is located on the Hubbard and Becker County line, sixteen miles north of Park Rapids.  Little Mantrap has a surface area of 348 acres and a maximum depth of 54 feet.  The lake is irregularly shaped with two main basins and several small bays.  A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the southern bay.  Little Mantrap is a popular lake for largemouth bass, panfish, and northern pike fishing, but also contains a bonus walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Little Mantrap is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Third Crow Wing, Eagle, Island, Big Mantrap, Ojibway, Spider, Straight, and Two Inlets. <br> \n <br> \nDemand for larger fish by Minnesota anglers has led to the development of restrictive harvest regulations on certain lakes.  These regulations are part of an experiment to increase the numbers of large fish in Minnesota's lakes.  Little Mantrap was chosen for a special regulation for largemouth bass based on its present and past largemouth bass population and its estimated capacity to produce large bass.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Little Mantrap.  All bass from 12.0 to 18.0 must be immediately returned to the water (12-18 inch protected slot).  This protected slot length limit for largemouth bass has been in place since 1997.  Spring electrofishing was conducted in 2007 to evaluate largemouth bass abundance and size structure.  Electrofishing results found high numbers of largemouth bass within the protected slot (12-18 inches) with bass measured up to 19.0 inches.  The excellent largemouth bass population found in Little Mantrap will be maintained with the continued strong angler support and compliance of the protected slot regulation. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and panfish are also popular species on Little Mantrap.  While larger northern pike are present, anglers will find lots of small, \"hammer handle\" pike in the lake.  Sampled northern pike had and average length and weight of 19.6 inches and 1.8 pounds, with pike measured up to 31.1 inches.  Moderate to high recruitment of young pike, and slow growth rates limit the northern pike population in Little Mantrap.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers (30.6 bluegill/trapnet), similar to past surveys and within the range \"typical\" for this lake class. The bluegill population in Little Mantrap is probably known more for numbers than size, however, there are enough fish in the 6-8 inch size range that you can sort through the small ones and still get enough \"eaters\".  Little Mantrap can provide good crappie fishing in the spring.  Anglers can expect to find black crappie in the 9-11 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nThough not known as a walleye lake, Little Mantrap does support a \"bonus\" walleye population.  Walleye abundance (1.5 walleye/gillnet) was near the current management goal of 2 walleye/gillnet and similar to past surveys.  Little Mantrap is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead, and low numbers of brown bullhead, rock bass, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n</p>",
