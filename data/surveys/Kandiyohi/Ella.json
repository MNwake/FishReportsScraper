                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Lake Ella was conducted during mid June of 2011. Ella is a small (136 acres), shallow (12 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Several springs are located along the north shore. Partial winterkills have occurred in Ella, but are generally rare. Conditions were conducive for a potential winterkill during the harsh winter of February 2010. Low numbers of dead fish (carp, bass, walleye and bluegill) were observed after ice out, but gamefish species were abundant in spring ice out trapnets during 2010. Water levels were above normal during the spring and early summer of 2011, but low by late fall. High nutrient runoff inflows are common into Ella during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. The outlet connects to Lake Elizabeth during moderate to high water levels. Fish movement between the two lakes is possible via the outlet channel during high flows. There were high levels of total phosphorus (0.060 ppm) and chlorophyll-a (17.5 ppb) in Ella during 2006. Dissolved oxygen readings were low (<6.0 ppm) in Ella during mid June of 2011. The water clarity was fair (secchi disc=3.00 feet) during the 2011 assessment. High densities of submergent vegetation (curly-leaf pondweed) were present during the spring and summer of 2002 however densities were low during 2006 and 2011. Low densities of submergents included sago pondweed, water moss, and coontail. Broad-leaved cattail was a common emergent around the south and east shoreline areas. Shoalwater substrates were mostly marl, muck, silt, and clay. Residential development is limited to several farm sites.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was high in 2011 (33.00 fish/gillnet) and above the normal ranges for Ella and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 11.69 fish/gillnet. The yellow perch average size was moderate (0.29 pounds and 8.17 inches) from the gillnet catch in 2011. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.17 pounds for Ella. The catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was high (24.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2011 assessment.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was high in 2011 (7.00 fish/gillnet) and above or near the upper ends of the normal ranges for Ella and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 5.78 fish/gillnet. The northern pike average size was moderate (3.07 pounds and 23.12 inches) from the gillnet catch. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.66 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was high (5.00 fish/gillnet) in 2011. Northern pike growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. Northern pike numbers captured in the 2011 assessment comprised several different year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was moderate in 2011 (15.67 fish/trapnet) and within the normal ranges for Ella and similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 26.28 fish/trapnet. Abundant numbers of bluegill (96.00 fish/trapnet, 5.03 inches average length) were captured in the previous 2006 resurvey. The 2011 bluegill average size was large (0.31 pounds and 6.72 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.17 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was high (12.97 fish/trapnet) in 2011. The catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches) and larger bluegill was also high (4.38 fish/trapnet) in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was high in 2011 (10.00 fish/gillnet, 20.83 fish/trapnet) and near the upper ends of the normal ranges for Ella and similar lakes. The 2011 black crappie average size was small to moderate from both gillnet (0.23 pounds and 6.60 inches) and trapnet catches (0.29 pounds and 7.08 inches). The black crappie historical average weights are 0.13 and 0.21 pounds respectively from gillnets and trapnets. The catch rate of preferred size (10.00 inches) and larger black crappie was high (4.67 fish/trapnet) in 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite crappie abundance was high in 2011 (6.50 fish/trapnet) and above the normal ranges for Ella and similar lakes. The white crappie historical average catch rate is 2.36 fish/trapnet. The 2011 white crappie average size was moderate (0.32 pounds and 8.37 inches) from trapnets. The white crappie historical average weight is 0.68 pounds from trapnets in Ella. The catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger white crappie was high (5.00 fish/trapnet) in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were not captured in the gillnet or trapnets during 2011. Abundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" and yearling largemouth bass were captured by near shore electrofishing and seining gears during late July of 2011. Largemouth bass abundance in 2006 (1.50 fish/gillnet) was at the upper end of the normal range for similar lakes. A spring electrofishing survey was not conducted on Ella during 2011. The largemouth bass average weight was moderate (1.37 pounds) from the 2006 gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance low in 2011 (3.00 fish/gillnet) and near the lower ends of the normal ranges for Ella and similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 6.56 fish/gillnet. The 2011 walleye trapnet catch (2.17 fish/trapnet, 1.12 pounds average weight) was similar to the historical average (1.86 fish/trapnet). The 2011 walleye average size was moderate (1.06 pounds and 14.15 inches) from gillnet catch. The walleye historical average weight is 2.08 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was low (1.00 fish/gillnet) in 2011. Walleye growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3 and ages 5-7, but above the normal range for age 4. The 2008 year class comprised the majority (44%) of the 2011 walleye catch. The 2009 year class (38%) may be from natural reproduction or walleye movement into Ella from Elizabeth (2009 fry stocking). Walleye movement from Elizabeth into Carrie Lake may have also occurred in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Ella is generally insignificant or rare based on previous fall and summer surveys. Prior to 2008, walleye fry were stocked in Ella every other odd year since 1983. Walleye fry stockings were generally successful during the 1990's as documented by fall electrofishing and summer surveys, but generally unsuccessful from 2003 to 2007. Walleye frylings (approximately 1 inch average length, 1,500 fish/pound) became available from the New London Hatchery in 2008. Ella was stocked with 33,403 and 35,051 walleye frylings in late/mid June of 2008 and 2010 respectively. YOY walleye catch rates were low to moderate in 2008 (25.26 YOY/hour, 7.01 inches length) and 2010 (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.55 inches) fall electrofishing surveys, but better than fall electrofishing surveys during recent fry stocking years. YOY walleye average size was excellent in 2008 and 2010 fall electrofishing surveys. Walleye frylings are scheduled for stocking in 2012 for Ella. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance was low in 2011 (2.00 fish/gillnet) and below the normal ranges for Ella and similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 25.36 fish/gillnet. Black bullhead catch rate (0.83 fish/trapnet) was also low in the 2011 trapnets. The 2011 black bullhead average size was large (0.76 pounds and 10.65 inches) from the gillnet catch. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.46 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp abundance was low in 2011 (1.00 fish/trapnet) and below the normal ranges for Ella and similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 1.78 fish/trapnet. The 2011 carp average size was large (6.45 pounds and 23.88 inches) from trapnets. The historical average weight is 5.66 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Ella include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking walleye fry or frylings every other year. The Ella fishery will be surveyed in the 2016 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry or fryling stocked years to assess the success or failure of these stockings. <br> \n</p>",

THE DECLINE IN THE WAE POPULATION MAY HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE REDUCTION IN THE FRY STOCKING RATE FOR THE STOCKINGS AFTER 1985 (APPROXIMATELY 3,800 FRY/ACRE TO 1,000 FRY/ACRE).  NOP ARE DEPENDANT ON HIGH SPRING WATER LEVELS TO UTILIZE ADJACENT MARSHLANDS FOR SPAWNING (NO WINTER RESCUE STOCKING ON THIS LAKE).  WATER LEVELS HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY LOWER IN THE LATE 1980'S.  THE RELATIVELY HIGH NOP ABUNDANCE IN 1986 MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY IMMIGRATION FROM LAKE ELIZABETH (NO BARRIER) DURING HIGH WATER IN THE MID 1980'S.  CRAPPIE APPEAR ABUNDANT WITH THE WHC SHOWING BETTER GROWTH.  ELLA WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE WINTERKILLED DURING 1985-1986, BUT THE 1986 SURVEY SHOWED GOOD GAMEFISH POPULATIONS.  CRAPPIE YOY WERE VERY ABUNDANT IN THE 1990 SEINE HAULS (1,871) AND BLG HAD FAIR REPRESENTATION (154).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Ella is small (136 acres) and productive with a maximum depth of 12 feet. A smallinlet drains into the northwest corner of the lake. Springs are present along the northshore. The outlet drains into Lake Elizabeth. Water clarity was low in 1996 (secchi disc=1.2ft on 6/19/96). The water is a brown stained color. The only water quality data collected wasfrom June of 1986 with the following results: pH=8.4, Total Alkalinity=204 ppm, TotalDissolved Solids=276, Total Phosphorus=0.085 ppm. Nutrient runoff is from agriculturalsources (row crops, feedlots). Summer dissolved oxygen readings during the survey period wereabove 5.0 ppm throughout the water column. Periodic winterkills have occurred in Ella. InMarch of 1997, both Ella and Elizabeth were opened to unlimited fishing because these lakeshad the potential to winterkill because of low dissolved oxygen levels (Ella=0.3 ppm,Elizabeth=1.6 ppm). Lake Carrie (connected to Elizabeth) had adequate winter dissolved oxygenlevels. Spring testing netting in April of 1997 determined that numerous gamefish (walleye,northern pike, black crappie, yellow perch) survived in both Ella and Elizabeth. Algae bloomsare common in Ella Lake during the summer. Submergent vegetation is rare and limited to waterdepths less than one foot. The most frequently occurring submergent species is water moss.Emergent vegetation is limited primarily to common cattail. Small cattail stands arescattered along the shoreline with the greatest densities along the east shoreline. Theshoalwater substrates are composed primarily of silt, marl, sand, gravel, rubble, anddetritus. Natural reproduction is poor to none for walleye, and fair for other species suchas crappies, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, yellow perch. There is potential forfish movement either way between Ella and Lake Elizabeth during high/average water levels.The surrounding shoreline generally consists of a hardwood fringe with marshlands andfarmlands adjacent. Development is limited to 3 farms sites adjacent to Ella (1986 survey).Angling pressure is generally low on Ella except when fishing is good for walleye, crappie,or northern pike. The lake is managed for walleye as the primary species with crappies,yellow perch, northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill as secondary species. Ella wasstocked in the 1995 spring with walleye fry (190,000). Both Ella and Elizabeth are scheduledto stocked with walleye fry every odd year. If winterkill occurs within Ella, then adultnorthern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch brood fish will berestocked the following spring.     Walleye abundance in 1996 (13.0 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (2.3 - 18.1 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 43, but above the historicalaverage (7.1 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (16.8 inches from gillnets and trapnetscombined) was above the historical average (15.4 inches). The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 71.0 and38.7 respectively. Growth rates appear average compared to area lakes. It appears that mostwalleye represented are from fry stocked year classes.     Northern pike abundance in 1996 (6.5 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.1 - 8.0 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 43 and equal to the historicalaverage (6.5 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (21.4 inches from gillnets and trapnets)was similar to the historical average. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 47.6 and 9.5 respectively.The growth rates appear average/good compared to other area lakes. About 55% of the northernpike captured were from the 1995 year class.     Both black and white crappie are present within Ella, Elizabeth, and Carrie.Historically, black crappie have been more prevalent than white crappie in Ella. Blackcrappie abundance in 1996 (8.2 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rd median interquartilerange (1.2 - 20.5 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 43 and similar to the historical average (8.9fish/trapnet). White crappie abundance in 1996 (0.5 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rdmedian interquartile range (0.3 - 6.0 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 43, but below thehistorical average (2.5 fish/trapnet). The black crappie average size in 1996 (6.7 inchesfrom gillnets and trapnets) was slightly below the historical average (7.2 inches). The whitecrappie average size in 1996 was 14.2 inches (3 fish). The 1996 black crappie PSD and RSD-Pwas 10.9 and 0 respectively. Growth rates appear average for both black and white crappie inElla. About 88% of the black crappie belonged to the 1994 year class. The white crappiecaptured belonged to the 1990 and 1989 year classes.     Bluegill abundance in 1996 (28.7) was above the 1st and 3rd median interquartile range(1.2 - 20.0 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 43 and the highest recorded catch within Ella(historical average=11.7 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (5.3 inches from gillnets andtrapnets) was below the historical average (5.9 inches). The largest bluegill captured inElla was 10.0 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 5.7 and 2.9 respectively. Growth ratesappear average/good compared to other area lakes. About 77% of the bluegill captured belongedto 1993 year class. Adult prespawn bluegills were stocked into Ella in 1991 (6,726 fish at11 fish/lb) and 1993 (4,119 fish at 7 fish/lb) to boost population numbers. It appears thatthe stocked bluegills probably produced the excellent 1993 year class.     Yellow perch abundance in 1996 (4.0 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (2.7 - 25.0 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 43 and similar to the historicalaverage (4.4 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (6.6 inches from gillnets and trapnets) wassimilar to the historical average (6.5 inches). The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (gillnets and trapnetscombined) was 10.0 for both. Growth rates appear good in Ella compared to other area lakes.About 60% of the fish belonged to the 1994 year class.     Black bullhead abundance in 1996 (3.0 fish/trapnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (11.5 - 132.6 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 43 and below the historicalaverage (38.8 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (10.2 inches) was above the historicalaverage (9.3 inches). Yellow bullhead abundance (2.7 fish/trapnet) in 1996 was within the 1stand 3rd median interquartile range (0.5 - 2.5 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 43, but below thehistorical average (5.5 fish/trapnet). One channel catfish (26.4 inches, 9.4 lbs) was caughtin a trapnet in 1996. Channel catfish were never stocked into Ella, Elizabeth, or Carrie.However, this fish may have been illegally stocked or may have entered Ella from the SouthFork of the Crow River via county ditches and Johnson Lake.     Carp abundance in 1996 (4.0 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.0 -13.8 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 43, but above the historicalaverage (1.9 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (21.5 inches from gillnets and trapnets)was similar to the historical average (20.6 inches).     Ella and Elizabeth did not winterkill during the 1996-97 winter. A population assessmentwill be scheduled for the summer of 1998 in order to provide information about the variousfish populations within Ella and Elizabeth. It appears that Ella is well suited for a varietyof species especially walleye and crappie. Supplemental adult bluegill stocking may benecessary if natural reproduction becomes limited. Walleye fry will be stocked in the springof 1997. Stocking walleye fry is preferable to fingerlings because of past stocking successand the poor water clarity in Ella. Walleye fry stocking was successful in 1995 (198.0YOY/hour, 5.9 inches average size) based on fall electrofishing. Other management optionsinclude encouraging local landowners to implement best management practices (conservationtillage, wetland restoration, feedlot and manure management, planting buffer strips) andseeking funding for aeration systems on both Ella and Elizabeth.</p>",

Walleye movement out of or into Ella via Lake Elizabeth can also occur during high water events. Prior to 2008, Walleye fry were stocked in Ella every other odd year since 1983. Ella was stocked with 33,403 and 35,051 Walleye frylings (1-2 inch average length) in late/mid-June of 2008 and 2010 respectively. YOY Walleye catch rates were low to moderate in 2008 (25.26 YOY/hour, 7.0 inches length) and 2010 (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.6 inches) fall electrofishing surveys, but better than fall electrofishing surveys of 2003-2007 fry stocking years. Walleye fry were recently stocked into Ella due to no/minimal fryling availability during 2015 (152,385 fry), 2017 (103,822 fry) and 2018 (115,064 fry). <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers (18.00 YOY/hour, 6.2 inches) and no yearling Walleye were captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on Ella during September 7, 2023 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. Two stations were sampled for a total of 20 minutes. The water temperature was 73 F. Water clarity was poor (6\"). Light densities of sago pondweed were present during the 2023 electrofishing survey. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nLake Ella experienced a significant winterkill of Walleye and Common Carp during the 2022-23 winter. Lake Elizabeth also had a significant winterkill of Walleye and Common Carp near the Lake Ella outlet area. The Ella standard lake survey trapnet catch (3 single frame sets during early June of 2023) consisted of numerous adult Northern Pike, White Crappie and Black Bullhead in addition to low numbers of Bluegill, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. Poor conditions such as high snowfall, long winter duration, low water and high aquatic vegetation contributed to the winterkill severity in many local lakes for 2022-23 winter. A partial winterkill of mostly Common Carp and Walleye occurred near the outlet area during February of 2019.  <br> \n <br> \nElla is a small (153 acres), shallow (12 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Walleye natural reproduction in Ella is generally insignificant or rare based on previous surveys. Walleye movement out of or into Ella via Lake Elizabeth can also occur during high water events. Walleye fry were generally stocked in Ella every other odd year from 1983-2007. Ella was stocked with 33,403 and 35,051 Walleye frylings (1-2 inch average length) in late/mid-June of 2008 and 2010 respectively. YOY Walleye catch rates were low to moderate in 2008 (25.26 YOY/hour, 7.01 inches length) and 2010 (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.55 inches) fall electrofishing surveys, but better than fall electrofishing surveys of 2003-2007 fry stocked years (3-20 YOY/hour). Walleye fry were stocked into Ella due to no/minimal fryling availability during 2015 (152,385 fry), 2017 (103,822 fry), 2018 (115,064 fry), 2019 (101,232 fry), 2021 (105,525 fry) and 2023 (76,262 fry). The fryling program has been discontinued. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of YOY Walleye (6.00 YOY/hour, 5.66 inches) were caught in the 2023 fall daytime electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye are probably more numerous than documented in 2023 due to daytime electrofishing being less effective than nighttime electrofishing for catching YOY Walleye. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (102.00 YOY/hour, 5.57 inches) were captured in the 2019 fall night electrofishing survey. No Yearling Walleye were captured in 2019. We observed moderate numbers of Bluegill in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (18.00 YOY/hour, 6.17 inches) and no yearling Walleye were captured in the 2018 fall night electrofishing survey. No YOY or yearling Walleye were captured in the 2017 fall night electrofishing survey. Moderate numbers of YOY Walleye (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.12 inches) were captured in the 2015 fall night electrofishing survey. Nearby Lake Elizabeth had a slightly lower catch rate (30.00 YOY/hour, 5.52 inches), but no Walleye fry were stocked in Elizabeth during 2015. Low YOY Walleye numbers (6.00 YOY/hour, 7.68 inches average length) due to natural reproduction or movement from Elizabeth were sampled in the 2013 night fall electrofishing survey. Walleye fingerlings (239 pounds, 5,975 fish) were stocked into Ella during the 2013 fall after the fall night electrofishing survey.  <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye numbers (10.33 fish/gillnet, 1.42 pounds and 15.60 inches) were abundant in the most recent 2021 standard summer gillnet and trapnet survey. Approximately 50% of the 2021 summer catch was from the 2019 year class. However, Walleye numbers are currently reduced as of 2023 due to the recent winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nThe Ella fishery will be surveyed in the 2026 summer for all fish species. Walleye fry will be stocked annually. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted periodically during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of these stockings. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Lake Ella was conducted during mid June of 2006. Ella is a small (136 acres), shallow (12 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Several springs are located along the north shore. Partial winterkills have occurred in Ella, but are generally rare. Water levels were below normal during 2006. High nutrient runoff inflows are common into Ella during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. The outlet connects to Lake Elizabeth during moderate to high water levels. There were high levels of total phosphorus (0.060 ppm) and chlorophyll-a (17.5 ppb) in 2006. The water clarity was poor (secchi disc=2.20 feet) during the 2006 resurvey. High densities of submergent vegetation (curly-leaf pondweed) were present during the spring and summer of 2002, however densities were low during 2006. Low densities of submergents included sago pondweed, water moss, and coontail. Broad-leaved cattail was a common emergent around the south and east shoreline areas. Shoalwater substrates were mostly marl, muck, silt, and clay. Residential development is limited to several farm sites.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2006 (2.65 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 7.43 fish/gillnet. The yellow perch average size was small (0.07 pounds and 5.60 inches from gillnets). Yellow perch growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. The 2004 year class comprised the majority of the 2006 yellow perch catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate in 2006 (5.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 5.53 fish/gillnet. The northern pike average size was moderate (3.34 pounds and 25.56 inches from gillnets). The northern pike historical average weight is 2.58 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was high (5.50 fish/gillnet) in the 2006 resurvey. Northern pike growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. Northern pike numbers captured in the 2006 resurvey comprised several different year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2006 (96.00 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 28.40 fish/trapnet. The 2006 bluegill average size was small (0.10 pounds and 5.03 inches from trapnets). The bluegill historical average weight is 0.15 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was high (22.33 fish/trapnet) in the 2006 resurvey. Bluegill growth rates were within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2006 (21.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2006 black crappie average size was small (0.12 pounds and 5.94 inches from gillnets). The black crappie historical average weight is 0.11 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was low (1.50 fish/gillnet) in the 2006 resurvey. Black crappie growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. The 2005 and 2003 year classes comprised the majority of the 2006 black crappie catch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were moderate to high in 2006 (1.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The largemouth bass average weight was moderate (1.37 pounds) in the 2006 gillnets. Largemouth bass growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate in 2006 (7.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 7.27 fish/gillnet. The 2006 walleye average size was moderate (1.31 pounds and 14.75 inches from gillnets). The walleye historical average weight is 2.28 pounds. Walleye growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal range for ages 1-5. The catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was low (1.50 fish/gillnet) in 2006. The 2004 year class comprised the majority of the 2006 walleye catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Ella is generally insignificant or rare based on previous fall and summer surveys. Ella was stocked with 72,558 and 68,056 walleye fry in the spring of 2004 and 2005. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were moderate in 2006 (40.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 30.03 fish/gillnet. The 2006 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.55 pounds and 9.95 inches from gillnets). The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.40 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were moderate in 2006 (4.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 1.93 fish/gillnet. The 2006 carp average size was moderate (4.27 pounds and 21.33 inches from gillnets). The historical average weight is 3.66 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Ella include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking walleye fry every other year. The Ella fishery will be surveyed in the 2011 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye movement out of or into Ella via Lake Elizabeth can also occur during high water events. Prior to 2008, Walleye fry were stocked in Ella every other odd year since 1983. Ella was stocked with 33,403 and 35,051 Walleye frylings (1-2 inch average length) in late/mid-June of 2008 and 2010 respectively. YOY Walleye catch rates were low to moderate in 2008 (25.26 YOY/hour, 7.01 inches length) and 2010 (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.55 inches) fall electrofishing surveys, but better than fall electrofishing surveys of fry stocking years prior to 2015. Walleye frylings were unavailable during 2012 and 2013. Low YOY Walleye numbers (6.00 YOY/hour, 7.68 inches average length) due to natural reproduction or movement from Elizabeth were sampled in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye fingerlings (239 pounds, 5,975 fish) were stocked into Ella during the 2013 fall in response to the low YOY Walleye numbers sampled in the fall electrofishing survey.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (152,385 fish) were stocked into Ella during 2015. Moderate numbers of YOY Walleye (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.12 inches) were captured in the 2015 fall night electrofishing survey. Nearby Lake Elizabeth had a slightly lower catch rate (30.00 YOY/hour, 5.52 inches), but no Walleye fry were stocked in Elizabeth during 2015. There were no yearlings captured in Ella during the 2015 fall electrofishing survey.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Ella fishery will be surveyed in the 2016 summer for all fish species. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry or fryling stocked years to assess the success or failure of these stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Lake Ella was conducted during late June of 2002. Ella is a small (136 acres), shallow (12 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Several springs are located along the north shore. Partial winterkills have occurred in Ella, but are generally rare. High nutrient runoff inflows are common into Ella during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. The outlet connects to Lake Elizabeth during moderate to high water levels. Water levels in the 2002 spring were below normal, but normal by late summer. High densities of submergent vegetation (curly-leaf pondweed) were present during the spring and summer of 2002. Water clarity was excellent during late June of 2002 in Ella. Residential development is limited to several farm sites. Yellow perch numbers were abundant in 2002 (22.3 fish/gillnet) and the highest historical recorded value for Ella. The 2002 yellow perch average size was small to moderate (0.17 lbs. and 6.7 inches) from gillnets. The largest yellow perch captured was 8.8 inches in the 2002 assessment. The catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches) and larger yellow perch was moderate (4.7 fish/gillnet) in the 2002 assessment. Northern pike numbers were moderate in 2002 (4.0 fish/gillnet). The northern pike historical average catch rate is 5.5 fish/gillnet for Ella. The 2002 northern pike average size was moderate (3.54 lbs. and 23.9 inches) from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (21.0 inches) and larger northern pike was moderate to high (3.0 fish/gillnet) in the 2002 assessment. The largest northern pike captured was 31.9 inches in the 2002 assessment. Northern pike growth rates in Ella were above the normal range for ages 1-5 compared to area lakes. Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2002 (10.8 fish/trapnet), but the second highest recorded value for Ella. The 2002 bluegill average weight and length were small (0.14 lbs. and 5.0 inches) from trapnets. The largest bluegill captured was 10.4 inches in the 2002 assessment. The catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches) and larger bluegill was low (3.3 fish/trapnet) in the 2002 assessment.Black crappie numbers were low to moderate in 2002 (4.3 fish/trapnet) and below the historical average catch rate (7.8 fish/trapnet) for Ella. The 2002 black crappie average size was small (0.12 lbs. and 5.6 inches) from trapnets. The largest black crappie captured was 9.7 inches in the 2002 assessment. Black crappie growth rates in Ella were above the normal range for ages 1-3 compared to area lakes. Approximately 89% of the black crappie captured in 2002 assessment were hatched in 2001.Walleye numbers were moderate in 2002 (8.0 fish/gillnet) and the second highest recorded value for Ella. The walleye historical average catch rate is 7.3 fish/gillnet. The 2002 walleye average size was moderate (2.18 lbs. and 16.1 inches) from gillnets. The largest walleye captured was 24.6 inches in the 2002 assessment. The catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches) and larger walleye was moderate (5.3 fish/gillnet) in 2002. Walleye growth rates in Ella were above the normal range for ages 2-6 compared to area lakes. Walleye natural reproduction in Ella is generally insignificant or rare based on previous fall and summer surveys. Ella was stocked with 73,200 walleye fry in the spring of 2001.Black bullhead numbers were moderate to abundant in 2002 (31.0 fish/trapnet) and similar to the historical average catch rate (36.8 fish/trapnet) for Ella. The 2002 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.22 lbs. and 6.8 inches) from trapnets. The largest black bullhead captured was 14.2 inches in the 2002 assessment. Carp numbers were moderate in 2002 (2.5 fish/trapnet) and similar to the historical average catch rate (2.1 fish/trapnet). The 2002 carp average size was large (7.38 lbs. and 23.2 inches) from trapnets. The largest carp captured was 31.1 inches in the 2002 assessment.Current fish management activities on Ella include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking walleye fry every other year. The Ella fishery will be surveyed in the 2006 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Lake Ella was conducted during mid-June of 2016. Ella is a small (153 acres), shallow (12 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Several springs are located along the north shore. Ella is not aerated. Partial winterkills have occurred in Ella, but are generally rare. Conditions were conducive for a potential winterkill with an uncharacteristically long and cold winter with high amounts of snowfall in 2014. Low numbers of dead fish (Common Carp, Walleye, Yellow Perch and Black Crappie) were observed after ice out, but gamefish species were abundant in spring ice out trapnets during 2014. Moderate nutrient runoff inflows are common into Ella during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. The outlet connects to Lake Elizabeth during moderate to high water levels. Fish movement between the two lakes is possible via the outlet channel during high flows. There were moderate levels of total phosphorus (0.030 ppm) and chlorophyll-a (8.9 ppb) in Ella during 2016. Dissolved oxygen readings were constant at each foot depth (about 7 ppm) during 2016 survey. The water clarity was fair (secchi disc=4.2 feet) during the 2016 survey. High densities of submergent vegetation (curly-leaf pondweed) were present during the spring and summer of 2002, however densities were low during 2006 and 2011. Densities of curly-leaf pondweed were also low in 2016 with the only high density area being in Southeast bay near public access. Low densities of other submergent vegetation species present included sago pondweed, water celery, bushy pondweed and coontail. Broad-leaved and narrow leaf cattails were common aquatic emergents around the south and east shoreline areas. Shoalwater substrates were mostly sand, marl, silt, and boulder. Residential development is limited to several farm sites. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance in 2016 (8.00 fish/gillnet) was within the normal ranges for Ella and similar lakes. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 11.17 fish/gillnet. The Yellow Perch average size was moderate (0.17 pounds and 7.1 inches) from the gillnet catch in 2016. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.17 pounds for Ella. The Yellow Perch catch rate of 8.0 inches and larger was low (1.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2016 survey. Majority (82%) of Yellow Perch sampled were of ages 2-3. Growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was low in 2016 (2.00 fish/gillnet) and below the normal range for Ella, but near the low end of the normal range for similar lakes. The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 5.24 fish/gillnet. The Northern Pike average size (4.16 pounds and 27.0 inches) was above the historical average (2.87 pounds and 23.78 inches) from the gillnet catch. The Northern Pike catch rate of 21.0 inches and larger was low (2.00 fish/gillnet) in 2016. Northern pike growth rates were above Spicer Area growth normal ranges for age 1 and within the normal ranges for ages 2-5. The 2013 year class comprised 50% of the 2016 Northern Pike survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was low in 2016 (2.17 fish/trapnet) and well below normal range for Ella, but near the low end of the normal range for similar lakes. The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 22.83 fish/trapnet. Moderate numbers of Bluegill (15.67 fish/trapnet, 4.9 inches average length) were captured in the previous 2011 resurvey. The 2016 Bluegill average size was small (0.12 pounds and 4.9 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.17 pounds from trapnets. There were only 2 year classes sampled with the majority (69%) being yearlings and others of age 4. Growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was high in 2016 (19.00 fish/gillnet, 37.83 fish/trapnet) and well above the normal ranges for Ella and similar lakes. The 2016 Black Crappie average size was small from both gillnet (0.17 pounds and 6.8 inches) and trapnet catches (0.19 pounds and 7.1 inches). The Black Crappie historical average weights are 0.14 and 0.21 pounds respectively from gillnets and trapnets. The Black Crappie catch rate of 8.0 inches and 10.0 inches and larger was moderate with 2.67 fish/trapnet and 1.33 fish/trapnet respectively in 2016. Several Black Crappie year classes were sampled in 2016 with majority (90%) being age 2. Growth rates above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappie were not sampled in 2016. The White Crappie historical average catch rate is 2.02 fish/trapnet. The White Crappie historical average weight is 0.68 pounds and length 10.8 inches from trapnets in Ella.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance was low (0.17 fish/trapnet) in 2016. Abundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" and yearling Largemouth Bass were captured by near shore electrofishing and seining gears during late July of 2011. A spring electrofishing survey was not conducted on Ella during 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was high in 2016 (12.00 fish/gillnet) for Ella, but within the normal range for similar lakes. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 7.33 fish/gillnet. The 2016 Walleye trapnet catch rate (0.50 fish/trapnet, 1.58 pounds average weight) was below the historical average (1.67 fish/trapnet). The 2016 Walleye average size was moderate to large (1.73 pounds and 17.1 inches) from gillnet catch. The Walleye historical average weight is 2.03 pounds from gillnets. The Walleye catch rate of 15.0 inches and larger Walleye was high (9.00 fish/gillnet) in 2016. Walleye growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2013 year class comprised the majority (73%) of the 2016 Walleye catch. The 2014 year class (27%) may be from natural reproduction or Walleye movement into Ella from Elizabeth since there was no stocking done in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Ella is generally insignificant or rare based on previous fall and summer surveys. Prior to 2008, Walleye fry had been stocked in Ella every odd year from 1983-2007. Walleye fry stockings were generally successful during the 1990's as documented by fall electrofishing and summer surveys, but generally unsuccessful from 2003 to 2007. Walleye frylings (approximately 1 inch average length, 1,500 fish/pound) became available from the New London Hatchery in 2008. Ella was stocked with 5,975 Walleye fingerlings (about 4 inch average size) in 2013. Walleye fry stocking occurred with 152,385 fish in 2015. YOY Walleye catch rates were fair in 2015 (42.0 YOY/hour, 6.1 inches length) for fall electrofishing surveys, but better than fall electrofishing surveys during previous fry stocking years. Nearby Lake Elizabeth, which is connected on high water, had a slightly lower catch rate (30.0 YOY/hour, 5.5 inches), but no Walleye fry were stocked in Elizabeth during 2015. There were no yearlings captured in Ella during 2015 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance was high in 2016 (68.00 fish/gillnet), but within the normal range for similar lakes. The Black Bullhead historical average catch rate is 31.45 fish/gillnet. Black Bullhead catch rate (29.17 fish/trapnet) was moderate in the 2016 trapnets. The 2016 Black Bullhead average size was large (0.61 pounds and 9.9 inches) from the gillnet catch. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.46 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance was low in 2016 (1.00 fish/trapnet) and below the normal ranges for Ella and similar lakes. The Common Carp historical average catch rate is 1.67 fish/trapnet. The 2016 Common Carp average size was large (6.71 pounds and 23.8 inches) from trapnets. The historical average weight is 5.81 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Ella include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking Walleye fry or frylings every other year. The Ella fishery will be surveyed in the 2021 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry or fryling stocked years to assess the success or failure of these stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Lake Ella was conducted during mid-June of 2021. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nElla is a small (153 acres), shallow (12 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Several springs are located along the north shore. Ella is not aerated. Partial winterkills have occurred in Ella, but are generally rare. A partial winterkill of mostly Common Carp occurred near the outlet area during February of 2019. Conditions were conducive for a winterkill with an uncharacteristically long and cold winter with high amounts of snowfall in 2014. A partial winterkill resulted in low numbers of dead fish (Common Carp, Walleye, Yellow Perch and Black Crappie) present after ice out, but gamefish species were abundant in spring ice out trapnets during 2014. Low numbers of Common Carp were observed dead following ice out in 2019. Nearby Lake Elizabeth experienced a partial winterkill of mostly Common Carp during 2019. Winter dissolved oxygen levels were adequate during the 2020-21 and 2021-22 winters in Ella. High nutrient runoff inflows are common into Ella during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. The outlet connects to Lake Elizabeth during moderate to high water levels. Fish movement between the two lakes is possible via the outlet channel during high flows. Water levels were low in 2020 and 2021. There were moderate levels of total phosphorus (0.030 ppm) and chlorophyll-a (8.9 ppb) in Ella during 2016. Dissolved oxygen readings were slightly variable from 8.25 ppm at the surface to 5.23 ppm at 7 feet deep during 2021 survey. The water clarity was poor (secchi disc=2.0 feet) and green-brown stained during the 2021 survey. Light stands of submergent vegetation were noted along the north shore littoral areas. No curly-leaf pondweed was observed in 2021. High densities of submergent vegetation (curly-leaf pondweed) were present during the spring and summer of 2002, however densities were low during 2006, 2011 and 2021. Densities of curly-leaf pondweed were also low in 2016 with the only high density area being in Southeast bay near public access. Low densities of other submergent vegetation species included sago pondweed, water moss, and coontail in 2016. Broad-leaved and narrow leaf cattails were a common emergent around the south and east shoreline areas. Shoalwater substrates were mostly marl, muck, silt, and clay. Residential development is limited to several farm sites and one cabin.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance in 2021 was low (0.67 fish/gillnet) for Ella. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 9.85 fish/gillnet. The Yellow Perch average size was moderate (0.21 pounds and 7.36 inches) from the 2021 gillnet catch. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.17 pounds for Ella. The Yellow Perch catch rate of quality size (8.00 plus inches) was low (0.33 fish/gillnet) in 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance in 2021 was low (1.00 fish/gillnet) for Ella. The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 4.71 fish/gillnet. The Northern Pike average size was small (1.50 pounds and 19.02 inches) from the 2021 gillnet catch. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.70 pounds from gillnets. The Northern Pike catch rate of quality size (21.00 plus inches) was low (0.33 fish/gillnet) in 2021. Northern Pike growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2019-year class comprised 50% of the 2021 Northern Pike survey catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Ella in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 2021 was moderate (22.33 fish/trapnet) for Ella. The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 22.77 fish/trapnet. The highest recorded Bluegill catch rate (96.00 fish/trapnet, 5.03 inches average length) occurred in 2006. The 2021 Bluegill average size was small (0.07 pounds and 4.67 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.15 pounds from trapnets. The Bluegill catch rate of quality size (6.00 plus inches) was 0.17 fish/trapnet in 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie gillnet abundance in 2021 was low (1.00 fish/gillnet) for Ella. Black Crappie trapnet abundance was moderate (9.00 fish/trapnet) for Ella. The Black Crappie historical average catch rates are 8.42 fish/gillnet and 13.15 fish/trapnet. The 2021 Black Crappie average size was small (0.21 pounds and 7.14 inches) from the gillnet catch. The 2021 Black Crappie average size was moderate (0.33 pounds and 7.64 inches) from trapnets. The Black Crappie historical average weights are 0.15 and 0.23 pounds respectively from gillnets and trapnets. The Black Crappie catch rate of preferred size (10.00 plus inches) was 2.33 fish/trapnet in 2021. The largest Black Crappie captured was 12.24 inches. Black Crappie growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2019 year class comprised 43% of the Black Crappie 2021 survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappie gillnet abundance in 2021 was high (4.33 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (0.17 fish/gillnet). White Crappie trapnet abundance (18.67 fish/trapnet) in 2021 was also above the historical average (4.10 fish/trapnet). White Crappie were not captured in 2016 nets. The 2021 White Crappie average size was large (0.64 pounds and 10.11 inches) from trapnets. The White Crappie historical average weight is 0.67 pounds from trapnets in Ella. White Crappie growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. There were four White Crappie moderate year classes (2020, 2019, 2016 and 2015) present in Ella. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance was low (1.50 fish/trapnet) in the 2021 trapnet catch. The historical average catch rate is 1.95 fish/trapnet. The Largemouth Bass average size was 1.89 pounds and 14.64 inches from trapnets. Largemouth Bass were not captured in the trapnets or gillnet during 2011. The largest Largemouth Bass was 17.20 inches in the 2021 survey nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2021 was high (10.33 fish/gillnet) for Ella. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 7.71 fish/gillnet. The 2021 Walleye average size was moderate (1.42 pounds and 15.60 inches) from the gillnet catch. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.95 pounds. The Walleye catch rate of quality size (15.00 plus inches) was moderate (4.00 fish/gillnet) in 2021. Walleye growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8.  The 2019-year class (50% of the survey catch) is probably from a 2019 fry stocking. Walleye movement from Elizabeth into Ella and nearby Carrie is also possible during high water. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Ella is generally insignificant or rare based on previous fall and summer surveys. Prior to 2008, Walleye fry were stocked in Ella every other odd year from 1983 to 2007. Walleye fry stockings were generally successful during the 1990's as documented by fall electrofishing and summer surveys, but generally poor from 2003 to 2007. Walleye frylings (approximately 1 inch average length, 1,500 fish/pound) became available from the New London Hatchery in 2008. Ella was stocked with Walleye frylings in 2008 (33,403 fish) and 2010 (35,051 fish). Young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye catch rates were low to moderate in 2008 (25.26 YOY/hour, 7.01 inches length) and 2010 (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.55 inches) fall electrofishing surveys, but better than fall electrofishing surveys during recent fry stocking years. YOY Walleye average size was excellent in 2008 and 2010 fall electrofishing surveys. Walleye frylings were unavailable during 2012 and 2013. Low YOY Walleye numbers (6.00 YOY/hour, 7.68 inches average length) due to natural reproduction or movement from Elizabeth were sampled in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. Thus, Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2013 (5,975 fish, 239 pounds) after the survey. Walleye fry were stocked into Ella due to no/minimal fryling availability during 2015 (152,385 fry), 2017 (103,822 fry), 2018 (115,064 fry), 2019 (101,232 fry) and 2021 (115,064 fry). Only Spicer strain Walleye fry have been stocked into Ella since 2017. Moderate numbers of YOY Walleye (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.12 inches) during a 2015 fry stocked year were captured in the 2015 fall night electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were low in 2017 (0.00 YOY/hour) and 2018 (18.00 YOY/hour, 6.17 inches). Abundant YOY numbers (102.00 YOY/hour, 5.57 inches) were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were first sampled (1.67 fish/gillnet) during 2021 for Ella. The Channel Catfish average size was moderate (4.26 pounds and 22.77 inches) from gillnets. The largest Channel Catfish was 23.74 inches. Channel Catfish were first captured in nearby and connected Lake Elizabeth in the 2011 survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance in 2021 was low (0.67 fish/gillnet) for Ella. The Black Bullhead historical average catch rate is 22.86 fish/gillnet. Black Bullhead catch rate (0.33 fish/trapnet) was also low in the 2021 trapnets. The 2021 Black Bullhead average size was large (1.12 pounds and 12.52 inches) from gillnet catch. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.56 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance in 2021 was low (1.00 fish/trapnet) for Ella. The Common Carp historical average catch rate is 1.78 fish/trapnet. The 2016 Common Carp average size was large (6.71 pounds and 23.76 inches) from trapnets. The historical average weight is 5.81 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth Buffalo gillnet abundance in 2021 (1.67 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average (1.50 fish/gillnet). The Bigmouth Buffalo trapnet abundance was 0.33 fish/trapnet for Ella. The 2021 Bigmouth Buffalo average weights were 3.17 pounds and 5.60 pounds for gillnets and trapnets respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Ella include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking Walleye fry or frylings every other year. The Ella fishery will be surveyed in the 2026 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry or fryling stocked years to assess the success or failure of these stockings. <br> \n</p>",

Ella is a small (153 acres), shallow (12 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Ella is generally insignificant or rare based on previous surveys. Walleye movement out of or into Ella via Lake Elizabeth can also occur during high water events. Walleye fry were generally stocked in Ella every other odd year from 1983-2007. Ella was stocked with 33,403 and 35,051 Walleye frylings (1-2 inch average length) in late/mid-June of 2008 and 2010 respectively. YOY Walleye catch rates were low to moderate in 2008 (25.26 YOY/hour, 7.01 inches length) and 2010 (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.55 inches) fall electrofishing surveys, but better than fall electrofishing surveys of 2003-2007 fry stocking years (3-20 YOY/hour). Walleye fry were stocked into Ella due to no/minimal fryling availability during 2015 (152,385 fry), 2017 (103,822 fry), 2018 (115,064 fry) and 2019 (101,232 fry). A partial winterkill of mostly Common Carp occurred near the outlet area during February of 2019. <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers (102.00 YOY/hour, 5.57 inches) were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. No Yearling Walleye were captured in 2019. We observed moderate numbers of Bluegill in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (18.00 YOY/hour, 6.17 inches) and no yearling Walleye were captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. No YOY or yearling Walleye were captured in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate numbers of YOY Walleye (42.00 YOY/hour, 6.12 inches) were captured in the 2015 fall night electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (6.00 YOY/hour, 7.68 inches average length) due to natural reproduction or movement from connected Lake Elizabeth were sampled in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye fingerlings (239 pounds, 5,975 fish) were stocked into Ella during the 2013 fall after the fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye numbers (12.00 fish/gillnet, 1.73 pounds and 17.1 inches) were abundant in the most recent 2016 standard summer gillnet and trapnet survey. Approximately 73% of the 2016 summer catch were from the 2013 year class. <br> \n <br> \nThe Ella fishery will be surveyed in the 2021 summer for all fish species. Walleye fry will be stocked in 2021. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry or fryling stocked years to assess the success or failure of these stockings. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
