Three age classes were sampled.  All but one fish was either age 1 or 2 and both of these age classes showed fast growth.  Bluegill numbers fell from 14.6/trapnet (average) in 1986 to 8.2/trapnet in 1991, a 46% change.  Size remained small (0.10 lb).  Median length 4.5 to 1986 as well.  The trapnet catch of largemouth bass (0.8/ trapnet) was average for the lake class. The gillnet catch (2.6/lift), however, was higher and produced bass to 15 inches in length.  Ages 2-4 were present in the aged sample and appeared to have good growth.  The walleye catch (3.0/gillnet) appeared unchanged since 1986 (4.0/gillnet). Median length rose to 20 from 14-22 since 1986.  Lost scale envelopes prevented comparison of age composition with stocking records.  Yellow perch (0.8/gillnet) decreased a statistically significant 91% since 1986 (7.0/ gillnet).  Little else can be said about the perch because of the small sample size.  Brown bullhead was sampled in gillnets.  Over 50% of the sample was at least 12\".</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Fox is a 239 acre lake located about two miles west of Fifty Lakes.  It adjoins 472 acre West Fox Lake.  A public access is found on the west end of the lake.  The maximum depth of East Fox is 65 feet and about 42% of the lake is less than fifteen feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is generally above average for the area.  Shallow water soils are predominatly a mix of sand, gravel and rock of various sizes.  Marl is also present and marshy area tend to have mucky bottom soils.  The aquatic plant community is somewhat diverse.  Emergent species were limited to those typically found in marshy areas.  The submergent species were more diverse and are important as food and cover to a wide variety of fish and other aquatic species.Northern pike, walleye and largemouth bass were the most abundant gamefish species found in the 1996 test netting.  Bluegills were the most abundant panfish sampled.Walleyes have been stocked on a regular schedule since the early 1970's.  Currently, fingerlings are stocked every other year in both East and West Fox lakes.  Walleyes were caught in \"average\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  The catch was also similar to catches from past nettings of East Fox.  Several year classes were sampled and growth was good.  Walleyes averaged 20 inches long and 3.0 lbs. in '96.Northern pike were also found in numbers which were \"average\" for similar type lakes and within the historical catch range for the lake.  Five year classes were sampled and growth was good.  Because the relatively young 1993 year class was most abundant in the sample, the average northern pike was 18 inches and 1.5 lbs. in '96, compared to 17 inches and 2.0 lbs. in '91.Largemouth bass were present in \"average\" numbers, as well. Bass are difficult to sample in stationary nets. As a result, sample size was small.  Only two year classes were sampled and growth appeared to be slow.  Smallmouth bass were sampled for the first time in nets other than shoreline seines.Black crappies were caught at a rate that bordered on \"low\" when compared to similar type lakes, but the catch was similar to previous catches for this lake.  Too few crappies were sampled to be able to evaluate age and growth.  Bluegills were caught in \"average\" numbers in '96.  Six year classes were sampled and growth was generally slow.  About 9% of bluegills from trapnets were 7.0 inches or more in length, similar to a rate of 7% in 1991.Yellow perch, tullibees and white suckers are important forage species for the lakes gamefish.  Yellow perch numbers were in the \"average\" category in '96 and the catch was similar to the 1991 catch.  Tullibees were caught for the first time in the past three nettings and were sampled in \"low\" numbers.  White suckers were not sampled in '96 and were traditionally caught in rather low numbers in past nettings.Other species which were caught in the  1996 netting included: bowfin (dogfish), three bullhead species, rock bass, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish.  Overall, the fish catch was fairly similar to that for adjoining West Fox Lake.</p>",

BOWFIN, BLACK BULLHEAD AND BLACK CRAPPIE NET CATCHES ARE BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE WHICH MAY INDICATE LOW POPULATION LEVELS AT LEAST FOR BLACK BULLHEAD AND BOWFIN. CONVERSELY, ROCK BASS, NORTHERN PIKE AND LARGEMOUTH BASS CATCH RATES ARE ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE AS WELL AS ABOVE THE LO- CAL AND  STATEWIDE MEDIAN FIGURES. THE CATCH RATES FOR ROCK BASS AND NORTHERN PIKE SUGGEST HIGH POPULATION LEVELS, HOWEVER, THE INDICATED HIGH LARGEMOUTH BASS POPULATION MAY BE NET BIASED AND REQUIRES ANALYSIS USING OTHER SAMPLING GEAR. FIVE GILLNETS WERE SET IN AUGUST OF 1982 AND AU- GUST 1986. BASED ON CATCHES FROM THESE NET SETS, THE YELLOW PERCH POPULATION HAS INCREASED AND BOTH THE NORTHERN PIKE AND WALLEYE POPULATIONS HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY UNCHANGED. WALLEYE, 4/SET AND 13 OF 21 AGED, SHOWED AGE AND GROWTH ANALYSIS OF FISH AT LAST ANNULUS FORMATION INDICATION GOOD GROWTH, HOWEVER, BACK CALCULATED SIZES AT RESPEC- TIVE AGES INDICATES SLOW GROWTH IN YEAR CLASSES I AND II WHILE THOSE OF YEAR CLASSES III-VI EXHIBITD GOOD GROWTH. IN 1982 THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.6 PDS WHILE IN 1986 IT WAS 1.7 PDS. ADDITIONALLY THE RANGE IN LENGTH IN 1982 WAS 7.5 TO 20.9 WHILE IN 1986 IT WAS 10.4 TO 23.9. THE YEAR CLASSES PRESENT REPRESENTS WELL, THE YEAR FINGERLING STOCKING OCCURRED. WALLEYE FINGERLINGS WERE NOT STOCKED IN 1980 AND THAT YEAR CLASS WAS NOT REPRESENTED IN THE NETTING.  THE YELLOW PERCH POPULATION HAS IN- CREASED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE 1982 IN SPITE OF THE ANNUAL WALLEYE FINGERLING STOCKING PROGRAM. THE INCREASE IS FROM 1.6/SET TO 7.0/SET. YEAR CLASS II-V WERE REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE IN A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION. ANNULUS IV FISH REPRESENTED THE STRONGEST YEAR CLASS. GENERALLY THE GROWTH OF ALL YEAR CLASSES IS GOOD, HOWEVER, AN ANALYSIS OF BACK CALCULATED SIZE AT ANNULUS II INDICATED SLOW GROWTH. DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, THE MEAN RATE REMAINED THE SAME, HOWEVER, THE LENGTH FREQUENCY SHIFTED FROM 6.0-9.9 INCHES TO 5.0-8.4 INCHES. THE NUMBER OF 8.0 INCH OR LARGER FISH DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE DURING THIS PERIOD AND STILL REMAINS LOW. THE NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION, 7.0/GILLNET AND 32 OF 35 FISH AGED, SAMPLED IN 1986 WAS REPRESENTED BY YEAR CLASSES I-VII WITH A MISSING YEAR CLASS OF ANNULUS V FISH. THE TWO STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES WERE I AND II WITH 11 AND 13 FISH RESPECTIVELY. GROWTH OF FISH IN YEAR CLASSES I AND II IS FAST. THE SAMPLE OF LARGER FISH WAS TOO SMALL TO MAKE A REASONABLE STATEMENT OF GROWTH RATE. THE NORTHRN PIKE POPULATION HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE 1982 AND GENERALLY, THE LENGTH FREQUENCY HAS NOT CHANGED REMARKABLY EITHER. THE MEAN WEIGHT DETERMINED IN 1982 WAS 2.05 WHILE IT WAS 1.97 IN THE 1986 NETTING. LARGEMOUTH BASS ARE REPRESENTED BY FOUR YEAR CLASSES OF WHICH ANNULUS IV WAS WEAK. YEAR CLASSES I-III WERE WELL-REPRESENTED AND DIS- PLAYED GOOD GROWTH. BLACK CRAPPIE ARE APPARENTLY LOW (0.40/TRAPNET VS. 2.90/TRAPNET), HOWEVER, MORE WERE SAMPLED IN GILLNETS (1.20/LIFT). GROWTH OF BLACK CRAPPIES IS GOOD FROM THE THREE YEAR CLASSES SAMPLED (III-V). BLUEGILLS RANGED IN SIZE FROM 3.0-8.4 INCHES. ONLY 8.3% OF THE FISH SAMPLED WERE 7.0 INCHES OR LARGER AND THE MEAN WT OF THE ENTIRE SAMPLE WAS 9.4/PD. GENERALLY GROWTH OF ALL SIZE CLASSES AT LAST ANNULUS WAS SLOW, HOWEVER, BACK CALCULATED SIZE ANALYSIS OF ANNULUS I FOR ALL FISH INDICATED GOOD GROWTH.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Fox Lake is a 239 acre lake located about two miles west of Fifty Lakes.  It adjoins 472 acre West Fox Lake.  A public access is located on the west end of the lake.  The maximum depth is 65' and about 42% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates are a mix of gravel, sand, and rock with mucky soil in marsh areas.  The aquatic plant community is somewhat diverse.  Emergent plants are important for shoreline stabilization, maintaining water quality, and improve spawning habitat for fish.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.Walleyes have been stocked as fingerlings on a regular basis since 1974 and are currently stocked every third year at a rate of 1lb per littoral acre (100lbs).  The 2001 walleye catch of 2.2/gill net is similar to previous catches and is considered average when compared to similar lakes.  Year classes when stocking was done accounted for 76.9% of the catch.  Average length and weight remained the same as 1996 at 19.8\" and 2.9lbs.Northern pike were caught in above average numbers in 2001 at 14.2/gill net.  The 1998 and 1999 year classes were most abundant and contributed 80% of the catch.  Compared to 1996, average length and weight increased slightly from 18.9\" and 1.5lbs to 19.4\" and 1.8lbs.The largemouth bass catch of 1.4/trap net was the highest since 1986 and was relatively high when compared to similar lakes.  Average weight was 0.6lbs and 27.8% of all largemouth bass measured were 12\" or larger.The bluegill catch of 20.0/trap net was average compared to similar lakes, and similar to typical catches on this lake.  Growth was relatively slow and 12.3% of trap netted bluegills measured 7\" or larger, compared to 9% in 1996 and 7% in 1991.  Black crappie abundance was average in 2001 at 1.1/trap net.  Average weight was 0.5lbs and 63.6% of the fish sampled were 8\" or larger compared to 50% in 1996.Yellow perch, white suckers, and tullibee are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  All have been sampled in low numbers in the past, but none were caught in 2001.</p>",

All of the walleyes captured were 12\" or larger, with an average length of 20.5\"; the largest being 29.4\".  They were all aged back to stocking years. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were high again at 10.8/gill net.  Average length was 19.9\" and fish above the 22\"-26\" protected slot made up 8% of the catch.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nBass electrofishing is the primary means DNR Fisheries uses to assess bass abundance and size distribution.  Due to time and weather constraints, bass electrofishing was not conducted this survey, but the gill net catch was highest to date at 5.8/net.  They may not provide much as a destination for anglers, however, as average length was 11.3\" and only one fish over 15\" was captured. <br> \n <br> \nThe panfish catch was average, with a black crappie trap and gill net catches of 0.7/net each and a bluegill catch of 10.9/trap net.  It appears there may be some decent fish to be caught though, as 70% of the black crappies were 8\" or larger, with fish up to 12.8\" caught.  Bluegill average size was 6.2\" and 36% were 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Trap netting is done every third spring in order to monitor the panfish population and compare it to that of Rogers Lake.  The primary interest in this sampling is length frequency and though catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) is reported, comparisons across years should be made cautiously due to the variability inherent in spring sampling.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 bluegill catch of 9.5/trap net was up slightly from the previous netting in 2013 (8.3/trap net).  Average length was 7.1, with 54% measuring 7\" or larger.  This was up from 2013 when mean length was 6.5\" and 27% measured 7\" or larger.  Fish ranged in size from 3.9\" to 9.1\". <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch of 2.0/trap net was down from the 2013 netting (7.5/net).  Average length was 9.2\" (up from 8.6 in 2013), with 65% of the fish measuring 9\" or larger.  Fish ranged in length from 4.4\" to 11.7\". <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Fox Lake is a 241 acre lake, with a maximum depth of 65', located 33 miles north of Brainerd in Crow Wing County.  East Fox is located in the Pine River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on July 26 & 29, 2019, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 2 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 4 stations.  Heavy vegetation and/or soft bottom prevented the use of seines at the other 4 sampling sites.  Thirteen species were sampled, including 4 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: banded killifish, blacknose shiner, Iowa darter, and rock bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on June 29-31, 2019 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Fox Lake is a 240 acre lake located in northern Crow Wing County with a maximum depth of 65 feet.  It's primarily managed for northern pike.  Northern pike were sampled in 2013 at a rate of 10.5/ gill net.  This above average when comparing lakes similar to East Fox, but down from the high of 14.2/ gill net in 2001.  Their average size was 20.7\" with fish up to 34.8\" sampled.  Nearly 24% of the northern pike were 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are another available species for anglers of East Fox Lake as they are stocked every third year.  The 2013 walleye catch was only 0.8/ gill net but most of these fish are decent sized.  The average size was 23.1\" and all of the walleyes sampled were 20\" or greater in length.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled at a rate of 1.7/ gill net, which is above average for lakes similar to East Fox.  The average size of these fish was nearly 14\" with fish as large as 16.6\" measured. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in above average numbers at 1.3/ gill net.  They averaged 9.5\" and had fish as large as 11.8\" sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate was slightly below average for lakes similar to East Fox at 11.3/trap net.  The average size was 5.7\" and the largest of these bluegills was 8.1\".  Only 15% were 7\" or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nSome other fish species sampled during the survery include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, tullibee, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 16 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 32.1 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 8.7?C (47.7?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for these species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for these species was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. Data collected in 1996, 2001, 2002, and 2013 also indicated suitable oxythermal habitat. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress.</p>",
