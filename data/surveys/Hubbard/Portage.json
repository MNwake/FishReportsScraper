The walleye were of a large average size.  There was a good range of sizes of the other species of fish present.Although Portage Lake is ecologically more suitable for centrarchids, it appears this lake can also support a walleye fishery through periodic fingerling stocking.  The age-class structure of walleyes taken in the test nets indicates that both natural reproduction and walleye fry stocking have failed to produce good year-classes in the past four years.  Walleye fingerling stocking may produce better results.Good bass and bluegill reproduction in 1957 and a strong 1956 year-class of crappies should provide good fishing for these species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Portage Lake is located three miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Portage Lake is a shallow, 412 acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet.  A county-owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake.  Heavy algae blooms can occur on Portage Lake during the summer months.  Due to the shallow depth, Portage Lake is subject to periodic \"winter kill\" events.  Winter kill usually happens during winters when heavy snowfall accumulated on the ice and blocks sunlight from penetrating to the water, which in turn limits oxygen production through photosynthesis.  At the same time, decaying aquatic vegetation on the lake bottom uses oxygen, causing oxygen levels in the lake to drop.  Shallow lakes with heavy aquatic vegetation growth are more likely to winter kill than are deep water lakes.  Gamefish such as largemouth bass and bluegill are less tolerant of low oxygen levels than are northern pike and bullheads.  Portage Lake has suffered only partial winter kills (last winter kill during the winter of 1995-96), but a gamefish population has always remained.  Portage Lake provides fishing opportunities for walleye, northern pike, and panfish, and is also a popular destination for ice fishing. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Portage Lake is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include, First and Fourth Crow Wing Lakes, Paine Lake, and Peysenski. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish abundance was up, with good numbers of black crappie in the 9 inch size range and bluegill in the 6-7 inch size range sampled.  Walleye abundance (2.8 walleye/gillnet) was similar to the 2002 survey (4.2 walleye/gillnet) but down from surveys conducted in the 1980's and 1990's.  The current WAE management goal on Portage Lake is 5 walleye/gillnet.  Present and past surveys have shown that walleye stocking is maintaining the population in Portage, with little or sporadic recruitment from natural reproduction.  Portage Lake is currently stocked annually with walleye fry in the spring.  Walleye fingerling stocking will occur if fall electrofishing sampling shows poor survival of stocked fry for two consecutive years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were found in very low numbers.  Yellow perch numbers were very high in the 1980's, but since the early 1990's have been at very low numbers.  Due to the low perch numbers, walleye are utilizing other forage species such as the abundant bullhead population found in Portage.  Northern pike abundance was down, with the 2007 gillnet catch rate of 0.2 pike/gillnet the lowest recorded for all surveys conducted on Portage.  Past surveys have shown northern pike to be very abundant in Portage and dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" fish.  Portage Lake has an abundant bullhead population, composed of brown and black bullhead.  Yellow bullhead are also present in low numbers.  Largemouth bass are present in low to moderate numbers when compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and other recreational boaters should be aware that curly leaf pondweed, an invasive aquatic plant, is present in Portage Lake.  Boaters should take extra care and precaution to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats and trailers when leaving the lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Portage Lake is located three miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Portage Lake is a shallow, 412 acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet.  A county-owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake.  Due to the shallow depth and heavy aquatic vegetation growth, Portage Lake is subject to periodic \"winterkill events\".  Portage Lake has suffered only partial winterkills (last winterkill during the winter of 1995-96), and a gamefish population has always remained.  Portage Lake provides fishing opportunities for panfish, northern pike, and walleye.  Portage is a popular destination for ice angling. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Portage is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include First and Fourth Crow Wing Lakes, Paine, and Peysenski. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular option for anglers year around on Portage.  Black crappie in the 9 inch size range and bluegill in the 6-7 inch size range were sampled in good numbers.  Northern pike abundance (6.5 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have shown the northern pike population to fluctuate from low to high numbers.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.4 inches and 2.5 pounds, with pike measured up to 34.6 inches.  Walleye abundance (4.8 walleye/gillnet) was up from the previous survey and near the current management goal of (5.0 walleye/gillnet).  A strong year class of 10-12 inch walleye were sampled and should provide good fishing in future years.  Present and past surveys have shown that walleye stocking is maintaining the population in Portage, with little or sporadic recruitment from natural reproduction.  Portage Lake is currently stocked annually with walleye fry in the spring.  Walleye fingerling stocking will occur if fall electrofishing sampling shows poor survival of stocked fry for two consecutive years.  Fall electrofishing surveys have shown poor survival of stocked walleye fry.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in low numbers (2.0 perch/gillnet).  Yellow perch numbers were very high in the 1980's, but since the early 1990's have been at very low numbers.  Due to the low perch numbers, walleye are utilizing other forage species such as the bullhead population found in Portage.  Portage Lake has an abundant bullhead population, composed of brown and black bullhead.  Yellow bullhead are also present in low numbers.  Largemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers during spring electrofishing survey (34 bass/hour).  Good numbers of bass over 15.0 inches were sampled when compared to class 39 and other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and other recreational boaters should be aware that curly leaf pondweed, an invasive aquatic plant, is present in Portage Lake.  Boaters should take extra care and precaution to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats and trailers when leaving the lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Portage Lake is located three miles northwest of Park Rapids in west-central Hubbard County. Portage has a surface area of 429 acres and a maximum depth of 17 feet. A county owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake. Portage is a very popular lake for ice fishing, as it is one of the first lakes to freeze in the area. Due to the shallow depth and heavy aquatic vegetation growth, Portage Lake is subject to periodic winterkills. Portage provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Panfish, Largemouth Bass and Walleye. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Portage is in lake class 39, one of fifteen class 39 lakes in the Park Rapids management area. Class 39 lakes are generally shallow, with high littoral area and are regularly shaped. Other class 39 lakes in the work area include: First Crow Wing, Fourth Crow Wing, Ham, Hennepin, Loon, Minnie, Paine, Peysenski, Rice, Shallow, Upper Twin, Wolf, and Hungryman. <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was down from recent surveys but is still considered high. Anglers will find the Northern Pike population spread out with most from 13 to 27 inches in length. Northern Pike sampled had an average length of 18.8 inches and weighed 1.5 pounds. <br> \nPortage supports a fast-growing Black Crappie population and angling for them is popular year-round. Anglers will find most Black Crappie in the 8.5 - 10.5 inch size range, with fish up to 12.3 inches. Portage also provides good fishing for Bluegill and Pumpkinseed; with some nicer fish up to 8.5 inches sampled. <br> \nWalleye were sampled in low numbers, and below previous recent surveys. Walleye sampled had an average length of 15.9 inches with fish measuring up to 20.6 inches. Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye were sampled in increasing numbers, but most were too small for anglers. <br> \nCurly-leaf Pondweed is an aquatic invasive species (AIS) that has been identified in Portage. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

Yellow perch and black crappie were both extremely high.  Yellow perch and black crappie were both extremely high.  Yellow perch were all between 5 and 6 inches.  Rough fish no problem at this time.Management Recommendations:With the lack of spawning area for walleye, a fishery may be maintained with periodic stocking of fingerlings.  They should be stocked at the rate of 0.5 pound per littoral acre.  The fingerlings should average 50 fish per pound or larger.  No other management required at this time.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Portage Lake is located three miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Portage Lake is a shallow, 412 acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet.  A county-owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake.  Heavy algae blooms can occur on Portage Lake during the summer months.  Due to the shallow depth, Portage Lake is subject to periodic \"winter kill\" events.  Winter kill usually happens during winters when heavy snowfall accumulates on the ice and blocks sunlight from penetrating to the water, which in turn limits oxygen production through photosynthesis.  At the same time, decaying aquatic vegetation on the lake bottom uses oxygen, causing oxygen levels in the lake to drop.  Shallow lakes with heavy aquatic vegetation growth are more likely to winter kill than are deep water lakes.  Gamefish such as largemouth bass and bluegill are less tolerant of low oxygen levels than are northern pike and bullheads.  Portage Lake has suffered only partial winter kills (last winter kill during the winter of 1995-96), but a gamefish population has always remained.  Walleye, northern pike, and panfish are the most common species anglers target when fishing Portage Lake.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Portage Lake is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include First and Fourth Crow Wing Lakes, Paine Lake, and Peysenski.The 2002 survey showed walleye abundance (4.2 walleye/gillnet) was down from the previous survey in 1997, but still within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  The current management goal for Portage Lake is  5.0 walleye/gillnet.  Past surveys have shown that since 1986 walleye numbers have been above the range \"typical\" for this lake class, while surveys prior to 1986 showed low to moderate walleye numbers.  Anglers can expect to find good numbers of walleye in the 14-16 inch range.  While a limited amount of natural reproduction is occuring in Portage, the walleye population is being maintained by a successful stocking program by the DNR.  Portage Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were found in very low numbers.  Yellow perch numbers were very high in the 1980's, but since the early 1990's have been at very low numbers.  The 2002 survey showed walleye growth rates to be slow and variable when compared to other area lakes.  Due to the low perch numbers, walleye are utilizing other forage species such as the abundant bullhead population found in Portage.Northern pike abundance (9.8 pike/gillnet) was similar to past surveys and within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find that small \"hammer handle\" northern pike are common in Portage.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19.1 inches and 1.3 pounds.  The northern pike population in Portage is limited by high recruitment of young pike and very slow growth rates.Past surveys have shown that the panfish populations in Portage have gone through \"boom and bust\" periods, fluctuating with the periodic and partial winter kills.  The 2002 survey showed bluegill numbers (14.2 bluegill/trapnet) were up in Portage.  Bluegill abundance in past surveys has generally been below or at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this class.  Good numbers  of bluegill in the 6-7 inch size range were sampled.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to recent surveys.  Anglers can expect to find crappie in the 9-10 inch size range.Black and brown bullhead were sampled in very high numbers, well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and well above past surveys.  Yellow bullhead are also present in low numbers.  Other species sampled include moderate numbers of white sucker and low numbers of largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, and rock bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Portage Lake is located just north of Park Rapids.  Portage has a surface area of 412 acres and a maximum depth of 17 feet.  There is a city owned access on the south shore of the lake.  Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Portage Lake is in lake class 39.  Class 39 lakes are generally shallow with a very high proportion of littoral area (depths less than 15 feet), and a regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 39 lakes in the Park Rapids area include First Crow Wing, Fourth Crow Wing, Hennepin, Peysenski, Upper Twin, and Wolf.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 survey consisted of targeted sampling for certain fish species at certain times of the year (i.e., spring trap netting for Northern Pike, spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass and summer trap netting for Bluegill).  Portage Lake had a partial winterkill in 2013 that was evident by the size distribution and their abundance of certain fish species.     <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant but the size structure consisted of smaller fish.  This has been evident for the past several years.  Largemouth Bass were sampled by spring electrofishing in low numbers.  Bass had a good average size of 11 inches but few fish over 15 inches were sampled.  Bluegills were sampled in lower numbers than recent years but on the high end compared to similar lakes.  Fish of all sizes were sampled from 2.4 to 7.7 inches, with a small average size of 3.4 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nCurly-leaf Pondweed an aquatic invasive species has been identified in Portage Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Portage Lake is located 2.5 miles northwest of Park Rapids in southwestern Hubbard County.  Portage Lake is a shallow, 412 acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet.  A county-owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake.  Heavy algae blooms can occur on Portage Lake during summer months.  Due to the shallow depth, Portage Lake is subject to periodic \"winter kill\" events.  Winter kill usually happens during winters when heavy snowfall accumulates on the ice and blocks sunlight from penetrating to the water, which in turn limits oxygen production through photosynthesis.  At the same time, decaying aquatic vegetation on the lake bottom uses oxygen, causing oxygen levels in the lake to drop.  Shallow lakes with heavy aquatic vegetation growth are more likely to winter kill than are deep water lakes.  Gamefish such as largemouth bass and bluegill are less tolerant of low oxygen levels than are northern pike and black bullheads.  Portage Lake has suffered only partial winter kills (last winter kill during the winter of 1995-96), but a gamefish population has always remained.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Portage Lake is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: First and Fourth Crow Wing Lakes (southeastern Hubbard County), Paine (southwest of Lake George), and Peysenki (five miles east of Park Rapids).Walleye were sampled at 8.7/gillnet, above the range typical for lake class 39 and similar to the 1987 and 1992 assessments.  Walleye gillnet catch rates prior to 1987 survey were lower, ranging from 1.3/net (1977) to 3.1/net (1959).  Walleye were quality sized, with an average length and weight of 18.0 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 7.3 to 25.6 inches.  A strong 1994 year class accounted for 40% of the sample (21 fish) and corresponds to a year of walleye fingerling stocking.  Natural reproduction is also contributing to the population with 27% of the walleye sample (14 fish) coming from non-stocked years.  Portage Lake receives walleye fingerling stockings on even calendar years.  When compared to other area lakes, walleye exhibited fast growth to age four then began to slow to near normal growth for age five and older fish.Northern pike were sampled at 6.8/gillnet, within the range typical for lake class 39.  Excluding 1987 (19.5/net), historical northern pike gillnet catch rates have been stable, ranging from 3.6/net (1959) to 9.5/net (1972).  However, average weight of northern pike has declined from earlier surveys.  Average size of northern pike was small in the 1997 survey (19.1 inches and 1.4 lbs), with the largest fish measuring 23.5 inches.  Due to the declining size and the high population of small northern pike, a special regulation was implemented in 1988 which allowed a northern pike daily limit of six fish with only one over 24 inches.  This regulation was dropped after the 1995 season after no change in the northern pike size structure was noticed.  Abundant northern pike reproduction coupled with slow growth rates and harvest of larger fish has contributed to the poor size structure found in Portage Lake.Only two yellow perch were sampled (0.2/gillnet, 0.1/trapnet), below the catch rates typical for lake class 39 and the lowest recorded catch rate on Portage Lake.  Historical yellow perch catches have fluctuated, however, ranging from 2.2/gillnet (1992) to 118.0/gillnet (1981).  Due to the low yellow perch population, the walleye and northern pike populations must be utilizing another forage base.  Bullheads were observed in the stomachs of walleye during field work.Bluegill were sampled in low numbers (1.3/trapnet), below the range typical for lake class 39.  Bluegill abundance in Portage Lake has fluctuated with winterkill events.  Excluding 1959 (13.7/net), historical bluegill trapnet catch rates have been low and ranged from 0.0/net (1972, 77) to 5.3/net (1992).  Bluegill were large with fish sampled up to 9.2 inches.  Bluegill exhibited fast growth rates compared to other class 39 lakes.Like bluegill, black crappie abundance has fluctuated with winter kill events.  Eight black crappie were sampled in the gillnets (1.3/net), similar to the 1992 survey.  Historical black crappie catches have fluctuated for both gears types.  Black crappie gillnet catch rates have fluctuated from 1.8/net (1987) to 41.7/net (1981), while trapnet catch rates have ranged from 1.4/net (1972) to 16.6/net (1987).  Sampled black crappie ranged in length from 5.6 to 6.1 inches.Three species of bullhead are found in Portage Lake; black, brown, and yellow bullhead.  Black and brown bullhead were sampled in high numbers, while yellow bullhead were sampled in low numbers. Black and brown bullhead catches have been at moderate to high levels since the 1986 survey, but were at low levels prior to 1986.  Historical yellow bullhead levels have remained at low to moderate levels with only slight fluctuations in catches.One pumpkinseed was sampled (0.2/gillnet), identical to the 1992 survey.  Historical catch rates have fluctuated from 1.7/net (1977) to 22.0/net (1986).  White sucker were sampled in moderate numbers, similar to past surveys.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Portage Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catch rates (5.17 fish/set and 9.68 lbs/set) remained within the normal ranges for Lake Class 40, despite abundance being at its lowest since 1981.  Along with the decrease in abundance was an increase in mean individual weight to 1.87 pounds.  The size structure (PSD=84, RSD-P=6) indicates a large proportion of quality-length walleye, but few over 20.0 inches and none over 25.0 inches.  The two walleye over 20.0 inches in the sample were also the only fish over age 6.  This is an indication of the young age distribution of the walleye population.  Walleye growth rates are slightly slow and length-at-age is greatly affected by the size of stocked fingerlings.  Mean length at age 2 is 9.88 inches, with a range of 7.29 to 13.51 inches for different year classes.  There is no evidence of walleye natural reproduction in Portage Lake.  All walleye sampled were from stocked year classes.The number of northern pike sampled (9.33 fish/gillnet) remained slightly above the third quartile, despite a large decrease since 1987.  Pounds per gillnet (13.65) fell to within the normal range for the first time since 1959.  These changes in net catches represent the declining size of northern pike since 1981, when mean individual weight was 4.42 pounds.  In 1992, mean weight was a low 1.46 pounds.  The size structure (PSD=13, RSD-P=2) is also indicative of the small northern pike population.  The size structure is reflective of the young age distribution.  Ninety-two percent of the aged northern pike were age 2 or 3.  Northern pike growth is very high the first 2 years before declining rapidly after age 2.  Mean length at age 4 is 24.22 inches.  The high density of small northern pike prompted the special regulation of allowing six northern pike per bag limit.Largemouth bass, black crappie and bluegill trapnet catches were within the normal ranges for lakes in Class 40.  Little fluctuation has occurred in largemouth bass abundance since 1959.  In contrast, black crappie catch rates were above the third quartile until 1986, when a large decrease occurred due to winterkill.  Black crappie size structure is large (PSD=100, RSD-P=80); however, no fish >9.5 inches are present.  Blackcrappie exhibit good growth, averaging 6.58 inches at age 3.  The size structure of bluegill (PSD=88, RSD-P=8) is smaller but slightly more balanced than that of black crappie.  Bluegill have also been adversely affected by winterkills.  Similar to black crappie and bluegill, pumpkinseed abundance has been decreasing since 1986 and was below the first quartile in 1992.  Yellow perch gillnet catches have dropped from 118.0 fish/set in 1981 to 2.17  fish/set (below the first quartile) in 1992.White sucker catch rates dropped below the first quartile for the first time in 1992.  Trapnet catches of yellow bullhead were also below the first quartile for Lake Class 40, while those of black bullhead were within the normal range and brown bullhead were above the third quartile.  Black and brown bullhead were the only fish species experiencing population increases in 1992.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Portage Lake is located three miles northwest of Park Rapids in west central Hubbard County. Portage Lake is a shallow, 429 acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet.  A county-owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake off of 210th street. Due to the shallow depth and heavy aquatic vegetation growth, Portage Lake is subject to periodic \"winterkill events\". Portage Lake experienced a partial winterkill during the winter of 2013-2014, but a smaller game fish population remained. Portage Lake provides angling opportunities for panfish, Northern Pike, Walleye and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Portage is in lake class 39. Class 39 lakes are regularly shaped lakes that are made up of mostly shallow water.  Other area lakes in this same classification include First and Fourth Crow Wing Lakes, Paine, and Peysenski. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of Northern Pike in Portage, with the highest numbers ever sampled. Northern Pike had a relatively small average length of 18.9 inches and weight of 1.3 pounds.  Very few larger Northern Pike were sampled, but the largest was 31.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nPortage has been a popular lake recently for ice fishing panfish.  Angling opportunities for panfish include Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed. After the recent winterkill in 2013-2014 the numbers are down, but there are still some nice fish available.  Most Black Crappies were sampled from 9-12 inches in length, while most Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds were from 5-8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was the lowest sampled since 1981, despite regular stockings.  All fish sampled were suitable for anglers, ranging from 13-21 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCurly leaf pondweed is an aquatic invasive species (AIS) that has been identified in Portage Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Portage Lake is located three miles northwest of Park Rapids in west central Hubbard County. Portage Lake is a 429 acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet. A county-owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake off of 210th street. Due to the shallow depth and heavy aquatic vegetation growth, Portage Lake is subject to periodic \"winterkill events\". Portage Lake last experienced a partial winterkill during the winter of 2013-2014. Portage Lake provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, panfish, Walleye and Largemouth Bass.  <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Portage is in lake class 39. Class 39 lakes are regularly shaped lakes that are made up of mostly shallow water. Other area lakes in this same classification include First and Fourth Crow Wing Lakes, Paine, and Peysenske.  <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of Northern Pike in Portage, with most fish 16-24 inches and the largest 32 inches.  Northern Pike were an average length of 20.5 inches and weight of 1.9 pounds. <br> \nPortage has been a popular lake recently for ice fishing panfish. Angling opportunities for panfish include Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed.  Since the partial winterkill in 2013-2014 the abundance increased, but the average size is still low.  There are still some nice fish available with Black Crappies up to 12.5 inches, Bluegills up to 9 inches, while Pumpkinseeds were smaller, up to 7.5 inches.  <br> \nWalleye abundance was good and dominated by larger fish, 18 to 23 inches.  The average size of 19.5 inches and 3 pounds was the highest seen in past samples. <br> \nLargemouth Bass were hit pretty hard in the winterkill of 2013-2014, and limited adults survived.  The 2014 sample had good numbers of bass, but with a very small average size of 7 inches.  Catch rates increased in 2017, and the average size was 10.5 inches. <br> \nCurly-leaf Pondweed is an aquatic invasive species (AIS) that has been identified in Portage Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Portage Lake is located just north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Portage has a surface area of 412 acres and a maximum depth of 17 feet.  There is a county owned access on the south shore of the lake.  Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Portage Lake is in lake class 39.  Class 39 lakes are generally shallow with a very high proportion of littoral area (depths less than 15 feet), and a regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 39 lakes in the Park Rapids area include First Crow Wing, Fourth Crow Wing, Hennepin, Peysenski, Upper Twin, and Wolf. <br> \n   <br> \nPortage Lake is part of a long term monitoring project, Sustaining Lakes In a Changing Environment (SLICE).  The 2016 survey consisted of targeted sampling for certain fish species at certain times of the year.      <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant but the size structure consisted of smaller fish.  This has been evident for the past several years.  Largemouth Bass were sampled by spring electrofishing in moderate numbers.  Bass had a poor average size of 7 inches and no fish over 14 inches were sampled.  Bluegills were sampled in higher numbers than recent years, and above the third quartile when compared to similar lakes.  Fish of all sizes were sampled from 3.15 to 8.5 inches, with a small average size of 4.3 inches. Portage Lake experienced a partial winterkill in 2013 that was evident by the smaller size distribution and over-abundance of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike.  <br> \n    <br> \nCurly-leaf Pondweed, an Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS), has been identified in Portage Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",
