                "narrative": "<p>Thunder Lake has had a history of producing good walleye fishing early in theseason, both spring and winter.  The lake has been fry stocked annually since the1984.  Few younger walleye showed up in this survey despite the stocking program. The northern pike population has dramatically increased and may be limiting successof the walleye fry stocking.  Average length of the pike was 20 inches.  Keepingthe smaller pike and releasing the larger ones may help the fish communitystructure.  There is currently a high perch population which are an important preyspecies for the northern pike and walleye.  The panfish species present in the lakeare black crappies, bluegills, and pumpkinseed.  Black crappies have provided awinter fishery in the past.  Little information is available on the species as theyare difficult to sample with standard survey equipment.  Bluegill have been stockedin the past to supplement the low population ,but are now maintaining a naturallyviable population.  Bluegill reproduction may be limited by the high bullheadpopulation.  The bullheads average about 9 - 10 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Fall night electrofishing was conducted in mid-September to evaluate the success of spring fry stocking.  Fry are stocked in Thunder Lake during even-numbered years and have sustained a walleye fishery that meets management goals for the lake.   Most of the lake shore was electrofished except for the north bay and some of the west side of the lake due to shallow water depth and mud bottom.    <br> \n     Forty young of the year walleye were netted in just over one hour of on-time producing a catch rate of 38.1/hour.   Water clarity was poor which made fish identification a challenge.  An additional five adult walleye were also netted in the 2012 electrofishing.   Those walleye ranged from 19.9 to 24.4 inches in length.  A similar electrofishing effort was done in early October of 2004.  The catch rate was higher in that electrofishing effort at 64.7/hour with 64 young of year walleye being captured.    Eleven adult walleye measuring from 12.5 to 28.4 inches were also captured in the 2004 electrofishing.    Most of the adult fish were from 12 to 15 inches in length and may have been from the 2002 or 2001 year classes.  Fry were stocked in 2002 and fingerlings in 2001.  Stocking began in 1972 with three years of fry stocking until 1974.  Fry stocking was reinitiated again in 1984 and continued annually until 1996 after which it was switched to even-numbered years.   Some fingerling walleye were stocked in 2001 which was the only fingerling stocking done in Thunder Lake.   <br> \n     A population assessment was conducted in 2007 which netted 24 walleye.  The catch rate of 5.5/gill net was within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  With the walleye stockings in Thunder Lake, catch rates have been within the lake class interquartile range of 1.5 - 5.8/gill net.   The lowest walleye gill net catch was 3.2/set in 2001 and the highest 6.7/set in 1989.  All but the 2001 gill net catch met the management goal of five walleye per gill net.   Walleye caught in the 2007 survey were from 2004, 2002, and 1998 year classes, all of which corresponded to fry stocked years.   <br> \n     Other fish species observed during the 2012 electrofishing run were black crappie, golden shiner, common shiner, yellow perch, common carp, white sucker, bluegill, bowfin, black bullhead, northern pike, and largemouth bass.    The largest bass was netted and measured 20.3 inches in length.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thunder Lake is a 215-acre lake located about eight miles northeast of Browerville.  The fishery can generally be described as supporting average to above average numbers of Northern Pike, a low-density Walleye population and average abundance of Bluegill and Black Crappie. Black Bullheads are the most common species present. Thunder Lake experienced winterkills prior to the 1990s but it is not presently considered a problem. <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye captured in survey nets ranged from 14 to 26 inches. Fry have been stocked annually since 2016 and biennially before that. Anecdotal reports are that decent fishing can be had at various times throughout the year.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are fairly abundant with individual sizes ranging from 16-36 inches in the 2019 survey. Average size is about 21 inches which is typical for lakes in central Minnesota. There are some big pike in Thunder Lake but it's a fragile fishery so any harvest of pike over 30 inches could have significant negative consequences. As the statewide regulation for Minnesota's northcentral zone outlines, anglers are encouraged to keep ten pike less than 22 inches. Doing so would be a big favor for Thunder Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, the favored prey fish for pike and Walleye, are present in healthy numbers. Very few are over ten inches so whilst there isn't much of a fishery, they do provide important forage for the lake's predatory species. <br> \n  <br> \nDaytime electrofishing for Largemouth Bass was completed in 2013, capturing a total a 20 fish ranging in size from 8-18 inches. The lake provides good habitat for bass and forage appears plentiful. Bluegill and Black Crappie abundance is average. Mean lengths are about 7 and 8 inches, respectively.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thunder Lake is a relatively shallow lake east of Browerville.  The lake has moderate development with most of the development occurring on the east and south sides of the lake.  The west and portions of the north shore have marsh with muck shorelines.  Filamentous algae was common around the lake       The lake supports a fish community that is typical of lakes which periodically winterkill with northern pike, bullheads, and perch as the predominant species.  Several changes have occurred in the fish community since the last survey in 1995.  The most notable and desirable was the decrease in northern pike numbers.  Even with the decline in abundance, size of the fish remained small, with no pike over 24 inches being measured in the survey.  Walleye fry stocking appears to sustain the walleye fishery in the lake although there was evidence of some natural reproduction.  The majority of the fish in the survey were over 20 inches in length and periodically anglers report good walleye fishing, usually early in the season.  The yellow perch population appears to have declined significantly since 1995, likely the result of the high northern pike population evident in 1995.  Perch can be an important food species for the northern pike and walleye and can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  Bluegills and black crappies were also present with quality individuals seen in both populations.      Thunder Lake supports all three species of bullheads, black, brown, and yellow, with the black bullheads being the most abundant.  Both the black and brown bullhead populations showed a significant increase in numbers from 1995.  Net catches suggest both species are over abundant and the populations dominated by fish between 6 and 8 inches.  Other species in the fish community include white suckers, pumpkinseeds, bowfin, and rock bass.  Carp are also known to be in the lake although none were captured in the survey.    Despite having only light development around the lake and a watershed dominanted by forest and marsh, algae blooms are common in Thunder Lake.  The lake has a history of winterkills with  severe winterkills appearing to be less frequent and only partial kills more likely.  Minimizing impacts to the lake's undeveloped shorelines and plant communities is encouraged to provide fish and wildlife habitat and buffer the effects of land use practices.  Anglers and spearers are encouraged to harvest small northern pike and to release larger pike over 24 inches to help maintain fish community balance.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Thunder Lake is a relatively shallow lake east of Browerville.  Two of the most outstanding features of the 2007 summer survey on the lake was the poor water clarity and abundant population of small, black bullheads.  The secchi disk reading was only 3.8 feet in mid-June which is usually more common at the end of the summer.  The lake supports a fish community that is typical of lakes which experience periodic winterkills although none recently.  Black bullheads, brown bullheads, and northern pike were the most common fish species found in the survey.  \n     The lake has an abundance of northern pike which can have a negative impact on the fish community.  Despite the increased abundance some nice fish were seen in the survey with the average size being about 2 pounds and some over six pounds being sampled.  Walleye fry stocking  appears to sustain the walleye fishery in the lake although there has been evidence of some natural reproduction.  Several year classes were represented in the survey and periodically anglers report good walleye fishing usually early in the season.  Yellow perch numbers are lower than desired which may be due to the high pike numbers.  Perch can be an important food species for the northern pike and walleye and can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  Thunder Lake also has an abundant black crappie population which is a new development.  While some nice crappies up to 12 inches were observed in the survey, the average size was about 6 inches.  If growth rates remains good, there could be excellent crappie fishing in one to two years.  Bluegills on the other hand have not been that abundant in the lake but have maintained without stocking since 1990.  The average size found in the survey was about 6 inches but there were some quality size bluegills up to 9 inches caught.\n     If looking for bullheads and not picky about size, Thunder Lake is an excellent lake to start with.  Both the black and brown bullheads populations are high when compared to similar type lakes.  Yellow bullheads are also present but their numbers are much lower than the other two species.  The black bullheads tended to be much smaller than the other two species.  Black and yellow bullheads are two species that can be indicators of water quality.  Black bullheads reach their highest abundance in very turbid, eutrophic waters while yellow bullheads prefer clear water.  Thunder Lake also has a very healthy bowfin or dogfish population which can provide some fishing action.  Other fish species found in the survey included common carp, white suckers,, and pumpkinseeds.\n     Despite having only light development around the lake and a watershed dominated by forest and marsh, algae blooms are common in Thunder Lake.  The lake has experienced some severe winterkills in the past but winterkill in recent times appeared to be just partial die-offs.  Minimizing impacts to the lake's undeveloped shorelines and plant communities is encouraged to provide fish and wildlife habitat and buffer the effects of land use practices.  Anglers and spearers are encouraged to harvest small northern pike and to release larger pike over 24 inches to help maintain fish community balance.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>         Thunder Lake is a relatively shallow basin east of Browerville.   Dense submergent vegetation beds of Canada Waterweed, Northern Watermilfoil, and Flat-stemmed Pondweed flourish on the north and west side of the lake.  Sand and gravel along with detritus were the most common shallow water substrates.  <br> \n        The lake supports a fish community that is typical of lakes which experience periodic winterkills although none have occurred recently. Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, and Northern Pike were the most common fish species found in the survey. The lake has an abundance of Northern Pike which can have a negative impact on the fish community. Despite their abundance, some nice fish were seen in the survey with the average size about 2.5 pounds and some over six pounds sampled. Walleye fry stocking appears to sustain the Walleye fishery in the lake although there has been evidence of some natural reproduction.   While the survey catch did not meet management goals for the lake, periodically anglers report good Walleye fishing usually early in the season.  Thunder supports a moderate number of Largemouth Bass available in a wide range of sizes.  Most of the bass were between 9 and 11 inches in length, however, fish up to 18 inches were observed. <br> \n        Yellow Perch numbers are lower than desired which may be due to the high pike numbers. Perch can be an important food species for the Northern Pike and Walleye and can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well-balanced Bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  Many anglers go to Thunder Lake seeking both Black Crappie and Bluegill.  While a few nice crappie were caught in the summer survey, fish over 12 inches were observed in spring electrofishing.  Bluegill abundance appears to be within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  The fish grow fast and reach 8 inches by age five.  The average size found in the survey was about 5 inches but there were some quality size Bluegills up to 9 inches caught. <br> \n If looking for bullheads and not picky about size, Thunder Lake is an excellent lake to start with. Both the Black and Brown bullhead populations are high when compared to similar type lakes. Yellow Bullhead are also present but their numbers are much lower than the other two species.   Overall, Black Bullhead tended to be much smaller than the other species of bullhead. Black and Yellow bullhead are two species that can be indicators of water quality. Black Bullhead reach their highest abundance in very turbid, eutrophic waters while Yellow Bullhead prefer clear water.  Common Carp are present but do not appear to be at levels high enough to be detrimental to lake habitat.  Other fish species found in the survey included Bowfin (Dogfish), White Suckers, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n Despite having only light development around the lake and a watershed dominated by forest and marsh, late summer algae blooms have been common in Thunder Lake.  This is from natural eutrophication due to surrounding marshes.  The lake has experienced some severe winterkills in the past but winterkill in recent times appeared to be just partial die-offs. Minimizing impacts to the lake's undeveloped shorelines and plant communities is encouraged to provide fish and wildlife habitat and buffer the effects of land use practices. Anglers and spearers are encouraged to harvest small Northern Pike and to release larger pike over 24 inches to help maintain fish community balance.  Limiting harvest of the larger Black Crappie and male Bluegill will also help maintain a quality panfish fishery.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nearshore sampling was performed on Thunder Lake July 3 and 8 of 2019 to provide data for calculation of a Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score in conjunction with standard gill net and trap net sampling conducted June 17-19.  Nearshore sampling consists of seining and backpack electrofishing at 10 randomly selected stations evenly spaced along the shoreline.  Data from these efforts were combined to arrive at the FIBI score which is used to assess overall lake health and aquatic life use.  The FIBI uses fish community data to help identify stressors that may be negatively impacting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, derived from several fish community attributes provides an indication of lake health by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake within its classification.   Thunder Lake is classified within FIBI Tool 5 for comparative scoring and evaluation.  FIBI calculations resulted in a score of 26 which is slightly above the impairment threshold of 24.  These results indicate that the lake is approaching an impaired status based on the FIBI score which is very near the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biotic integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 17 native fish species were observed when combining nearshore data with gill net and trap net results.  Common Carp, a non-native species, was sampled in multiple gears.  One native species found in the lake (Iowa Darter) is considered intolerant of habitat disturbance.  Three tolerant fish species were sampled (Black Bullhead, Common Carp and Green Sunfish).   Largemouth Bass was the most abundant species in near shore sampling and darter species (Iowa darter and Johnny Darter) were well represented.  Black Bullhead were the most numerous species in the gill nets and Northern Pike accounted for slightly more of the gill net biomass than Black Bullhead. Bluegill were the most abundant species in the trap nets, however Northern Pike accounted for the most biomass.   Golden Shiners were the only minnow/cyprinid species observed.   <br> \n  <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency <br> \n</p>",
