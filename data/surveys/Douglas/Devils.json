                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catch rate increased from 7.5 fish/net night in 1986 to 16.25 fish/net night in 1990.  The present catch rate is twice as great as any survey dating back to 1955.  Walleye measuring up to 29.0 inches in length were captured in the recent population assessment. PSD was calculated at 46%.  RSD Q-P and RSD P-M were calculated at 13% and 8%, respectively. The mean weight of fish captured increased slightly from 1.34 lbs in 1986 to 1.48 lbs in 1990 mean Wr of stock (10.0-14.9 inches), quality- (15.0-19.9 inches), and preferred-(20.0+ inches) length fish was 77.0, 80.2, and 78.6, respectively despite relatively poor condition factors, growth rate is good with age 5 fish averaging 19.4 inches in length.  Strong year classes have developed in 1989, 1988, and 1986.  Fry were stocked in 1989.  Fingerlings were stocked in 1988.  Fry were stocked in 1986, however, fingerlings stocked in 1987 included carry over fish (age 1+).  The efficacy of the prior stockings is difficult to determine.  There have been no blank years to accurately assess natural reproduction, and stocking of carry-over or age-1 fish was common. Northern pike are abundant.  Catch rates averaged 12.0 fish/gillnet.  This compares to catch rates of 0.2 fish/gillnet in 1981 and 5.3 fish/gillnet in 1986.  The PSD was calculated at 10%, compared to 25% in 1981 and 32% in 1986. Mean weight of fish captured was 1.67 lbs. Electrofishing yielded 47.2 largemouth bass/hour.  The size structure of the sample would indicate a desirable population from an angling perspective.  PSD was measured at 69.9% and RSD P-M was 25%.  Growth is good with age 3 fish averaging 13.5 inches in length.  Recruitment may have been poor in 1989.  No sub-stock (8.0 inches) fish were captured.  Only one fish was a cohort of the 1989 year class. Bluegill catch rates increased slightly to 37.4 fish/trapnet.  This compares to 28.1 and 25.3 fish/trapnet in 1981 and 1986, respectively.  PSD was measured at 39.0%, compared to 22.0% in 1986.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.15 lbs.  Growth of bluegill is slow with age 4 fish averaging 4.8 inches in length.  Although growth rate is slow, the relative abundance and size structure of the population should provide a quality fishery. Black crappie catch rates averaged 1.4 fish/ trapnet and 8.8 fish/gillnet.   The trapnet catch is similar to previous years, while the gillnet index is higher than those encountered in the past.  The seasonal distribution of crappie in deeper water makes it difficult to assess the population during the summer months. PSD was calculated at 63 percent with most of the larger fish being taken in gillnets. Yellow perch catch rates averaged 13.5 fish/ gillnet.  This rate has remained stable despite the recent increase in walleye and northern pike abundance.  All fish captured were 5.0-7.9 inches in length.  This results in a PSD of 0.0% mean weight of fish captured was 0.15 lbs. Bullhead are abundant, especially black bullhead.  Catch rates averaged 26.5 fish/gillnet. The majority of fish were 9.0-10.9 inches in length.  Fish captured had a mean weight of 0.59 lbs.  These fish have commercial and sport fishery potential.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Devils Lake is a small (234 acre), shallow basin located in northwestern Douglas County near Brandon, Minnesota.  Water quality is high and aquatic vegetation is common.  Water clarity was approximately 11.0 feet at the time of the July survey.  One public access is located on the northern shoreline just off Devils Lake Road.\n\nWalleye catch rates (3.3/gill net) exceed the statewide average of similar lakes (2.8/gill net).  Average size was 16.8 inches and 1.7 pounds.  The largest Walleye was 22.6 inches.  Growth rates appear moderate, allowing younger Walleye to reach desirable lengths in three to four years.  Northern Pike (5.5/gill net) remain abundant in Devils Lake.  Over 70% of all surveyed pike were less than 21.0 inches in length.  Anglers are encouraged to take advantage of the liberalized pike harvest regulation (anglers are able to keep up to 10 pike with no more than two fish longer than 26 inches; all fish from 22-26 inches must be released).  Increased harvest may improve growth rates and average size of Northern Pike.  Electrofishing efforts collected 91 Largemouth Bass in 2021.  Average size was good (12.5 inches), with several individuals exceeding 18.0 inches.  The largest bass surpassed 20.0 inches.  Bluegill are common, but average length was modest (6.5 inches).  Maximum length was 9.2 inches in 2021.  Growth rates of Bluegill are moderate and likely approximate similar lakes in Minnesota.  Seven-year-old Bluegill averaged 7.6 inches.  Similar to previous surveys, Black Crappie are present, but not highly abundant (1.2/gill net).  Individuals averaged 9.3 inches, with the largest exceeding 10.5 inches.  Yellow Perch are not common in Devils Lake.  \n\nOther species recorded in the 2021 lake survey included Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed and Yellow bullhead.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2027.  \n\nDevils Lake is designated as infested with Zebra Mussels.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to other lakes.\n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Devils Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nEleven species were collected during this survey, indicating a relatively simple nearshore fish community.  Two species (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter) were considered \"intolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Devils Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Devils Lake is a relatively small lake located in northwestern Douglas County between Lakes Chippewa and Little Chippewa.  Devils Lake is connected to both those lakes by non-navigable channels.  Water clarity is good with a mid-summer Secchi reading of 8.1 feet.  This lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass and sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers are similar to those reported in the 2005 survey.  Gillnet catches averaged 4.3 fish/net.  The walleye population has good size structure and fast growth.  Ninety-two percent of walleyes captured in gillnets exceeded 15.0 inches in length, 28% exceeded 20.0 inches, and eight percent exceeded 25.0 inches.  Average length was 18.1 inches.  Natural reproduction has been documented on Devils Lake.  Fingerling stocking continues on an every other year basis to supplement natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass population in Devils Lake is abundant.  Electrofishing catches averaged 78.0 eight-inch or larger largemouth bass per hour.  Size distribution is favorable.  Average length of sampled fish was 12.9 inches.  The largest fish measured 17.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers are consistent with expected catches for similar lakes in the Glenwood area.  Trapnet catches averaged 18.9 fish/net.  Size structure is fair with only 44% of the sample exceeding 6.0 inches.  Few fish sampled were longer than 8.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike remain abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 7.7 fish/net.  Size structure remains poor.  Only 21% of the sample exceeded 21.0 inches.  The largest fish measured 29.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie are also present in Devils Lake but were not sampled in sufficient numbers to accurately assess population density and size structure. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch have not been sampled since the 1997 survey.  Yellow perch are an important forage fish for northern pike and walleye.  Yellow perch numbers may continue to be impacted by high northern pike numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Devils Lake is a 234-acre basin located in northeastern Douglas County near Brandon, Minnesota.  The lake has a maximum depth of 35.0 feet and estimated average depth of 12.0 feet.  Devils Lake is connected to Big Chippewa and Little Chippewa lakes by non-navigable channels.  One public access is located on the northern shoreline of Devils Lake just off Devils Lake Road. <br> \n <br> \nA standardized fish community assessment was completed on Devils Lake, July 27-30, 2015.  A combination of six gill nets and nine trap nets were used.  An electrofishing survey was also completed in early May to sample the Largemouth Bass population.     <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes proved to be moderately abundant.  The gill net catch rate of 4.8-fish/net was lower than some prior surveys but is within expectations for lakes similar to Devils Lake.  Walleye captures averaged 14.7 inches.  The largest capture measured 26.4 inches.  Walleyes grow well in Devils Lake and in response, 50% of Walleyes exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Twelve percent of Walleyes exceeded 20.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike continue to be abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 8.3-fish/net.  Most gill net captures (80%) were less than 21.0 inches in length.  The lake does support a few larger pike.  The largest pike measured 32.5 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest surplus small pike to improve growth rates and size of Northern Pike and increase survival of stocked Walleyes. <br> \n <br> \nA single trip around the 3.2-mile shoreline with the electrofishing boat resulted in the capture of 99 Largemouth Bass.  Length at capture ranged from 5.0 to 19.1 inches, with average length being 12.3 inches.  Approximately 20% of bass collected exceeded 15.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish populations proved reasonably healthy.  Bluegill catches averaged 22.0-fish/trap net, which exceeds the median catch rate for similar lakes.  Bluegills grow well in Devils Lake and nearly 50% of all Bluegill captures exceeded 6.0 inches.  The largest Bluegill caught during the survey measured 8.7 inches.  Black Crappie catches were limited.  Trap net and gill net catches averaged only 1.0-fish/net.  The low catch rate was consistent with preceding survey findings and was anticipated in late-summer surveys where crappies are difficult to sample.  Age distribution of Black Crappie captures extended to age 6.  Due to the presence of older fish in the population, over 25% of captures exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  Devils Lake does not support a Yellow Perch fishery.  No Yellow Perch have been captured in the last two surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullheads are moderately abundant and the population can support quality fishing.  Those bullheads captured in trap nets averaged 11.0 inches in length and 0.75 pounds. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Devils Lake is a relatively small lake located in northwestern Douglas County between Lakes Chippewa and Little Chippewa.  Devils Lake is connected to both those lakes by non-navigable culverts.  This lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass and sunfish. Walleye numbers appear to be down from previous surveys.  Catch rates in 2005 were the lowest documented.  Gillnet catches averaged 5.3/net in 1993, 12.8/net in 1997, 13.3/net in 2001 and 3.4/net in 2005.  The walleye population has a good size structure and fast growth.  Seventy-seven percent of walleyes captured in gillnets exceeded 15.0 inches in length, 45% exceeded 20.0 inches, and 32% exceeded 25.0 inches.  Average length was 20.1 inches.  Natural reproduction has been documented in previous surveys.  Fingerling stockings are prescribed on an every other year basis to supplement natural walleye reproduction and stocking rates will be increased beginning in 2006.The largemouth bass population in Devils Lake is abundant.  Electrofishing catches averaged 103.0 eight-inch or longer largemouth bass per hour in 2005 as compared to 42.0 fish per hour in 2001.  Size distribution of captured fish is favorable.  Average length of sampled fish was 11.9 inches.  Bluegill numbers remain low with a fair size structure.  Ninety-three percent of bluegill sampled in trapnets exceeded 6.0 inches in length.  Few fish sampled were longer than 8.0 inches.  Northern pike remain abundant. Gillnet catches averaged 9.7 fish/net.  Size structure remains poor.  Only 21% of sampled fish exceeded 21.0 inches.  No yellow perch were sampled in the 2001 and 2005 surveys.  Yellow perch are an important forage fish for walleye and northern pike.  Density and size distribution may continue to be impacted by high northern pike numbers.  Black crappie are also present in Devils Lake but were not sampled in sufficient numbers to accurately assess population density and size structure.    </p>",

Firm bottom substrates provide ample spawning areas forsunfish and bass which is evidenced by their abundance.  Walleye are present in moderate numbers.  Gillnet catch rate averaged 5.3 fish/net in 1993, which iswithin the normal range of mean catch rates for lakes with similar chemical and physicalcharacteristics.  Thirty percent of fish captured were greater than 20 inches in length and averageweight was 2.5 pounds.  Northern pike numbers have remained high in Devils Lake.  However, average sizeis small at 1.8 pounds.  Largemouth bass are abundant and should provide quality fishing opportunities. Fish average 1.2 pounds and about one in five exceed 15 inches in length.  An abundant, slow growingbluegill population is also present.  Approximately 40% of the fish are over 6 inches in length, butfew if any exceed 8 inches.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Devils Lake is a relatively small lake located in northwestern Douglas County between Lakes Chippewa and Little Chippewa.  Devils Lake is connected to both those lakes by non-navigable culverts.  This lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass and sunfish with walleye being a species of secondary management importance. Anglers targeting walleye will find an abundant population that has a good size structure and fast growth rates.  Catch rates in the 2001 survey were the highest catches documented since 1990.  Seventy-eight percent of walleyes collected in gill nets exceeded 15 inches in length, 15% exceeded 20 inches, and 4% exceeded 25 inches.  Average length was 16.5 inches.  Natural reproduction has been documented in previous surveys.  Fingerling stockings are prescribed on an every other year basis to supplement natural walleye reproduction.The largemouth bass population in Devils Lake exhibits moderate abundance and good size structure.  Electrofishing catches averaged 42 eight-inch or longer largemouth bass per hour in 2001 with the average length being 11.6 inches.  Panfish numbers appear to be down compared to previous surveys, especially yellow perch.  Yellow perch gill net catches averaged 13.5/net in 1990, 6.5/net in 1993, 2.3/net in 1997, and 0.0/net in 2001.  Yellow perch are an important forage fish for top predators like the walleye.  Low catches in 2001 may be due to abundant walleye and northern pike populations.  Bluegill size structure is low.  Sixty-six percent of bluegill collected in trap nets exceeded 6 inches in length but no fish sampled were longer than 8 inches.  Black crappie are also present in Devils Lake but this species is not sampled in sufficient numbers during summer months to accurately assess population density and size structure.  Anglers targeting northern pike will find an abundant population of mostly smaller individuals.  The average length of northern pike collected in gill nets was just over 20 inches. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catches averaged 12.8 fish/net in 1997. Gillnet catches have been highly variable inrecent surveys averaging 5.3 fish/net in 1993 and 16.3 fish/net in 1990.  The normal range of meancatch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics is 1.2 - 5.3 fish/gillnet. Mean weight of fish captured in 1997 was 1.4 pounds.  A stocking chronology of walleye fry one year,fingerling stocking the following year, and a blank in the third year was initiated in 1993.  Thisstocking scheme allows for the evaluation of the relative effectiveness of fry versus fingerlingstocking in reaching management goals and allows for the evaluation of natural reproduction.  The ageclass distribution of fish captured in 1997 suggests that natural reproduction in 1995 and a fingerlingstocking in 1994 at a rate of 2.0 lbs per littoral acre both produced strong year classes.  Frystocking in 1996 may have also produced a strong year class.  Age-1 fish were prevalent in gillnetcatches, however fish of this size are not normally captured in gillnets.   Northern pike are abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 13.2 fish/net which exceeds the normal range ofmean catch rates from similar lakes (2.3 - 9.2 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches averaged 9.7 and 12.0fish/net in 1993 and 1990, respectively.  Size structure of the northern pike population is poor.  Meanweight of fish captured was 1.7 pounds and mean length was 19.5 inches.  Largemouth bass are alsoabundant and should provide quality angling opportunities.  Electrofishing yielded 51.0 fish per hour. Over 60% of the fish captured were 12.0 inches in total length or greater and approximately one-thirdexceeded 15.0 inches.  Similar catch rates and size structures were recorded during daytimeelectrofishing in 1993 and 1990.  Bluegill catches averaged 25.8 fish/trapnet.  Trapnet catches havebeen relatively consistent in previous surveys dating back to 1981, ranging from 22.8 to 37.4fish/trapnet.  Sixty-eight percent of the fish captured were 6.0 inches or greater, however few fishexceeded 8.0 inches.  Yellow perch catches averaged only 2.3 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches averaged6.5 and 13.5 fish/net in 1993 and 1990, respectively.  The normal range is 3.7 - 28.4 fish/gillnet. All of the fish captured in were between 5.5 and 7.5 inches in total length.  Black crappie are notcollected in sufficient numbers during summer months to assess population density and size structure. Trapnet catches averaged 1.0/net in 1997, similar to catches of 1.5 and 1.4 fish/trapnet recorded in1993 and 1990. </p>",
