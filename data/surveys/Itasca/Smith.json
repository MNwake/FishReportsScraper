The sucker and smallmouth bass population have remained stable.  The bluegill population increased between 1959-1976 and has since stayed stable.  The northern pike population was stable until 1976 but has now increased.  The crappie population has fluctuated during this period.  The perch population declined between 1959-1976 but has begun to increase.  The walleye population has declined since 1959, there has been little successful natural reproduction and survival of stocked walleye fry has been low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Smith Lake is a 155 acre bass-panfish lake located 4 miles southeast of Marcell, MN in the Chippewa National Forest.  Smith Lake has a maximum depth of 32 feet and relatively clear water (clarity = 9.8 ft).  There is no designated public access, but boats are commonly launched off the right-of-way of County Road #49 on the south shore of the lake.Largemouth bass appeared to be relatively abundant in the most recent assessment.  The night electrofishing catch rate for largemouth bass was 66.2 fish/hr of on-time.  Smallmouth bass were sampled in lower numbers, at 7.7/hr.  The only other previous electrofishing assessment on Smith Lake was in 1993.  Interestingly, catch rates for both bass species in that assessment were about one third of those recorded in 2003.  The differences in catch rates are likely due to variations in water temperature and weather conditions between the two sampling periods, rather than a large increase in abundance.  Size structure was moderate for both species.  Largemouth bass had an average length of 11.1 inches, while smallmouth bass had an average length of 12.2 inches.  Growth of both species was slightly below the statewide average.Gill net and trap net catches for black crappie were up from the previous assessment and above the normal range for this lake class.  Size structure was nearly identical for both gears; average length was 7.8 inches from gill nets and 7.9 inches from trap nets, with few crappie over 10 inches in the sample.  Age 4 and 5 crappie made up 74% of the sample.  Growth was considered slow (<85% of the statewide average) for ages 1-5.The gill-net catch rate for northern pike (3.3/net) was below the normal range and the lowest recorded since 1976.  Size structure was generally poor, with an average length of only 19.5 inches, although one 35.0 inch fish was captured.  Growth was slightly below the statewide average.The trap-net catch rate for bluegill was similar to the previous assessment and near the lake class average.  Bluegill size structure was poor; average length of bluegill in this assessment was only 5.1 inches and only 2% of bluegill were over 8 inches.  Bluegill were not aged in this assessment, but the previous assessment noted very slow growth.The walleye gill-net catch rate remained low, but was within the normal range at 0.67/net.  The four walleye captured averaged 24.9 inches.  Walleye have not been stocked since 1990.  A low-density population is maintained by natural reproduction.  The yellow perch gill-net catch was low at 3.5/net, near the lake class average and similar to assessments since 1987, but substantially lower than assessments done previously.  The low numbers of yellow perch are likely a limiting factor for production of predator species like northern pike and walleye.Other species sampled include: brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker. As lakes like Smith become increasingly more developed, lakeshore owners will have a larger impact on their future.  In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  Although the effect of land use decisions on one lake lot may seem relatively small, the cumulative impact of many lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, installing sand beach blankets, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, uncontrolled run-off and failing septic systems all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The northern pike population in Smith Lake has remained stable over the past several years.  There are a number of fish in the 20 - 30 inch range.  The average length of the northern pike that were sampled is 20.3 inches and the average weight was 2.0 pounds.     Smith Lake has a very small walleye population.  Reports indicate that they are very rarely caught.  The average size of the walleyes captured in the 1993 assessment was over 4 pounds.     Smith Lake is more suited to largemouth bass and sunfish than it is to walleyes and perch.  The largemouth bass population, though difficult to assess, appears reasonably healthy.  The largemouth bass that were sampled averaged 11.4 inches long.  Some smallmouth bass were also sampled, but they don't appear to be as abundant as largemouth bass.     Bluegills have increased in numbers in recent years.  They range in size from 3.1 - 7.8 inches long, with the majority being between 3.5 and 5.5 inches.       Black crappies, although not abundant, average 8.5 inches long.   Yellow perch are also present at low numbers and range in length from 5.9 - 9.6 inches.     </p>",
