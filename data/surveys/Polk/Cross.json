                "narrative": "<p>Cross Lake is a southeastern Polk County lake with a history of good fishing in between winterkills.  Northern pike, brown bullhead, and walleye (stocked) are the primary species sought.  The 1984 fish population assessment reported that anglers were catching two to four pound walleyes, large brown bullheads, and northern pike.  Many were caught from the dock at the county park.  Documented winterkill has most recently occurred during 1988, 1990, and 1991.  Although Cross Lake has a history of recorded winterkill as early as 1948 and 1967, oxygen depletion seemed to occur more frequently during the past decade than earlier years.  The 1991 winterkill virtually eliminated all fish species except black and brown bullhead.  Gillnet catches of northern pike averaged just below the normal range in 1995.  No northern pike have been stocked since 1975 and at least four winterkills have occurred since then.  The mere presence of a pike population is testament to its ability to sustain itself in Cross Lake.  Natural reproduction of northern pike has occurred in each of the four years since the most recent winterkill.  Two year olds are most abundant.  Average length of sampled pike was 23.0 inches and average weight was 3.1 pounds.  The growth rate was considered faster than normal.  Walleye were not able to survive the same low oxygen conditions as northern pike.  However, when stocked as fry following winterkill, walleye have grown quickly to become a relatively inexpensive supplement to the Cross Lake fishery.  Gillnet catches of walleye in 1995 averaged well above the normal range at 15.0 per gillnet.  The 1995 sample consisted entirely of two and four year old walleye, stocked since the winterkill in early 1991.  Average length of walleye was 17.2 inches and average weight was 1.9 pounds.  However, two distinct length groups were present.  Those two years of age were 13 to 15 inches long while those four years of age were 17 to 21 inches long.  To give a perspective by weight, the walleye population generally consists of one pounders and two pounders.  Walleye growth in Cross Lake is considered fast.  Yellow perch have undergone a steady decline in abundance since the initial survey in 1980.  Winterkill and predation are obviously factors in this decline, but, yellow perch are often among the first species to rebuild their populations following winterkill.  In Cross Lake, this has not occurred.  The 1995 gillnet catch of yellow perch was well below the normal range at 0.5 per gillnet.  Panfish have not been abundant in Cross Lake at any time since 1980.  Although bluegill have been introduced, they are quite sensitive to low dissolved oxygen and have not survived recent winterkills.  In 1995, black crappie were caught in test nets for the first time since test netting began.  The average trapnet catch of 1.0 crappie per trapnet in 1995 was within the normal range for similar lakes.  The ten crappie sampled were from the 1992 year class with a average length of 7.1 inches.  The growth rate for black crappie in Cross Lake was considered normal.  Black crappie are more tolerant of low oxygen and may survive longer than bluegill in Cross Lake.  Winterkill lakes typically have large populations of black bullhead, since this species is tolerant of low dissolved oxygen.  Trapnet catches of black bullhead in Cross Lake were extremely high in 1989.  As walleye and black crappie populations have rebounded following the 1991 winterkill, black bullhead abundance has decreased.  The 1995 net catch of black bullhead was 13.9 per trapnet, just above the normal range for lakes of similar ecological classification.  Brown bullhead numbers have also decreased since the 1980s and the most recent catch was less than the normal range for the first time since the initial survey in 1980.  In effort to prevent winterkill in Cross Lake, aeration equipment was operated by the Fosston Community Sportsmen's Club and the Fosston Lions Club from the mid seventies through the late eighties.  Unfortunately, the amount of aeration needed to sustain the fishery in severe winters was not available due to extreme expense.  A heavy winterkill in 1988 eliminated the gamefish populations from the lake, even with aeration systems operating.   It is clear from historical data that Cross Lake is ecologically suited for northern pike and bullhead.  Although periodic winterkill has devastated the fish community, those species remain most abundant and able to sustain themselves.  Walleye and panfish stocking following winterkill has also provided additional fishing opportunity in Cross Lake.  The opportunity for walleye anglers is now ripe with large numbers of good sized fish available.  Some anglers interviewed in mid June 1995 reported that walleyes had a \"muddy\" flavor.  Others did not notice such a flavor.  Generally, fish caught earlier in the year when water temperatures were cooler were thought to taste better than those caught later in summer.  With moderate to light fishing pressure, these walleye should provide angling until the next winterkill occurs.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cross Lake is a southeastern Polk Coutny lake with a history of algal blooms and good fishing in between winter kills.  Northern pike, brown bullhead, and walleye are the primary species sought.  Before the most recent series of winter kills in 1988, 1990, and 1991, anglers on the fishing pier were catching two to four pound walleyes and one to two pound brown bullheads quite regularly.  Unfortunately, the 1991 winter kill eliminated nearly all fish but the bullheads.  Even bullhead numbers were severely decreased.Nine years later, in 2000, northern pike have rebounded to abundances that are more normal for this lake.  Sampled pike averaged 19.9 inches long and some just under 27 inches long were caught.Walleyes, stocked as fry in each odd year since the winter kill, were also present.  Cross Lake walleyes grow quickly and average a good size (just under three pounds each).Largemouth bass, bluegills, and black crappies were also found in small numbers in 2000.  This was the first survey in which bass were caught in Cross Lake.Bullheads have once again become extremely abundant.  The black bullhead population is dominated by small fish (average 6.6 inches) while 14% of brown bullheads were longer than 10 inches.  High numbers of bullheads are typical for lakes subject to winterkill since these species are most tolerant of low dissolved oxygen.  They tend to rebound quickly following winterkill since there are few competitors or predators.In the past, the Fosston Community Sportsmen's Club and the Fosston Lion's Club operated aeration equipment in efforts to prevent winter kill from occurring in Cross Lake.  Unfortunately, the amount of aeration needed to sustain the fishery in severe winters was not available due to extreme expense.  A heavy winter kill in 1988 eliminated gamefish populations from the lake, even with aeration systems operating.It is clear from historical data that Cross Lake is ecologically suited for northern pike and bullhead.  Although periodic winter kill has devastated the fish community, these species remain most abundant and able to sustain themselves.  Walleye and panfish stocking following winter kill has also provided additional fishing opportunity in Cross Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cross Lake is a southeastern Polk County lake with a history of algal blooms and good fishing in between winterkills.  Northern Pike, Brown Bullhead, and Walleye have historically been the primary species sought by anglers.  Before the most recent series of severe winterkills in 1988, 1990, and 1991, anglers on the fishing pier were catching two to four pound Walleyes and one to two pound Brown Bullheads quite regularly.  However, the 1991 winterkill eliminated nearly every species but bullheads, and even bullhead numbers were severely decreased. <br> \n <br> \nNine years later, in 2000, Northern Pike rebounded to abundances that were more normal for this lake.  Now, in 2014, the catch rate has increased even more and, in 2014, the catch rate was well above normal for this lake.  Pike sampled by all gears ranged from 9.9 to 37.2 inches in length with an average of 21.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked regularly and test net catches were strong in 2014.  Cross Lake Walleyes grow quickly and sampled fish averaged over two pounds each.  Five distinct year classes of Walleye were found, but the strongest was the 2011.  Those young fish should provide good angling in the near future if they do not succumb to winterkill.  Fry stocking appears to work best when bullhead numbers are down, as is currently the case. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Bluegill and Black Crappie populations cannot be classified as abundant, record catch rates of Bluegills and Black Crappies were found in 2014.  There were good sized fish of both species present and, even though many were young, they should also provide good fishing in the near future barring severe winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nBullhead numbers were down markedly in 2014.  Brown Bullheads were slightly more abundant and larger than Black Bullheads.  High numbers of bullheads are typical for lakes subject to winterkill since these species are most tolerant of low dissolved oxygen.  They tend to rebound quickly following winterkill since there are few competitors or predators.  However, after several years without winterkill, game fish species can often overtake the bullhead populations.  This appears to be happening in Cross Lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn the past, the Fosston Community Sportsmen's Club and the Fosston Lion's Club operated aeration equipment in efforts to prevent winterkill from occurring in Cross Lake.  A heavy winterkill in 1988 eliminated gamefish populations from the lake, even with aeration systems operating.  Although no severe winterkill has occurred since 1991, light kills took place in 2001, 2004, and 2006.  In addition, dissolved oxygen levels reached the critical mark in 2014, but no evidence of fish kill was found. <br> \n <br> \nIt is clear from historical data that Cross Lake is ecologically suited for Northern Pike and bullhead.  Although periodic winterkills have occasionally reduced or eliminated many fish populations, these species remain most abundant and able to sustain themselves.  Walleye and panfish stocking following winterkills has provided additional fishing opportunities in Cross Lake.</p>",

The most recent severe winterkill occurred in 1991, when virtually all fish species except bullhead were extirpated from the lake.  However, a moderate winterkill also occurred in the winter of 2017-2018.  A standard fisheries survey was completed in June 2022 to evaluate the status of the fish populations in Cross Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSurvey results show that Cross Lake is still in recovery following the most recent partial winterkill.  Anglers will likely encounter Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and bullheads, with a smaller chance of catching Walleye and Bluegill.   <br> \n <br> \nThe size of Northern Pike was respectable, with fish averaging almost 27 inches long and individuals over 40 inches also observed.  Black Crappie had an average size of almost 11 inches long.  Bluegill were primarily five inches long, but some fish up to nine inches were also measured.  Walleye abundance was low, with fish averaging 17 inches long.  Bullheads were the most abundant fish caught in nets, with their average size being around seven inches.  Yellow Perch were present in low numbers with an average size of six inches.  Common Carp and White Sucker were also collected in numbers similar to past surveys.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cross Lake is a southeastern Polk County lake with a history of algal blooms and good fishing in between winterkills.  Northern pike, brown bullhead, and walleye have historically been the primary species sought by anglers.  Before the most recent series of severe winterkills in 1988, 1990, and 1991, anglers on the fishing pier were catching two to four pound walleyes and one to two pound brown bullheads quite regularly.  However, the 1991 winterkill eliminated nearly every species but bullheads, and even bullhead numbers were severely decreased. <br> \n <br> \nNine years later, in 2000, northern pike rebounded to abundances that were more normal for this lake.  Now, in 2007, the catch rate declined to the historic low of 2.3 pike per gill net.  Pike sampled by all gears ranged from 18.19 to 32.28 inches in length with an average of 20.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes, stocked as fry in each odd year since the winterkill, were also present.  Cross Lake walleyes grow quickly and average nearly three pounds each.  For the most part, sampled walleyes were either two years of age or older than ten years with very few in between.  Fry stocking appears to work best when bullhead numbers are down.  There were at least two missing year classes of stocked walleyes from years when bullhead catch rates were extremely high. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough bluegill and black crappie populations cannot be classified as abundant, record catch rates of bluegills and black crappies were found in 2007.  There were good sized fish of both species present and crappies, even though young, were very fast growing.  They should provide good fishing in the near future if they do not succumb to low dissolved oxygen levels. <br> \n <br> \nBullheads remain quite abundant.  However, the black bullhead population declined markedly from the 2000 study.  Brown bullheads were more abundant and larger than black bullheads.  High numbers of bullheads are typical for lakes subject to winterkill since these species are most tolerant of low dissolved oxygen.  They tend to rebound quickly following winterkill since there are few competitors or predators. <br> \n <br> \nIn the past, the Fosston Community Sportsmen's Club and the Fosston Lion's Club operated aeration equipment in efforts to prevent winterkill from occurring in Cross Lake.  A heavy winterkill in 1988 eliminated gamefish populations from the lake, even with aeration systems operating.  Although no severe winterkill has occurred since 1991, light kills took place in 2001, 2004, and 2006. <br> \n <br> \nIt is clear from historical data that Cross Lake is ecologically suited for northern pike and bullhead.  Although periodic winterkills have periodically reduced or eliminated many species, these species remain most abundant and able to sustain themselves.  Walleye and panfish stocking following winterkills has provided additional fishing opportunities in Cross Lake.</p>",
