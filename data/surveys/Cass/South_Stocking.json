                "narrative": "<p>South Stocking Lake covers an area of 34 acres and has very soft water.  The maximum depth is 44 feet and the median depth is 12 feet.  Aproximately 69 percent of the lake's area of 23.5 acres is less than 15 feet deep.  Soils of the lake bed in the more shallow water are judged to be 50% sand, 30% muck, 10% gravel, 5% gravel and rubble, and 5% rubble.  There are no inlets or outlets except that there is a fairly extensive sedge and cattail lowland or shoreline marsh connecting North and South Stocking Lakes.  A thin border of emergent aquatic plants surrounds the lake.  Submerged aquatic vegetation is sparse.  A secchi disc could be seen to a depth of 4.5 feet in brownish tinted water.There are no resorts or cottages present, however, one trailer house and three boats were seen.  Fishing pressure at best is believed to be light.Test netting of the lake revealed that white sucker, perch, pumpkinseed, and largemouth bass were caught in numbers below the respective statewide and regional medians.  Northern pike numbers indicated a dense population.During the lake survey, the summer oxygen levels did not appear to be as good as should be expected of a soft water lake.FISH STOCKING1947\tLargemouth bass\tfingerling\t1,0721948\tLargemouth bass fingerling\t1,4401950\tLargemouth bass fingerling\t3,9001954\tLargemouth bass fingerling\t6,600SPECIAL REGULATIONS:  Closed to fishing in posted spawning bed areas in 1951, 1952, and 1954.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Stocking Lake (DOW # 11-0297) is a 46-acre lake located near Longville, MN.  South Stocking Lake has 1.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 44 feet.  The lake is undeveloped and entirely within the Chippewa National Forest. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  South Stocking Lake is in Lake Class 21; lakes in this class are generally very small (< 50 acres) with a high percentage of shallow water areas.  Similar Lake Class 21 lakes in the Walker area include Blind (11-0155) and Silver (11-0202). This lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie and secondarily for Northern Pike. There is a carry-in access on the south end of the lake. This survey was a standard population assessment conducted in the summer of 2017. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are abundant in South Stocking Lake. Black Crappie average length was 7 inches and they ranged in size from 5 to 12 inches.  Northern Pike numbers were down from previous surveys. Northern Pike average length was 26 inches and lengths ranged size from 16 to 32 inches. The abundance of Yellow Perch was similar to previous surveys. Pumpkinseed numbers increased substantially since the last survey to a historic high. Pumpkinseeds were generally small and averaged 4 inches long and ranged in size from 3 to 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in South Stocking Lake.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Stocking Lake (DOW # 11-297) is a 34 acre lake located near Longville, MN.  South Stocking Lake has 1.6 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 44 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  South Stocking Lake is in Lake Class 21; lakes in this class are generally very small (< 50 acres) with a high percentage of shallow water areas.  This lake is primarily managed for black crappie and secondarily for northern pike.  There is a carry-in access on the south end of the lake.  The black crappie population in South Stocking Lake is doing well.  For the fourth consecutive survey black crappie catch rates have been higher than other lakes in this lake class.  Black crappies collected by the DNR ranged in size from 3.9-11.9 inches.    In the 2001 survey northern pike between 15.7 and 28.9 inches were sampled by the DNR.  The average size was 22.0 inches.  Northern pike catch rates in South Stocking Lake are similar to other lakes in Lake Class 21.  Similar to black crappie, northern pike in South Stocking Lake are plump.    In the 1996 survey, no bluegill were collected in South Stocking Lake following the reported winter kill.  Similarly, no bluegill were collected during the 2001 survey suggesting that the bluegill population has not rebounded.  The abundance of yellow perch, pumpkinseed, golden shiner and white sucker in the 2001 survey was similar to previous survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike in South Stocking were sampled by gillnets at a rate of 5.5 fish/net, which is within the interquartile range for lake class 21.  In previous assessments, northern pike gillnet catches have ranged from 5.33 to 9.00 fish/net.  Overall mean weight for northern pike collected by gillnets and trapnets was 3.8 pounds, which is higher than any previous survey.  Northern pike had a size structure that could be considered favorable to anglers; of the sampled northern pike greater than or equal to 14.0 inches, 69 percent were 21 inches or longer and 31 percent were 28 inches or longer.  Northern pike growth rates were good- 22.7 inches at the time they formed their third annulus.The 1992 trapnet catch of pumpkinseed sunfish, 7.33 fish/net, was higher than trapnet catches in previous surveys, which had ranged from 0.80 to 2.60 fish/net.  Pumpkinseed in the sample ranged from 3.0 to 6.9 inches, with just 10 percent of the sampled pumkinseed 6 inches or longer.The 1992 assessment was only the second survey in which bluegill were sampled.  In 1978, just 0.20 bluegill/net were caught, while in the 1992 survey 18.00 bluegill/net were taken.  The 1992 trapnet catch falls near the middle of the interquartile catch rate range for lake class 21.  The combined gillnet and trapnet length frequency for bluegill shows a sample ranging from 3.0 to 8.9 inches.  Almost half of the sampled bluegill were 6.0 inches or longer (PSD = 47), while 5 percent were 7.0 inches or more.  Bluegill growth in this lake was excellent for this area: age 3 bluegill averaged 6.0 inches at the time that their third annulus was formed.  It appears that bluegill may have been introduced (probably by anglers) during the 1980's and their population is presently expanding.  Whether present growth rates can be maintained is unknown.  No bluegill over 4 years old were sampled.The catch rate of black crappie by gillnet was 5.5 fish/net, which is in the middle of the interquartile range for class 21 lakes.  Trapnet catch of black crappie (18.0 fish/net) far exceeded the interquartile trapnet catch for this lake class.  The 1987 population assessment also showed a good catch of black crappie in trapnets.  No black crappie were reported in the 1963 or the 1978 surveys.  Combining length information from gillnets and trapnets, it can be seen that black crappie ranged from 3.5 to 11.9 inches.  Just 11 percent of the 5 inch and larger black crappie were 8.0 inches or more (PSD = 11).  A large portion of the sampled black crappie in 1992 were in the 6.0 to 7.9 inch range.  The PSD of the 1987 sample was 50.  Growth of the 1992 sample of black crappie was somewhat slow, with age 5 black crappie measuring 6.85 inches at formation of annulus 5.  This was slower than growth found in the 1987 survey, when age 5 fish averaged 9.95 inches at annulus formation.The gillnet catch of yellow perch in this survey of 3.00 fish/net, which is toward the lower end of the interquartile range for lake class 21.  Yellow perch ranged from 7.5 to 9.4 inches.</p>",
