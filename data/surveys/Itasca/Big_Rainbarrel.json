THERE WERE NO SUITABLE SEINING LOCATIONS SO FOUR MINNOW TRAPS BAITED WITH DOG FOOD WERE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THE ABUNDANCE OF YOUNG GAMEFISH AND SMALL FORAGE SPECIES. ONLY ONE OUT OF FOUR SETS CAUGHT ANY FISH. THERE WERE 90 YOUNG OF YEAR LARGEMOUTH BASS IN THIS SET. A SUBSAMPLE OF 25 OF THESE FISH AVERAGED ON JULY 15. THE ONLY CONCLUSION TO MAKE FROM THIS DATA IS THAT LARGE- MOUTH BASS ARE SUCCESSFULLY REPRODUCING. THE SAMPLING PERIOD WAS TOO EARLY TO EVALUATE THE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS YEAR CLASS TO THE FUTURE BASS FISHERIES WITHIN THE LAKE. THE SMALL SAMPLE OF YELLOW PERCH WERE AGED AND ALL INDIVIDUAL FISH HAD BETTER GROWTH RATES THAN THE STATE AVERAGE.</p>",
