Low numbers of rock bass, smallmouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and lake whitefish were also captured.Cisco sizes ranged from 7\" to 15\".  Fifteen percent of walleye were over 20\".  A large northern pike (41\") was captured, as well as some quality sized crappie (over 12\") and bluegill (over 8\").Crappie recruitment was quite even except that few young crappie were captured, possibly due to cold summers in 1992 and 1993.  Northern pike and walleye recruitment was dominated by strong 1991 year-classes, although several year-classes were well-represented for both species. Crappie growth was faster than average for the area, and northern pike growth was average.  Growth of young walleye was very slow, while growth of older walleye was nearly average for the area.Total numbers of fish in the gillnets (34.3/net) and total weight of fish (27.6 pounds/net) is about average for the area.  Total numbers of fish in the trapnets (8.4/net) and total weight of fish (9.2 pounds/net) is much lower than average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Iron Lake is fairly large, at 3,246 acres, and is three miles southeast of Ely. The lake has two public access with concrete boat ramps, both on the west side of the lake. White Iron Lake can also be accessed by boat from the Garden Reservoir via Farm Lake. Water levels on the lake are affected seasonally by a hydroelectric dam at the outlet of Garden Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 lake management plan for White Iron Lake (White Iron) lists walleye as the primary management species and northern pike, smallmouth bass, and black crappie as secondary species. A standard survey was conducted in early fall 2023 to assess the populations of these species, especially walleye and northern pike which have special regulations, and to monitor lake quality and habitat. The survey crew sampled fish with gill nets and trap nets, and they measured water quality. White Iron was well mixed, with a water temperature of 64 F from the surface to 25 feet deep. Oxygen levels were adequate for all fish species throughout the water column. White Iron has brown, bog-stained water with visibility around 5 feet. Shoreline substrates are predominantly rocky, although some of the bays have muck bottoms and fair amounts of aquatic vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye harvest by anglers on White Iron is restricted with a special regulation that requires the release of all fish from 17 to 26 inches, with only one fish over 26 inches allowed in a 6-fish limit. This regulation, which also applies to the Garden Reservoir lakes, has been in place since 2006 and the goal has been to maintain overall catch rates while increasing the number of fish over 17 inches. The gill-net catch for walleye was lower than the historic median for the lake. Walleye averaged 14.7 inches in length and 47% of the fish sampled were over 14.0 inches. The catch rate of walleye over 17 inches was 1.6 fish/net, which was slightly higher than the historic median. A few walleye were also caught in trap nets and were larger, at  22.4 inches long on average. Walleye growth was fairly slow, as it took the average fish between 5 and 6 years to reach 15 inches in length. Walleye ages ranged from 0 to 19 years old. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike (pike) harvest by anglers on White Iron is restricted with a special regulation that requires the release of all fish from 24 to 36 inches, with only one fish over 36 inches allowed in a 3-fish limit. This regulation, which applies to all the connected lakes mentioned above, has been in place since 2003 with the goal of maintaining the overall catch rate and increasing the abundance of larger pike. In this survey, the gill-net catch for pike was slightly higher than the historic median for the lake. The fish averaged 21.2 inches in length, which was smaller than the historical average for the lake and a decline from the previous three surveys. Additional pike were caught in trap nets, and these fish tended to be smaller, averaging just 18.2 inches. However, pike greater than 30 inches were sampled in both gill nets and trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were caught at rates that were above average for the lake. However, these fish were smaller than in previous surveys with an average length of just 5.4 inches. Bluegill ages ranged from 3 to 8 years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were caught at rates that were below the historic median for the lake. Black crappie averaged 9.7 inches in length. The largest black crappie sampled was 13.4 inches long, and ages ranged from 3 to 9. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in 2023 included cisco, golden shiner, rock bass, smallmouth bass, white sucker, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Iron Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.   White Iron Lake is larger than most of the lakes in this lake class and has water that is less clear (tea colored) due to bog-stain.  White Iron Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.  White Iron Lake is large and windswept, and the South Kawishiwi and Bear Island rivers flow through it with average flows of several hundred cubic feet per second.  For these reasons it typically only partially stratifies thermally in midsummer with bottom temperatures only a few degrees F cooler than the surface, and retains adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) to the bottom.  The lake was not stratified at all on 08/23/2004.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 5 ft.Fish sampling in the 2004 fish population assessment consisted of fifteen gillnet sets and fourteen trapnet sets.  Fifteen trapnets were set, but one was pulled out by a riparian landowner.  Sixteen previous investigations on this lake, dating back to 1958, consisted of 3-15 gillnet sets.  Trapnets (8-15 sets) were used during five of these previous investigations.  Historically, gillnets have captured many more fish than trapnets in White Iron Lake.Fish populations in 2004, as in previous investigations, were dominated by walleye, cisco, northern pike, and yellow perch.Walleye numbers in 2004 (7.3/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 7.5/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes averaged 13.9\" (1.2 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 12.9\" in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye recruitment was good, with many year classes well represented in the 2004 catch.  Walleye growth was slower than normal (in the first or second quartiles, depending on the age) by area standards.Cisco numbers in 2004 (9.9/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 11.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes averaged 8.8\" (0.26 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 9.3\" in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco are a rich forage base, and are likely responsible for the occasional trophy sized walleye and northern pike caught in this lake.Northern pike numbers in 2004 (3.6/gillnet) were at the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 2.4/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2004 averaged 23.7\" (3.0 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 21.6\" in all investigations on this lake.  Northern pike scales were very difficult to age, but it appeared that most pike captured in 2004 were ages three and four, and pike growth appeared to be somewhat faster than normal (in the third quartile) by area standards.Yellow perch numbers in 2004 (8.1/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 8.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2004 averaged 6.8\" (0.15 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 7.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  Perch recruitment was good, and perch from a number of year classes were represented in the 2004 catch.  Perch growth was normal (in the second or third quartile, depending on the age) by area standards.Smallmouth bass were first captured in DNR investigations on White Iron Lake in 1973.  Smallmouth catches in gillnets and trapnets have been fairly low, and it is our impression that smallmouth numbers in White Iron Lake are not particularly high.  The largest smallmouth captured in 2004 was 16.6\".Black crappie catches have likewise been fairly low in DNR investigations, but some nice sized crappie have been captured.  The largest crappie in 2004 was 12.8\".Many of the northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch examined in 2004 were infected with neascus.  Some of the cisco were infected with triaenophorus and some of the yellow perch were infected with yellow grub.   Neascus (black spot), yellow grub, and triaenophorus are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are killed at temperatures used to cook fish, and are often removed by filleting the fish (except for triaenophorus, which are embedded in the muscle).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Iron Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  White Iron Lake is larger than most of the lakes in this lake class and has water that is less clear due to bog-stain (tea-colored).   White Iron Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Iron Lake is large and windswept, and the South Kawishiwi and Bear Island Rivers flow through it with average flows of several hundred cubic feet per second.  For these reasons it typically only partially stratifies thermally in midsummer with bottom temperatures only a few degrees F cooler than the surface, and retains adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) to the bottom.  The lake was not thermally stratified at all on 09/02/2008.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 5 ft. <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling in the 2008 fish population assessment consisted of nine gillnet sets and fifteen trapnet sets.  Fifteen gillnets were used in recent investigations, but this number was reduced to nine in 2008 in an effort to reduce fish mortality due to the more frequent assessment regime (every two years) for White Iron Lake as part of the Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE) program that was implemented in 2008.  SLICE is an effort to intensively sample 24 representative lakes across the state to better determine environmental stressors and change over time.  Seventeen previous investigations on this lake, dating back to 1958, consisted of 3-15 gillnet sets.  Trapnets (8-15 sets) were used during seven of these previous investigations.  Historically, gillnets have captured many more fish than trapnets in White Iron Lake. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2008, as in previous investigations, were dominated by walleye, cisco, northern pike, and yellow perch.  Six of the fifteen trapnets set in 2008 were moved to locations more appropriate to capturing centrarchids (shallow, weedy areas), but centrarchid catches remained low. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2008 (9.8/gillnet) were at the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 7.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes averaged 13.5\" (1.1 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 12.9\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye was 26.8\".  Walleye recruitment was good, with many year-classes well represented in the 2008 catch, but the increase in walleye numbers was due to a strong 2006 year-class that comprised 33 percent of the gillnet catch.  Walleye growth was slower than normal by area standards, especially for young fish. <br> \n <br> \nCisco numbers in 2008 (13.9/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 11.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes averaged 9.4\" (0.35 lb), which was near the median for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 9.3\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest cisco was 15.8\".  Cisco are rich forage fish, and are likely responsible for the occasional trophy-sized walleye and northern pike caught in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2008 (2.2/gillnet) were near the median for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 2.4/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2008 averaged 22.6\" (3.4 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 21.7\" in all investigations on this lake.  Northern pike scales were difficult to age, but it appeared that most pike captured in 2008 were ages 2-4, and pike growth appeared to be normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2008 (8.8/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 8.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2008 averaged 7.7\" (0.23 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 7.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  Perch recruitment was good, and perch from a number of year-classes were represented in the 2008 catch.  Perch growth was somewhat faster than normal (in the third quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were first captured in DNR investigations on White Iron Lake in 1973.  Smallmouth catches in gillnets and trapnets have been fairly low, and it is our impression that smallmouth numbers in White Iron Lake are not particularly high.  Four smallmouth were caught in the gillnets and two were caught while electrofishing in 2008.  The largest smallmouth was 18.4\".  Smallmouth growth was somewhat faster than normal (in the third quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catches have likewise been fairly low in DNR investigations, but some nice sized crappie have been captured.  The largest crappie in 2008 was 11.7\". <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers remained low in 2008 despite moving some trapnets into shallower, weedier locations in an effort to catch more bluegill, crappie, and bass.  Bluegill sizes were good: eight of the 32 bluegill captured in the trapnets were over 8\" and the largest was 9.2\".  Bluegill growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.   <br> \n <br> \nOne 37\" tiger muskie, a cross between a muskellunge and a northern pike, was captured in 2008.  Low numbers of muskie were stocked into this system in the 1970's and two tiger muskie (24\" and 32\") were also caught in White Iron Lake in 2004.  <br> \n <br> \nMany of the northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch examined in 2008 were infected with Neascus (black spot).  Some of the yellow perch were infected with yellow grub.  Triaenophorus has previously been observed in cisco in this lake.  All of these parasites are common and are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish, a large and aggressive crayfish species native to the Ohio River Valley, were captured by the U.S. Forest Service in crayfish traps in the summer of 2007 in Birch Lake, White Iron Lake, Farm Lake, and Garden Lake.  They were previously observed by DNR fisheries crews in Birch Lake near the Kawishiwi River inlet, and they have been abundant in Fall Lake for over 20 years.  No crayfish were caught during the 2008 fisheries investigation on White Iron Lake.  Experience tells us that these crayfish will become abundant in this system as well, and will result in the disappearance of native crayfish and much of the rooted aquatic vegetation. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Iron Lake is one of 24 \"sentinel lakes\" located around the state for the Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE) project.  SLICE is a cooperative lake monitoring program between DNR Fisheries and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.  The project is designed to help scientists understand, predict, and respond to outcomes of major drivers of change (e.g. development, agriculture, invasive species, climate) on lake habitats and fish populations.  Data collected in 2010 for this project include: northern pike ice-out trap netting, largemouth bass and smallmouth bass fall night electrofishing, summer gill netting and trap netting for all species, and an aquatic vegetation survey.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite Iron Lake is a 3,429-acre lake with a maximum depth of 47 feet located five miles east of Ely in northeastern St. Louis and western Lake counties.  It has a very large watershed (592,626 acres) draining the majority of the Kawishiwi  River watershed (173:1 watershed area to lake area ratio).  Eighty-three percent of the watershed is forested.  The Kawishiwi and Bear Island Rivers flow into the lake with the Kawishiwi River flowing out on the north end.  Average flow of several hundred cubic feet per second gives lake water a short residence time of only 45 days.  The many wetlands in the watershed give the lake a bog stained color and a lower water clarity. <br> \n <br> \nBased on chemical and physical characteristics Minnesotas lakes have been categorized into 43 different classes.  White Iron, is in lake class 7.  Lakes in this class typically are moderate in size (average = 1807 acres), moderately deep (average = 49 feet), and have close to 50% of the lake less than 15 feet deep.  Typical fish communities include walleye, northern, cisco, white sucker, rock bass, black crappie, and yellow perch.  White Iron had all of these species in addition to bluegill in 2010.   <br> \n <br> \n White Iron Lake maintains a high quality, naturally reproducing walleye and northern pike populations.  No stocking of any species is currently done in White Iron Lake, hower, the reservoir that contains White Iron Lake does get stocked in other lakes.  Recently implemented special size and harvest regulations for walleye and northern pike are designed to maintain high numbers and quality size structure.  Similar to other lakes in the border ecoregion, warm-water centrarchids such as bluegill are becoming increasingly abundant.  The game fish community of White Iron is diverse with substantial populations of cold, cool, and warm water species.  The non-native rusty crayfish was first discovered in White Iron chain in 2003 and confirmed in 2007.  Rusty crayfish can destroy large beds of aquatic plants.  (Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's summary report on White Iron Lake, February 2009). <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to catch walleye in a wide range of lengths up to 30 inches with good numbers of fish in the 13-15 inch range.  White Iron Lake has an excellent natural reproducing population that was composed of 14 different year classes in 2010.  Growth is slow.  It takes six years for a walleye to attain 17 inches in length and enter into the protected slot of 17-26 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThere is a low density population of quality-sized northern pike that anglers will enjoy catching.  In 2010, DNR personnel sampled pike up to 38 inches.  These large trophy pike take many years to attain this size.  Anglers should consider practicing selective harvest and release these bigger pike and target pike below the protected slot (24\"-36\" with one over 36\") for harvest.   <br> \n <br> \nBoth largemouth and smallmouth were also sampled.  Smallmouth bass up to 18 inches were captured.  There were also high numbers of young-of-the-year smallmouth bass sample indicating successful natural reproduction in 2010. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2010, panfish sampled included yellow perch, black crappie and bluegill.  Yellow perch are valuable both as a forage fish for northern pike and walleye as well as recreationally for angling.  Perch up to 10.7 inches were sampled.  Black crappie abundance was typical for lake class 7.  Crappie sampled ranged in length from 8.3 to 12.0 inches with an average length of 9.4 inches.  Few bluegill were sampled, however, fish up to 10 inches were captured. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Iron Lake is a 3,246 acre lake located three miles southeast of Ely.  There are three accesses, two of which are concrete ramps both on the west side of the lake. The other access is a navigable channel on the north side which connects to the other three lakes of the Garden Reservoir chain.  The lake has a maximum depth of 47 feet and brown water.\n\nThe South Kawishiwi and Bear Island Rivers enter on the south side and provide the main source of inflow to White Iron Lake with the South Kawishiwi River exiting to the north to Farm Lake.  The Winton Hydroelectric Dam, located at the outlet of Garden Lake, sets the water levels for the chain and White Iron Lake.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly ledge rock, boulder, and rubble.  Some of the bays have muck and a fair amount of aquatic vegetation.  \n\nGill nets and trap nets were used in this survey and captured walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, yellow perch, cisco, white sucker and rock bass.    \n\nSince 2006 a regulation has required the release of all walleye from 17 to 26 inches, with only one fish over 26 inches allowed in a 6 fish limit.  The goal was to maintain a good walleye catch rate but also increase the number of fish over 17 inches.  The 2017 gill net catch rate was 9.2 fish/net which was good compared to past surveys on White Iron as well as compared to other walleye lakes in the area.  The catch rate of fish over 17 inches was 2.3 fish/net which was an increase over past surveys before the slot limit was implemented.  Lengths in 2017 ranged from 6 to 27 inches with an average of 14 inches which was better than normal for the lake.  Growth however was quite slow.  This is fairly common for lakes in the area that have such a strong river influence.  On average it takes five years for a walleye to reach 15 inches.  Ages of walleye from this survey ranged from 1 to 20 years old.\n\nSince 2003, a protected slot limit for northern pike has required the release of all fish between 24 and 36 inches, with only one fish over 36 inches allowed in the 3 possession and a 3 fish bag possesion limit. The goal was to increase the abundance of pike greater than 24 inches.  The 2017 northern pike gill net catch rate was 2.5 fish/net which was near average for White Iron.  The average catch rate of fish over 24 inches from this and the four most recent surveys was 0.8 fish/gill net.  This was slightly better than the average catch rate of 0.7 fish/net recorded from surveys prior to the regulation.  Lengths in 2017 ranged from 14 to 40 inches with an average of 23 inches.  The average size of fish has increased from just under 22 inches before the regulation to just over 23 inches in surveys after the regulation.\n\nTwo smallmouth bass were sampled in gill nets both were nice fish at 16.5 and 19 inches.  Smallmouth bass do not always get captured well in nets, although angler catches suggest smallmouth are often caught in the lake.  Past electrofishing surveys sampled smallmouth over 20 inches with an average close to 14 inches.    \n\nSeven black crappie were sampled by trap nets and gill nets.  Catch rates were low but have been erratic in past surveys on White Iron.  Sizes were 5 to 12 inches with an average of 7 inches.  \n\nThe trapnet catch for bluegill was 2.1 fish/net which was tied for the highest on record for White Iron Lake.  Sizes ranged from 3 to 7 inches with an average of just over 4 inches.  One additional larger bluegill at 9 inches was sampled in a gill net.  \n\nThe yellow perch gillnet catch rate was 10.6 fish/net which was better than average for the lake and was the highest catch rate since 1986.  Lengths were similar to past surveys with a range from 5 to 11 inches and a mean of 7 inches.\n\nOther species sampled were cisco, white sucker and rock bass.  Numbers of each species were similar to past surveys.    \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Iron Lake is one of 24 \"sentinel lakes\" located around the state for the Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE) project.  Data collected in 2011 for this project included spring trap netting for all species, fall electrofishing to sample smallmouth and largemouth bass, and an aquatic vegetation survey.  The 2011 aquatic vegetation survey results are presented in a separate report dated 7/01/2011. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Iron Lake is a 3429-acre lake with a maximum depth of 47 feet located two miles east of Ely in northeastern St. Louis County.  White Iron Lake, along with 29 other Tower area lakes, is in lake class 7.    Lakes in this class are typically large in size (mean = 1,807 acres), moderately deep (mean maximum depth = 49 feet), and have high percentage of littoral area (mean = 46%).  The White Iron Lake lakeshore is mostly under private ownership and subject to development.  White Iron has a very large watershed (592,626 acres) draining the majority of the Kawishiwi River watershed (173:1 watershed area to lake area ratio).  Eighty-three percent of the watershed is forested.  The Kawishiwi and Bear Island Rivers flow into the lake with the Kawishiwi River flowing out on the north end.  Average flow of several hundred cubic feet per second gives lake water a short residence time of only 45 days.  The many wetlands in the watershed give the lake a bog stained color and lower water clarity.  There are public accesses on the north and south basins both on the west shore.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker and sunfish species dominated the spring trap-net catch.  Black crappie had the highest abundance but was below what you would typically find in a class 7 lake.  Length of sampled fish ranged from 4.1 to 12.2 inches with a mean of 10.2 inches.  Three year classes were identified with the 2007 year class (age four) comprising 75% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nThere were few bluegill captured but were of quality size.  Lake class 7 lakes are typically not known for having an abundant bluegill fishery.  Bluegill ranged in length from 6.1 to 9.8 inches with a mean of 8.1 inches.  Five year classes were identified.  Other fish sampled in trap nets were rock bass, yellow perch, white sucker, walleye, and northern pike.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were first captured in DNR investigations on White Iron Lake in 1973.  Smallmouth catches in gill nets and trap nets have been low.  In an attempt to obtain a more representative sample, evening electrofishing was conducted in fall 2011.  Fall electrofishing also is the best method to sample young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye.  Only one adult SMB and 15 young-of-the-year SMB were captured.  This compares to 2010 where 34 smallmouth bass were captured of which 26 were young-of-the-year.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2011, a total of 144 young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye were captured.  This compares to 24 YOY walleye captured in 2010.  In 2011, the mean length for YOY walleye was 4.5 inches compared to 6.5 inches in 2011. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Iron Lake is a 3,246 acre lake located three miles southeast of Ely.  There are three accesses, two of which are concrete ramps both on the west side of the lake, the other is a navigable channel on the north side which connects to the other three downstream lakes of the Garden Reservoir chain.  This Ecological Lake Class 7 lake has a maximum depth of 47 feet and brown bog-stained water.\n\nWhite Iron was weakly thermally stratified on August 24, 2020 with a surface temperature of 74 F and a bottom temperature of 65 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 29 feet where the temperature was 67 F.  The South Kawishiwi and Bear Island Rivers enter on the south side and provide the main source of inflow to White Iron Lake with the South Kawishiwi River exiting to the north to Farm Lake.  The Winton Hydroelectric Dam, located at the outlet of Garden Lake, sets the water levels for the Garden Reservoir and influences White Iron Lake. White Iron Lake also has a natural restriction at its outlet that influences water levels. Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly ledge rock, boulder, and rubble with muck and vegetation in the bays.  A fair amount of the shoreline (mostly on the east side of the south basin) is US Forest Service owned but a lot of the remaining lake shore is privately owned.  \n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 17.8 fish/net which was nearly the lowest catch rate on record for the lake.  A yield of 18.6 lbs/net was below average.  Fish species sampled were walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, white sucker, cisco, rock bass, and black crappie.      \n\nSince 2006, a regulation has required the release of all walleye from 17 to 26 inches with only one fish over 26 inches allowed in a 6 fish limit.  The 2020 gill nets sampled 78 walleye for a catch rate of 6.5 fish/net.  This catch rate was slightly below average compared to past surveys on White Iron but better than average compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 7 to nearly 26 inches with an average of just over 12 inches.  The average weight was nearly one pound, which was comparable to other similar lakes.  Walleye growth was slow with the average fish growing to just over 12 inches at four years old.  Ages ranged from 1 to 14 years.\n\nSince 2003, a protected slot limit for northern pike has required the release of all fish between 24 and 36 inches with only one fish over 36 inches allowed in a 3 fish limit.  The 2020 northern pike gill net catch rate of 2.3 fish/net was average compared to past surveys on the lake, but slightly above average compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 13 to nearly 39 inches with an average of just over 21 inches.  Average length of fish from all surveys prior to the regulation was 21.5 inches, compared to an average of nearly 23 inches after implementation of the regulation.\n\nThe yellow perch gillnet catch rate was 4.0 fish/net which was the lowest catch rate on record and average compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths were similar to past surveys with a range from 5 to 11 inches and an average of nearly 8 inches.  \n\nTwenty-two cisco were caught in gill nets for a catch rate of 1.8 fish/net.  This was the second lowest catch rate on record for the lake.  Past cisco catches have ranged from 0 to 34 fish/gill net on White Iron Lake.  Sizes were 6 to nearly 15 inches with an average of just over 9 inches.  Sizes were similar to past samples.  \n\nOther species sampled were white sucker, rock bass, and black crappie.  Numbers and sizes were similar to catches from past surveys.\n\nThree rusty crayfish, which are an invasive species, were sampled in the gill nets for a catch rate of 0.3 crayfish/net.  Although rusty crayfish are common in connecting waters both up and down stream of White Iron Lake, this was the first sample in DNR nets.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Iron Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  White Iron Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class, except that it is larger (3,429 acres) than the lake class average of 1,807 acres.White Iron Lake is large and windswept, and the Kawishiwi and Bear Island rivers flow through it with large volumes of water.  For these reasons it only partially stratifies thermally during most summers, and has good oxygen (more than 2 ppm) to the bottom, where the temperature is in the mid-60's F.  Bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 4 ft; the most common are cattails, arrowhead, sedges, waterlilies, and bladderwort.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1997 of 35 fish/net (29 lb/net) was normal for this lake class and was similar to the average catch of 44 fish/net (30 lb/net) in 14 previous gillnettings in this lake, dating back to 1958.  Lake class 7 is one of the more productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of total fish numbers and biomass in gillnet catches.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1997 of 11 fish/net (8 lb/net) was similar to the average catch of 7 fish/net (7 lb/net) in four previous trapnettings in this lake, dating back to 1958.Fish populations in 1997 were dominated by walleye and northern pike.  The abundance of most species in 1997 was similar to previous net catches, except that fewer cisco and yellow perch were caught in 1997.Walleye numbers in 1997 (8/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the average catch of 9/gillnet in previous nettings in this lake.  Walleye sizes averaged 13\", also similar to previous catches in this lake.  The largest walleye caught in 1997 was was 24\".  Seventy-eight percent of the walleye were ages one through three.  Walleye growth (15\" at age five) was normal for the area.Northern pike numbers in 1997 (5/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the average catch of 3/gillnet in previous nettings in this lake.  Pike sizes averaged 20\", which was similar to the long term average of 21\" for this lake.  The largest pike caught in 1997 was 29\".  Ninety-two percent of pike captured in 1997 were ages one through three.  Pike growth (21\" at age three) was faster than normal for the area.Yellow perch numbers in 1997 (6/gillnet) were normal for this lake class, but were lower than the average catch of 11/gillnet in previous nettings in this lake.  Perch sizes averaged 7\"; the largest was 11\".  Perch growth (8\" at age five) was normal for the area.Cisco numbers in 1997 (9/gillnet) were normal for this lake class, but were lower than the average catch of 14/gillnet in previous nettings in this lake.  Cisco sizes in 1997 averaged 8\"; the largest was 15\".Crappie numbers in 1997 (1/trapnet) were lower than normal for this lake class, but were near the average catch of 2/net for previous nettings in this lake.  Crappie sizes averaged 7\"; the largest was 12\".  Crappie growth (10\" at age five) was faster than normal for the area.Most of the gamefish examined in 1997 were free of diseases or parasites.  However, one-third of the northern pike had Neascus (black spot) in their skin, and half of the smallmouth bass had bass tapeworm larvae in their abdominal cavity.  Neascus and bass tapeworm are common fish parasites that cannot infect humans, are killed by cooking, and are usually removed by filleting.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Iron Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  White Iron Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that is larger (3,429 acres) than the lake class average of 1,807 acres.White Iron Lake ranked as mesotrophic in 2001 according to Carlson's Trophic State Index, with a Secchi water clarity of 1.2 m, chlorophyll_a of 5.7 ppb, and total phosphorus of 17 ppb.  The water in White Iron Lake is tea-colored due to bog stain, not because of sediment or algae growth.White Iron Lake is large and windswept, and the South Kawishiwi and Bear Island Rivers flow through it with average flows of several hundred cubic feet per second.  For this reason, it only partially stratifies thermally during most summers, and retains more than 2 ppm oxygen to the bottom, where the water temperature is in the mid-60's F.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder.  Aquatic plants are sparse with concentrations in the bays, and grow to a depth of 5 ft.Fish sampling in the 2001 fisheries lake survey consisted of 14 trapnet sets in late June and 15 gillnet sets in late August.  Fifteen previous investigations on this lake, dating back to 1958, consisted of 3-15 gillnet sets, most of which were also done in late August.  Trapnets (8-15 sets) were used during five of these previous investigations.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets in 2001 of 10.6 fish/net (7.9 lb/net) was similar to the median catch of 9.5 fish/net (7.8 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 2001 of 30.2 fish/net (21.6 lb/net) was in the second quartile for this lake class and was lower than the median catch of 35.1 fish/net (26.8 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Slightly fewer cisco, walleye, and white sucker were caught in 2001.  Lake Class 7 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.Fish populations in 2001 were dominated by walleye, followed by northern pike, cisco, white sucker, and yellow perch.Walleye numbers in 2001 (6.6/gillnet) were near the median for this lake class and were slightly lower than the median catch of 7.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2001 averaged 12.3\" (0.8 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was slightly smaller than the average size of 12.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye in 2001 was 26.9\" (6.7 lb).   Walleye captured in 2001 were from 11 year classes, but most (78 percent) were ages 2-4.  Walleye growth was slower than normal by area standards.Northern pike numbers in 2001 (2.1/gillnet) were near the median for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 2.4/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2001 averaged 21.9\" (2.5 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was near the average size of 21.5\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2001 (caught in a trapnet) was 29.3\".  Pike scales were difficult to read, but pike growth appeared to be normal by area standards.Cisco numbers in 2001 (9.2/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 11.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes in 2001 averaged 8.3\" (0.2 lb), which was at the first quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 9.4\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest cisco in 2001 was 16.8\".White sucker numbers in 2001 (2.8/gillnet) were at the first quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 3.6/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2001 averaged 17.0\" (2.1 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 15.7\" in all investigations on this lake.Yellow perch numbers in 2001 (8.2/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 8.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2001 averaged 7.5\" (0.2 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 7.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch in 2001 was 10.9\".Some good-sized black crappie (11\") and smallmouth bass (16\") were also captured during the 2001 survey.  Trapnet and gillnet catches probably underrepresent the number of smallmouth bass present in this lake.Neascus was found on about half of the northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch examined in 2001.  Many yellow perch also had yellow grub, and many cisco had trianophorus.  All of these parasites are native to the area and are commonly observed.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Iron Lake, located 5 miles east of Ely in northeastern St. Louis and western Lake Counties, is in a group of several lakes in the Kawishiwi River system often referred to as the White Iron Chain of Lakes (WICOL).  The WICOL system includes Farm, South Farm, and Garden lakes.  Hydroelectric dams between Garden Lake and Fall Lake and between Birch Lake and White Iron Lake control flow and water levels in the WICOL reservoir system.  White Iron has a large (592,626 acres) heavily forested watershed that drains the majority of the South Kawishiwi River watershed.  Numerous wetlands in the watershed are responsible for the stained color and limited water clarity compared to other lakes in the region.  The water column tends to be well mixed and dissolved oxygen levels have remained above 2 ppm in depths to 30 feet.  The lake is accessed via two separate public concrete ramps on the west side of the lake and navigable channel connecting the north end of the lake to Farm Lake.  Rocky substrates and low water clarity limit aquatic plant growth in the lake, however plants can be found in high density in some of the shallow bays. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Iron Lake was selected as one of 25 Sentinel Lakes in Minnesota's Long-term Monitoring Program (i.e., Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment [SLICE]).  It represents lakes of the Canadian Shield ecoregion in northeastern Minnesota.  As a tier 2 Sentinel Lake, data is being collected on water characteristics, aquatic plants, fish populations, and other potential biological indicators to identify and understand changing lake conditions.  In addition to standard fish population assessments, sampling includes spring electrofishing targeting bass, index of biotic integrity (IBI) surveys assessing the nearshore fish community, and aquatic vegetation surveys.  Additional surveys will increase knowledge of fish species that are not effectively sampled using the standard gear and to assess habitat.  Furthermore, supplemental age and growth information will be collected for specific indicator species like Yellow Perch.  Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass hatch dates and first year growth rates are also being examined as part of a larger study in Sentinel Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Iron Lake maintains naturally reproducing populations of several important game fish species including Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Smallmouth Bass.  Special regulations for Walleye and Northern Pike are in effect for the WICOL system.  Since 2003, a protected slot limit for northern pike requires releasing all fish between 24 and 36 inches, with only one fish over 36 inches allowed in possession in the 3 fish bag limit.  The regulation is designed to increase the proportion of Northern Pike greater than 24 inches.  Since 2006, a regulation has required the release of all Walleye from 17 to 26 inches, with only one fish over 26 inches allowed in the 6 fish possession limit.  The goal is to maintain walleye numbers while increasing the proportion over 17 inches.  The fish community of White Iron is diverse with substantial populations of cold, cool, and warm water species.  No stocking of any species is currently done in White Iron Lake; however, the adjacent Garden Lake Reservoir has been stocked with Walleye fingerlings in odd years since 1991.    A total of 10 different fish species were sampled using gill nets and trap nets in 2014: Black Crappie, Bluegill, Cisco (Tullibee), Northern Pike, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Tiger Muskellunge, Walleye, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  Also, non-native rusty crayfish were captured in 2014 after being first discovered in WICOL in 2003 and confirmed in White Iron Lake in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of 4.7 Walleye/gill net was about average for Tower Area lakes, but slightly lower than recent surveys on White Iron Lake.  Most Walleye in the recent sample were less than 13 inches and age-3 or less indicating consistent natural reproduction and angling opportunities for fish under the protected slot in the near future.  Walleye on White Iron Lake grow very slowly compared other lakes in the Tower Area.   On average, it takes about six years for a Walleye to reach 17 inches and enter into the protected slot. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a low density population of quality-sized Northern Pike that anglers will enjoy catching.  In 2014, DNR personnel sampled pike up to 43 inches.  The larger Northern Pike take many years to attain this size and anglers should consider practicing selective harvest by releasing them and targeting fish below the protected 24 to 36 inches slot limit for harvest.  The average length of Northern Pike sampled in gill nets in 2014 was less than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAngling opportunities for Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch are also present. Quality to trophy sized Smallmouth Bass are present with fish between 17 and 21 inches sampled.  Black Crappie up to 12.6 inches were also present.  Plus, several Yellow Perch from 8 to 10 inches were caught.  Additionally, 1 tiger muskellunge was captured in 2014 indicating an extremely low population persists in WICOL despite not being stocked in over 30 years. <br> \n</p>",
