                "narrative": "<p>Greer Lake is a 353-acre lake located in north-central Crow Wing County.  It's primarily managed as a bass-panfish lake.  When looking at the lake, it is easy to see why bass can do well with a variety of suitable habitat such as abundant lily pads, nice weedlines, and quite a bit of undeveloped shoreline.  Although standard survey nets usually don't sample largemouth bass very efficiently, the catch rate of 1.0/gill net was above average compared to lakes that have similar characteristics to Greer.  Anglers would be pleased by the average size which is 15.2\" and there were 3 largemouth bass that were bigger than 19\".  Nearly 67% of the bass were 12\" or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers may also want to pursue bluegill and black crappie.  The bluegill catch rate was above average at 13.8/trap net.  The average size was 5.7\", but there were fish up to 8\" measured.  A little over 20% were 7\" or larger.  The black crappie catch rate was 4.0/gill net, which is about average for this type of lake.  The average size was 7.0\" with just over 33% that were 8\" or larger.  The largest fish sampled was 11.0\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike provide another option for fisherman.  The northern pike catch rate was 6.3/gill net, which is close to average.  The average size of these fish was 20.6\" with 16% measuring 24\" or larger.  The largest northern pike sampled was 30.5\". <br> \n <br> \nThough somewhat untraditional, anglers may want to pursue the abundant population of yellow bullheads in Greer.  The catch rate of 29.8/gill net was well above average for lakes of similar characteristics.  The average size of these fish was 10.4\". <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, yellow perch, and various minnow species.   <br> \nFor anglers looking to do some camping as well as fishing there is a state forest campground on Greer Lake.  It's located on the southeast side of the lake, near the access.      <br> \n</p>",
