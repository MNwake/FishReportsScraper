                "narrative": "<p>East Goose Lake is primarily managed for walleye.  Walleye numbers have increased since our last survey in 1991 and are currently considered a normal population.  Lengths from fish sampled in our gillnets ranged from 9 to 22 inches with an average length of approximately 14 ? inches.  The average weight from walleye collected in our gillnets was about 1 ? lbs.  A fair number of larger walleye over 20 inches is expected for the 1996 fishing season.       East Goose Lake also has a high population of yellow perch compared to similar lakes in our area.  Yellow perch lengths sampled in our gillnets ranged from 5 ? to 12 inches with an average length of 8 inches.  Although the perch population is high, the average weight of yellow perch is also relatively high at 1/3 lb.  Yellow perch were last stocked in 1982.  A strong year class produced in 1992 should provide anglers with good catches of yellow perch over 10 inches in length.       The black bullhead population is relatively low in abundance.  The average length of bullheads collected in trapnets was 9 inches with an average weight of approximately ? lb.  Of interest, a fair number of carp are found in East Goose Lake.       Other species including largemouth bass, green sunfish, and white sucker are also found in Goose Lake but at very low abundances.  </p>",

Goose is a typical prairie pothole basin with minimal shoreline development and a maximum depth of 9 feet.  Goose Lake has is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) of Walleye were stocked in 2019.  To evaluate stocking success, a daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on Goose Lake on September 19, 2019 to capture young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 LMS Walleye fry stocking appeared to be unsuccessful, as no YOY Walleye were sampled.  Age-1 Walleye (2018 year class) were sampled at a rate of 90.0 per hour indicating that the 2018 stocking of LMS fry was successful (stocking success was not evaluated during the fall of 2018).  Yearling Walleye ranged from 9.1 to 11.1 inches and averaged 10.2 inches, indicating that they are growing fast.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Goose, near the town of Lynd, is a 139 acre lake located in western Lyon County.  It is a typical prairie pothole basin with minimal shoreline development and a maximum depth of 9 feet.  There is a MNDNR owned public access on the East shore with a concrete plank boat ramp and handicapped accessible dock.  The lake has not had a significant history of winterkills, as it has only been opened to \"liberalized\" fishing three times from 1952 to 1986.  A winter aeration system was installed on the Northeast side in 1986, and only one minor winterkill occurred since in 2006-07.  Because Goose Lake is relatively close to Marshall, this small lake has a history of heavy angling pressure at times (up to .3 boats per acre).  To help \"spread\" out the angling pressure and harvest of walleyes a more frequent (3 of 4 years in a row), but lower density (300 per acre), fry stocking regime has been adapted with great success.  Goose is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 20, 2015 using 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets to evaluate fish abundance and species presence.  This lake would be considered a \"simple\" system dominated by only four species, Black Crappie, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nEven though walleye catch rates are at a historical low for this lake (2.3 per gill net), the majority of the fish sampled were 15 to 24 inches long.  In comparison to prior surveys the catch rate for walleye has ranged from 5 to 57 per gill net with a long term average of 22 per set.  Goose was stocked with \"Lower Mississippi\" strain (Lake Sarah) fry in the spring of 2015.  The outlook for future numbers of walleye appears excellent based on fall electrofishing for these young of the year fish, with 450 per hour sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch populations have steadily declined since the 1991 survey.  The catch rate for perch was 0.0 for both gill nets and trap nets.  This decline may have been caused by predation from previously high walleye populations, or competition for forage from the current abundant black crappie numbers.  To help re-establish this managed species it will be necessary to stock pre-spawn adults in the spring of 2016. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers remain very even though they have not been stocked by the DNR since 1988 and are not a managed species.  The trap net catch rate of 33.8 per net was more than double the long term average for this lake of 14.5 per net.  At least three year classes are present with some 4-5 inchers, many 6-8.5 inchers, and several 9.5-13 inchers.  These fish should provide excellent crappie angling action for the future. <br> \n <br> \nThe common carp abundance was the highest it's ever been with a catch rate of 36.7 per gill net.  This lake should be kept in mind as a possible site to do some \"bowfishing\" for these carp.  It will also be recommended to improve water quality and reduce carp biomass by commercial seining. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Goose Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch.  East Goose Lake is one of the more interesting lakes in the area because of substantial fishing pressure it receives.  In the past, the reason for the high pressure was probably due to the large year classes of walleye moving through the population.  To produce a more consistent fishery rather than the \"boom or bust\" walleye fishery of the past, the stocking regime was changed to fry stocking three out every four years at a rate of 300/littoral acre.   The average walleye gill net catch was 57.33 fish/net set which was more than twice the upper range for this lake class.  The average walleye catch rate in gill nets was the highest that has ever been recorded on Goose Lake.  The next highest catch rate was recorded in 1986 when an average catch rate of 25.67 fish/net set was recorded.  Total lengths of walleye in gill nets ranged between 11.2 and 22.6 inches, with an average of 15.3.  Six year classes of walleye were recorded from gill nets with the 1997 year class (34.3 %) being most numerous.  Shoreline seining sampled seven young of the year walleye which indicated some fry survival and/or natural reproduction.  Fall electrofishing conducted in 1998 recorded 6.0 fish/hour which suggests Goose has had walleye natural reproduction in the past.  It appears fishing for walleye in the next few years should be above average compared to other area lakes.The average yellow perch gill net catch was 21.00 fish/net set which was nearing the upper range for this lake class.  This was the lowest catch rate of yellow perch ever sampled in East Goose Lake other than when they were absent from sampling in 1986.  These lower catch rates when compared to historical values may be a secondary effect of a large walleye population. Although this was the lowest number of yellow perch sampled per gill net, the catch rate was within the expected range for this type of lake.  On the upside of things, the size of yellow perch present in the population would be appealing to most anglers.  Yellow perch total lengths ranged between 8.3 and 11.9 inches, with an averageof 10.0.  Five year classes of yellow perch were sampled from gill nets with the 1994 and 1995 year classes being most numerous.  Shoreline seining found one young of the year yellow perch which indicates some natural reproduction.  Fishing for yellow perch in East Goose should be enjoyable.Black crappie showed up in the trap nets in 1999, which indicates the population has become established.  The average black crappie trap net catch was 0.43 fish/net set which was lower than expected for this type of lake.  This was the first time black crappie were sampled in trap nets in the history of surveys conducted on East Goose Lake.  Black crappie were last stocked in East Goose Lake in 1988.  Total lengths of black crappie ranged between 10.2 and 11.9 inches, with an average of 10.7.  The crappie sampled were from only one year class (1995).  The average black bullhead gill net catch was 115.67 fish/net set which was close to the upper range for this lake class.  Historically East Goose Lake tends to support above average catches of black bullhead (37.00 to 162.33 fish/net set).  Total lengths of black bullhead ranged between 4.8 and 10.6 inches, with an average of 8.0.  The abundance of common carp appears to have increased in 1999.  The average common carp trap net catch was 13.43 fish/net set which was more than twice the upper range for this lake class.  Historically common carp catch rates have not been as high as this year.  Total lengths of common carp ranged between 11.1 and 27.7 inches, with an average of 15.6.  There are good numbers of carp in Goose Lake, including some big ones to make fishing interesting.         To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of East Goose Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Goose, near the town of Lynd, is a 139-acre lake located in Lyon County.  East Goose has a maximum depth of 9 feet and has had an aeration system since 1986.  It has not had a significant history of winterkills, as it has been opened to liberalized fishing only 3 times from 1952 to 1986.  Because Goose Lake is relatively close to Marshall, this small lake has a history of heavy angling pressure (up to 3 boats per acre).  One of the long-range goals was to produce more consistent year classes of fish to \"spread\" out the angling and harvest pressure.  This goal resulted in a more frequent, but lower density, fry stocking regime.  Goose is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 23, 2007 using 2 gill nets and 9 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite a pocket winterkill during the winter of 2006-2007, the abundance of walleye was impressive in the survey assessment in 2007.  Catch rates have been higher only once (1999) based on the historical survey data.  Total lengths ranged from 7 to 21 inches with an average of  just short of 15 inches.  Although the \"plumpness\" of fish could have been better, growth rates of walleye were excellent as an average length Age 2 walleye was 15.5 inches and an Age 3 was 17.3 inches.  In the last 5-10 years the Windom office has been generally reluctant to open a lake to liberalized fishing because a \"complete\" winterkill is rare.  This small lake is definitely a diamond in the rough and should be considered for fishing walleyes. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were within the expected range.  The catch rate was 12.5/gill net set and over the years has varied from 3.3 to 93.0/set.  Total lengths ranged from 6.1 to 12.4 inches with an average of 8.8 inches.  Although their abundance has been higher, decent numbers of \"keepers\" could be caught.  If the perch are not biting, target the black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate has never been higher.  Total lengths ranged from 4.3 to 13.2 inches with a mean of 6.0 inches.  Despite the abundance of smaller fish, targeting black crappies could provide some good action.  In a few years, there could be some good \"keepers\". <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance was within the expected range.  The black bullhead catch rate was 62/gill net set and historically has varied from 35 to 162.0/gill net set.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite a pocket winterkill, common carp abundance was higher than the normal range (1.0 to 13.8/set).  Total lengths ranged from 8.7 to 25.6 inches with a mean of 14.8 inches.  Based on this data, this would suggest the winterkill was localized.  Other species sampled were largemouth bass and orangespotted sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Ryan Doorenbos   <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Goose, near the town of Lynd, is a 139-acre lake located in Lyon County.  East Goose has a maximum depth of 9 feet and has had an aeration system since 1986.  It has not had a significant history of winterkills, as it has only been opened to liberalized fishing 3 times from 1952 to 1986.  Because Goose Lake is relatively close to Marshall, this small lake has a history of heavy angling pressure (up to .3 boats per acre).  One of the long-range goals was to produce more consistent year classes of fish to \"spread\" out the angling and harvest pressure.  This goal resulted in a more frequent, but lower density, fry stocking regime.  Goose is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 25, 2011 using 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite a lower catch rate of walleye than the 2007 survey (16 compared to 44 per gill net), the walleye population in Goose remains respectable.  Although age-1, age-2, and age-3 fish dominate the catch, there were a few age-5, age-7, and age-8 fish present. Total lengths sampled in 2011 ranged from 8.5 to 27.0 inches with an average of 15.5 inches. Growth rates currently are somewhat below expected with an average length at age-1 of 10.2 inches, age2 of 12.0 inches, and age-3 of 14.2 inches.  This slow growth may be attributed to the lack of forage available with low bullhead abundance, few yellow perch, and possible competition with black crappie.  The current walleye stocking regime, along with some natural reproduction, appears to be maintaining a balanced population.  It also has greatly enhanced angling opportunity and reduced periods of extreme harvest pressure.  This small prairie pothole basin continues to be an excellent choice for walleye anglers from the Marshall area. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were within the expected range for this type of lake.  The catch rate was 7.3 per gill net set and over the years has varied from 3.3 to 93.0 per set.  Total lengths ranged from 5.5 to 10.5 inches with an average of 7.8 inches.  Although their abundance has been higher in past surveys, a few \"keepers\" could be caught.  If the perch are not biting, target the black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nEast Goose is not specifically managed for crappie, but currently has an excellent population of this species.  They first appeared in the 1999 survey and their numbers \"exploded\" in 2007 from natural reproduction.  The trap net catch index was half of the 2007 index for black crappies, and is represented by two strong year classes.  Total lengths ranged from 3.0 to 12.0 inches with an average of 7.0 inches.  The overall condition factor showed these fish were also quite \"stout\" and foraging successfully.  With the presence of 2 strong year classes (8.5 to 12 inch fish, and 4.5 to 6 inch fish), black crappies should provide some angling action for a few years. <br> \n\t\t\t <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance was on the low end of the expected range.  The black bullhead catch rate was 31 per gill net set and historically has varied from 35 to 162.0 per gill net set.  Currently the bullheads are dominated by small fish in the 4.5 to 6 inch range which anglers might not target.  <br> \n <br> \nDespite a partial winterkill in 2006-07, common carp abundance was the highest ever recorded on Goose.  Total lengths ranged from 6.0 to 22.0 inches with an average of 11.25 inches.  Based on this data, this would suggest the winterkill was localized.  East Goose should be kept in mind as a possible future site to do some \"bowfishing\". The only other species sampled were white crappie. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Chuck \"Shelby\" Obler <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Goose Lake is a 139-acre lake located in Lyon County, six miles northwest of the Town of Russell.  Goose is a typical prairie pothole basin with minimal shoreline development and a maximum depth of 9 feet.  Like most pothole prairie lakes, Goose Lake's fish community is very simplistic and not diverse but it has very nice growth rates of fish.  Goose Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  Walleye fry are stocked 3 of 4 years at 300 per littoral acre (2024, 2026, 2027, and 2028 etc.).  Goose Lake was surveyed the week of July 17, 2023 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and nine trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nSince 1986, catch rates of Walleye have ranged from 2.3 per gill net in 2015 to 57.3 per gill net in 1999 and have averaged 19.7 per gill net.  The 2023 catch rate was 10.0 per gill net, a slight decrease from the 2019 catch rate of 13.5 per gill net, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Walleye ranged in length from 7.4 to 26.5 inches and averaged 14.6 inches.  Growth of Walleye was fast as indicated by an average length at capture at age-2 of 13.5 inches.  Five year classes of Walleye were sampled (2015, 2018, 2020, 2021, and 2022) of which three years corresponded to fry stocking.  Two year classes (2020 and 2021) were unstocked and are likely from natural reproduction, comprising 63 percent of the aged Walleye.  Since 2015, the Lower Mississippi Strain of Walleye (LMS) have been stocked in Goose Lake. This strain originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Sporadic natural reproduction occurs in Goose Lake (like several other Windom area lakes), thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival and persistent advantages and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes.  Despite a moderate gill net catch rate there were reports of excellent fishing in the spring of 2023.  Walleye fry will be stocked in the spring of 2024and then an \"off\" year will happen in 2025 to assess natural reproduction in Goose Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 Yellow Perch catch rate was 5.0 per gill net, a slight decrease from 8.0 per gill net in 2019 and below the long-term average of 19.7 per gill net since 1986.  Despite being the third lowest catch since 1986, the catch rate is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Prior to 2003, catch rates from four surveys averaged 41.0 per gill net.  Post 2003, Yellow Perch catch rates have averaged 6.0 per gill net across six surveys.  The decrease in average gill net catch rate appears to correspond with a large increase in Black Crappie trap net catch rates.  Prior to 2003 Black Crappie were not sampled in lake surveys.  Post 2003, the average Black Crappie catch rate was 31.6 per trap net, suggesting that Black Crappie are outcompeting Yellow Perch.  The 2023 Black Crappie catch rate decreased to 5.0 per trap net, perhaps allowing the Yellow Perch population to recover.  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 5.7 to 12.4 inches and averaged 7.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate decreased from 116.5 per gill net in 2019 to 16.0 per gill net in 2023, but still exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.4 to 13.8 per gill net).  Black Crappie were rare in Goose Lake until 2007, and have had cyclical abundance since, with peak catches occurring about every 10 or 11 years.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 5.2 to 13.0 inches and averaged 9.9 inches.  Although Black Crappie are not managed in Goose Lake, they do maintain a robust population.  Goose Lake could be a destination for \"slab anglers\" as sixty seven percent of the Black Crappie sampled were 10.7 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance continued to be low with catch rates of 1.3 per trap net and 0.5 per gill net.  The majority of the Black Bullhead sampled were 12.2 inches or larger.  Common Carp abundance in Goose Lake decreased considerably from 25.5 per gill net in 2019 to 6.0 per gill net in 2023, and from 8.3 per trap net in 2019 to 0.6 per trap net in 2023.  Other species sampled included Hybrid Sunfish and Orangespotted Sunfish.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Goose Lake is a 139-acre, class 43 lake, located in Lyon County.  Goose is a typical prairie pothole basin with minimal shoreline development and a maximum depth of 9.0 feet.  Goose Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  Goose Lake is part of an effort to introduce a unique strain of walleye to area lakes.  The strain of Walleye (Lower Mississippi Strain; LMS) is the same strain that is found in Lake Sarah, which has one of the only Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction. A recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  Further genetic testing has shown that this strain of Walleye has persisted in some other southern Minnesota lakes despite extensive stocking of other MN strains of Walleye.  Goose Lake was stocked with the LMS Walleye fry in the spring of 2015 and 2016 in an effort to get this strain established in additional waterbodies.  Goose Lake was selected because it has supported a good walleye population, has habitat that is conducive to Walleye reproduction, and has historically had natural reproduction.  A Walleye fry stocking evaluation using night electrofishing was conducted on October 5, 2016 to determine if the 2016 fry stocking was successful. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 LMS Walleye fry stocking was very successful, as they were captured at a rate of 447.8 per hour, which is an extremely high catch rate.  In 2016, the young-of-the-year catch rate was 4.0 per hour, which is low, but expected because of the abundant year class produced in 2015.  The age-1 Walleye (2015 year class) were captured at a rate of 129.3 per hour in 2016, indicating that they survived the winter.  The 2015 year class is likely suppressing the 2016 year class. Age-0 Walleye ranged in length from 7.5 to 8.1 inches and averaged 7.8 inches. Age-1 Walleye ranged in length from 8.5 to 11.4 inches and averaged 10.0 inches.  If a surplus of LMS Walleye fry exists in future years, additional stocking will be considered for Goose Lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Goose is a 139 acre lake located nine miles east of Lynd in Lyon County.  The lake has 1.7 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of nine feet.  East Goose is managed for walleye as the primary species while yellow perch are managed secondarily.  The lake is presently stocked three out of four years with walleye fry.  The pump and baffle aeration system was replaced with Aero II's in 2002 to help reduce the risk of winterkill.The walleye population is typical of lakes similar to East Goose.  Lengths of walleye caught in our nets ranged from 9.2 to 25.8 inches with an average length of 12.1 inches.  Four different ages of walleye were observed during the survey but the majority of the fish were age 2 and age 3 and were in the nine to 12 inch range.  We have heard reports of good walleye fishing during the winter of 2002-2003.The yellow perch population is similar to other lakes like East Goose.  The population is in what would be considered a normal range of abundance but at the low end of that range.  Length of yellow perch caught in our nets ranged from 7.5 to 10.6 inches and averaged 8.9 inches.The black crappie population is also similar to other lakes like East Goose.  The catch rate was 3.1 in 2003 compared to 0.4 in 1999 and 0.0 in 1995.  Lengths of black crappie caught in our nets ranged from 4.6 to 12.0 inches and averaged 8.8 inches.  Four different ages were observed during the survey which indicates there is good natural reproduction of black crappie.Black bullhead numbers were down considerably from 1999 when the catch rate was 248.4.  The catch rate was 23.9 in 2003.  Lengths of black bullhead ranged from 5.3 to 11.8 inches and averaged 9.1 inches.Other species of fish sampled during the survey included largemouth bass, common carp, hybrid sunfish, and white sucker.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of East Goose Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Goose Lake is a 139-acre lake located in Lyon County, six miles northwest of the Town of Russell.  Goose is a typical prairie pothole basin with minimal shoreline development and a maximum depth of 9 feet.  Goose Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  Walleye fry are stocked 3 of 4 years at 300 per littoral acre (2020, 2022, 2023, and 2024 etc.).  In the mid-1990s, Goose Lake stocking regime for walleye was modified to stock more frequently but at lower density.  One of the driving reasons behind the strategy was due to the fishing pressure.  Historically there were times when Goose Lake had high levels of angling pressure and harvest levels were perceived to be high.  Goose Lake was surveyed the week of July 22, 2019 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Walleye in Goose Lake have varied from 2.3 per gill net in 2015 to 57.3 per gill net in 1999 and have averaged 20.8 per gill net since 1986.  The 2019 Walleye catch rate was 13.5 per gill net, an increase from the 2015 catch rate of 2.3 per gill net, and greater than expected catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net).  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 7.3 to 25.8 inches and averaged 15.3 inches.  Growth of Walleye was fast as indicated by a mean length at age-2 of 13.6 inches.  Five year classes of walleye were sampled (2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018) all of which corresponded to stocking events except the 2017 year class, which accounted for 32 percent (N=8) of aged Walleye.  Since 2015, the Lower Mississippi Strain of Walleye (LMS) have been stocked in Goose Lake. This strain originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Sporadic natural reproduction occurs in Goose Lake, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates have ranged from 0.0 per gill net in 2015 to 93.0 per gill net in 1991, and averaged 24.0 per gill net since 1986.  In 2019, the Yellow Perch catch rate was 8.0 per gill net, which is an increase from the 2015 catch rate of 0.0 per gill net and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net).  Total lengths of Yellow Perch from both gears ranged from 5.5 to 10.1 inches and averaged 7.5 inches.  Although abundance of Yellow Perch in Goose Lake is not high, there should be sufficient numbers of brood fish present for natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2007, Black Crappie were rare in Goose Lake.  Trap net and gill net catch rates were near 0.0 per net dating back to the start of surveys in 1986.  Since 2007, Black Crappie have been thriving in Goose Lake, with gill net catch rates ranging from 27.3 per gill net in 2015 to 116.5 per gill net in 2019, and trap net catch rates ranging from 23.2 per trap net in 2011 to 53.3 per trap net in 2019.  All gill net and trap net catch rates since 2007 have exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes throughout Minnesota.  Lengths of Black Crappie from both gears ranged from 4.5 to 13.2 inches and averaged 8.2 inches.  Nearly 30 percent of sampled Black Crappie were larger than 10.0 inches in length.  Goose Lake's Black Crappie population is one of the best in the area and should provide anglers with an excellent angling opportunity.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance was low in 2019 at 2.6 per trap net.  Common Carp abundance was high at 25.5 per gill net; however, that is normal for Goose Lake, as catch rates have exceeded 18.5 per gill net in 5 of the last 6 surveys dating back to 1999.  Other species sampled included Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, and Orangespotted Sunfish. <br> \n</p>",
