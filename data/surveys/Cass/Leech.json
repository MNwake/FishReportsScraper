                "narrative": "<p>WALLEYE:  THE 1996 CATCH OF WALLEYE PER EXPERIMENTAL GILLNET LIFT WAS 9.5.  THIS CATCH WAS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE 1983-96 AVERAGE (7.6/LIFT) AND THE THIRD HIGHEST SINCE ANNUAL SAMPLING BEGAN (1983).  THE 1994 AND 1995 WALLEYE YEAR CLASSES COMPRISED A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF SAMPLED WALLEYE CAUSING CATCH RATES TO INCREASE AND AVERAGE LENGTH AND WEIGHT TO DECLINE (13.1 INCHES AND 0.9 POUNDS).  PRELIMINARY FINDINGS INDICATE THE 1996 YEAR CLASS MAY ALSO BE STRONG.  IF THIS IS THE CASE, UPON RECRUITMENT TO THE GILLNET, NEAR RECORD GILLNET CATCH RATES CAN BE EXPECTED.  THE LOW CATCH RATES AND HIGH AVERGE LENGTH AND WEIGHT IN 1993 (4.6/LIFT; 15.6 INCHES AND 1.5 POUNDS) AND 1994 (4.9/LIFT; 16.7 INCHES AND 1.8 POUNDS) WAS A RESULT OF POOR REPRODUCTION AND/OR RECRUITMENT OF THE 1989, 1990, 1992 AND 1993 YEAR CLASSES.  IN 1989 AND 1990, REPRODUCTION WAS SUPPRESSED BY THE EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG 1988 YEAR CLASS.  AS A RESULT OF RECORD COLD SUMMERS, POOR PRODUCTION OF FORAGE CAUSED THE 1992 AND 1993 WALLEYE YEARS CLASSES TO FAIL.LEECH LAKE ANGLERS AND RESORT OWNERS REPORTED EXCELLENT WALLEYE ANGLING, ESPECIALLY FOR LARGE WALLEYE, DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE 1996 OPEN WATER SEASON.  AS IN 1995, ANGLERS WERE DELIGHTED WITH THE AVERAGE SIZE OF WALLEYE.  HOWEVER, MANY EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT FEW SMALL WALLEYE BEING CAUGHT.  THIS CONCERN QUICKLY DISAPPEARED IN EARLY JULY WHEN THE 1994 WALLEYE YEAR CLASS BECAME LARGE ENOUGH TO BE CAUGHT BY ANGLERS.  NEAR THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST THESE WALLEYE BEGAN ATTAINING SIZES ACCEPTABLE TO THE AVERAGE ANGLER (12-14 INCHES) AND LIMITS OF WALLEYE BECAME COMMON THROUGH FREEZE-UP.FOR 1997, ANGLERS SHOULD EXPECT GOOD WALLEYE ACTION.  THE 1994 YEAR CLASS IS ACCEPTABLE TO MOST ANGLERS AND IS PRESENT IN LARGE NUMBERS.  NEAR MID-AUGUST, THE STRONG 1995 YEAR CLASS WILL ALSO BEGIN TO ATTAIN SIZES ACCEPTABLE TO ANGLERS.  THESE TWO YEAR CLASSES COUPLED WITH STILL ABUNDANT 1985, 1988 AND 1991 YEAR-CLASSES WILL PROVIDE AMPLE WALLEYE ANGLING OPPORTUNITIES ON LEECH LAKE.  THESE OPPORTUNITIES WILL INCLUDE BOTH QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF WALLEYE.NORTHERN PIKE:  THE 1996 CATCH OF NORTHERN PIKE PER EXPERIMENTAL GILLNET SET WAS 4.8, SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE 1983-1996 AVERAGE (4.7 NORTHERN PIKE PER SET).  SAMPLED NORTHERN PIKE AVERAGED 20.8 INCHES AND 2.3 POUNDS.  THIS AVERAGE DECLINED CONSIDERABLY FROM THE 1995 SAMPLING WHICH WAS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED (22.8 INCHES AND 3.1 POUNDS).  THE OVERALL AVERAGE LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF NORTHERN PIKE, SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE LARGE LAKE MONITORING PROGRAM (1983), IS 21.1 INCHES AND 2.3 POUNDS.  OF THE 174 NORTHERN PIKE SAMPLED IN 1996, 57 PERCENT WERE FEMALE ND 43 PERCENT WERE MALE.  ANGLING FOR NORTHERN PIKE WAS AGAIN REPORTED TO BE GOOD THIS PAST YEAR. DURING THE MUSKY INC. INTERNATIONAL MUSKELLUNGE TOURNAMENT, WHICH WAS HELD IN EARLY SEPTEMBER, MORE NORTHERN PIKE LARGER THAN 36 INCHES WERE REPORTED FROM LEECH LAKE THAN ALL OTHER LAKES INCLUDED IN THE TOURNAMENT.YELLOW PERCH:  THE 1996 CATCH OF YELLOW PERCH PER EXPERIMENTAL GILL NET SET WAS 25.6.  THIS CATCH IS THE FOURTH HIGHEST EVER RECORDED.  THE LOWEST CATCH OCCURRED IN 1986 (13.2 YELLOW PERCH PER SET) AND THE HIGHEST IN 1995 (37.7 YELLOW PERCH PER SET).  THE 1996 AVERAGE LENGTH OF SAMPLED YELLOW PERCH WAS 7.7 INCHES.  THIS AVERAGE HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE SINCE 1992 WHEN THE STRONG 1989 YEAR CLASS BEGAN TO BE RECRUITED TO THE GILLNET.  AS IN MOST PREVIOUS SAMPLING, THE AVERAGE WEIGHT OF SAMPLED YELLOW PERCH WAS 0.2 POUNDS.  NO YEAR HAS DEVIATED MORE THAN 0.1 POUNDS FROM THIS AVERAGE.  SEX WAS DETERMINED FOR 845 OF THE 923 YELLOW PERCH SAMPLED.  OF THOSE, 65 PERCENT WERE FEMALES AND 35 PERCENT WERE MALES.  FEMALE YELLOW PERCH HAVE CONSISTENTLY OUTNUMBERED MALES BY APPROXIMATELY 2:1.  THIS ANOMALY IS AN EFFECT OF GILL NET SELECTIVITY FOR FEMALE YELLOW PERCH RATHER THAN A DESCRIPTION OF THE SEX DISTRIBUTION OF YELLOW PERCH IN LEECH LAKE.ANGLERS ENJOYED GOOD SUCCESS WHILE ANGLING FOR YELLOW PERCH THIS PAST YEAR.  BEST SUCCESS OCCURRED FROM OPENING OF FISHING TO MID-JUNE AND FROM MID-AUGUST TO NEAR FREEZE-UP.  THE EARLY SEASON SUCCESS COULD BE PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE LATE ICE-OUT (MAY 11) WHICH DELAYED SPAWNING UNTIL AFTER OPENING DAY OF FISHING WHEN MORE ANGLERS ARE ON THE WATER.  JUST BEFORE AND AFTER SPAWNING, YELLOW PERCH ARE OFTEN READILY CAUGHT BY ANGLERS.  LOCAL CONSERVATION OFFICERS REPORTED GOOD YELLOW PERCH SUCCESS FROM MID-AUGUST TO NEAR FREEZE-UP.CISCO:  THE 1996 CATCH OF CISCO PER EXPERIMENTAL GILL NET SET WAS 4.7.  THIS CATCH IS 3.3 FISH LOWER THAN THE 1983-96 AVERAGE (8.0 CISCO PER SET) BUT CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE LOWEST CATCH EVER RECORDED (1989; 2.1 PER SET).  THE HIGHEST CATCH PER SET OCCURRED IN 1987 (18.5 PER NET).  GILLENT CATCH RATES FOR CISCO DISPLAY CONSIDERABLE VARIABILITY FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND DO NOT APPEAR TO BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF ABUNDANCE.  THE AVERAGE LENGTH AND WEIGHT (11.8 INCHES AND 0.6 POUNDS) OF CISCO SAMPLED DURING 1996 WERE SIMILAR TO OVERALL AVERAGES (10.7 INCHES AND 0.6 POUNDS).  THE LARGEST DEVIATIONS FROM THESE OVERALL AVERAGES OCCURRED IN 1984 (13.4 INCHES AND 1.0 POUNDS) AND 1990 (8.5 INCHES AND 0.2 POUNDS).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, whereas yellow perch and cisco are principal forage species.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers for its excellent walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge fishing.  Each year, anglers spend approximately 1.2 million hours on Leech Lake during the open-water fishing season.     Summer angling pressure on Leech Lake has increased approximately 47% since the mid 1960's.  This trend of increasing angling pressure has been occurring statewide.  Although angling pressure has been increasing through time, total harvest has remained relatively stable.  Consequently, today's angler's fishing success is somewhat less than that of the past creating a perception of a declining sport fishery.      Walleye:  The 2000 catch of walleye per experimental gill net set was 5.9 which is somewhat less than the 1983-2000 average of 7.7 walleye per set.  Historically, catch rates have ranged from 4.6 walleye/set (1993) to 13.4 walleye/set (1988).  Walleye sampled in experimental gill nets ranged in length from 7.0 to 30.0 inches with an average length of 15.3 inches.  As a result of consistent recruitment of walleye year classes between 1994-1997, good numbers of fish greater than 15 inches in length should provide quality angling opportunities in 2001.          Northern Pike:  The 2000 catch of northern pike per experimental gill net was 5.0.  Since 1983, northern pike gill net catch rates have been stable ranging from 3.6 pike/set (1993) to 6.2 pike/set (1995).  Northern pike sampled in experimental gill nets in 2000 ranged in length from 10.0 to 37.5 inches with an average length of 21.1 inches.     Muskellunge:  In 2000, two muskellunge were sampled in experimental gill nets.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and grow to sizes which are not effectively sampled with gill nets.  Several 50+ inch muskellunge were reported caught by anglers in 2000.                 Data collected during the 1999 fishing season suggests it takes the average musky angler approximately 37 hours to catch a muskellunge.  All anglers interviewed during our 1999 creel survey released their muskellunge back into Leech Lake which illustrates a strong catch and release ethic among musky anglers.  The average size of angler caught muskellunge of legal size (>40 inches) was 43.3 inches.      Yellow Perch: The 2000 catch of yellow perch per experimental gill net set was 21.2 which is comparable to the 1983-2000 average of 22.4 perch per set.  Historically, yellow perch gill net catch rates have ranged from 13.5 perch/set (1983) to 37.7 perch/set (1995).  In 2000, yellow perch sampled in gill nets ranged in length from 5.2 to 12.5 inches with an average length of 7.6 inches.        Cisco: The 2000 catch of cisco per experimental gill net set was 2.7.  Since 1983, gill net catch rates for cisco have varied considerably ranging from 2.1 cisco/set (1989) to 18.5 cisco/set (1987).  Cisco sampled in gill nets in 2000 ranged in length from 7.3 to 16.8 inches with an average length of 11.7 inches.     Leech Lake also provides quality angling opportunities for largemouth bass, black crappie, and sunfish in several shallow vegetated bays.  These species are not effectively sampled with gill nets.      To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of Leech Lake.  Best management practices should be employed when      developing a shoreline.  Careless development within the watershed and the loss of upland and aquatic vegetation can accelerate the natural aging of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain the current water quality of Leech Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.     Scientists have recently identified a new yellow perch parasite found in Leech Lake and the Eagle River Chain of Lakes in Wisconsin.  This microscopic parasite, Heterosporis, is rare in sportfish and causes the flesh to have a \"cooked\" or \"freezer burned\" appearance.  Although infected muscles cells reduce the quality and change the texture of the fillet, there is no evidence that an infected perch is unsafe to eat.  Most people choose to discard affected portions of the fillets.  To help      prevent the spread of this parasite, infected fish remains should not be thrown back into the water, boat exteriors and other equipment should be thoroughly dried, and live wells and bilges should be disinfected with bleach before moving to other bodies of water.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco are principal forage species.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers for its excellent walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge fishing.  Each year, anglers spend approximately 1.2 million hours on Leech Lake during the open-water fishing season.Walleye:  The 2004 catch of walleye per experimental gill net set was 4.97 which is below  the 1983-2004 average of 7.4 walleye per set.  This relatively low gill net catch is due to limited recruitment since the 1997 year class.  Historically, catch rates have ranged from 4.6 walleye/set (1993) to 13.4 walleye/set (1988).  Walleye sampled in experimental gill nets ranged in length from 9.9 to 29.9 inches with an average length of 16.5 inches.  The average length of sampled walleye varied considerably; main lake walleye averaged 18.8 inches while western bay walleye had a mean length of 14.3 inches.  More than one-half of all sampled walleye were caught in Sucker (50) and Agency (48) Bays.Northern Pike:  The 2004 catch of northern pike per experimental gill net was similar to previous  catches at 5.4 per set.  Since 1983, northern pike gill net catch rates have been stable ranging from 3.6 pike/set (1993) to 6.2 pike/set (1995).  Northern pike sampled in experimental gill nets in 2004 ranged in length from 8.5 to 31.5 inches with an average length of 20.7 inches.  PSD-28 remains below the long-term average (8) at 3.Muskellunge:  In 2004, no muskellunge were sampled in experimental gill nets.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and grow to sizes which are not effectively sampled with gill nets.Yellow Perch: The 2004 catch of yellow perch per experimental gill net set was 16.3 which is below the 1983-2004 average of 21.5 perch per set.  Historically, yellow perch gill net catch rates have ranged from 13.5 perch/set (1983) to 37.7 perch/set (1995).  The main lake catch rate was considerably lower (7.7/set) than the western bay rate (27.0/set).  In 2004, yellow perch sampled in gill nets ranged in length from 4.6 to 11.9 inches with an average length of 6.8 inches. Of the 586 yellow perch sampled with gill nets, 5.6% were >10 inches.Cisco: The 2004 catch of cisco per experimental gill net set was 1.8.   Since 1983, gill net catch rates for cisco have varied considerably ranging from a low of 0.9 cisco/set (2003) to 18.5 cisco/set (1987).  Cisco sampled in gill nets in 2004 ranged in length from 7.4 to 15.4 inches with an average length of 10.3 inches. Leech Lake also provides quality angling opportunities for largemouth bass, black crappie, and sunfish in several shallow vegetated bays. These species are not effectively sampled with gill nets.  Anglers report occasional catches of smallmouth bass around Bear and Pelican Islands.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of Leech Lake.  Best management practices should be employed when developing a shoreline.  Careless development within the watershed and the loss of upland and aquatic vegetation can accelerate the natural aging of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain the current water quality of Leech Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco are principal forage species.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers for its walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge fishing. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye:  The 2006 catch of walleye per experimental gill net set was 7.1 which is near the 1983-2006 average of 7.3 walleye per set and higher than last year.  The increase in catch rate in 2006 is due to the 2005 year class recruiting to the gear. After aging all walleye caught in fall test nets, 96 age 1 walleye were sampled, the highest number since 1998.  Historical gill net catch rates have ranged from 4.6 walleye/set (1993) to 13.4 walleye/set (1988).  Walleye sampled in experimental gill nets ranged in length from 6.2 to 25.2 inches with an average length of 15.7 inches.  Catch rates were higher in the main lake (8.7 walleye/set) than in the western bays (5.1 walleye/set). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike:  The 2006 catch of northern pike per experimental gill net was similar to previous  catches at 4.0 per set.  Since 1983, northern pike gill net catch rates have been stable ranging from 3.6 pike/set (1993) to 6.2 pike/set (1995).  Northern pike sampled in experimental gill nets in 2006 ranged in length from 9.3 to 32.7 inches with an average length of 22.4 inches.  RSD-28 was 9, which is above the long-term average (8). <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge:  In 2006, one 26.3 inch muskellunge was sampled in experimental gill nets.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and grow to sizes which are not effectively sampled with gill nets. <br> \n\t\t\t <br> \nYellow Perch: The 2006 catch of yellow perch per experimental gill net set was 20.5 which is greater than last year\u0019s catch rate of 12.9.  Historically, yellow perch gill net catch rates have ranged from last year\u0019s low catch rate to 37.7 perch/set (1995), averaging 21.1 perch/set.  The main lake catch rate was 2.7 times higher than last year\u0019s catch rate (7.8/set).  The increase in yellow perch abundance in the main lake is likely the result of good natural reproduction in recent years and efforts to reduce the population of double-crested cormorants in 2005 and 2006.  In 2006, yellow perch sampled in gill nets ranged in length from 4.2 to 12.0 inches with an average length of 7.1 inches. Of the 737 yellow perch sampled with gill nets, 3.8% were >10 inches.  This percentage is one-half of last year\u0019s value, however, the decrease is due to the increased catch of small yellow perch.  The actual number of yellow perch sampled >10 inches was 28, up from last year (24).\t\t\t\t <br> \nCisco: The 2006 catch of cisco per experimental gill net set was 0.6, the lowest value observed during the large lake program.   Since 1983, gill net catch rates for cisco have varied considerably ranging from this year\u0019s low to 18.5 cisco/set (1987).  The catch of cisco may have been impacted by this year\u0019s summer kill.  Cisco sampled in gill nets in 2006 ranged in length from 8.1 to 13.3 inches with an average length of 9.9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake also provides quality angling opportunities for largemouth bass, black crappie, and sunfish in several shallow vegetated bays. These species are not effectively sampled with gill nets.  Anglers report occasional catches of smallmouth bass around Bear and Pelican Islands. <br> \n <br> \nDue to recent trends in walleye and yellow perch catch data, a five-year action plan was developed for Leech Lake in 2004.  This plan aims to increase the abundance and create a more stable size structure for these two species.  Management activities include: restrictive regulations for walleye, science-based cormorant control, walleye stocking and an increased focus on habitat protection.  Habitat protection includes watershed-level land management as fish habitat is directly affected by the water quality that enter the lake via runoff.  It is paramount to maintain the current water quality of Leech Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within Minnesota\u0019s boundaries and covers approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco are principal forage species.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers for its walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge fishing.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the Large Lake Program began in 1983, walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2007 catch of walleye per experimental gillnet set was 13.1 fish/net, the second highest on record, and is well above the 1983-2007 average of 7.5 fish/net.  The increase in the walleye gillnet catch rate is due to the large year classes of walleyes produced in 2005 and 2006; 61% of walleyes caught during the 2007 gillnet survey were from these two year classes.  Walleyes sampled in experimental gillnets ranged in length from 6.7 to 26.3 inches with an average length of 14.8 inches.  Gillnet catch rates were higher in the main lake (18.4 fish/net) than in the western bays (6.6 fish/net).  Reports from anglers have been good across the entire lake since the 2007 opener and a special creel survey is scheduled for summer 2008. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The 2007 catch of northern pike per experimental gillnet was 5.9 fish/net.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.6 fish/net (1993) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.8 fish/net.  Northern pike captured in 2007 gillnet sets ranged in length from 12.1 inches to 35.1 inches with an average length of 23.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: Only one muskellunge of 17.7 inches was sampled in experimental gillnet sets during 2007.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and exceed sizes that are effectively sampled with gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Gillnet catch rates of yellow perch have ranged from 20.5 fish/net (2005) to 37.7 fish/net (1995).  The 2007 catch rate of yellow perch in experimental gillnet sets was 36.9 fish/net.  This is well above the catch rates observed in 2006 (20.5 fish/net) and 2005 (12.9 fish/net) and is also above the 1983-2007 average of 21.7 fish/net.  The increase in yellow perch abundance, particularly in the main lake, is likely the result of good natural reproduction in recent years as well as efforts to reduce the double-crested cormorant population on Leech Lake.  Yellow perch sampled in 2007 gillnet sets ranged in length from 4.6 inches to 11.9 inches.  Of the 1,326 total yellow perch caught, 29% were 8 inches and longer and 6% were 10 inches and longer; both of these proportions are anticipated to increase as young perch continue to grow and reach harvestable sizes. <br> \n <br> \nCisco: The 2007 catch rate of cisco per experimental gillnet set was 4.0 fish/net.  Gillnet catch rates of cisco have varied considerable, ranging from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987), and the 1983-2007 average is 5.6 fish/net.  Warmer summers resulting in summer kills have probably been the source of cisco catch rates remaining below average since 1995. <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake also provides quality angling opportunities for largemouth bass, black crappie, and sunfishes in shallow, vegetated bays.  These species are not effectively sampled with gillnets.  Anglers also occasionally report catches of smallmouth bass around Bear and Pelican islands. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, including excellent fishing opportunities for walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, muskellunge, largemouth bass, sunfish, and black crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake has been surveyed annually with standardized assessments since 1983.  Establishment of long-term data sets on Leech Lake and Minnesota's other large walleye lakes allow biologists to compare current observations against historical averages.  These long-term data sets can also provide insight into other lakes having similar physical and biological properties that are not sampled as frequently.  Population metrics for a particular species, such as the highs and lows in gill net catch rates or the growth rates of fish, are constantly changing as they move from one extreme of their observed normal range to the other, much like a pendulum.  While highs and lows are normal and rarely sustained past one year, consecutive observations at either extreme can be indicative of changes to an ecosystem.  These may include exotic species introductions, shifts in habitat availability and/or quality, beneficial or adverse environmental conditions, and increased or decreased competition for resources between species or among year classes of the same species or among several species with similar requirements.  Regardless, it is important to remember that all populations of flora and fauna fluctuate dramatically and that this natural variability is strongly influenced by the changing environment in which they live as well as the other species of plants and animals they share it with.   <br> \n <br> \nThis report primarily addresses the 2010 Leech Lake fishery assessment.  The 2007-2009 assessments of the Leech Lake fishery determined that all management goals outlined in the 2005-2010 action plan had been met or exceeded (Schultz 2008a, 2008b).  Fishing quality on Leech Lake, indexed by targeting angler catch rates, improved significantly from the historic lows observed during 2005 to record highs during the 2008 open water season (Schultz 2009).  Recent surveys have indicated substantial improvements to the walleye population and its fishery over the course of a few years.  The completion and thorough evaluation of these efforts will refine current management strategies on Leech Lake as well as identify the needs for new ones.   <br> \n <br> \nThe MN DNR convened a citizen input committee (Leech Lake Advisory Committee; LLAC) comprised of stakeholders representing local and statewide interests in Leech Lake management.  This group outlined walleye population management objectives and actions, including double-crested cormorant control, the walleye regulation, and walleye fry stocking (LLAC 2010).  These recommendations were incorporated into DNR's Leech Lake Management Plan, 2011-2015 (Schultz 2010a).  These management goals, where appropriate, are referenced in this report.  <br> \n <br> \nThe current protected slot walleye regulation (PSL) on Leech Lake (18-26\" walleye must be immediately released; possession limit of 4, one of which may be longer than 26\") was reviewed and compared to other regulation options (Schultz and Staples 2010a).  Public comment on proposed regulation changes was solicited during October, 2010.  The majority of public input supported maintaining the regulation through 2015, though some comments expressed consideration for a more liberal length limit that adjusts with measures of spawner biomass.  Therefore, if measures of spawner biomass exceed 2.0 lbs/acre during two consecutive years, DNR will consider adjusting the regulation to a 20-26\" PSL, bag of 4, one fish over 26\" allowed in possession to begin the ensuing season based on current information.  <br> \n <br> \nAquatic invasive species currently found in Leech Lake include rusty crayfish, heterosporosis, curly-leaf pondweed, Eurasian watermilfoil, purple loosestrife, and banded mystery snail.  Currently invasive plant species are not widely distributed within Leech Lake.  Other aquatic invasive species are increasing in prevalence throughout Minnesota and pose a likely risk.  Anglers and boaters alike are encouraged to properly dispose of bait in the trash, to drain all water from bait containers, livewells, and watercraft, and properly inspect and remove all vegetation from the watercraft, anchor, and trailer when leaving a lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the Large Lake Program began in 1983, walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2010 catch of walleye per experimental gillnet set was 7.86 fish/net and remains above the 1983-2010 average of 7.6 fish/net.  The improvements in the walleye population can be largely attributed to above-average year classes of walleye produced during 2005-2008.  Walleye sampled in experimental gillnets ranged in length from 6 to 25 inches.  Observed median lengths of the 2009, 2008, and 2007 year classes were approximately 10, 13, and 16 inches TL, respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nStatistics from the 2010 creel survey described another good walleye angling season on Leech Lake.  Walleye were caught at a rate of 0.222 fish/hour and harvested at a rate of 0.091 fish/hour across all anglers.  Anglers specifically targeting walleye caught fish at a rate of 0.645 walleye/hour and harvested fish at a rate of 0.197 walleye/hour.  These statistics, in particular the targeting catch and harvest rates, are comparable to estimates collected during the 1990's.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The 2010 gillnet catch rate of northern pike was 4.08 fish/net.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.6 fish/net (1993) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.8 fish/net.  Northern pike captured in 2010 gillnet sets ranged in length from 8 to 33 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers targeting northern pike during 2010 caught pike at a rate of 0.755 fish/hour and harvested pike at a rate of 0.247 fish/hour.  The average length of harvested northern pike during 2010 was 23.13 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: Only two muskellunge were sampled in experimental gillnet sets during 2010.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and exceed sizes effectively sampled with gillnets.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskie anglers averaged 0.025 fish/hour, or 1 fish/50 angler-hours, during the 2010 fishing season.  This is double the 2009 statistic and above the long-term average for targeting anglers (0.018 fish/hour).  Catch rates were highest during July and August.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Gillnet catch rates of yellow perch have ranged from 12.9 fish/net (2005) to 37.7 fish/net (1995).  The 2010 catch rate of yellow perch in experimental gillnet sets was 24.31 fish/net.  This is above the 1983-2010 average of 22.1 fish/net.  Yellow perch sampled in 2010 gillnet sets ranged in length from 4 inches to 12 inches.  Of the total perch caught, 39% were 8 inches and longer and 11% were 10 inches and longer; both of these proportions have increased during recent years. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers targeting yellow perch averaged a catch rate of 8.188 perch/hour and a harvest rate of 2.100 perch/hour during 2010.  Catch and harvest rates were highest during September. <br> \n <br> \nCisco: The 2010 catch rate of cisco per experimental gillnet set was 5.94 fish/net and is above the long-term average of 5.66 fish/net.  Gillnet catch rates of cisco have varied considerable, ranging from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987).  Warmer summers causing summer kills have probably been the reason for cisco catch rates remaining below average since 1995.  Strong year classes were produced in recent years and their extended persistence in the absence of summer kill events is presumed to be the cause of increased catch rates. <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake also provides quality angling opportunities for largemouth bass, black crappie, and sunfish in shallow, vegetated bays.  These species are not effectively sampled with gillnets.  Anglers also occasionally report catches of smallmouth bass. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco are principal forage species.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers for its excellent walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge fishing.  Each year, anglers spend approximately 1.2 million hours on Leech Lake during the open-water fishing season.     Summer angling pressure on Leech Lake has increased approximately 47% since the mid 1960's.  This trend of increasing angling pressure has been occurring statewide.  Although angling pressure has been increasing through time, total harvest has remained relatively stable.  Consequently, today's angler's fishing success is somewhat less than that of the past creating a perception of a declining sport fishery.      Walleye:  The 2001 catch of walleye per experimental gill net set was 7.0 which is somewhat less than the 1983-2001 average of 7.7 walleye per set.  Historically, catch rates have ranged from 4.6 walleye/set (1993) to 13.4 walleye/set (1988).  Walleye sampled in experimental gill nets ranged in length from 6.5 to 24.8 inches with an average length of 14.9 inches.  The highest catch rate for walleye occurred off of Ottertail Point (26 walleye).  The 2001 walleye year class does not appear to be numerous, however, growth of sampled young-of-the-year is excellent.     In addition to the collection of aging structures, walleye were examined for the presence of Heterosporis.  This parasite is rare in sportfish and causes the flesh to have a \"cooked\" or \"freezer burned\" appearance.  No walleye appeared infected with the parasite.     Northern Pike:  The 2001 catch of northern pike per experimental gill net was 5.3.  Since 1983, northern pike gill net catch rates have been stable ranging from 3.6 pike/set (1993) to 6.2 pike/set (1995).  Northern pike sampled in experimental gill nets in 2001 ranged in length from 9.3 to 35.4 inches with an average length of 19.9 inches.     Muskellunge:  In 2001, no muskellunge were sampled in experimental gill nets.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and grow to sizes which are not effectively sampled with gill nets.  Several 50+ inch muskellunge were reported caught by anglers in 2001, most notably during the Muskies, Inc. tournament in September.  All anglers interviewed during our 1999 creel survey released their muskellunge back into Leech Lake which illustrates a strong catch and release ethic among musky anglers.  The average size of angler caught muskellunge of legal size (>40 inches) was 43.3 inches.      Yellow Perch: The 2001 catch of yellow perch per experimental gill net set was 15.5 which is below the 1983-2001 average of 22.0 perch per set.  Historically, yellow perch gill net catch rates have ranged from 13.5 perch/set (1983) to 37.7 perch/set (1995).  In 2001, yellow perch sampled in gill nets ranged in length from 4.3 to 14.0 inches with an average length of 7.3 inches. Of the 559 yellow perch sampled with gill nets, 10.6% were >10\".  Sampled yellow perch were also examined for the presence of Heterosporis.  Of the 475 perch examined, 5.7% are believed to be infected with Heterosporis.  This infection rate is lower than 2000, when 10.9% were infected. Tissue samples were taken from these fish to confirm the presence of the parasite.     Cisco: The 2001 catch of cisco per experimental gill net set was 1.3 which is the lowest catch during the large lake sampling program.  Since 1983, gill net catch rates for cisco have varied considerably ranging from the previous low of 2.1 cisco/set (1989) to 18.5 cisco/set (1987).  Cisco sampled in gill nets in 2001 ranged in length from 6.7 to 18.4 inches with an average length of 12.8 inches.     Leech Lake also provides quality angling opportunities for largemouth bass, black crappie, and sunfish in several shallow vegetated bays.  These species are not effectively sampled with gill nets.      To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of Leech Lake.  Best management practices should be employed when developing a shoreline.  Careless development within the watershed and the loss of upland and aquatic vegetation can accelerate the natural aging of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain the current water quality of Leech Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status of the Fishery (as of 3/30/2013) <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, including excellent fishing opportunities for walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, muskellunge, largemouth bass, sunfish, and black crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake has been surveyed annually with standardized assessments since 1983.  Establishment of long-term data sets on Leech Lake and Minnesota's other large walleye lakes allow biologists to compare current observations against historical averages.  These long-term data sets can also provide insight into other lakes having similar physical and biological properties that are not sampled as frequently.  Population metrics for a particular species, such as the highs and lows in gill net catch rates or the growth rates of fish, are constantly changing as they move from one extreme of their observed normal range to the other, much like a pendulum.  While highs and lows are normal and rarely sustained past one year, consecutive observations at either extreme can be indicative of changes to an ecosystem.  These may include exotic species introductions, shifts in habitat availability and/or quality, beneficial or adverse environmental conditions, and increased or decreased competition for resources between species or among different year classes of the same species.  Regardless, it is important to remember that all populations of flora and fauna fluctuate dramatically and that this natural variability is strongly influenced by the changing environment in which they live as well as the other species of plants and animals they share it with.   <br> \n <br> \nThe MN DNR convened a citizen input committee (Leech Lake Advisory Committee; LLAC) comprised of stakeholders representing local and statewide interests in Leech Lake management.  This group outlined walleye population management objectives and actions, including double-crested cormorant control, the walleye regulation, and walleye fry stocking (LLAC 2010).  These recommendations were incorporated into DNR's Leech Lake Management Plan, 2011-2015.  These management goals, where appropriate, are referenced in this report.  <br> \n <br> \nThe current protected slot walleye regulation (PSL) on Leech Lake (18-26\" walleye must be immediately released; possession limit of 4, one of which may be longer than 26\") was reviewed and compared to other regulation options.  Public comment on proposed regulation changes was solicited during October, 2010.  The majority of public input supported maintaining the regulation through 2015, though some comments expressed consideration for a more liberal length limit that adjusts with measures of spawner biomass.  Therefore, if measures of spawner biomass exceed 2.0 lbs/acre during two consecutive years, DNR will consider adjusting the regulation to a 20-26\" PSL, bag of 4, one fish over 26\" allowed in possession to begin the ensuing season based on current information.  Spawner biomass was exceeded 2.0 lbs/acre for the first time in 2012 (2.28 lbs/acre).  Anticipating this objective to be exceeded again in 2013, DNR has initiated the public input process for a potential regulation change at the start of the 2014 season.  Public comment on any proposed change(s) will be solicited during October, 2013. <br> \n <br> \nAquatic invasive species currently found in Leech Lake include rusty crayfish, heterosporosis, curly-leaf pondweed, Eurasian watermilfoil, purple loosestrife, and banded mystery snail.  Currently invasive plant species are not widely distributed within Leech Lake.  Other aquatic invasive species such as zebra mussels and spiny waterflea are increasing in prevalence throughout Minnesota and pose a likely risk.  Anglers and boaters alike are encouraged to review and adhere to rules requiring proper bait disposal, draining all water from bait containers, livewells, bilge, and the watercraft, and properly inspecting and removing all plants and animals from the watercraft, anchor, and trailer when leaving a lake.  Information on invasive species issues and prevention can be found at www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/index_aquatic/.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the Large Lake Program began in 1983, walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2012 catch of walleye per gillnet set was 9.42 fish/net and remains above the 1983-2012 average of 7.7 fish/net.  Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 6 to 27 inches.  Observed median lengths of the 2011, 2010, and 2009 year classes were approximately 10, 13, and 15 inches TL, respectively.  The percent of walleye sampled with gillnets in 2012 less than 15 inches (51%) indicates a balanced population of juveniles and adults.  Good 2010 and 2011 year-classes will begin providing harvest opportunities on the 2013 opener and continue to be available throughout the next several seasons.  Additionally, 35% of walleye sampled in gillnets were within the protected slot limit and will provide anglers the opportunity to catch a large fish.  The proportion of protected fish sampled in gillnets closely mirrors the proportion of protected fish caught by anglers.  Based on the return of the walleye population to its pre-2000 status and all indications that the population is indeed fully recovered, DNR has initiated the public input process to potentially relax the current 18-26\" PSL to a 20-26\" PSL (bag limit unchanged).  Public comments will be solicited during October, 2013 and any changes to the current 18-26\" regulation would be effective on the 2014 walleye opener. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The 2012 gillnet catch rate of northern pike was 4.33 fish/net.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.6 fish/net (1993) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.8 fish/net.  Northern pike captured in 2012 gillnet sets ranged in length from 12 to 37 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: Only one muskellunge were sampled in gillnet sets during 2012.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and exceed sizes effectively sampled with gillnets.  Anglers consistently reported an excellent 2012 season.  As an example, Muskies Inc. members can report their catch through an online database with the organization.  During 2012, members registered more muskies on Leech Lake than in the past ten years.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Gillnet catch rates of yellow perch have ranged from 12.9 fish/net (2005) to 37.7 fish/net (1995).  The 2012 catch rate of yellow perch in gillnets was 14.53 fish/net.  This is below the 1983-2012 average of 21.7 fish/net.  Yellow perch sampled in 2012 gillnet sets ranged in length from 4 to 13 inches.  Of the total perch caught, 37% were 8 inches and longer and 11% were 10 inches and longer. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nCisco: The 2012 catch rate of cisco per gillnet set was 3.61 fish/net and is below the long-term average of 5.46 fish/net.  Gillnet catch rates of cisco have varied considerably, ranging from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987).  Warmer summers causing summer kills have probably been the source of cisco catch rates remaining below average since 1995, except in 2009.  Age-2 and -5 fish were the most commonly sampled age-classes in 2012 and made up 48% of individuals sampled.  Lengths of cisco sampled ranged from 6.6 to 17.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass: The 2012 lakewide electrofishing catch rate of largemouth bass was 15.9 fish/hour.  Largemouth bass sampled in 2012 ranged in length from 2 to 19 inches.  Of all largemouth bass caught, 41% were 15 inches or longer.  Anglers can find quality bass fishing opportunities in the sprawling beds of mixed vegetation in the major bays.  Anglers also report occasional catches of smallmouth bass, which have always been present but in low numbers.  Only one smallmouth bass was captured during the 2012 electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBluegill: The 2012 lakewide electrofishing catch rate of bluegill was 33.1 fish/hour.  Bluegill sampled in 2012 ranged in length from 1 to 10 inches.  Of all bluegills caught, 27% were 8 inches or longer.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie: The 2012 lakewide electrofishing catch rate of black crappie was 4.8 fish/hour.  Black crappie sampled in 2012 ranged in length from 2 to 14 inches.  Of all black crappie caught, 70% were 10 inches or longer. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, including excellent fishing opportunities for walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, muskellunge, largemouth bass, sunfish, and black crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake has been surveyed annually with standardized assessments since 1983.  Establishment of long-term data sets on Leech Lake and Minnesota's other large walleye lakes allow biologists to compare current observations against historical averages.  These long-term data sets can also provide insight into other lakes having similar physical and biological properties that are not sampled as frequently.  Population metrics for a particular species, such as the highs and lows in gill net catch rates or the growth rates of fish, are constantly changing as they move from one extreme of their observed normal range to the other, much like a pendulum.  While highs and lows are normal and rarely sustained past one year, consecutive observations at either extreme can be indicative of changes to an ecosystem.  These may include exotic species introductions, shifts in habitat availability and/or quality, beneficial or adverse environmental conditions, and increased or decreased competition for resources between species or among different year classes of the same species.  Regardless, it is important to remember that all populations of flora and fauna fluctuate dramatically and that this natural variability is strongly influenced by the changing environment in which they live as well as the other species of plants and animals they share it with.   <br> \n <br> \nThe MN DNR convened a citizen input committee (Leech Lake Advisory Committee; LLAC) comprised of stakeholders representing local and statewide interests in Leech Lake management.  This group outlined walleye population management objectives and actions, including double-crested cormorant control, the walleye regulation, and walleye fry stocking (LLAC 2010).  These recommendations were incorporated into DNR's Leech Lake Management Plan, 2011-2015.  These management goals, where appropriate, are referenced in this report.  <br> \n <br> \nEffective May 10, 2014 all walleye between 20.0-26.0 inches long must be immediately returned to the water, a possession limit of 4 walleye with one longer than 26.0\" allowed in possession.  This regulation is intended to provide additional harvest opportunity while still protecting most of the mature female walleye in the population, and received majority support from the public comment period held during fall 2013. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nAquatic invasive species currently found in Leech Lake include rusty crayfish, heterosporosis, curly-leaf pondweed, Eurasian watermilfoil, purple loosestrife, and banded mystery snail.  Eurasian watermilfoil is beginning to establish in open-water areas of the lake.  Other aquatic invasive species such as zebra mussels and spiny waterflea are increasing in prevalence throughout Minnesota and pose a likely risk.  Anglers and boaters alike are encouraged to review and adhere to rules requiring proper bait disposal, draining all water from bait containers, livewells, bilge, and the watercraft, and properly inspecting and removing all plants and animals from the watercraft, anchor, and trailer when leaving a lake.  Information on invasive species issues and prevention can be found at www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/index_aquatic/.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the Large Lake Program began in 1983, walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2014 catch of walleye per gillnet set was 8.9 fish/net and remained above the 1983-2014 average of 7.8 fish/net.  Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 6 to 26 inches.  The average lengths of age-1 through age-4 walleye were 9.5, 12.5, 15.6, and 17.5 inches, respectively.  Good 2010 through 2012 year-classes will provide harvest opportunities on the 2015 opener and continue to be available throughout the next several seasons.  Additionally, 19% of walleye sampled in gillnets were 20-26\" and will provide anglers the opportunity to catch a larger fish.  The proportion of protected fish sampled in gillnets closely resembles the proportion of protected fish caught by anglers.  Based on the return of the walleye population to its pre-2000 status, the population is fully recovered. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The 2014 gillnet catch rate of northern pike was 4.6 fish/net.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.6 fish/net (1993) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.8 fish/net.  Northern pike captured in 2014 gillnet sets ranged in length from 11 to 35 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: Only two muskellunge were sampled in gillnet sets during 2014.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and exceed sizes effectively sampled with gillnets.  Muskellunge eggs were collected in 2013 for the statewide muskellunge stocking program and fish up to 53 inches long were captured.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Gillnet catch rates of yellow perch have ranged from 12.1 fish/net (2013) to 37.7 fish/net (1995).  The 2014 catch rate of 13.9 fish/net was the third lowest observed since standardized sampling began in 1983.  This compares to the 1983-2014 average of 21.1 fish/net.  Yellow perch sampled in 2014 gillnet sets ranged in length from 3 to 12 inches.  Of the total perch caught, 21% were 8 inches and longer and 4% were 10 inches and longer. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nCisco: The 2014 catch rate of cisco per gillnet set was 4.0 fish/net and was below the long-term average of 5.3 fish/net.  Gillnet catch rates of cisco have varied considerably, ranging from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987).  Warmer summers causing summer kills have probably been the source of cisco catch rates remaining below average since 1995, except in 2009.  Age-2 through age-8 cisco had similar catch rates in 2014, indicating recruitment is occurring each year.  Lengths of cisco sampled ranged from 7 to 18 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass: The next scheduled lakewide Centrarchid (bass/bluegill/crappie) survey is scheduled for spring 2015.  The 2012 lakewide electrofishing catch rate of largemouth bass was 15.9 fish/hour.  Largemouth bass sampled in 2012 ranged in length from 2 to 19 inches.  Of all largemouth bass caught, 41% were 15 inches or longer.  Anglers can find quality bass fishing opportunities in the sprawling beds of mixed vegetation in the major bays.  Anglers also report occasional catches of smallmouth bass, which have always been present but in low numbers.  Only one smallmouth bass was captured during the 2012 electrofishing survey.  Only one smallmouth bass has been sampled in a gill net since standardized sampling began in 1983. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBluegill: The 2012 lakewide electrofishing catch rate of bluegill was 33.1 fish/hour.  Bluegill sampled in 2012 ranged in length from 1 to 10 inches.  Of all bluegills caught, 27% were 8 inches or longer.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie: The 2012 lakewide electrofishing catch rate of black crappie was 4.8 fish/hour.  Black crappie sampled in 2012 ranged in length from 2 to 14 inches.  Of all black crappie caught, 70% were 10 inches or longer. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, including excellent fishing opportunities for walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, muskellunge, largemouth bass, sunfish, and black crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake has been surveyed annually with standardized assessments since 1983.  Establishment of long-term data sets on Leech Lake and Minnesota\u0019s other large walleye lakes allow biologists to compare current observations against historical averages.  These long-term data sets can also provide insight into other lakes having similar physical and biological properties that are not sampled as frequently.  Population metrics for a particular species, such as the highs and lows in gill net catch rates or the growth rates of fish, are constantly changing as they move from one extreme of their observed normal range to the other, much like a pendulum.  While highs and lows are normal and rarely sustained past one year, consecutive observations at either extreme can be indicative of changes to an ecosystem.  Such changes include exotic species introductions, shifts in habitat availability and/or quality, beneficial or adverse environmental conditions, and increased or decreased competition for resources between species or among year classes of the same species or among several species with similar requirements.  Regardless, it is important to remember that all populations of flora and fauna fluctuate dramatically and that this natural variability is strongly influenced by the changing environment in which they live as well as the other species of plants and animals they share it with.   <br> \n <br> \nHumans have had dramatic impacts on fish populations by degrading or destroying habitat necessary for successful reproduction, growth, and survival.  In particular, lakeshores are highly sensitive areas that are vital to the overall health of our lakes.  Terrestrial vegetation provides habitat for birds, mammals, and amphibians and buffers lakes from runoff that carry chemicals and sediment.  Near-shore aquatic vegetation provides protection and food for the early life-stages of some species, such as walleye, and serves as year-round habitat for others, such as bluegill and largemouth bass.  Any changes that have a negative effect on these areas will have a negative impact on the fishery.  Therefore, protection of these sensitive areas is paramount to ensuring the sustainability and quality of Minnesota\u0019s precious water resources for future generations. <br> \n <br> \nDue to recent trends in yellow perch and walleye catch data, a five-year action plan was initiated in 2005.  Action plan objectives were to increase the relative abundance and to stabilize the population size structure of these two species.  Management activities used to meet these objectives have included more restrictive regulations for walleye, cormorant control, walleye stocking, and an increased focus on habitat protection.  The annual fishery survey using experimental gill nets was completed by the Walker Area Fisheries office, MN DNR, between 1 September and 12 September 2008.  A summary of trawling data, which has been completed annually during August and is used to index the relative abundance of young-of-year (YOY) walleye, is also included. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the Large Lake Program began in 1983, walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2008 catch of walleye per experimental gillnet set was 9.1 fish/net, well above the 1983-2008 average of 7.5 fish/net.  The increase in the walleye gillnet catch rate is due to the large year classes of walleyes produced during 2005, 2006, and 2007; 79% of walleye caught during the 2008 gillnet survey were from these three year classes.  Walleye sampled in experimental gillnets ranged in length from 8.9 to 26.0 inches with an average length of 15.5 inches.  Gillnet catch rates were higher in the main lake (12.3 fish/net) than in the western bays (5.1 fish/net).   <br> \n <br> \nStatistics from the 2008 creel survey described one of the best walleye angling seasons ever recorded on Leech Lake.  Walleye were caught at a rate of 0.278 fish/hour and harvested at a rate of 0.115 fish/hour across all anglers; anglers specifically targeting walleye caught fish at a rate of 1.064 walleye/hour and harvested fish at a rate of 0.459 walleye/hour.  These statistics, in particular the targeting catch and harvest rates, are among the highest ever observed on Leech Lake.  For comparison, respective walleye catch and harvest rates for targeting anglers were higher on Leech during 2008 than during 2007 on Mille Lacs (0.391 and 0.129 fish/hour), Lake of the Woods (0.550 and 0.290 fish/hour), and Winnibigoshish (0.545 and 0.229 fish/hour). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The 2008 gillnet catch rate of northern pike was 5.6 fish/net.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.6 fish/net (1993) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.8 fish/net.  Northern pike captured in 2008 gillnet sets ranged in length from 8.5 inches to 33.5 inches with an average length of 22.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers targeting northern pike during 2008 caught pike at a rate of 0.881 fish/hour and harvested pike at a rate of 0.339 fish/hour.  Similar to targeting catch rates for walleye, statistics for Leech were higher than similar observations on Mille Lacs, Lake of the Woods, and Winnibigoshish during 2007. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: No muskellunge were sampled in experimental gillnet sets during 2008.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and exceed sizes that are effectively sampled with gillnets.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskie anglers averaged 0.022 fish/hour, or 1 fish/50 angler-hours, during the 2008 fishing season.  This is higher than the long-term average for targeting anglers (0.018 fish/hour) and is considerably higher than during the 2004-2005 creel survey (0.009 fish/hour).  Muskie anglers tended to catch fish more frequently in the western bays (0.027 fish/hour) than in the main lake (0.017 fish/hour) and were most successful during July.  For comparison, the season catch rate by anglers targeting muskies on Leech Lake was nearly double the estimate on Vermillion (0.013 fish/hour) and considerably higher than on Mille Lacs (0.004 fish/hour) during 2008. <br> \n <br> \nIn cooperation with various Muskies Inc. chapters and other anglers, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources will begin efforts to estimate the size of the muskellunge population.  Anglers will be asked to collect scale samples and other information from muskies they catch while fishing Leech Lake during 2009-2010.  If you will be fishing muskies on Leech Lake during 2009-2010 and would like to assist, please contact the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Gillnet catch rates of yellow perch have ranged from 12.9 fish/net (2005) to 37.7 fish/net (1995).  The 2008 catch rate of yellow perch in experimental gillnet sets was 26.6 fish/net.  This is above the 1983-2008 average of 21.7 fish/net.  Yellow perch sampled in 2008 gillnet sets ranged in length from 5.2 inches to 12.7 inches.  Of the 956 total perch caught, 36% were 8 inches and longer and 11% were 10 inches and longer; both of these proportions have increased during recent years. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers targeting yellow perch averaged a catch rate of 6.881 perch/hour and a harvest rate of 2.730 perch/hour during 2008.  Catch and harvest rates were highest during September. <br> \n <br> \nCisco: The 2008 catch rate of cisco per gillnet set was 1.61 fish/net.  Gillnet catch rates of cisco have varied considerable, ranging from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987), and the 1983-2007 average is 5.6 fish/net.  Warmer summers resulting in summer kills have probably been the source of cisco catch rates remaining below average since 1995. <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake also provides quality angling opportunities for largemouth bass, black crappie, and sunfish in shallow, vegetated bays.  These species are not effectively sampled with gillnets.  Anglers also occasionally report catches of smallmouth bass.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status of the Fishery (as of 2/21/2019) <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths approach 160 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge are the primary predator species, while Yellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, and includes excellent fishing opportunities for Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Muskellunge, Largemouth Bass, Sunfish, and Black Crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nThe MN DNR convened a citizen input committee (Leech Lake Fisheries Input Group; LLFIG) comprised of 16 stakeholders representing local and statewide interests in Leech Lake management.  This group developed a recommended list of sportfish population goals, objectives, and management actions.  These recommendations were incorporated into the DNR's 2016-2020 Fisheries Management Plan for Leech Lake.  These management goals, where appropriate, are referenced in this update.  <br> \n <br> \nAn 18-26\" protected slot limit (PSL) with a 4 fish possession limit for Walleye was implemented in 2005 to protect and increase the number of spawning Walleye; this regulation was relaxed to a 20-26\" PSL in 2014 after management objectives were exceeded.  The management plan outlines criteria for relaxation of the current slot limit, and many of these have continued to be met or exceeded despite a relaxation of the regulations in 2014 to the current 20-26\" PSL.  A further relaxation of the Walleye regulation was proposed and public comments were solicited in 2018. With strong public support, the proposal was accepted and the Walleye regulation that will be in place for the 2019 open water Walleye season will be a 4 fish bag limit with no more than 1 Walleye allowed over 20\" allowed in possession.  This regulation will be evaluated annually and adjustments based on Management Plan objectives will be proposed if sampling results demonstrate they would benefit the fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nUpdates on specific species are provided below: <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the current sampling plan that began in 1983, Walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2018 catch rate was 10.2 (fish/net) which was similar to than the 2017 catch rate (10.1 fish/net) and just above the management objectives of 7-10 fish/net. Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 7 to 27 inches, and included a number of younger year classes that should be large enough to harvest in the next year or two.  While 15% of the Walleye in the 2018 sample were protected by the slot limit nearly 20% were in the 15-19\" size range that are available for harvest.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The 2018 gillnet catch rate of Northern Pike was 4.2 fish/net.  Northern Pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.6 fish/net (1993) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.8 fish/net.  Northern Pike captured in 2018 gillnet sets ranged in length from 13 to 33 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: Since 2015, the MNDNR has worked with Muskellunge tournament participants on Leech Lake to collect creel information.  In 2018, the DNR obtained creel interviews from 184 anglers from 3 tournaments. Information on hours fished, the number and size of fish that were caught was collected.  Lengths of tournament Muskellunge caught on Leech in 2018 ranged from 22 to 51 inches and the average number of hours it took tournament anglers to catch a Muskellunge was 46 hours.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Catch rates in 2018 were 10.9 (fish/net), lower than the long-term average of 20.3(fish/net) and was similar to the record low in 2016. Previous catch rates ranged from 9.4 fish/net (2016) to 37.7 fish/net (1995). Total lengths of Yellow Perch sampled ranged from 5 to 12 inches with 37 percent of the Yellow Perch in the 2018 sample over 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco): The overall catch rate was 4.1 fish/net which was below the long-term average (5.4 fish/net). Previous catch rates ranged from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987). Tullibee sampled ranged from 7 to 18 inches. Warmer summers causing summer kills have likely been the source of Tullibee catch rates remaining relatively low since 1995.  However, no significant summer kill events have been observed during the past five years. Within the Leech Lake Reservation the Whitefish limit is 25 and the Tullibee (Cisco) limit is 50, which is an exception to the statewide regulation.  Daily and possession limits are the same.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass: A lake wide Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie assessment occurred during the springs of 2012 and 2015 and was repeated in 2018.  Catch rates for fish ?15 inches were similar between 2015 (6 fish/hour), 2012 (5 fish/hour) and 2018 (3 fish/hour). Lengths ranged from 3 to 19 inches. Anglers can find quality bass fishing opportunities in the beds of mixed vegetation in most major bays.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill: Spring electrofishing catch rates for all Bluegill (30 fish/hour) were lower than the 2015 (47 fish/hour) and 2012 (33 fish/hour) catch rates.  Twenty percent of the Bluegill sampled in 2018 were over 8 inches.  Lengths in 2018 ranged from 2 to 10 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie: Spring electrofishing catch rates for all Black Crappie were 4 fish/hour in 2018 9 fish/hour in 2015 and 5 fish/hour in 2012.  Lengths ranged from 4 to 14 inches and of all Black Crappie sampled in 2018, 44% were 10 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nAquatic invasive species currently found in Leech Lake include Rusty Crayfish, Heterosporosis, Curly-Leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil, Purple Loosestrife, Zebra Mussels, and Banded Mystery Snail.  Eurasian Watermilfoil is beginning to establish in open-water areas of the lake.  Other aquatic invasive species such as Spiny Waterfleas are increasing in prevalence throughout Minnesota and pose a likely risk.  Anglers and boaters alike are encouraged to review and adhere to rules requiring proper bait disposal, draining all water from bait containers, livewells, bilge, and the watercraft, and properly inspecting and removing all plants and animals from the watercraft, anchor, and trailer when leaving a lake.  Information on invasive species issues and prevention can be found by searching MNDNR invasive species in your preferred internet search engine or by calling your local DNR office. <br> \n</p>",

WALLEYE ANGLING WAS GOOD DURING THE SUMMER OF 1986 AS WELL AS DURING DECEMBER 1986 AND JANUARY 1987. IT ALSO APPEARS THAT WALLEYE REPRODUCTION WAS GOOD IN 1986. THE NUMBER OF NORTHERN PIKE CAUGHT IN DNR'S EXPERIMENTAL GILL NETS HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH SINCE 1950, BUT THE AVERAGE WEIGHT OF THESE NORTH- ERNS IN 1986 WAS GREATER THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS. THE NUMBER OF YELLOW PERCH TAKEN DURING 1986 IN EXPERIMENTAL GILL NETS WAS LESS THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS, BUT THEIR AVERAGE WEIGHT WAS SIMILAR TO PERCH AVERAGE WEIGHTS DURING THE PAST FOUR YEARS. ICE FISHING FOR YELLOW PERCH HAS BEEN GOOD ON LEECH DURING THE WINTER OF 1986-87. MUSKELLUNGE ANGLERS CONTINUED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN 1986 AND MORE OF THESE ANGLERS ARE PRACTICING CATCH AND RELEASE FISHING. LARGEMOUTH BASS FISHING IS BE- COMING INCREASINGLY POPULAR ON LEECH.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>2002 LEECH LAKE STATUS     Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface      acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco are principal forage species.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers for its excellent walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge fishing.  Each year, anglers spend approximately 1.2 million hours on Leech Lake during the open-water fishing season.     Summer angling pressure on Leech Lake has increased approximately 47% since the mid 1960's.  This trend of increasing angling pressure has been occurring statewide.  Although angling pressure has been increasing through time, total harvest has remained relatively stable.  Consequently, today's angler's fishing success is somewhat less than that of the past creating a perception of a declining sport fishery.      Walleye:  The 2002 catch of walleye per experimental gill net set was 6.2 which is below the 1983-2002 average of 7.6 walleye per set.  Historically, catch rates have ranged from 4.6 walleye/set (1993) to 13.4 walleye/set (1988).  Walleye sampled in experimental gill nets ranged in length from 6.5 to 25.4 inches with an average length of 15.7 inches.  The highest catch rate for walleye occurred off of Sugar Point (18 walleye).      Northern Pike:  The 2002 catch of northern pike per experimental gill net was identical to last year at 5.3.  Since 1983, northern pike gill net catch rates have been stable ranging from 3.6 pike/set (1993) to 6.2 pike/set (1995).  Northern pike sampled in experimental gill nets in 2002 ranged in length from 9.1 to 34.2 inches with an average length of 20.3 inches.     Muskellunge:  In 2002, no muskellunge were sampled in experimental gill nets.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and grow to sizes which are not effectively sampled with gill nets.  Muskie anglers enjoyed one of the best seasons in years.  The five day Muskie Pike Derby tournament registered  39 muskies (all fish were released), with an average length of 44.7 inches . All anglers interviewed during the 1999 creel survey released their muskellunge back into Leech Lake which illustrates a strong catch and release ethic among musky anglers.      Yellow Perch: The 2002 catch of yellow perch per experimental gill net set was 20.5 which is near the 1983-2002 average of 22.0 perch per set and up 33 percent from 2001.  Historically, yellow perch gill net catch rates have ranged from 13.5 perch/set (1983) to 37.7 perch/set (1995).  In 2002, yellow perch sampled in gill nets ranged in length from 4.3 to 12.6 inches with an average length of 6.8 inches. Of the 738 yellow perch sampled with gill nets, 6.4% were >10 inches.  The 47 yellow perch sampled >10 inches is the lowest number sampled since 1987.  Sampled yellow perch were also examined for the presence of Heterosporis.  Of the fish examined, 37 are believed infected which correlates to approximately 6.7 percent.  If confirmed, this is approximately double the 2001 infection rate yet below levels found in 2000.  Tissue samples were taken from suspect fish to confirm the presence of the parasite.     Cisco: The 2002 catch of cisco per experimental gill net set was 1.6.  Since 1983, gill net catch rates for cisco have varied considerably ranging from the last year's low of 1.3 cisco/set  to 18.5 cisco/set (1987).  Cisco sampled in gill nets in 2002 ranged in length from 6.8 to 17.1 inches with an average length of 11.0 inches.     Leech Lake also provides quality angling opportunities for largemouth bass, black crappie, and sunfish in several shallow vegetated bays.  These species are not effectively sampled with gill nets. One smallmouth bass was sampled in a gillnet, marking the first time a smallmouth has been sampled by DNR gear.  Anglers report occasional catches of smallmouth bass around Bear and Pelican Islands.     To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of Leech Lake.  Best management practices should be employed when developing a shoreline.  Careless development within the watershed and the loss of upland and aquatic vegetation can accelerate the natural aging of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain the current water quality of Leech Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status of the Fishery (as of 2/9/2022) <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake has an irregular shape with a variety of large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths approach 160 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge are the primary predator species, while Yellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, and includes excellent fishing opportunities for Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Muskellunge, Largemouth Bass, Sunfish, and Black Crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nThe MN DNR convened a citizen input committee (Leech Lake Fisheries Input Group; LLFIG) comprised of 16 stakeholders representing local and statewide interests in Leech Lake management.  This group assisted the MN DNR in developing a list of sportfish population goals, objectives, and management actions.  These recommendations were incorporated into the DNR's 2016-2020 Fisheries Management Plan for Leech Lake and were updated with input from the group for 2021-2025.  <br> \n <br> \nThe current Walleye regulation on Leech Lake is a 4 fish limit with no more than 1 Walleye over 20\" allowed in possession effective in 2019. The objectives of this regulation change at the time were to return spawner stock biomass to the goal range while providing additional harvest opportunity to anglers.  The regulation is evaluated annually and adjustments are made based on management plan objectives and action items.   <br> \n <br> \nA crappie possession limit of 5 and Sunfish possession limit of 5 were proposed in 2020 with implementation in 2021 as part of a statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  This regulation will also be evaluated utilizing future creel surveys and targeted spring sampling. The regulations are intended to maintain size structure of both species. <br> \n <br> \nUpdates on specific species are provided below: <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the current sampling plan that began being implemented in 1983, Walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2021 catch rate was 12.1 fish/net which was slightly above the management objective of 7-10 fish/net. Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 7 to 31 inches, and included a number of younger year classes that will be large enough to harvest in the next year or two.  Fourteen percent of the Walleye in the 2021 sample were over 20 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The gillnet catch rate of Northern Pike was 4.1 fish/net.  Northern Pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.6 fish/net (1993) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.7 fish/net.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 10 to 34 inches. There is a 10 fish possession limit with not more than 2 over 26\", all from 22-26\" must be immediately released.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: Since 2015, the MNDNR has worked with Muskellunge tournament participants on Leech Lake to collect creel information.  In 2021, DNR staff were able to obtain creel interviews from Don's Portage Bay Classic and Frank Schneider Memorial participants.  Information on hours fished as well as the number and size of fish that were caught is collected.  Lengths of tournament Muskellunge caught on Leech ranged from 20 to 50 inches. There is a 54\" minimum size limit with only 1 allowed in possession.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Gill net catch rates were 10.5 (fish/net) in 2021. Historical catch rates have ranged from 9.4 fish/net (2016) to 37.7 fish/net (1995). Yellow Perch sampled ranged from 5 to 11 inches with 31 percent of fish 8.0 inches or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco): The gill net catch rate was 7.3 fish/net, which was above the long-term average (5.5 fish/net). Catch rates have ranged from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987). Tullibee sampled ranged from 6 to 16 inches. High summer water temperatures causing summer kills have potentially been the source of Tullibee catch rates remaining relatively low since 1995.  However, no significant summer kill events have been observed since 2012. Within the Leech Lake Reservation the Whitefish limit is 25 and the Tullibee (Cisco) limit is 50, which is an exception to the statewide regulation.  Daily and possession limits are the same.  <br> \n <br> \nBass: A Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie assessment occurred during the springs of 2012, 2015, and 2018.  Catch rates for Largemouth Bass ? 15 inches were similar among years (range: 3 to 6 fish/hour). Lengths in 2018 ranged from 3 to 19 inches. Anglers can find quality bass fishing opportunities in the beds of mixed vegetation in most major bays. Smallmouth Bass have always been present but are infrequently sampled or caught by anglers. Their population density is low but catch rates have been steadily increasing in the most recent creel surveys and during mid-summer sampling for age-0 fishes.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill: Spring electrofishing catch rates for all Bluegill (30 fish/hour) were lower than the 2015 (47 fish/hour) and 2012 (33 fish/hour) catch rates.  Size quality is high with lengths sampled in 2018 ranging from 2 to 10 inches; 20 percent of the Bluegill sampled were over 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie: Spring electrofishing catch rates for all Black Crappie were 4 fish/hour in 2018, compared to 9 fish/hour in 2015 and 5 fish/hour in 2012.  Lengths in 2018 ranged from 4 to 14 inches and 44 percent were 10 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nAquatic invasive species currently found in Leech Lake include Banded Mystery Snails, Curly-leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil, Heterosporosis, Purple Loosestrife, Rusty Crayfish, Starry Stonewort and Zebra Mussels.  Other aquatic invasive species such as Spiny Waterfleas are increasing in prevalence throughout Minnesota and pose a likely risk but have not been found in Leech Lake to date.  Anglers and boaters alike are encouraged to review and adhere to rules requiring proper bait disposal, draining all water from bait containers, live wells, bilge, and the watercraft, and properly inspecting and removing all plants and animals from the watercraft, anchor, and trailer when leaving a lake.  Information on invasive species issues and prevention can be found by searching MNDNR invasive species in your preferred internet search engine or by calling your local DNR office. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status of the Fishery (as of 3/1/2024) <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake has an irregular shape with a variety of large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths approach 160 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge are the primary predator species, while Yellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, and includes excellent fishing opportunities for Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Muskellunge, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Sunfish and Black Crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nThe MN DNR convened a citizen input committee (Leech Lake Fisheries Input Group; LLFIG) comprised of 16 stakeholders representing local and statewide interests in Leech Lake management.  This group assisted the MN DNR in developing a list of sportfish population goals, objectives, and management actions.  These recommendations were incorporated into the DNR's 2016-2020 Fisheries Management Plan for Leech Lake and were updated with input from the group for 2021-2025.  <br> \n <br> \nThe current Walleye regulation on Leech Lake is a 4 fish limit with no more than 1 Walleye over 20\" allowed in possession which came into effect in 2019. The objectives of this regulation change at the time was to bring the number of female spawners into the optimal reproductive range for the lake and provide additional harvest opportunity to anglers.  The regulation is evaluated annually and adjustments will be made based on management plan objectives and action items.   <br> \n <br> \nA crappie possession limit of 5 and Sunfish possession limit of 5 were proposed in 2020 with implementation in 2021 as part of a statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  This regulation will also be evaluated utilizing future creel surveys and targeted spring sampling. The regulations are intended to reduce exploitation and maintain size structure and abundance of both species. <br> \n <br> \nUpdates on specific species are provided below: <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the current sampling plan that began being implemented in 1983, Walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2023 catch rate was 9.9 fish/net which was within the management objective of 7-10 fish/net. Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 7 to 28 inches, and included a number of younger year classes that will be large enough to harvest this year.  Sixteen percent of the Walleye in the 2023 sample were over 20 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The gillnet catch rate of Northern Pike was 3.4 fish/net.  Northern Pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.3 fish/net (2022) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.6 fish/net.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 13 to 36 inches. There is a 10 fish possession limit with none allowed from a 22-26\" protected slot limit and only 2 over 26\" allowed in possession.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: Since 2015, the MNDNR has worked with Muskellunge tournament participants on Leech Lake to collect creel information.  In 2023, DNR staff were able to obtain creel interviews from Don's Portage Bay Classic and Frank Schneider Memorial participants.  Information on hours fished as well as the number and size of fish that were caught is collected.  Lengths of tournament Muskellunge caught on Leech ranged from 25 to 51 inches and the average time it took tournament anglers to catch a Muskellunge was 42 hours. There is a 54\" minimum size limit with only 1 allowed in possession.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Gill net catch rates were 8.1 (fish/net) in 2023. Historical catch rates have ranged from 8.1 fish/net (2023) to 37.7 fish/net (1995). Yellow Perch sampled ranged from 4 to 14 inches with 27 percent of fish 8.0 inches or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco): The gill net catch rate was 0.6 fish/net, which was well below the long-term average (4.2 fish/net). Catch rates have ranged from 0.6 fish/net (2006, 2023) to 18.5 fish/net (1987). Tullibee sampled ranged from 7 to 18 inches. High summer water temperatures causing summer kills have potentially been the source of Tullibee catch rates remaining relatively low since 1995.  However, no significant summer kill events have been observed since 2012. Within the Leech Lake Reservation the Whitefish limit is 25 and the Tullibee (Cisco) limit is 50, which is an exception to the statewide regulation.  Daily and possession limits are the same.  <br> \n <br> \nBass: A Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie assessment occurred during the springs of 2012, 2015, 2018 and 2022. The next assessment is scheduled for the spring on 2026.  Catch rates for Largemouth Bass ? 15 inches were similar among years (range: 3 to 6 fish/hour). Lengths in 2022 ranged from 7 to 18 inches. Anglers can find quality bass fishing opportunities in the beds of mixed vegetation in most major bays. Their population density is low but catch rates have been steadily increasing in the most recent creel surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill: Spring electrofishing catch rates for all Bluegill (67 fish/hour) in 2022 were higher than the 2018 (30 fish/hour) and 2015 (46 fish/hour) catch rates.  Size quality is high with lengths sampled in 2022 ranging from 2 to 10 inches; 20 percent of the Bluegill sampled were over 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie: Spring electrofishing catch rates for all Black Crappie were 11 fish/hour in 2022, compared to 4 fish/hour in 2018.  Lengths in 2022 ranged from 4 to 14 inches and 37 percent were 10 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nAquatic invasive species currently found in Leech Lake include Banded Mystery Snails, curly-leaf pondweed, Eurasian watermilfoil, Heterosporosis, purple loosestrife, Rusty Crayfish, starry stonewort and Zebra Mussels.  Other aquatic invasive species such as Spiny Waterfleas are increasing in prevalence throughout Minnesota and pose a likely risk but have not been found in Leech Lake to date.  Anglers and boaters alike are encouraged to review and adhere to rules requiring proper bait disposal, draining all water from bait containers, live wells, bilge, and the watercraft, and properly inspecting and removing all plants and animals from the watercraft, anchor, and trailer when leaving a lake.  Information on invasive species issues and prevention can be found by searching MNDNR invasive species in your preferred internet search engine or by calling your local DNR office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>THE 1990 AVERAGE CATCH OF WAE PER EXPERIMENTAL GILL NET SET WAS 8.3 FISH; THIS IS 0.1 FISH HIGHER THAN THE OVERALL AVERAGE OF 8.2 FISH PER SET FROM 1983-90.  OF THESE EIGHT YEARS, 1990 EXHIBITED THE THIRD HIGHEST WAE CATCH.  THE LOWEST OCCURRED IN 1983 WITH 5.3 WAE PER SET, AND THE HIGHEST IN 1988 13.4 PER SET.  THE SECOND HIGHEST CATCH OCCURRED IN 1989 WITH 11.7 WAE PER SET.  THE HIGHER CATCHES OF 1988 AND 1989 WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG 1985, 1986, AND 1988 YEAR CLASSES.  IT IS EXPECTED THESE YEAR CLASSES WILL COMPRISE THE MAJORITY OF THE 1990 NET CATCHES, HOWEVER AGING OF FISH NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED TO CONFIRM THIS.  THE AVERAGE TOTAL LENGTH OF WAE CAUGHT IN EXPERIMENTAL GILL NETS DURING 1990 WAS 14.0 INCHES, AND THE AVERAGE WEIGHT 1.0 POUNDS.  THE AVERAGE TOTAL LENGTH OF WAE SINCE SURVEYS BEGAN IN 1943 IS 13.8 INCHES, AND THE LARGEST DEVIATION FROM THIS VALUE OCCURRED IN 1950 WHEN THE AVERAGE WAS 14.8 INCHES.  THE AVERAGE WEIGHT FOR THIS PERIOD IS 1.0 POUNDS, END THE LARGEST DEVIATIONS OCCURRED DURING 1950 AND 1986 WHEN THE AVERAGES WERE 1.2 POUNDS.  OF THE 300 WAE CAUGHT IN THE GILL NETS, 56% WERE FEMALES AND 44% WERE MALES.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 1988 NETTING, 1990 EXHIBITED THE MOST PROMINENT NUMBER OF REPORTS DURING THE SUMMER SUGGESTED POOR WAE FISHING SUCCESS.  THIS POOR SUCCESS MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO AN ABUNDANT POPULATION OF THE FORAGE SPECIES YEP.  BOTH SUMMER TRAWLING AND FALL GILL NETTING EXHIBITED THE HIGHEST CATCHES FOR THIS SPECIES SINCE THE LARGE LAKE SAMPLING PROGRAM BEGAN IN 1983.  A WINTER CREEL SURVEY IS BEING CONDUCTED DURING 1990-91, AND SUMMER CREEL SURVEY WILL BE PERFORMED DURING 1991.  GIVEN THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE WAE POPULATION IN LEECH LAKE, IT IS EXPECTED THESE CREEL SURVEYS MAY SHOW BETTER THAN AVERAGE FISHING SUCCESS FOR WAE.  THE 1990 AVERAGE CATCH OF NOP PER EXPERIMENTAL GILL NET SET WAS 5.3 FISH; THIS IS 0.7 FISH HIGHER THAN THE OVERALL AVERAGE OF 4.6 FISH PER SET FROM 1983-90.  OF THESE EIGHT YEARS, 1990 EXHIBITED THE SECOND HIGH- EST NOP CATCH.  THE LOWEST CATCH OCCURRED IN 1984 WITH 3.7 NOP PER SET, AND THE HIGHEST IN 1989 WITH 5.8 PER SET.  THE AVERAGE TOTAL LENGTH OF NOP CAUGHT IN EXPERIMENTAL GILL NETS DURING 1990 WAS 20.6 INCHES, AND THE AVERAGE WEIGHT 2.1 POUNDS. THE AVERAGE TOTAL LENGTH OF NOP SINCE TOTAL LENGTH DATA COLLECTION BEGAN IN 1985 IS 20.8 INCHES, AND THE LARGEST DEVIATION FROM THIS VALUE OCCURRED IN 1986 WHEN THE AVERAGE WAS 21.9 INCHES.  THE AVERAGE WEIGHT SINCE WEIGHT DATA COLLECTION BEGAN IN 1950 IS 2.2 POUNDS, AND THE LARGEST DEVIATION OCCURRED DURING 1986 WHEN THE AVERAGE WAS 2.8 POUNDS.  OF THE 192 NOP CAUGHT IN THE GILL NETS, 51% WERE FEMALES AND 49% WERE MALES.  THE 1990 AVERAGE CATCH OF YEP PER EXPERIMENTAL GILL NET SET WAS 33.7 FISH; THIS IS 14.4 FISH HIGHER THAN THE OVERALL AVERAGE OF 19.3 FISH PER SET FROM 1983-90. OF THESE EIGHT YEARS, 1990 EXHIBITED THE HIGHEST YEP CATCH.  THE LOWEST CATCH OCCURRED IN 1986 WITH 13.2 YEP PER SET.  THE AVERAGE TOTAL LENGTH OF YEP CAUGHT IN EXPERIMENTAL GILL NETS DURING 1990 WAS 7.7 INCHES, AND THE AVERAGE WEIGHT 0.2 POUNDS. THE AVERAGE TOTAL LENGTH OF YEP SINCE TOTAL LENGTH DATA COLLECTION BEGAN IN 1986 IS 7.6 INCHES, AND THE LARGEST DEVIATION FROM THIS VALUE OCCURRED IN 1987 WHEN THE AVERAGE WAS 7.4 INCHES.  THE AVERAGE WEIGHT SINCE WEIGHT DATA COLLECTION BEGAN IN 1950 IS 0.3 POUNDS, AND NO YEAR'S AVERAGE DEVIATED MORE THAN 0.1 POUNDS FROM THIS VALUE.  OF THE 1,212 YEP CAUGHT IN THE GILL NETS, 61% WERE FEMALES AND 39% WERE MALES.  THE 1990 AVERAGE CATCH OF CISCO PER EXPERIMENTAL GILL NET SET WAS 5.9 FISH; THIS IS 0.2 FISH LOWER THAN THE OVERALL AVERAGE OF 6.1 FISH PER SET FROM 1983-90.  OF THESE EIGHT YEARS, 1990 EXHIBITED THE FIFTH HIGHEST CISCO CATCH.  THE LOWEST CATCH OCCURRED IN 1989 WITH 2.1 CISCO PER SET, AND THE HIGHEST IN 1986 WITH 14.1 PER SET. THE AVERAGE TOTAL LENGTH OF CISCO CAUGHT IN EXPERIMENTAL GILL NETS DURING 1990 WAS 8.5 INCHES, AND THE AVERAGE WEIGHT 0.2 POUNDS.  THE AVERAGE TOTAL LENGTH OF CISCO COLLECTED SINCE THE LARGE LAKE SAMPLING PROGRAM BEGAN WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT.  THE AVERAGE WEIGHT SINCE 1983 IS 0.6 POUNDS, AND THE LARGEST DEVIATIONS OCCURRED DURING  1984 AND 1990 WHEN THE AVERAGES WERE 1.0 AND 0.2 POUNDS RESPECTIVELY.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>WALLEYE: The 1997 catch of walleye per experimental gillnet lift was 5.7 (Table 1). This catch was lower than the 1996 catch (9.5/lift) but within the range of values experienced since annual sampling of Leech Lake began (1983). Historically, catch rates have ranged from 13.4/lift (1988) to 4.6/lift (1993; Table 2). The predicted near record walleye catch rate for 1997 was not realized. Possible explanations include:     1) High water clarity may have caused walleye to use areas \t        of the lake not sampled.     2) Yellow perch experienced excellent reproduction that             increased food availability and may have lessened travel         needed to obtain food.This would reduce the probability          of encountering a gillnet.      3) Increased mortality reduced numbers of walleye present           in the lake.Examination of the length frequency distribution showed fewer walleye were sampled throughout the distribution and not just the components subjected to exploitation (Table 5). Considering the consistency of walleye reproduction since 1994, it appears environmental factors influenced walleye catch rates and not increased mortality. Preliminary indications are; the 1994 and 1995 walleye year classes continue to comprise a large percentage of sampled walleye. The 1996 year class is also well represented. Because of growth of walleye from the 1994 and 1995 year classes, average length and weight have increased from the record low values in 1996 (13.1 inches and 0.9 pounds) to 13.9 inches and 1.1 pounds (Table 1). Average length and weight should continue to increase until the next large year class is recruited to the gillnet.In 1997, Leech Lake anglers and resort owners reported good walleye angling during the open water season. Some concern was expressed regarding the lack of 2-pound walleye and the large numbers of relatively small walleye. In 1995 and 1996, just the opposite was true. Anglers were concerned about few small walleye being caught. Both events were a result of poor recruitment of the 1992 and 1993 year classes. Reproduction was good in 1992, but a shortage of food caused both year classes to experience high mortality and poor recruitment.Although a large yellow perch hatch in 1997 may slow angling success in 1998, especially during midsummer, anglers can expect good walleye action. The 1994 and 1995 year classes are acceptable to anglers and present in large numbers. Near mid-August, the 1996 year class will also begin to be large enough for anglers to harvest. These three year classes coupled with 1988 and 1991 year-classes will provide good walleye angling opportunities for years to come on Leech Lake.NORTHERN PIKE: The 1997 catch of northern pike per experimental gill net set was 5.1 (Table 1). This catch rate was higher than the 1983-1997 average (4.7 northern pike per set). Sampled northern pike averaged 21.0 inches and 2.4 pounds and was similar to the 1983-1997 average (21.1 inches and 2.3 pounds). Of the 180 northern pike sampled, 62 percent were female and 38 percent were male (Table 6). Northern pike angling was again reported to be good this past year. During the International Muskellunge Tournament held in early September, more northern pike larger than 36 inches were reported from Leech Lake than all other lakes.   YELLOW PERCH: The 1997 catch of yellow perch per experimental gill net set was 32.1 (Table 1). This catch was the third highest since the large lake program began (1983). The lowest catch occurred in 1986 (13.2 yellow perch per set) and the highest in 1995 (37.7 yellow perch per set; Table 2). The 1997 average length of sampled yellow perch was 7.5 inches. This average declined for the first time since 1992. Recruitment to the gillnet of a strong year class was responsible for the decline in 1992 and likely will be responsible for the decline in 1997. This will be determined once age and growth data are analyzed. As in most previous sampling, the average weight of sampled yellow perch was 0.2 pounds.  No year has deviated more than 0.1 pounds from this average.  Sex was determined for 1006 of the 1124 yellow perch sampled (Table 6).  Of those, 60% were females and 40% were males. Female yellow perch have consistently outnumbered males because of gill net selectivity for female yellow perch.    Anglers enjoyed good success while angling for yellow perch this past year. Best success occurred from opening of fishing to mid-June and from mid-August to near freeze-up. Local conservation officers reported seeing good yellow perch success from mid-August to near freeze-up. Some over-limit citations were issued.CISCO: The 1997 catch of cisco per experimental gill net set was 4.2. This catch is considerably lower than the 1983-97 average (7.7 cisco per set; Table 1). The average length and weight (11.8 inches and 0.6 pounds) of cisco sampled during 1997 were similar to overall averages (10.7 inches and 0.6 pounds). The largest deviations from these overall averages occurred in 1984 (13.4 inches and 1.0 pounds) and 1990 (8.5 inches and 0.2 pounds). Cisco catch rates have varied considerably between years and may not be a reliable indicator of abundance (Table 2). Since 1983, catch rates have ranged from 2.1 (1989) to 18.5 (1987).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, whereas yellow perch and cisco are principal forage species.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers for its excellent walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge fishing. Walleye:  The 1998 catch of walleye per experimental gill net set was 11.6.  This catch rate was more than twice the number of walleye sampled per gill net set in 1997.  Historically, catch rates have ranged from 4.6 walleye/set (1993) to 13.4 walleye/set (1988).  The increase in gill net catch can be attributed to the      production of relatively strong year classes in recent years.  Analyses suggest the 1994 and 1995 year classes continue to comprise a large percentage of sampled walleye.  Early indications also suggest a relatively strong year class was produced in 1997.  Good numbers of walleye of quality size (>15 inches) should be present for the 1999 fishing season.   Walleye sampled in experimental gill nets ranged in length from 6.9 to 26 inches with an average length of 13.2 inches.  The average length of walleye decreased slightly since 1997 (13.9 inches).  This decline was most likely the result of the 1997 year class fish becoming susceptible the gill net.  In addition, walleye from the relatively strong 1988 and 1991 year classes have grown to sizes which are not sampled effectively with gill nets.Northern pike:  The 1998 catch of northern pike per experimental gill net set was 5.1.  Since 1983, northern pike gill net catch rates have been relatively stable ranging from 3.6 pike/set (1993) to 6.2 pike/set (1995).  Northern pike sampled in experimental gill nets in 1998 ranged in length from 8.5 to 36.6 inches with an average length of 20.9 inches. Muskellunge:  In 1998, two muskellunge were sampled in experimental gill nets.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and grow to sizes which are not effectively sampled with gill nets.Yellow perch:  The 1998 catch of yellow perch per experimental gill net set was 28.6.  Historically, yellow perch gill net catch rates have ranged from 13.5 perch/set (1983) to 37.7 perch/set (1995).  In 1998, yellow perch sampled in gill nets ranged in length from 5.3 to 12.5 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches.Cisco:  The 1998 catch of cisco per experimental gill nets set was 3.7.  Since 1983, gill net catch rates for cisco have varied considerably ranging from 2.1 cisco/set (1989) to 18.5 cisco/set (1987).  Cisco sampled in gill nets in 1998 ranged in length from 6.9 to 15.5 inches with an average length of 10.4 inches.     To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of Leech Lake.  Best management practices should be employed when developing a shoreline.  Careless development within the watershed and the loss of upland and aquatic vegetation can accelerate the natural aging of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain the current water quality of Leech Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, whereas yellow perch and cisco are principal forage species.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers for its excellent walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge fishing.  Summer angling pressure on Leech Lake has increased nearly 50% since the mid 1960's.  This trend of increasing angling pressure has been occurring statewide.  Fortunately, most of Leech Lake's fish populations have remained relatively healthy with this increase in fishing pressure.  However, yellow perch harvest has been increasing through time, and the proportion of larger fish has been declining.  As more and more pressure is placed on our fisheries resources, management of harvest must become more restrictive to maintain a balanced fish population and provide quality angling opportunities for the future.Walleye:  The 1999 catch of walleye per experimental gillnet set was 8.9 which is comparable to the 1983-1999 average of 7.8 walleye per set.  Historically, catch rates have ranged from 4.6 walleye/set (1993) to 13.4 walleye/set (1988).  The walleye population contains several relatively strong year classes and good numbers of walleye of quality length (> 15 inches) should be present for the 2000 fishing season.   Walleye sampled in experimental gillnets ranged in length from 5.5 to 26.0 inches with an average length of 14.5 inches.  The average length of walleye increased since 1998.  This increase can be attributed to growth of individual walleye especially from the relatively strong 1994 and 1995 year classes.   Northern Pike:  The 1999 catch of northern pike per experimental gillnet was 3.7.  Since 1983, northern pike gillnet catch rates have been stable ranging from 3.6 pike/set (1993) to 6.2 pike/set (1995).  Northern pike sampled in experimental gillnets in 1999 ranged in length from 9.0 to 38.5 inches with an average length of 21.9 inches.Muskellunge:  In 1999, one muskellunge was sampled in experimental gillnets.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and grow to sizes which are not effectively sampled with gillnets.  Several 50+ inch muskellunge were reported caught by anglers in 1999.       In 1999, it took the average musky angler approximately 37 hours to catch a muskellunge.  All anglers interviewed during our creel survey released their muskellunge back into Leech Lake which illustrates the catch and release ethic among musky anglers.  The average size of angler caught muskellunge of legal size (>40 inches) was 43.3 inches. Yellow Perch: The 1999 catch of yellow perch per experimental gillnet set was 21.1 which is comparable to the 1983-1999 average of 22.5 perch per set.  Historically, yellow perch gillnet catch rates have ranged from 13.5 perch/set (1983) to 37.7 perch/set (1995).  In 1999, yellow perch sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 5.0 to 12.9 inches with an average length of 7.9 inches.   Cisco: The 1999 catch of cisco per experimental gillnet set was 3.1.  Since 1983, gillnet catch rates for cisco have varied considerably ranging from 2.1 cisco/set (1989) to 18.5 cisco/set (1987).  Cisco sampled in gillnets in 1999 ranged in length from 5.9 to 16.9 inches with an average length of 10.2 inches.  Leech Lake also provides quality angling opportunities for largemouth bass, black crappie, and sunfish in several shallow vegetated bays.  These species are not effectively sampled with gillnets.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of Leech Lake.  Best management practices should be employed when developing a shoreline.  Careless development within the watershed and the loss of upland and aquatic vegetation can accelerate the natural aging of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain the current water quality of Leech Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Additionally, scientists recently identified a new yellow perch parasite found in Leech Lake and the Eagle River Chain of Lakes in Wisconsin.  This microscopic parasite, Heterosporis, is rare in sportfish and causes the flesh to have a \"cooked\" or \"freezer burned\" appearance.  Although infected muscle cells reduce the quality and change the texture of the fillet, there is no evidence that an infected perch is unsafe to eat.  Most people choose to discard affected portions of fillets.  To help prevent the spread of this parasite, infected fish remains should not be thrown back into the water, boat exteriors and other equipment should be thoroughly dried, and live wells and bilges should be disinfected with bleach before moving to other bodies of water.   </p>",

Historically, catch rates have ranged from 4.6 walleye/set (1993) to 13.4 walleye/set (1988).  Walleye sampled in experimental gill nets ranged in length from 6.6 to 24.1 inches with an average length of 16.7 inches.  The highest catch rate for walleye occurred off of Stoney Point (14 walleye).      Northern Pike:  The 2003 catch of northern pike per experimental gill net was similar to previous catches at 5.0 per set.  Since 1983, northern pike gill net catch rates have been stable ranging from 3.6 pike/set (1993) to 6.2 pike/set (1995).  Northern pike sampled in experimental gill nets in 2003 ranged in length from 8.9 to 36.2 inches with an average length of 20.6 inches.     Muskellunge:  In 2003, no muskellunge were sampled in experimental gill nets.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and grow to sizes which are not effectively sampled with gill nets.  The Muskie/Northern Pike Derby Days (July 26-31) registered 28 muskies, all of which were released. A tournament held September 5-7 on various lakes registered 48 caught-and-released Leech Lake muskies.  Each tournament's largest muskie exceeded 50 inches.     Yellow Perch: The 2003 catch of yellow perch per experimental gill net set was 16.2 which is below the 1983-2003 average of 21.7 perch per set and down 21 percent from 2002.  Historically, yellow perch gill net catch rates have ranged from 13.5 perch/set (1983) to 37.7 perch/set (1995).  In 2003, yellow perch sampled in gill nets ranged in length from 4.9 to 11.9 inches with an average length of 6.9 inches. Of the 586 yellow perch sampled with gill nets, 6.4% were 10 inches or larger, which is similar to 2002 sampling.     A graduate student at the University of Wisconsin- La Crosse microscopically examined a subsample of yellow perch for the presence of the parasite Heterosporis.  Of the 223 yellow perch examined, 48 (21.5%) were infected.  This is higher than previous estimates that were based on visual examination.     Cisco: The 2003 catch of cisco per experimental gill net set was 0.9, the lowest catch rate observed.  Since 1983, gill net catch rates for cisco have varied considerably ranging from this year's  low to 18.5 cisco/set (1987).  Cisco sampled in gill nets in 2003 ranged in length from 6.2 to 17.5 inches with an average length of 10.8 inches.  In late summer 2003, a significant summer kill of cisco was noted in Walker Bay.     Leech Lake also provides quality angling opportunities for largemouth bass, black crappie, and sunfish in several shallow vegetated bays. These species are not effectively sampled with gill nets.  Anglers report occasional catches of smallmouth bass around Bear and Pelican Islands.     To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of Leech Lake.  Best management practices should be employed when developing a shoreline.  Careless development within the watershed and the loss of upland and aquatic vegetation can accelerate the natural aging of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain the current water quality of Leech Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, including excellent fishing opportunities for walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, muskellunge, largemouth bass, sunfish, and black crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake has been surveyed annually with standardized assessments since 1983.  Establishment of long-term data sets on Leech Lake and Minnesota's other large walleye lakes allow biologists to compare current observations against historical averages.  These long-term data sets can also provide insight into other lakes having similar physical and biological properties that are not sampled as frequently.  Population metrics for a particular species, such as the highs and lows in gill net catch rates or the growth rates of fish, are constantly changing as they move from one extreme of their observed normal range to the other, much like a pendulum.  While highs and lows are normal and rarely sustained past one year, consecutive observations at either extreme can be indicative of changes to an ecosystem.  These may include exotic species introductions, shifts in habitat availability and/or quality, beneficial or adverse environmental conditions, and increased or decreased competition for resources between species or among different year classes of the same species.  Regardless, it is important to remember that all populations of flora and fauna fluctuate dramatically and that this natural variability is strongly influenced by the changing environment in which they live as well as the other species of plants and animals they share it with.   <br> \n <br> \nThe MN DNR convened a citizen input committee (Leech Lake Advisory Committee; LLAC) comprised of stakeholders representing local and statewide interests in Leech Lake management.  This group outlined walleye population management objectives and actions, including double-crested cormorant control, the walleye regulation, and walleye fry stocking (LLAC 2010).  These recommendations were incorporated into DNR's Leech Lake Management Plan, 2011-2015.  These management goals, where appropriate, are referenced in this report.  <br> \n <br> \nEffective May 10, 2014 all walleye between 20.0-26.0 inches long must be immediately returned to the water, a possession limit of 4 walleye with one longer than 26.0\" allowed in possession.  This regulation is intended to provide additional harvest opportunity while still protecting most of the mature female walleye in the population, and received majority support from the public comment period held during fall 2013. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nAquatic invasive species currently found in Leech Lake include rusty crayfish, heterosporosis, curly-leaf pondweed, Eurasian watermilfoil, purple loosestrife, and banded mystery snail.  Eurasian watermilfoil is beginning to establish in open-water areas of the lake.  Other aquatic invasive species such as zebra mussels and spiny waterflea are increasing in prevalence throughout Minnesota and pose a likely risk.  Anglers and boaters alike are encouraged to review and adhere to rules requiring proper bait disposal, draining all water from bait containers, livewells, bilge, and the watercraft, and properly inspecting and removing all plants and animals from the watercraft, anchor, and trailer when leaving a lake.  Information on invasive species issues and prevention can be found at www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/index_aquatic/.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the Large Lake Program began in 1983, walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2013 catch of walleye per gillnet set was 8.9 fish/net and remains above the 1983-2013 average of 7.7 fish/net.  Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 6 to 27 inches.  Observed median lengths of the 2011, 2010, and 2009 year classes were approximately 10, 13, and 15 inches TL, respectively.  The percent of walleye sampled with gillnets in 2013 less than 15 inches (42%) indicates a higher percentage of larger walleye is currently present.  Good 2010 through 2012 year-classes will provide harvest opportunities on the 2014 opener and continue to be available throughout the next several seasons.  Additionally, 23% of walleye sampled in gillnets were 20-26\" and will provide anglers the opportunity to catch a large fish.  The proportion of protected fish sampled in gillnets closely mirrors the proportion of protected fish caught by anglers.  Based on the return of the walleye population to its pre-2000 status, the population is fully recovered. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The 2012 gillnet catch rate of northern pike was 4.6 fish/net.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.6 fish/net (1993) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.8 fish/net.  Northern pike captured in 2013 gillnet sets ranged in length from 8 to 32 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: Only one muskellunge were sampled in gillnet sets during 2013.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and exceed sizes effectively sampled with gillnets.  Muskellunge eggs were collected in 2013 for the statewide muskellunge stocking program and fish up to 53 inches long were captured.  Overall, anglers reported a good 2013 season.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Gillnet catch rates of yellow perch have ranged from 12.1 fish/net (2013) to 37.7 fish/net (1995).  The 2013 catch rate of 12.1 fish/net was the lowest observed since standardized sampling began in 1983.  This compares to the 1983-2013 average of 21.4 fish/net.  Yellow perch sampled in 2013 gillnet sets ranged in length from 3 to 12 inches.  Of the total perch caught, 34% were 8 inches and longer and 11% were 10 inches and longer. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nCisco: The 2013 catch rate of cisco per gillnet set was 3.3 fish/net and was below the long-term average of 5.4 fish/net.  Gillnet catch rates of cisco have varied considerably, ranging from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987).  Warmer summers causing summer kills have probably been the source of cisco catch rates remaining below average since 1995, except in 2009.  Age-2 and -6 fish were the most commonly sampled age-classes in 2013 and made up 88% of individuals sampled.  Lengths of cisco sampled ranged from 7 to 17 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass: The next scheduled lakewide Centrarchid (bass/bluegill/crappie) survey is scheduled for spring 2015.  The 2012 lakewide electrofishing catch rate of largemouth bass was 15.9 fish/hour.  Largemouth bass sampled in 2012 ranged in length from 2 to 19 inches.  Of all largemouth bass caught, 41% were 15 inches or longer.  Anglers can find quality bass fishing opportunities in the sprawling beds of mixed vegetation in the major bays.  Anglers also report occasional catches of smallmouth bass, which have always been present but in low numbers.  Only one smallmouth bass was captured during the 2012 electrofishing survey.  Only one smallmouth bass has been sampled in a gill net since standardized sampling began in 1983. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBluegill: The 2012 lakewide electrofishing catch rate of bluegill was 33.1 fish/hour.  Bluegill sampled in 2012 ranged in length from 1 to 10 inches.  Of all bluegills caught, 27% were 8 inches or longer.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie: The 2012 lakewide electrofishing catch rate of black crappie was 4.8 fish/hour.  Black crappie sampled in 2012 ranged in length from 2 to 14 inches.  Of all black crappie caught, 70% were 10 inches or longer. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status of the Fishery (as of 1/5/2016)\n\nLeech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths approach 160 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, including excellent fishing opportunities for walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, muskellunge, largemouth bass, sunfish, and black crappie.  \n\nLeech Lake has been surveyed annually with standardized assessments since 1983.  Establishment of long-term data sets on Leech Lake and Minnesota's other large walleye lakes allow biologists to compare current observations against historical averages.  These long-term data sets can also provide insight into other lakes having similar physical and biological properties that are not sampled as frequently.  Population metrics for a particular species, such as the highs and lows in gill net catch rates or the growth rates of fish, are constantly changing as they move from one extreme of their observed normal range to the other, much like a pendulum.  While highs and lows are normal and rarely sustained beyond one year, consecutive observations at either extreme can be indicative of changes to an ecosystem.  These may include invasive species introductions, shifts in habitat availability and/or quality, beneficial or adverse environmental conditions, and increased or decreased competition for resources between species or among different year classes of the same species.  Regardless, it is important to remember that all populations of flora and fauna fluctuate dramatically and that this natural variability is strongly influenced by the changing environment in which they live as well as the other species of plants and animals they share it with.  \n\nThe MN DNR convened a citizen input committee (Leech Lake Fisheries Input Group; LLFIG) comprised of 16 stakeholders representing local and statewide interests in Leech Lake management.  This group outlined sportfish population goals, objectives, and management actions.  These recommendations were incorporated into DNR's 2016-2020 Fisheries Management Plan for Leech Lake.  These management goals, where appropriate, are referenced in this report. \n\nEffective May 10, 2014 all walleye between 20.0-26.0 inches long must be immediately returned to the water, a possession limit of 4 walleye with one longer than 26.0\" allowed in possession.  This regulation is intended to provide additional harvest opportunity while still protecting most of the mature female walleye in the population, and received majority support from the public comment period held during fall 2013. All other species are currently managed under statewide fishing regulations.\n\n\nAquatic invasive species currently found in Leech Lake include rusty crayfish, heterosporosis, curly-leaf pondweed, Eurasian watermilfoil, purple loosestrife, and banded mystery snail.  Eurasian watermilfoil is beginning to establish in open-water areas of the lake.  Other aquatic invasive species such as zebra mussels and spiny waterflea are increasing in prevalence throughout Minnesota and pose a likely risk.  Anglers and boaters alike are encouraged to review and adhere to rules requiring proper bait disposal, draining all water from bait containers, livewells, bilge, and the watercraft, and properly inspecting and removing all plants and animals from the watercraft, anchor, and trailer when leaving a lake.  Information on invasive species issues and prevention can be found at www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/index_aquatic/.  \n\nWalleye: Since the Large Lake Program began in 1983, walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2015 catch of walleye per gillnet set of 12.4 fish/net, the third highest catch rate in the time series, remained above the 1983-2015 average of 7.9 fish/net for the ninth consecutive year.  Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 7 to 26 inches, and demonstrated a balanced size distribution.  The average lengths of age-1 through age-4 walleye were 9.9, 12.2, 14.6, and 16.9 inches, respectively.  Good 2011 through 2013 year-classes will provide harvest opportunities on the 2016 opener and continue to be available throughout the next several seasons.  Additionally, 24% of walleye sampled in gillnets were 20-26\" and will provide anglers the opportunity to catch a larger fish.  The proportion of protected fish sampled in gillnets resembles the proportion of protected fish caught by anglers.  \n\n\nNorthern Pike: The 2015 gillnet catch rate of northern pike was 5.9 fish/net.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.6 fish/net (1993) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.8 fish/net.  Northern pike captured in 2015 gillnet sets ranged in length from 12 to 34 inches.\n\n\nMuskellunge: Muskellunge from Miller Bay near Whipholt are currently collected and spawned for the statewide broodstock program every four years, with spawning operations most recently occurring in 2013.  A total of 51 individual fish were captured in May of 2013, of which 23 were female and 28 were male.  Females ranged in length from 39-53 inches, while males ranged from 31-46 inches. Females ranged in age from six through sixteen, while males ranged in age from five through fifteen. \n\n\nYellow Perch: Gillnet catch rates of yellow perch have ranged from 12.1 fish/net (2013) to 37.7 fish/net (1995).  The 2015 catch rate of 18.6 fish/net remains below the long term average (21.1 fish/net) but continues to increase incrementally from the record low observed in 2013 (12.1 fish/net). Yellow perch sampled in 2015 gillnet sets ranged in length from 3 to 12 inches.  Of the total perch caught, 24% were 8 inches and longer and 6% were 10 inches and longer.\n\n\nCisco: The 2015 catch rate of cisco per gillnet set was 5.5 fish/net and similar to the long-term average of 5.4 fish/net.  Gillnet catch rates of cisco have varied considerably, ranging from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987).  Warmer summers causing summer kills have likely been the source of cisco catch rates remaining relatively low since 1995.  However, no summer kill events have been observed in the past three years.  The 2012 and 2013 year classes were the most frequently sampled age classes in this survey.  Lengths of cisco sampled ranged from 5 to 18 inches. Within the Leech Lake Indian Reservation the Whitefish limit is 25 and the Cisco (Tullibee) limit is 50, which is an exception to the statewide regulation.  Daily and possession limits are the same. \n\n\n\nLargemouth Bass: A spring lakewide largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie electrofishing assessment occurred in springs 2012 and 2015.  Catch rates for all largemouth bass were similar between 2015 (16 fish/hour) and 2012 (15 fish/hour).  Catch rates for fish 15 inches were also similar between 2015 (6 fish/hour) and 2012 (5 fish/hour). Length and age frequency distributions of largemouth bass sampled in 2015 ranged from 4 to 18 inches and 1 to 15 years, respectively.  Of all largemouth bass sampled in 2015, 35% were 15 inches or longer.  Anglers can find quality bass fishing opportunities in the beds of mixed vegetation in most major bays. \n\n\nBluegill: Catch rates for all bluegill were higher in 2015 (47 fish/hour) than in 2012 (31 fish/hour).  Catch rates for fish 8 inches were lower in 2015 (3 fish/hour) than in 2012 (8 fish/hour). Length and age frequency distributions of bluegill sampled in 2015 ranged from 2 to 9 inches and 3 to 13 years, respectively.  Of all bluegill sampled in 2015, 7% were 8 inches or longer.  Anglers can find quality bluegill fishing opportunities in the beds of mixed vegetation in most major bays.\n\n\nBlack Crappie: Catch rates for all black crappie were higher in 2015 (9 fish/hour) than in 2012 (5 fish/hour).  Catch rates for fish 10 inches were similar between 2015(5 fish/hour) and 2012 (4 fish/hour).  Length and age frequency distributions of black crappie sampled in 2015 ranged from 2 to 14 inches and 1 to 12 years, respectively.  Of all black crappie sampled in 2015, 62% were 10 inches or longer.  Anglers can find quality black crappie fishing opportunities in the beds of mixed vegetation in most major bays.\n\n\nLake Whitefish and Cisco survey with Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe Division of Resource Management: In the fall of 2015 the DNR coordinated with the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, Division of Resource Management to collect additional data on cisco and lake whitefish harvested by Band members.  Whitefish data were collected in October, while cisco data were collected in November. Harvested lake whitefish ranged in length from 18 to 27 inches and ages ranged from 7 to 30 years.  Length and age frequency distributions of cisco harvested in 2015 ranged from 14 to 19 inches and 4 to 10 years, respectively.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, including excellent fishing opportunities for walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, muskellunge, largemouth bass, sunfish, and black crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake has been surveyed annually with standardized assessments since 1983.  Establishment of long-term data sets on Leech Lake and Minnesota\u0019s other large walleye lakes allow biologists to compare current observations against historical averages.  These long-term data sets can also provide insight into other lakes having similar physical and biological properties that are not sampled as frequently.  Population metrics for a particular species, such as the highs and lows in gill net catch rates or the growth rates of fish, are constantly changing as they move from one extreme of their observed normal range to the other, much like a pendulum.  While highs and lows are normal and rarely sustained past one year, consecutive observations at either extreme can be indicative of changes to an ecosystem.  These may include exotic species introductions, shifts in habitat availability and/or quality, beneficial or adverse environmental conditions, and increased or decreased competition for resources between species or among year classes of the same species or among several species with similar requirements.  Regardless, it is important to remember that all populations of flora and fauna fluctuate dramatically and that this natural variability is strongly influenced by the changing environment in which they live as well as the other species of plants and animals they share it with.   <br> \n <br> \nHumans have had dramatic impacts on fish populations by altering habitats necessary for successful reproduction, growth, and survival.  In particular, lakeshores are highly sensitive areas that are vital to the overall health of our lakes.  Terrestrial vegetation provides habitat for birds, mammals, and amphibians and buffers lakes from runoff that carry chemicals and sediment.  Near-shore areas provide protection and food for the early life-stages of some species, such as walleye, and serve as year-round habitat for others, such as bluegill and largemouth bass.  Any changes that have a negative effect on these areas will adversely impact the fishery.  Therefore, protection of these sensitive areas is paramount to ensuring the sustainability and quality of Minnesota's precious water resources for future generations. <br> \n <br> \nDue to recent trends in yellow perch and walleye catch data, a five-year action plan was initiated in 2005.  Action plan objectives were to increase the relative abundance and to stabilize the population size structure of these two species.  Management activities used to meet these objectives have included more restrictive harvest regulations for walleye, cormorant control, walleye stocking, and an increased focus on habitat protection.  The annual fishery survey using experimental gill nets was completed by the Walker Area Fisheries office, MN DNR, between 7 September and 18 September 2009.  A summary of trawling data, which has been completed annually during August and is used to index the relative abundance of young-of-year (YOY) walleye, is also included. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the Large Lake Program began in 1983, walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2009 catch of walleye per experimental gillnet set was 8.61 fish/net and remains above the 1983-2009 average of 7.6 fish/net.  The increase in the walleye gillnet catch rate is due to the large year classes of walleyes produced during 2005, 2006, and 2007; 79% of walleye caught during the 2009 gillnet survey were from these three year classes.  Walleye sampled in experimental gillnets ranged in length from 5 to 27 inches.  Gillnet catch rates were higher in the main lake (12.0 fish/net) than in the western bays (4.4 fish/net).   <br> \n <br> \nStatistics from the 2009 creel survey described another excellent walleye angling season on Leech Lake.  Walleye were caught at a rate of 0.339 fish/hour and harvested at a rate of 0.110 fish/hour across all anglers; anglers specifically targeting walleye caught fish at a rate of 0.987 walleye/hour and harvested fish at a rate of 0.242 walleye/hour.  These statistics, in particular the targeting catch and harvest rates, are among the highest ever observed on Leech Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The 2009 gillnet catch rate of northern pike was 4.9 fish/net.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.6 fish/net (1993) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.8 fish/net.  Northern pike captured in 2009 gillnet sets ranged in length from 11 to 32 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers targeting northern pike during 2009 caught pike at a rate of 0.661 fish/hour and harvested pike at a rate of 0.197 fish/hour.  The average length of harvested northern pike during 2009 was 23.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: Only one muskellunge was sampled in experimental gillnet sets during 2009.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and exceed sizes that are effectively sampled with gillnets.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskie anglers averaged 0.013 fish/hour, or 1 fish/100 angler-hours, during the 2009 fishing season.  This is lower than the average for targeting anglers (0.018 fish/hour), but and is higher than the 2004-2005 average (0.009 fish/hour) and still within the range of normal.  In contrast to 2008, muskie anglers tended to catch fish more frequently in the main lake (0.020 fish/hour) than in the western bays (0.005 fish/hour) and were most successful during August and September.   <br> \n <br> \nIn cooperation with various Muskies Inc. chapters and other anglers, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources will begin efforts to estimate the size of the muskellunge population.  Anglers will be asked to collect scale samples and other information from muskies they catch while fishing Leech Lake during 2009-2010.  If you will be fishing muskies on Leech Lake during 2009-2010 and would like to assist, please contact the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Gillnet catch rates of yellow perch have ranged from 12.9 fish/net (2005) to 37.7 fish/net (1995).  The 2009 catch rate of yellow perch in experimental gillnet sets was 25.8 fish/net.  This is above the 1983-2009 average of 22.0 fish/net.  Yellow perch sampled in 2009 gillnet sets ranged in length from 5 inches to 12 inches.  Of the total perch caught, 33% were 8 inches and longer and 11% were 10 inches and longer; both of these proportions have increased during recent years. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers targeting yellow perch averaged a catch rate of 5.892 perch/hour and a harvest rate of 2.020 perch/hour during 2009.  Catch and harvest rates were highest during September. <br> \n <br> \nCisco: The 2009 catch rate of cisco per experimental gillnet set was 11.9 fish/net, well above the long-term average of 5.65 fish/net and the highest observation since 1987.  Gillnet catch rates of cisco have varied considerable, ranging from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987).  Warmer summers causing summer kills have probably been the source of cisco catch rates remaining below average since 1995.  Strong year classes were produced in recent years and have been the primary cause of increased catch rates. <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake provides quality angling opportunities for largemouth bass, black crappie, and sunfish in shallow, vegetated bays.  These species are not effectively sampled with gillnets.  Anglers also occasionally report catches of smallmouth bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, including excellent fishing opportunities for walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, muskellunge, largemouth bass, sunfish, and black crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake has been surveyed annually with standardized assessments since 1983.  Establishment of long-term data sets on Leech Lake and Minnesota's other large walleye lakes allow biologists to compare current observations against historical averages.  These long-term data sets can also provide insight into other lakes having similar physical and biological properties that are not sampled as frequently.  Population metrics for a particular species, such as the highs and lows in gill net catch rates or the growth rates of fish, are constantly changing as they move from one extreme of their observed normal range to the other, much like a pendulum.  While highs and lows are normal and rarely sustained past one year, consecutive observations at either extreme can be indicative of changes to an ecosystem.  These may include exotic species introductions, shifts in habitat availability and/or quality, beneficial or adverse environmental conditions, and increased or decreased competition for resources between species or among year classes of the same species or among several species with similar requirements.  Regardless, it is important to remember that all populations of flora and fauna fluctuate dramatically and that this natural variability is strongly influenced by the changing environment in which they live as well as the other species of plants and animals they share it with.   <br> \n <br> \nThe MN DNR convened a citizen input committee (Leech Lake Advisory Committee; LLAC) comprised of stakeholders representing local and statewide interests in Leech Lake management.  This group outlined walleye population management objectives and actions, including double-crested cormorant control, the walleye regulation, and walleye fry stocking (LLAC 2010).  These recommendations were incorporated into DNR's Leech Lake Management Plan, 2011-2015 (Schultz 2010a).  These management goals, where appropriate, are referenced in this report.  <br> \n <br> \nThe current protected slot walleye regulation (PSL) on Leech Lake (18-26\" walleye must be immediately released; possession limit of 4, one of which may be longer than 26\") was reviewed and compared to other regulation options (Schultz and Staples 2010a).  Public comment on proposed regulation changes was solicited during October, 2010.  The majority of public input supported maintaining the regulation through 2015, though some comments expressed consideration for a more liberal length limit that adjusts with measures of spawner biomass.  Therefore, if measures of spawner biomass exceed 2.0 lbs/acre during two consecutive years, DNR will consider adjusting the regulation to a 20-26\" PSL, bag of 4, one fish over 26\" allowed in possession to begin the ensuing season based on current information.  <br> \n <br> \nAquatic invasive species currently found in Leech Lake include rusty crayfish, heterosporosis, curly-leaf pondweed, Eurasian watermilfoil, purple loosestrife, and banded mystery snail.  Currently invasive plant species are not widely distributed within Leech Lake.  Other aquatic invasive species are increasing in prevalence throughout Minnesota and pose a likely risk.  Anglers and boaters alike are encouraged to review and adhere to rules requiring proper bait disposal, draining all water from bait containers, livewells, bilge, and the watercraft, and properly inspecting and removing all plants and animals from the watercraft, anchor, and trailer when leaving a lake.  Information on invasive species issues and prevention can be found at www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/index_aquatic/.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the Large Lake Program began in 1983, walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2011 catch of walleye per experimental gillnet set was 8.08 fish/net and remains above the 1983-2011 average of 7.6 fish/net.  The improvements in the walleye population can be largely contributed to above-average year classes of walleye produced during 2005-2008.  Walleye sampled in experimental gillnets ranged in length from 6 to 26 inches.  Observed median lengths of the 2010, 2009, and 2008 year classes were approximately 9, 12, and 15 inches TL, respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nStatistics from the 2011 creel survey described another good walleye angling season on Leech Lake.  Walleye were caught at a rate of 0.232 fish/hour and harvested at a rate of 0.079 fish/hour across all anglers.  Anglers specifically targeting walleye caught fish at a rate of 0.584 walleye/hour and harvested fish at a rate of 0.177 walleye/hour.  These statistics, in particular the targeting catch and harvest rates, are comparable to estimates collected during the 1990's.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The 2011 gillnet catch rate of northern pike was 5.89 fish/net.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.6 fish/net (1993) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.9 fish/net.  Northern pike captured in 2011 gillnet sets ranged in length from 10 to 37 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers targeting northern pike during 2011 caught pike at a rate of 0.640 fish/hour and harvested pike at a rate of 0.228 fish/hour.  The average length of harvested northern pike during 2010 was 23.01 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: Only two muskellunge were sampled in experimental gillnet sets during 2011.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and exceed sizes effectively sampled with gillnets.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskie anglers averaged 0.032 fish/hour, or 1 fish/31 angler-hours, during the 2011 fishing season.  This is 1.8 times higher than the long-term average for targeting anglers (0.018 fish/hour).  Catch rates were highest during August and September.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Gillnet catch rates of yellow perch have ranged from 12.9 fish/net (2005) to 37.7 fish/net (1995).  The 2011 catch rate of yellow perch in experimental gillnet sets was 17.22 fish/net.  This is above the 1983-2011 average of 21.9 fish/net.  Yellow perch sampled in 2011 gillnet sets ranged in length from 5 inches to 12 inches.  Of the total perch caught, 37% were 8 inches and longer and 13% were 10 inches and longer; both of these proportions have an increasing trend during recent years. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers targeting yellow perch averaged a catch rate of 4.988 perch/hour and a harvest rate of 1.682 perch/hour during 2011.  Catch and harvest rates were highest during August and September. <br> \n <br> \nCisco: The 2011 catch rate of cisco per experimental gillnet set was 1.86 fish/net and is above the long-term average of 5.53 fish/net.  Gillnet catch rates of cisco have varied considerable, ranging from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987).  Warmer summers causing summer kills have probably been the source of cisco catch rates remaining below average since 1995, except in 2009.  Age-2 fish were by far the most frequently sampled in 2009.  <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake also provides quality angling opportunities for largemouth bass, black crappie, and sunfish in shallow, vegetated bays.  These species are not effectively sampled with gillnets.  Anglers also occasionally report catches of smallmouth bass, which have always been present in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake has an irregular shape with a variety of large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths approach 160 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge are the primary predator species, while Yellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, and includes excellent fishing opportunities for Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Muskellunge, Largemouth Bass, Sunfish, and Black Crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nThe MN DNR convened a citizen input committee (Leech Lake Fisheries Input Group; LLFIG) comprised of 16 stakeholders representing local and statewide interests in Leech Lake management.  This group assisted the MN DNR in developing a list of sportfish population goals, objectives, and management actions.  These recommendations were incorporated into the DNR's 2016-2020 Fisheries Management Plan for Leech Lake and were updated with input from the group for 2021-2026.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye regulation on Leech Lake was changed to a 4 fish possession limit with no more than 1 Walleye over 20 inches allowed in possession, effective May 11, 2019. The objectives of this regulation change were to reduce spawner stock biomass and provide additional harvest opportunity to anglers.  The regulation will be evaluated annually and adjustments will be made based on objectives and actions outlined in the management plan.   <br> \n <br> \nA crappie possession limit of 5 and sunfish possession limit of 5 were proposed in 2020 with likely implementation in 2021 as part of a statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  This regulation will be evaluated utilizing future creel surveys and targeted spring sampling. The proposed regulations are intended to maintain and/or improve size structure and abundance of both species. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the current sampling plan that began in 1983, Walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2020 catch rate was 11.0 fish/net which was slightly above the management objective of 7-10 8.1 fish/net. Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 7 to 27 inches, and included a number of younger year classes that should be large enough to harvest in the next year or two.  Fourteen percent of the Walleye in the 2020 sample were over 20 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The gillnet catch rate of Northern Pike was 4.4 fish/net.  Northern Pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.6 fish/net (1993) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.8 fish/net.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 14 to 31 inches. There is a 10 fish possession limit; all pike from 22.0 to 26.0 inches must be immediately released, and only 2 pike over 26.0 inches are allowed in possession.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: Since 2015, the MNDNR has worked with Muskellunge tournament participants on Leech Lake to collect creel information.  In 2020, the way the DNR obtained creel interviews was different but they were still able to collect information from 298 tournament anglers. Information on hours fished, the number and size of fish that were caught was collected.  Lengths of tournament Muskellunge caught on Leech ranged from 32 to 50 inches and the average time it took tournament anglers to catch a Muskellunge was 62 hours. There is a 54 inch minimum size limit with only 1 allowed in possession.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Gill net catch rates were 14.4 (fish/net), up from 10.2 fish/net in 2018. Historical catch rates have ranged from 9.4 fish/net (2016) to 37.7 fish/net (1995). Yellow Perch sampled ranged from 5 to 13 inches with 17 percent of fish 8.0 inches or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco): The gill net catch rate was 10.2 fish/net, which was above the long-term average (5.5 fish/net). Catch rates have ranged from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987). Tullibee sampled ranged from 6 to 18 inches. High summer water temperatures causing summer kills have potentially been the source of Tullibee catch rates remaining relatively low since 1995.  However, no significant summer kill events have been observed during the past six years. Within the Leech Lake Reservation the Whitefish limit is 25 and the Tullibee (Cisco) limit is 50, which is an exception to the statewide regulation.  Daily and possession limits are the same.  <br> \n <br> \nBass: A Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie assessment occurred during the springs of 2012, 2015, and 2018.  Catch rates for Largemouth Bass ? 15 inches were similar among years (range: 3 to 6 fish/hour). Lengths in 2018 ranged from 3 to 19 inches. Anglers can find quality bass fishing opportunities in the beds of mixed vegetation in most major bays. Smallmouth Bass have always been present but are infrequently sampled or caught by anglers. Their population density is low but catch rates have been steadily increasing in the most recent creel surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill: Spring electrofishing catch rates for all Bluegill (30 fish/hour) were lower than the 2015 (47 fish/hour) and 2012 (33 fish/hour) catch rates.  Size quality is high with lengths sampled in 2018 ranging from 2 to 10 inches; 20 percent of the Bluegill sampled were over 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie: Spring electrofishing catch rates for all Black Crappie were 4 fish/hour in 2018, compared to 9 fish/hour in 2015 and 5 fish/hour in 2012.  Lengths in 2018 ranged from 4 to 14 inches and 44 percent were 10 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nAquatic invasive species currently found in Leech Lake include Rusty Crayfish, Heterosporosis, Curly-Leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil, Purple Loosestrife, Zebra Mussels, and Banded Mystery Snails.  Eurasian Watermilfoil has established in open-water areas of the lake.  Other aquatic invasive species such as Spiny Waterfleas are increasing in prevalence throughout Minnesota and pose a likely risk but have not been found in Leech Lake to date.  Anglers and boaters alike are encouraged to review and adhere to rules requiring proper bait disposal, draining all water from bait containers, livewells, bilge, and the watercraft, and properly inspecting and removing all plants and animals from the watercraft, anchor, and trailer when leaving a lake.  Information on invasive species issues and prevention can be found by searching MNDNR invasive species in your preferred internet search engine or by calling your local DNR office. <br> \n</p>",

THE MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF THESE WALLEYE WAS ALSO CLOSE TO MEASN FROM 1983 THROUGH 1986. THERE WERE FEWER IN PREVIOUS YEARS OF NETTING. ACCORDING TO GROWTH RATE DATA FROM LEECH LAKE, WALLEYES IN THIS SIZE RANGE SHOULD BE FROM THE 1984 CLASS. PREVIOUS SHORELINE SEINING DATA INDICATED A WEAKER 1984 YEAR CLASS. THE LOWER NUMBER OF 12-TO-13 INCH WALLEYES IN 1987 NETTING MAY BE REFLECTED IN THE ANGLERS' CREEL IN THE SUMMER OF 1988. HOWEVER, NUMBERS OF WALLEYES 15 INCHES AND LARGER CAUGHT IN DNR NETS WAS SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS YEARS, AND THESE FISH WILL BE AVAIL- ABLE TO ANGLERS IN 1988 AS WELL. LOCAL REPORTS IN- DICATED THAT WALLEYE ANGLERS ENJOYED GOOD FISHING ON LEECH DURING THE SUMMER OF 1987. THE NUMBER OF NORTHERN PIKE CAUGHT IN DNR'S EXPERIMENTAL GILL NETS HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH SINCE 1950 AND THE MEAN WEIGHT OF THESE WAS SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS YEARS. THE CATCH RATE FOR YELLOW PERCH IN 1987 (16.06 FISH/ NET) WAS SIMILAR TO CATCHES SINCE 1983. NETTED PERCH HAD A MEAN WEIGHT OF 0.21 LBS.

ONLY 1988 HAD A HIGHER CATCH RATE AT 13.39 FISH/SET. USUALLY LARGE NUMBERS OF YOUNG OF THE YEAR WALLEYE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS HIGH 1988 CATCH RATE. ALTHOUGH NOT YET CONFIRMED VIA AGING OF SCALE SAMPLES, THE 1988- YEAR CLASS WAS ONCE AGAIN WELL- REPRESENTED IN THIS YEARS GILL NETS. CATCHES OF WALLEYE ON LEECH LAKE FROM 1983 TO 1988 RANGED FROM 5.25 FISH/SET TO 13.39 FISH/SET IN 1988. WALLEYE IN THE 9 TO 10 INCH AND 13 TO 15 INCH LENGTH GROUP WERE MORE ABUNDANT THAN IN MOST OF THE PREVIOUS SIX YEARS OF ASSESSMENT. THE HIGHER NUMBERS OF 13 TO 15 INCH WALLEYE TAKEN IN THE 1989 EXPERIMANTAL GILL NETTING MAY BE REFLECTED IN ANGLERS CATCHES IN THE SUMMER OF 1990. BOTH MEAN LENGTH AND MEAN WEIGHT OF WALLEYE TAKEN DURING THE 1989 NETTTING WERE VERY CLOSE TO MEANS FROM 1983 THROUGH 1988. OF THE 422 WALLEYE TAKEN IN THE GILL NETS, 51% WERE FEMALE AND 49% WERE MALE. FORTY-ONE PERCENT OF THE FEMALES WERE SEXUALLY IMMATURE AND TWENTY-SIX OF THE MALES WERE IMMATURE. BASED ON LOCAL REPORTS, WALLEYE FISHING ON LEECH PROVED TO BE VERY GOOD TO EXCELLENT DURING THE SUMMER OF 1989. FALL FISHING SUCCESS CONTINUED ALONG THESE LINES. BASED ON LOCAL REPORTS, WALLEYE FISHING ON LEECH PROVED TO BE VERY GOOD TO EXCELLENT DURING THE SUMMER OF 1989. FALL FISHING SUCCESS CONTINUED ALONG THESE LINES. THE NUMBER OF NORTHERN PIKE CAUGHT BY EXPERIMENTAL GILL NET ON LEECH HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH SINCE 1950, AND THE MEAN WEIGHT OF THESE FISH WAS VERY COMPAR- ABLE TO PREVIOUS YEARS. THE NUMBER OF NORTHERN PIKE TAKEN IN 1989 IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE CATCH RATE IN ANY OF THE PREVIOUS SIX YEARS, BUT THERE IS NO APPARENT TREND IN NORTHRN PIKE ABUNDANCE. THE MEAN LENGTH OF NORTHERN PIKE ALSO FAILS TO INDICATE A CHANGE IN THE POPULATIONS SIZE STRUCTURE. THE GILL NET CATCH FOR YELLOW PERCH IN  1989 WAS HIGHER THAN CATCHES DURING THE LAST SIX YEARS OF ASSESSMENT. NETTED YELLOW PERCH HAD A MEAN WEIGHT OF 0.24 POUNDS PER FISH, WHICH IS QUITE SIMILAR TO MEAN WEIGHTS FROM 1983 THROUGH 1988. THE MEAN LENGTH OF YELLOW PERCH FOR 1989 WAS VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED FROM THE PRECEDING SIX YEARS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths reach around 150 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco are principal forage species.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers for its walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge fishing.Walleye:  The 2005 catch of walleye per experimental gill net set was 4.9, which is below the 1983-2005 average of 7.3 walleye per set.  This relatively low gill net catch is due to limited recruitment since the 1997 year class.  Historically, catch rates have ranged from 4.6 walleye/set (1993) to 13.4 walleye/set (1988).  Walleye sampled in experimental gill nets ranged in length from 6.6 to 26.0 inches with an average length of 17.8 inches.  Catch rates were higher in western bays (6.8 walleye/set) than in the main lake (3.4 walleye/set).Due to concerns regarding the lack of recruitment in recent years, additional sampling was conducted to assess the 2005 walleye year class this field season.  The catch rate for standard trawling stations was 247 young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye per hour, nearly two times the long-term average catch rate (124/hour).  Night electrofishing catch rates in the main lake are encouraging.  Through five hours of on-time electrofishing, the catch rate was 57 YOY walleye/hour.  YOY walleye average sizes throughout the summer and early fall has been at or above average.  Walleye sampled in mid-September averaged 6.7 inches in length.Northern Pike:  The 2005 catch of northern pike per experimental gill net was similar to previous  catches at 4.9 per set.  Since 1983, northern pike gill net catch rates have been stable ranging from 3.6 pike/set (1993) to 6.2 pike/set (1995).  Northern pike sampled in experimental gill nets in 2005 ranged in length from 9.1 to 36.6 inches with an average length of 22.2 inches.  RSD-28 was 10, which is above the long-term average (8).Muskellunge:  In 2005, one 39.2 inch muskellunge was sampled in experimental gill nets.  Muskellunge are typically low in abundance and grow to sizes which are not effectively sampled with gill nets.Yellow Perch: The 2005 catch of yellow perch per experimental gill net set was 12.9 which is the lowest catch rate observed since the inception of the Large Lake Program.  Historically, yellow perch gill net catch rates have ranged from 13.5 perch/set (1983) to 37.7 perch/set (1995), averaging 21.1 perch/set.  The main lake catch rate was considerably lower (7.8/set) than the western bay catch rate (19.3/set).  In 2005, yellow perch sampled in gill nets ranged in length from 4.3 to 12.0 inches with an average length of 7.6 inches. Of the 464 yellow perch sampled with gill nets, 7.8% were >10 inches.  While this RSD-10 measures more favorably than recent past values- the long-term average RSD-10 is 9- the increase this year is primarily due to a decrease in overall yellow perch catch and not a  substantial  increase in the catch of larger yellow perch.Cisco: The 2005 catch of cisco per experimental gill net set was 3.5.   Since 1983, gill net catch rates for cisco have varied considerably ranging from a low of 0.9 cisco/set (2003) to 18.5 cisco/set (1987).  Cisco sampled in gill nets in 2005 ranged in length from 5.3 to 17.5 inches with an average length of 9.3 inches. Leech Lake also provides quality angling opportunities for largemouth bass, black crappie, and sunfish in several shallow vegetated bays. These species are not effectively sampled with gill nets.  Anglers report occasional catches of smallmouth bass around Bear and Pelican Islands.Due to recent trends in walleye and yellow perch catch data, a five-year action plan was developed for Leech Lake.  This plan aims to increase the abundance and create a more stable size structure for these two species.  Management activities include: restrictive regulations for walleye, science-based cormorant control, experimental walleye stocking and an increased focus on habitat protection.  Habitat protection includes watershed-level land management as fish habitat is directly affected by the water quality that enter the lake via runoff.  It is paramount to maintain the current water quality of Leech Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake is geographically located in three glacial zones and has an irregular shape with many large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths approach 160 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Similar to other large lakes in Minnesota, the fish community is dominated by species in the perch and pike families.  Walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are the primary predator species, while yellow perch and cisco (Tullibee) serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, including excellent fishing opportunities for walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, muskellunge, largemouth bass, sunfish, and black crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake has been surveyed annually with standardized assessments since 1983.  Establishment of long-term data sets on Leech Lake and Minnesota's other large walleye lakes allow biologists to compare current observations against historical averages.  These long-term data sets can also provide insight into other lakes having similar physical and biological properties that are not sampled as frequently.  Population metrics for a particular species, such as the highs and lows in gill net catch rates or the growth rates of fish, are constantly changing as they move from one extreme of their observed normal range to the other, much like a pendulum.  While highs and lows are normal and rarely sustained beyond one year, consecutive observations at either extreme can be indicative of changes to an ecosystem.  These may include invasive species introductions, shifts in habitat availability and/or quality, beneficial or adverse environmental conditions, and increased or decreased competition for resources between species or among different year classes of the same species.  Regardless, it is important to remember that all populations of flora and fauna fluctuate dramatically and that this natural variability is strongly influenced by the changing environment in which they live as well as the other species of plants and animals they share it with.   <br> \n <br> \nThe MN DNR convened a citizen input committee (Leech Lake Fisheries Input Group; LLFIG) comprised of 16 stakeholders representing local and statewide interests in Leech Lake management.  This group outlined sportfish population goals, objectives, and management actions.  These recommendations were incorporated into DNR's 2016-2020 Fisheries Management Plan for Leech Lake.  These management goals, where appropriate, are referenced in this report.  <br> \n <br> \nEffective May 10, 2014 all walleye between 20.0-26.0 inches long must be immediately returned to the water, a possession limit of 4 walleye with one longer than 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  This regulation is intended to provide additional harvest opportunity while still protecting most of the mature female walleye in the population, and received majority support from the public comment period held during fall 2013. All other species are currently managed under statewide fishing regulations. <br> \n <br> \nAquatic invasive species currently found in Leech Lake include rusty crayfish, heterosporosis, curly-leaf pondweed, Eurasian watermilfoil, purple loosestrife, and banded mystery snail.  Eurasian watermilfoil is beginning to establish in open-water areas of the lake.  Zebra mussel larvae were found in two different sites in 2016 and a search for adults will ensue during 2017. Other aquatic invasive species such as spiny waterfleas are increasing in prevalence throughout Minnesota and pose a likely risk.  Anglers and boaters alike are encouraged to review and adhere to rules requiring proper bait disposal, draining all water from bait containers, livewells, bilge, and the watercraft, and properly inspecting and removing all plants and animals from the watercraft, anchor, and trailer when leaving a lake.  Information on invasive species issues and prevention can be found at www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/index_aquatic/.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the Large Lake Program began in 1983, walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2016 catch rate was 9.1 (fish/net) was lower than the 2015 catch rate (12.4 fish/net) but within the management objectives of 7-10 fish/net. Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 7 to 28 inches, and demonstrated a balanced size distribution.  Age distributions were similarly balanced, with age-1 (2015 year class) and age-3 individuals (2012 year class) being the most frequently sampled. The percentage of Walleye sampled that were ?20 inches was 20%, and was within the management objective range of 10-20%. The average lengths of age-1 through age-4 Walleye were similar to the long term average.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The 2015 gillnet catch rate of northern pike was 3.9 fish/net.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.6 fish/net (1993) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.8 fish/net.  Northern pike captured in 2016 gillnet sets ranged in length from 9 to 35 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: Muskellunge from Miller Bay near Whipholt are currently collected and spawned for the statewide broodstock program every four years, with spawning operations most recently occurring in 2013.  A total of 51 individual fish were captured in May of 2013, of which 23 were female and 28 were male.  Females ranged in length from 39-53 inches, while males ranged from 31-46 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Catch rates in 2016 were 9.4 (fish/net), lower than the long-term average of 20.7(fish/net) and was a record low. Previous catch rates ranged from 12.1 fish/net (2013) to 37.7 fish/net (1995). Total length of Yellow Perch sampled ranged from 5 to nearly 13 inches and ages ranged from 2 to 12 years old. The 2011, 2012, and 2013 year classes made up 84% of all Yellow Perch sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nCisco: The overall catch rate was 7.8 fish/net. Cisco catch rates (fish/net) have increased the last 4 years and are above the long-term average (5.4 fish/net). Previous catch rates ranged from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987). Cisco sampled ranged from 4 to 19 inches. Eleven year classes were represented in the 2016 sample, with the 2014 and 2015 year classes most abundant. Warmer summers causing summer kills have likely been the source of cisco catch rates remaining relatively low since 1995.  However, no significant summer kill events have been observed during the past four years.  Lengths of cisco sampled ranged from 5 to 18 inches. Within the Leech Lake Indian Reservation the Whitefish limit is 25 and the Cisco (Tullibee) limit is 50, which is an exception to the statewide regulation.  Daily and possession limits are the same.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status of the Fishery (as of 2/27/2020) <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake has an irregular shape with a variety of large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths approach 160 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge are the primary predator species, while Yellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, and includes excellent fishing opportunities for Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Muskellunge, Largemouth Bass, Sunfish, and Black Crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nThe MN DNR convened a citizen input committee (Leech Lake Fisheries Input Group; LLFIG) comprised of 16 stakeholders representing local and statewide interests in Leech Lake management.  This group assisted the MN DNR in developing a list of sportfish population goals, objectives, and management actions.  These recommendations were incorporated into the DNR's 2016-2020 Fisheries Management Plan for Leech Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye regulation on Leech Lake was changed to a 4 fish possession limit with no more than 1 Walleye over 20\" allowed in possession, effective May 11, 2019. The objectives of this regulation change was to reduce spawner stock biomass and provide additional harvest opportunity to anglers.  The regulation will be evaluated annually and adjustments will be made based on management plan objectives and action items.   <br> \n <br> \nUpdates on specific species are provided below: <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the current sampling plan that began in 1983, Walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2019 catch rate was 8.6 fish/net which was similar to the1983-2019 average catch rate (8.1 fish/net) and within the management objectives of 7-10 fish/net. Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 6 to 28 inches, and included a number of younger year classes that should be large enough to harvest in the next year or two.  Twenty five percent of the Walleye in the 2019 sample were over 20 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The gillnet catch rate of Northern Pike was 4.9 fish/net.  Northern Pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.6 fish/net (1993) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.8 fish/net.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 9 to 36 inches. There is a 10 fish possession limit with none allowed in the 22-26\" PSL and only 2 over 26\" allowed in possession.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: Since 2015, the MNDNR has worked with Muskellunge tournament participants on Leech Lake to collect creel information.  In 2019, the DNR obtained creel interviews from 164 anglers from 3 tournaments. Information on hours fished, the number and size of fish that were caught was collected.  Lengths of tournament Muskellunge caught on Leech ranged from 22 to 50 inches and the average time it took tournament anglers to catch a Muskellunge was 48 hours. There is a 54\" minimum size limit with only 1 allowed in possession.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Gill net catch rates were 16.1 (fish/net), up from 10.2 fish/net in 2018. Historical catch rates have ranged from 9.4 fish/net (2016) to 37.7 fish/net (1995). Yellow Perch sampled ranged from 5 to 11 inches with nearly 30 percent of fish over 8.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco): The gill net catch rate was 3.0 fish/net, which was below the long-term average (5.4 fish/net). Catch rates have ranged from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987). Tullibee sampled ranged from 7 to 17 inches. Warmer summers causing summer kills have likely been the source of Tullibee catch rates remaining relatively low since 1995.  However, no significant summer kill events have been observed during the past five years. Within the Leech Lake Reservation the Whitefish limit is 25 and the Tullibee (Cisco) limit is 50, which is an exception to the statewide regulation.  Daily and possession limits are the same.  <br> \n <br> \nBass: A Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie assessment occurred during the springs of 2012, 2015, and 2018.  Catch rates for Largemouth Bass ? 15 inches were similar among years (range: 3 to 6 fish/hour). Lengths in 2018 ranged from 3 to 19 inches. Anglers can find quality bass fishing opportunities in the beds of mixed vegetation in most major bays. Smallmouth Bass have always been present but are infrequently sampled or caught by anglers. Their population density is low and they are not well-distributed throughout the lake at this time.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill: Spring electrofishing catch rates for all Bluegill (30 fish/hour) were lower than the 2015 (47 fish/hour) and 2012 (33 fish/hour) catch rates.  Size quality is high with lengths sampled in 2018 ranging from 2 to 10 inches; 20 percent of the Bluegill sampled were over 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie: Spring electrofishing catch rates for all Black Crappie were 4 fish/hour in 2018, compared to 9 fish/hour in 2015 and 5 fish/hour in 2012.  Lengths in 2018 ranged from 4 to 14 inches and 44 percent were 10 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nAquatic invasive species currently found in Leech Lake include Rusty Crayfish, Heterosporosis, Curly-Leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil, Purple Loosestrife, Zebra Mussels, and Banded Mystery Snails.  Eurasian Watermilfoil has established in open-water areas of the lake.  Other aquatic invasive species such as Spiny Waterfleas are increasing in prevalence throughout Minnesota and pose a likely risk but have not been found in Leech Lake to date.  Anglers and boaters alike are encouraged to review and adhere to rules requiring proper bait disposal, draining all water from bait containers, livewells, bilge, and the watercraft, and properly inspecting and removing all plants and animals from the watercraft, anchor, and trailer when leaving a lake.  Information on invasive species issues and prevention can be found by searching MNDNR invasive species in your preferred internet search engine or by calling your local DNR office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status of the Fishery (as of 3/1/2023) <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake is the third largest lake entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota and has approximately 112,000 surface acres.  The lake has an irregular shape with a variety of large and small bays.  The deepest area of the lake is located in Walker Bay where depths approach 160 feet deep.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 35 feet deep.  Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge are the primary predator species, while Yellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) serve as the principal forage.  Leech Lake is well known among anglers as a tremendous multi-species fishery, and includes excellent fishing opportunities for Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Muskellunge, Largemouth Bass, Sunfish, Burbot (Eelpout) and Black Crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nThe MN DNR convened a citizen input committee (Leech Lake Fisheries Input Group; LLFIG) comprised of 16 stakeholders representing local and statewide interests in Leech Lake management.  This group assisted the MN DNR in developing a list of sportfish population goals, objectives, and management actions.  These recommendations were incorporated into the DNR's 2016-2020 Fisheries Management Plan for Leech Lake and were updated with input from the group for 2021-2025.  <br> \n <br> \nThe current Walleye regulation on Leech Lake is a 4 fish limit with no more than 1 Walleye over 20\" allowed in possession since 2019. The objectives of this regulation change at the time was to bring the number of female spawners into the objective range outlined in the management plan and provide additional harvest opportunity to anglers.  The regulation is evaluated annually and adjustments will be made based on management plan objectives and action items.   <br> \n <br> \nA crappie possession limit of 5 and Sunfish possession limit of 5 were proposed in 2020 with implementation in 2021 as part of a statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  This regulation will also be evaluated utilizing future creel surveys and targeted spring sampling. The regulations are intended to spread harvest among anglers and maintain size structure and abundance of both species. <br> \n <br> \nUpdates on specific species are provided below: <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Since the current sampling plan that began being implemented in 1983, Walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 4.6 fish/net (1993) to 13.4 fish/net (1988).  The 2022 catch rate was 7.2 fish/net which was within the management objective of 7-10 fish/net. Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 8 to 27 inches, and included strong year classes from 2021 and 2019 that will be large enough to harvest in the next year or two.  Seventeen percent of the Walleye in the 2022 sample were over 20 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike: The gillnet catch rate of Northern Pike was 3.3 fish/net.  Northern Pike gillnet catch rates have remained relatively stable since 1983, ranging from 3.3 fish/net (2022) to 6.2 fish/net (1995) with an average of 4.7 fish/net.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 10 to 32 inches. Leech Lake is in the North-central Northern Pike zone which includes a 10 fish possession limit with none allowed from a 22-26\" protected slot limit and only 2 over 26\" allowed in possession.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge: Since 2015, the MNDNR has worked with Muskellunge tournament participants on Leech Lake to collect creel information.  In 2022, DNR staff were able to obtain creel interviews from Don's Portage Bay Classic and Frank Schneider Memorial participants.  Information on hours fished as well as the number and size of fish that were caught is collected.  Lengths of tournament Muskellunge caught on Leech ranged from 20 to 50 inches and the average time it took tournament anglers to catch a Muskellunge was 49 hours. There is a 54\" minimum size limit with only 1 allowed in possession.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch: Gill net catch rates were 9.6 (fish/net) in 2022. Historical catch rates have ranged from 9.4 fish/net (2016) to 37.7 fish/net (1995). Yellow Perch sampled ranged from 5 to 12 inches with 38 percent of fish 8.0 inches or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco): The gill net catch rate was 0.9 fish/net, which was well below the long-term average (5.5 fish/net). Catch rates have ranged from 0.6 fish/net (2006) to 18.5 fish/net (1987). Tullibee sampled ranged from 7 to 17 inches. High summer water temperatures causing summer kills have potentially been the source of Tullibee catch rates remaining relatively low since 1995.  However, no significant summer kill events have been observed since 2012. Within the Leech Lake Reservation the Whitefish limit is 25 and the Tullibee (Cisco) limit is 50, which is an exception to the statewide regulation.  Daily and possession limits are the same.  <br> \n <br> \nBass: A Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie assessment occurred during the springs of 2012, 2015, 2018 and 2022.  Catch rates for Largemouth Bass ? 15 inches were similar among years (range: 3 to 6 fish/hour). Lengths in 2022 ranged from 7 to 18 inches. Anglers can find quality bass fishing opportunities in the beds of mixed vegetation in most major bays. Smallmouth Bass have always been present but are infrequently sampled or caught by anglers. Their population density is low but catch rates have been steadily increasing in the most recent creel surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill: Spring electrofishing catch rates for all Bluegill (67 fish/hour) were higher than the 2018 (30 fish/hour) and 2015 (46 fish/hour) catch rates.  Size quality is high with lengths sampled in 2022 ranging from 2 to 10 inches; 20 percent of the Bluegill sampled were over 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie: Spring electrofishing catch rates for all Black Crappie were 11 fish/hour in 2022, compared to 4 fish/hour in 2018.  Lengths in 2022 ranged from 4 to 14 inches and 37 percent were 10 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nAquatic invasive species currently found in Leech Lake include Banded Mystery Snails, curly-leaf pondweed, Eurasian watermilfoil, Heterosporosis, purple loosestrife, Rusty Crayfish, starry stonewort and Zebra Mussels.  Other aquatic invasive species such as Spiny Waterfleas are increasing in prevalence throughout Minnesota and pose a likely risk but have not been found in Leech Lake to date.  Anglers and boaters alike are encouraged to review and adhere to rules requiring proper bait disposal, draining all water from bait containers, live wells, bilge, and the watercraft, and properly inspecting and removing all plants and animals from the watercraft, anchor, and trailer when leaving a lake.  Information on invasive species issues and prevention can be found by searching MNDNR invasive species in your preferred internet search engine or by calling your local DNR office. <br> \n</p>",
