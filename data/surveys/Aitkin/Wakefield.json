                "narrative": "<p>Wakefield Lake is a softwater lake located amongst the bogs, mixed hardwood and evergreen forests of northeastern Aitkin County. It's difficult to get to and fishing pressure is low. The shoalwater substrate is mostly sand and silt. The lake also contains areas of gravel and rubble, and bays which have muck substrates. The most abundant aquatic plants are the waterlilys, floating burreed and variable pondweed. Narrow stretches of spikerush and patches of pickerelweed and swamp horsetail are also scattered along the lake shore. The vegetation beds are generally sparse enough to fish within. Water clarity is low enough to restrict most fish and fishing to near-shore areas. Walleyes reproduce naturally, but irregularly, in Wakefield Lake. The primary spawning habitat is located on the Southeast side of the lake, on a gravel and rubble bar near shore. Almost all of thewalleyes were caught in the trap nets set in shallow water. The dark water probably restricts the walleye prey to shallow water, so that is where the walleyes hang out. The most abundant walleye year classes were from 1988 and 1984; the 1991, 1989 and 1987 year classes were not represented in the catch. The walleyes ranged from 14 to 24 inches long. Northern pike are small and slow growing. About half of the northern pike were 16 to 19 inches long, and the largest fish was 27 inches long. About half of the northern pike were caught in trap nets. Bluegill, pumpkinseed and black crappie abundances are below normal for this type of lake. Though not abundant, the surviving fish are larger than average for this area. Over half (60%) of the bluegills were at least 6.0 inches long and most (78%) of the black crappies were at least 8.0 inches long. Panfish abundance is probably limited by high predation rates on the small fish and by a lack of good spawning habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Wakefield Lake was conducted on August 2, 2022, by Aitkin Area Fisheries Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 8 species of fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Grand Rapids Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

He also commented that they had not caught a largemouth bass in the last few years. Winter fish house counts for 1986-87 was 0. The SE shore (point) contains good walleye spawning habitat and should be protected from development. The gillnet catch indices for northern pike, white sucker, and yellow perch are lower than their respective regional first quartiles. The trap net index for bowfin is higher than the third regional quartile for bowfin. The trap net catch indices for pumpkinseed and bluegill are lower than their respective first regional quartiles. Northern pike ranged from two to eight plus years of age with a strong year class indicated in 1984. Growth increments for the first two years is normal. Growth from the second annuli on is variable ranging from fifty percent slower than normal to normal. Bluegill ranged from two to seven years of age and shows a large variation in spawning success with strong year classes in 1981 and 1984. Growth was normal except for the second increment which was thirty-three percent slower than normal. Yellow perch ranged from two to seven years of age with no fish sampled from 1981 to 1982 year classes. Sample size was too small to be valid but growth the first two increments appear to be slower than normal. Walleye ranged from five to eight plus years of age. Natural reproduction appears to be sporadic. Sample size was too small to be valid, but the first three increments appear to be slow. The fourth increment has normal growth while the fifth through eighth increments ranged from twenty six to one-hundred and twenty-five percent faster than normal.</p>",

This survey was completed in addition to the standard resurvey conducted the week of July 15, 2013, and a repeat near shore survey was also completed August 19, 2013.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but three sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 15-foot seine was used at 6 stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at 4 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured relatively few species including black crappie, bluegill, golden shiner, Johnny darter, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  The preliminary IBI score (per Drake and Pereira, 2002) calculated from this survey, and using standard gill net and trap net data from the resurvey, was 63, and the repeated nearshore score was 74.  The very low productivity of the system likely affects the score (Total Alkalinity = 12ppm).  Considering the lack of development, the excellent temperature-dissolved oxygen profile, and the diverse undeveloped shoreline habitat, the scores likely do not well reflect the overall health of the system.  <br> \n</p>",

The lake is difficult to reach with the primary access through private property off of a forest road.  As with many of the other lakes in this remote part of Aitkin County the angling pressure is very light.  The primary sport fish species in Wakefield include northern pike, walleye, black crappie and bluegill.  Northern pike and bluegill are probably the most common species caught by summer anglers with an occasional walleye in the angler's creel. The 2002-year class walleye that were sampled during the survey were probably from a permit stocking from a private source.  Winter anglers probably target black crappie and bluegill.</p>",

This survey is a repeat of near shore sampling conducted on August 6, 2013 and will be used to evaluate sampling protocols and variability.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but four sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 15-foot seine was used at 6 stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at 4 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured relatively few species including black crappie, bluegill, Johnny darter, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, tadpole madtom, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  The preliminary IBI score (per Drake and Pereira, 2002) calculated from this survey, and using standard gill net and trap net data from the resurvey, was 74, whereas the initial nearshore sampling resulted in a score of 63.  The very low productivity of the system (Total Alkalinity = 12ppm) may affect the score due to lower species diversity and density.  Considering the lack of development, the excellent temperature-dissolved oxygen profile, and the diverse undeveloped shoreline habitat, the scores likely do not well reflect the overall health of this system. <br> \n</p>",

While about half the shoreline is in state ownership there is no developed public access, which means anglers must obtain access through private property.  The remote location and challenging access limit the amount of fishing pressure the lake receives.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community contains several naturally reproducing populations of popular game fish species including black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and walleye.  Although none are particularly abundant, each species has a population with favorable size characteristics.  Largemouth bass are also present, but at even lower densities.  The lake has soft water and low productivity, which results in slow growing fish populations that can be susceptible to increased fishing pressure.  Anglers that appreciate solitude, tranquility, and natural beauty will not be disappointed on a trip to this lake and their effort can be rewarded with some quality fishing.  Due to the small size of lake, selective harvest of smaller individuals is encouraged to maintain the quality size component in the fish populations.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wakefield Lake is a small, dark water and secluded lake located in northeastern Aitkin County. While about half the shoreline is in state ownership there is no developed public access, which means anglers must obtain access with permission through private property. The remote location and challenging access limit the amount of fishing pressure the lake receives.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community contains several naturally reproducing populations of popular game fish species including Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, and Walleye. Although none are particularly abundant, each species has a population with favorable size characteristics. Largemouth Bass are also present, but at even lower densities. Yellow Perch have increased in abundance and are an important source of forage for predator species which may help their growth and survival. A couple of private stockings have occurred over the years but did not contribute to the fishery. The lake has soft water and low productivity, which results in slow growing fish populations that can be susceptible to increased fishing pressure.  Anglers that appreciate solitude, tranquility, and natural beauty will not be disappointed on a trip to this lake and their effort can be rewarded with some quality fishing. Due to the small size of lake, selective harvest of smaller individuals is encouraged to maintain the quality size component in the fish populations.   <br> \n</p>",
