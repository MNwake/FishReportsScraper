                "narrative": "<p>Goose Lake is a shallow basin located five miles south of Terrace in Pope County.  Maximum depth is approximately 17.0 feet.  Winterkill events were common on Goose Lake in the past.  Water level has been increasing for many years and is evidenced by dead standing timber fringing the shoreline.  Increased depth and moderating winters has allowed establishment of a fishery following stocking of adult broodstock in 2008.  Dense algal blooms can occur during summer months.  The primitive carry-in public access consists of a steep trail approximately 200 yards to the lake. <br> \n <br> \nAn introductory stocking of adult bluegill and largemouth bass was completed in late spring of 2008.  No bluegill were sampled in 2012.  Success of largemouth bass stocking was evident in survey findings.  Five year classes were represented in the sample.  Largemouth bass are abundant.  Daytime electrofishing yielded 119.0 bass per hour.  Mean length of sampled fish was 7.7 inches.  The largest individual measured 16.6 inches.  Growth is rapid.  Age-4 fish reached 15.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAlso present in the fishery are black bullheads, green sunfish and white suckers.  Increasing gamefish density has reduced recruitment and abundance of black bullheadsand green sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nIn an attempt to expand the current gamefish community, adult bluegill and black crappie broodstock were stocked in Goose Lake in 2012. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Goose Lake is a shallow basin located five miles south of Terrace in Pope County.  Maximum depth is approximately 17.0 feet.  Winterkill events were common on Goose Lake prior to water levels rising in recent decades.  Increasing water levels are evidenced by dead standing timber fringing the shoreline.  Increased depth and moderating winters have allowed establishment of a fishery following stocking of adult fish in 2008.  Dense algal blooms used to be common during summer months, but water clarity has been increasing in recent years.  A primitive carry-in public access exists on the east side of the lake.  Access to the lake with trailered boats is challenged by a steep trail of approximately 200 yards to the lake.  Very little development has occurred on Goose Lake.  The lack of development and limited access offers a unique \"remote\" setting in southern Pope County. <br> \n <br> \nIntroductory stockings of adult Bluegill and Largemouth Bass were completed in the spring of 2008.  Other adult stockings in 2012 included Bluegill and Black Crappie.  Largemouth Bass stocking was very successful.  Largemouth bass are very abundant.  Daytime electrofishing yielded 138.3 bass per hour.  Mean length of Largemouth Bass sampled by electrofishing was 13.2 inches.  The largest bass captured measured 18.7 inches.  Growth is rapid as bass are reaching 12.0 inches by age 3. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie stocking has not been successful.  No Black Crappie were observed during the survey and only a few small Bluegill were caught. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads, Green Sunfish and White Suckers are also present in Goose Lake.  Although, increasing Largemouth Bass abundance has reduced abundance of these three species.  Drastic improvements in water clarity has been observed in recent years and is likely a result of biological control and limited recruitment of bullheads, Green Sunfish and suckers. <br> \n</p>",
