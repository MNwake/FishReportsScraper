                "narrative": "<p>East and West Lake Sylvia are located three miles south of South Haven in western Wright County. East Sylvia is 669 acres with a maximum depth of 78 feet. West Sylvia is 904 acres with a maximum depth of 97 feet. The two basins are connected by a wide, navigable channel. The lakes have excellent water clarity due to their depth and small watershed. A large public access is located on the southwest end of West Sylvia with ample parking. In 2009, an experimental 24 - 36 inch protected slot limit was put in place and allows for one fish over 36 inches to be kept in a possession limit of three. The goal of this regulation is to increase harvest on the abundant population of small Northern Pike and to shift the size structure to more of a balanced population. A targeted ice out assessment was conducted in 2017 to help evaluate the effects of this experimental fishing regulation.  <br> \n <br> \nEast and West Lake Sylvia have an abundant Northern Pike population dominated by small fish. This results in an unbalanced fishery where too many predators over eat their prey (primarily Yellow Perch) and make Walleye stocking less effective.   <br> \n <br> \nThe ice out assessment survey began on March 24th, when a large percentage of the two lakes were still covered in ice and concluded on April 6th, 2017.  A total of 1,129 Northern Pike were sampled, and although pike up to 36.4 inches were found, the average length was only 19.0 inches. The percentage of Northern Pike longer than 24 inches was 17%, compared to 21% observed in the previous ice out survey conducted in 2002. The percentage of Northern Pike longer than 30 inches did increase from 2% in 2002 to 4% in 2017. The recruitment of small Northern Pike remained high however, as 8% of pike sampled were less than 14 inches in length. The future of the experimental Northern Pike regulation is uncertain and a second ice out assessment will be conducted in 2018 to collect additional data for an upcoming regulation review meeting to be held in the fall of 2018. <br> \n <br> \nOther species measured included 249 Black Crappie and 37 Walleye. Black Crappie ranged in length from 5.0 to 14.7 inches with an average length of 9.6 inches, while Walleye ranged in length from 9.3 to 29.4 inches with an average length of 21.5 inches. <br> \n</p>",

In order to collect additional pre regulation data, a targeted Bluegill and Black Crappie assessment was conducted on East Lake Sylvia from April 26 - 30, 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 524 Bluegill were caught; lengths ranged from 4 - 10 inches with an average length of 7 inches. Eighty-four percent of the Bluegill sampled were longer than six inches and 28% were longer than eight inches. These results are above average for both fish greater than six inches and eight inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOne hundred twelve Back Crappie were also caught on East Sylvia; lengths ranged from 4 - 14 inches with an average length of 10 inches. For East Sylvia Lake, 92% of the crappie caught were eight inches or longer while 65% of the catch were 10 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 81 Pumpkinseed Sunfish were also caught and ranged in length from 3 - 9 inches and averaged 7 inches; 237 hybrid sunfish were also caught and ranged in length from 5 - 10 inches, with an average length of 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill grow slowly in the Sauk Rapids Area, taking up to 8 years to reach 8 inches. Anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill (> 8 inches) and keep smaller fish for a meal. This can help prevent stunted populations of small fish and keep larger Bluegill available. <br> \n</p>",

Northern Pike (7.3/gill net) and Walleye (5.2/gill net) catches were within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Sylvia, while the Yellow Bullhead catch (18.7/gill net) was higher than the expected range.  \n\nThe average weight of Northern Pike (1.7 pounds) was below the range of expected values for similar lakes and the fish ranged in length from 14 to 28 inches.  The growth rate for Northern Pike was average compared with other Minnesota lakes. Fish aged 1 through 7 were captured during the survey. Northern Pike catches have remained stable since the first survey in 1971, and have averaged 8.4/gill net over this period.  \n\nWalleye mean weight (1.6 pounds) was within the range of expected values and fish ranged in length from 11 to 22 inches. Several year classes were represented in the catch, the result of recent annual stocking. The Walleye growth rate was average.  \n\nYellow Perch (0.2/lift) were taken in below average numbers, which has been true historically. Yellow Bullhead were taken in high numbers in the gill nets, which was consistent with previous assessments. Numerous fish captured were actively feeding on other species entangled in the nets. \n\nImportant species captured in trap nets were Bluegill (9.7/trap net) and Black Crappie (0.2/trap net). Both were caught in numbers below the range of expected values; however, Bluegill are thought to be more abundant than the trap net catch showed. Cooler summer temperatures may have negatively influenced the catch.  \n\nBluegill growth was average and four year classes were captured during sampling (age 1 to 4). Too few Black Crappie were caught to say much about the population status, but anglers report catching nice crappies, particularly in the spring. \n\nLargemouth Bass are known to be abundant and anglers report catching many small fish (less than 12 inches in length). Largemouth Bass were more consistently caught in gill nets (2.0/net) than in trap nets (0.2/net) in 1992 and this trend has been consistent among all surveys. Mean weight of Largemouth Bass (0.7 lbs) fell within the range of expected values for similar lakes, and the growth rate was about average for Minnesota lakes. Ages 1 through 4 were captured during the survey. \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East and West Sylvia Lakes are located in western Wright County, near the Town of South Haven.  The lakes are connected by a navigable channel with a combined acreage of 1,524. They are also among the deepest lakes in the county at 78 and 97 feet deep for the East and West lakes, respectively.  Water quality is excellent.  Not surprisingly, they are very popular for recreational use during the open water season.  Over 1,000 boats were counted at docks in 2002, and during summer weekends the public access on West Sylvia Lake is often very busy. <br> \n <br> \nEast and West Lake Sylvia is well suited for largemouth bass because of good water clarity and diverse aquatic vegetation.  The average catch rate for night electrofishing in area lakes is 63/hour and West Lake Sylvia was 70/hour in 2008, which was less than the rate of 300/hour sampled in 2002.  The population was dominated by smaller fish (8-12 inches), while bass over 16 inches were rare.  The percentage of fish larger than 12 inches was 23%.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye management in Lake Sylvia requires regular alternate year stocking of fingerlings, since natural reproduction does not occur.  The population of walleye between 16-28 inches was estimated to be 1,089 (0.7/acre).  The walleye catch rate has decreased since 1992.  Growth rates are relatively slow, but can vary greatly among individuals.  Individual walleye may reach a large size in East and West Lake Sylvia.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2008, catch rates for northern pike were above the range that is normal for lakes like East and West Sylvia.  Northern pike up to 34 inches were sampled, but most of the fish were 16-20 inches.  Average weight was less than two pounds.  Only 12% of northern pike were larger than 24 inches.   Catch rates and average size have remained consistent for East and West Lake Sylvia over the past three decades.  Based on the small average size of northern pike it is expected that anglers harvest only one of every 10 fish caught.  Similar results have been found at nearby Sugar and Pulaski Lakes.  New regulations for northern pike will go into effect in 2009: a 24-36 inch protected slot limit and three fish daily bag with only one over 36 inches allowed. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled in numbers that were typically found in similar lakes.  Bluegill grow slowly, based on age estimates made from examining otoliths.  Seven-inch bluegill were nine years old.  About one percent of the population is larger than eight inches.   <br> \n <br> \nFew black crappie were captured during summer netting because crappie use deeper water during this time of year.  During ice-out netting (4/3 \u0013 5/2/2008), a much larger number of crappie were sampled at a rate of 5.6/net. The average size was 9.8 inches and crappie up to about 13 inches were observed.  Growth was above that for similar lakes, but rates were based on only a few individuals.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish caught were black, brown and yellow bullhead; green, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish; bowfin; rock bass; yellow perch; and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nThe clear water of the lakes supports a diverse plant community, out to depths of 23 feet.  Stands of emergent and floatingleaf vegetation are present, but primarily in shallow bays or other sheltered areas.  Eurasian water milfoil was found in both East and West Sylvia Lakes for the first time in the spring of 2008.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted on East and West Lake Sylvia from June 10 to June 16, 2015. Targeted surveys around spawning time give a more accurate picture of Bluegill abundance and size structure than standard surveys conducted later in the summer.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 474 Bluegill were caught on East Sylvia; lengths ranged from 2.6 to 9.2 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.  Seven hundred fifty-four Bluegill were caught on West Sylvia; lengths ranged from 1.8 to 9.6 inches and averaged 6.6 inches. The size structure of a fish population is typically described using terms such as Proportional Stock Density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD). For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of fish longer than three inches that are also longer than six inches. RSD8 is the percentage of fish longer than three inches that are also longer than eight inches. For East Sylvia, PSD was 89 and RSD8 was 16. So 89% of Bluegills were longer than six inches and 16% were longer than eight inches. On West Sylvia, PSD was 77 and RSD8 was 7.  <br> \n <br> \nOn East Sylvia 150 Pumpkinseed Sunfish were also caught and ranged in length from 5.2 to 8.9 inches and averaged 6.9 inches; 77 Hybrid Sunfish were caught and ranged in length from 3.4 to 9.4 inches, with an average length of 7.4 inches. Two Green Sunfish were also captured. <br> \n <br> \nOne hundred forty-two Pumpkinseed Sunfish were caught on West Sylvia and ranged from 4.9 to 8.4 inches in length and averaged 6.7 inches; 67 Hybrid Sunfish were also caught and ranged in length from 3.7 to 9.1 inches, with an average length of 7.4 inches. One Green Sunfish was also captured.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill in the Sauk Rapids Area grow slowly, taking up to eight years to reach eight inches. Anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill (>8 inches) and keep medium sized fish for a meal. This can help keep larger Bluegill in the population and prevent stunted populations of small fish. <br> \n</p>",

Ages 1 to 4 were caught with 40 percent of the fish being age 4. Growth was average and similar to 1981. Walleye abundance has increased since 1981 and is near the state average. Walleye fingerlings stocked in 1979, 1982 and 1986 were well represented in the catch. Fry stocked in 1984 were absent from the sample in both Sylvia and Twin lakes. Limited natural reproduction is taking place. Growth remains good. Largemouth Bass are abundant (2.7/trap net) and anglers report good success. Several year classes were caught with ages 1 to 4 comprising 90 percent of the sample. Growth bordered on slow, which is similar to 1981. \n\nBluegill (50.9/trap net) are abundant. As in 1981, growth is slow. Most fish taken were age 3 and 4. Hybrid Sunfish are relatively abundant (8.1/trap net). The Black Crappie population is apparently low (1.2/trap net). Yellow Perch have increased significantly since 1981, but their numbers remain low at 1.2/trap net. Tullibee were not sampled, but known to be present and possibly abundant. Non-game fish present in low numbers were White Sucker, Bowfin and Brown Bullhead. Yellow Bullhead are moderately abundant at 7.5/trap net, an increase from 1981. \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East and West Sylvia Lakes are located three miles south of South Haven in western Wright County. East Sylvia is 669 acres with a maximum depth of 78 feet. West Sylvia is 904 acres with a maximum depth of 97 feet. The two basins are connected by a wide, navigable channel. The lakes have excellent water clarity due to their depth and a small watershed consisting mainly of open water, row crops and forest. Late July Secchi readings for East and West Sylvia were 23 and 22 feet. A large public access is located on the southwest end of West Sylvia with ample parking. Both lakes are very popular in the summer for recreational boating and fishing. The lakes are primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike. The last survey was done in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent vegetation was common along the lake shore for both lakes, primarily waterlilies, wild rice, cattail and bulrush. Submerged plants were not surveyed in 2015; chara and coontail were the dominant species in 2008. Eurasian milfoil is present in the lake; users should be careful not to spread this invasive plant to other lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low and nearly unchanged from 2008; Walleye size was good and similar to 2008. The Walleye catch rate for both lakes was at the low end of the expected range of values for similar lakes. Combined lengths ranged from 10.3 to 24.2 inches with average lengths of 20.2 inches from East Sylvia and 18.4 inches from West Sylvia. Walleye ages ranged from 1 to 14 years old with most fish spread between ages 1 and 7. Growth was fast; average length at age 1 was 11 inches. Walleye fingerlings have been stocked every other year, most recently in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches were slightly lower in 2015 than in 2008, but were within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Northern Pike were relatively small; lengths ranged from 5.4 to 30.3 inches with an average length of 19.7 inches for East Sylvia and 18.4 inches for West Sylvia. Only 13% of pike were 24 inches or longer from East Sylvia and 10% from West Sylvia. An experimental regulation for Northern Pike was implemented in 2009 with a protected slot limit of 24 to 36 inches with one over 36 inches allowed in the statewide bag limit of three. No significant effect was evident in 2015, but more time is needed to evaluate the effect of the regulation. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were abundant and small. During nighttime electrofishing in May 2015, the catch rate was 210/hour and 144/hour for East and West Sylvia, well above the Montrose Area nighttime average of 74/hour. Only the West basin was electrofished in 2008, with a result of 73/hour. Both basins had catch rates over 300/hour in 2002. Lengths in 2015 ranged from 5.0 to 17.1 inches with an average length of 10.6 inches. Only 2% of Largemouth Bass were 15 inches or longer on East Sylvia and 3% on West Sylvia. Given the high number of small bass, anglers are encouraged to harvest some smaller bass and release larger fish. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches were in the expected range of values for East and West Sylvia. Results in 2008 were higher for East and lower for West Sylvia. These results are within the historical range of catches for both lakes. Combined Bluegill lengths in 2015 ranged from 3.3 to 8.4 inches; East and West Sylvia had average lengths of 5.7 and 5.4 inches. Additionally, both lakes were netted in June during spawning to better assess sunfish numbers and size. Bluegill catches were similar for East and West Sylvia and higher than standard survey results in July. Bluegill size was also larger; combined lengths ranged from 1.8 to 9.6 inches with an average length of 7.1 inches for East Sylvia and 6.6 inches for West Sylvia. Among catchable size Bluegill (> 3 inches), 15% were 8 inches or longer from East Sylvia and 10% from West Sylvia. Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed were also caught in lower numbers than Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low, similar to 2008 results for both lakes and at the low end of the range of expected values. Lengths ranged from 5.9 to 11.8 inches with an average length of 9.2 inches for East Sylvia and 8.2 inches for West Sylvia. Black Crappie catches on both lakes have been low historically; however, the lakes have a large amount of deep water, making summer assessment difficult. Targeted sampling for Black Crappie around spawning time would likely give a better picture of numbers and size. <br> \n <br> \nOnly five Yellow Perch were caught in the survey for both lakes and all gears combined; Yellow Perch catch rates have been low since the 1970s. Lengths ranged from 6.4 to 6.7 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species caught during the survey included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Green and Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass. Notably absent was White Sucker; only one was caught in 2008 and few have been caught in the past. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East and West Lake Sylvia  are two connected lakes located three miles south of South Haven in western Wright County. East Sylvia is 669 acres with a maximum depth of 78 feet. West Sylvia is 904 acres with a maximum depth of 97 feet. The two basins are connected by a wide, navigable channel. The lakes have excellent water clarity due to their depth and a small watershed consisting mainly of open water, row crops and forest. Average summer Secchi readings for East and West Sylvia are 16.5 and 19.5 feet, respectively. A large public access is located on the southwest end of West Sylvia with ample parking. Both lakes are very popular in the summer for recreational boating and fishing. The lakes are primarily managed for Walleye, Black Crappie and Bluegill. The last survey was done in 2015. <br> \nEmergent vegetation was common along the lake shore for both lakes, primarily waterlilies, wild rice, cattail and bulrush. Submerged plants were not surveyed in 2020; chara and coontail were the dominant species in prior surveys. Eurasian milfoil, zebra mussels, and starry stonewort are present in the lakes and users should be careful not to spread these invasive species to other lakes.    <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches increased from 2015 and catch rates for both lakes were within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Combined lengths ranged from 12 to 28 inches with average lengths of 17 inches in East Sylvia and 16 inches in West Sylvia. Walleye ages ranged from 2 to 11 years old with 73% of the aged sample coming from the 2017 and 2018 year classes. Growth was fast; average length at age 2 was 14 inches. Walleye fingerlings had been stocked every other year for many years at a rate of 1 pound per littoral acre but starting in 2018 the rate was increased to two pounds per littoral acre, which appears to have been successful based on 2020 survey results. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches were higher in 2020, and increased beyond the expected range of values for similar lakes. Northern Pike were relatively small; lengths ranged from 11 to 32 inches with an average length of 19 inches in East Sylvia and 18 inches in West Sylvia. Only 6% of pike sampled were 26 inches or longer in East Sylvia and 5% in West Sylvia. An experimental 24 to 36 inch protected slot was in place on the lakes from 2009 to 2018; however, no significant improvement in pike size was evident by 2018, so pike regulations reverted to statewide limits beginning in the spring of 2019. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass was not conducted in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. In each of the past three lake surveys dating back to 2002, spring electrofishing catch rates have matched or exceeded averages for the Sauk Rapids Area. Lengths from bass sampled in gill nets and trap nets in 2020 ranged from 6 to 16 inches with an average length of 11 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches decreased in 2020 and were near or below the expected range of values for East and West Sylvia. These results however remained within the historical range of catches for both lakes. Combined Bluegill lengths ranged from two to eight inches; with average lengths of 5.5 inches. While summer surveys show a poor size structure, spring Bluegill assessments indicate that the size structure is excellent with 83% of the spring sample being six (6) inches or longer and 12% being eight (8) inches or longer with fish up to 9.5 inches being found in the lakes. Because of this, starting March 1, 2021 the daily limit for sunfish on both lakes will be reduced from 20 to 10 in an effort to protect and enhance the size structure of the sunfish population. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were once again low, and below the range of expected values. Lengths ranged from seven to eleven inches with an average length of nine inches. Black Crappie summer catches on both lakes have been low historically; however, spring assessments in 2017 sampled 250 Black Crappie that ranged in length from five (5) to 15 inches with an average length of 9.6 inches. Fifty-four percent of the fish sampled were 10 inches or longer.  These lakes have a large amount of deep water, making summer assessments difficult. Spring targeted sampling for Black Crappie around spawning time likely give a better picture of abundance and size. Starting March 1, 2021, the daily limit for Black Crappie will be reduced from 10 to five (5) in an effort to protect the existing size structure of the crappie population. <br> \n <br> \nOnly five Yellow Perch were sampled in the survey for both lakes; Yellow Perch catch rates have been low since the 1970s. Other species caught during the survey included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish) Green and Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass. Although not caught during this survey, there is a remnant population of Tullibee (cisco) in the lakes. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lakes Sylvia and Twin are located in western Wright County, near the town of South Haven.  The lakes are connected by a wide channel and are sometimes referred to as East and West Twin.  They are among the largest and deepest lakes in the county, and water quality is excellent.  Not surprisingly, they are very popular for recreational use during the open water season.  More than one thousand boats were counted at docks along shore in 2002, and during summer weekends the public access (on Twin Lake) is often very busy.A survey was conducted in 2002 to assess fish populations, and included spring netting (just after ice-out), spring electrofishing and summer netting.  Catch rates were compared to lakes with similar characteristics as a way to evaluate the fish populations of the two lakes.  Results were also compared to past surveys of Sylvia and Twin Lakes (most recently in 1992) to track changes over time.  Population estimates were made for northern pike and walleye during the survey.  While catch rates allow us to compare relative abundance among lakes, or over time, population estimates give us actual abundance, and suggest how many fish the lake can produce for anglers.  The survey also included water chemistry analysis, watershed mapping, and an aquatic plant survey.Lakes Sylvia and Twin are managed primarily for northern pike and walleye.  In 2002, catch rates for northern pike were within the range that is normal for lakes like Sylvia or Twin.  Northern pike up to 35 inches (9 pounds) were sampled during the ice-out netting, but most of the fish were 18-26 inches.  Average weight was two pounds.  Catch rates and average size have remained fairly consistent for Lakes Sylvia and Twin over the past three decades.  The population of northern pike between 16-34 inches in the two lakes was estimated to be 5,279 (3.5/acre).  Fish outside this size range were not sampled well enough by the gear used in the spring, so the estimate does not include small or very large fish.  In nearby Sugar Lake, which has a very high population of northern pike, density was estimated to be 26/acre.Walleye management in Sylvia and Twin Lakes requires regular stocking of fingerlings, since natural reproduction does not appear to occur, or is minimal.  Walleye are stocked in alternate years, and the quantity of fish stocked is based on the amount of littoral area (less than 15 feet) available.  The population of walleye between 16-28 inches was estimated to be 1,089 (0.7/acre).  The summer catch rate of walleye in 2002 was low, but within the normal range for lakes like Sylvia or Twin.  Survival of walleye from year to year is probably good, given that most walleye sampled were between 6-10 years old, and a few were estimated to be 14 years old.  However, growth rates are relatively slow, and can vary greatly among individuals.  This is probably due to the low density of suitable forage available; very few larger yellow perch, small white suckers or other appropriate-sized prey were sampled during the survey.  Walleye do reach large size in Sylvia and Twin Lakes, however; several fish sampled during the ice-out netting were over 28 inches (about 8 pounds).Lakes Sylvia and Twin are well suited for largemouth bass, because of good water clarity and diverse aquatic vegetation.  The bass population appeared very high in 2002, based on night electrofishing.  Over 300 bass were sampled per hour in each of the lakes, the highest in the Montrose management area.  The median catch rate for largemouth bass in area lakes is 55/hr.  The population is dominated by mid-sized fish (8-12 inches), while bass over 16 inches are rare.  Like the walleye, largemouth bass in Lakes Sylvia and Twin tend to be long-lived, but somewhat slow growing.Few black crappie were captured during summer netting, but for many lakes, crappie are not using shoreline areas during this time of year and are not caught in trap nets.  During ice-out netting, a much larger number of crappie was sampled.  The average size was high (ten inches) and crappie up to 14 inches were seen.  Bluegill were sampled in low numbers in 2002.  High water levels during the survey may have affected the catch; the high population of largemouth bass may also limit the size of the bluegill population.  Bluegill appeared to grow slowly, based on age estimates made from examining scale samples.  Seven-inch bluegill were nine years old.  Clear lakes tend to be less biologically productive, and this often results in slower growth rates for some fish species, such as bluegill.  Other sunfish species (pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass) were also sampled in 2002.In the mid 1970's an introduction of muskellunge was attempted by an angler group.  Although fingerlings were stocked on three occasions, no muskellunge were ever sampled during subsequent fisheries surveys.  However, anglers have reported catching muskellunge as recently as 1996, and in 1997, a dead muskellunge was found on the lakeshore.  Tullibee (a whitefish species) have been caught in these lakes (in low numbers) during previous surveys, but were not sampled in 2002.  A special effort was made to sample tullibee just before ice formed in December 2001, but only three were caught.  Tullibee are generally found in lakes further north in Minnesota, but several lakes in the Montrose management area contain tullibee.  In lakes where they are present, they provide important forage for predator species like northern pike and walleye.  Faster growth of northern pike would be expected if tullibee were abundant in Sylvia and Twin Lakes.The clear water of the lakes supports a diverse plant community, out to depths of 23 feet.  Stands of emergent and floatingleaf vegetation are present, but primarily in shallow bays or other sheltered areas.  Lakeshore residents can help protect the shoreline from erosion by allowing cattail and bulrush to grow, since the shallow roots of lawn grasses don't withstand wave action well.  The DNR website provides information on trees and other plants that are better suited to lakeshores.</p>",

Ages 1 to 3 were caught, strongly dominated by age 2 fish. Walleye abundance has increased but remains below the state average. Ages 3 and 6-8 were present. Largemouth Bass abundance is average to high and ages 2-5 were found. Natural reproduction appears lower than in 1971. Green Sunfish abundance decreased, Pumpkinseed abundance remained high and unchanged. Black Crappie abundance increased and Bluegill abundance declined since 1971. Hybrid Sunfish abundance was high in 1971 and has since doubled. Rock Bass abundance remains about average. For all panfish sampled, three or four age classes were found. Rock Bass, Black Crappies and Largemouth Bass show dominant single year classes, while Bluegill and Pumpkinseed show more consistant age class strength.</p>",
