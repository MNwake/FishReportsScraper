                "narrative": "<p>Dutch Lake is a 153-acre lake located one mile south of the City of Howard Lake in Wright County.  The lake is shallow with a maximum depth of 21 feet.  A state-owned public access is on the south side of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nFor many years the City of Howard Lake discharged its wastewater treatment effluent to Mallard Pass Lake (formerly Mud Lake) and thence to Dutch Lake.  Mallard Pass is shallow (four feet maximum depth) and was unable to assimilate the nutrients contained in the wastewater.  Heavy algal blooms, little submerged vegetation, and winter-kills in both lakes were the result. <br> \n <br> \nNo winter-kill has been observed since 1996-97 but because of poor water quality, it was thought that crappie, carp and bullheads would be more abundant than game fish.  The last lake survey was conducted in 1985. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are present in low numbers when compared to other area lakes.  Largemouth bass taken by electrofishing ranged in length from 4-20 inches with an average length and weight of 12.9 inches and 2 pounds.  Largemouth bass grow to 12 inches in five years.  The largest bass sampled was 20 inches and 10 years old. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have never been stocked in Dutch Lake but it is possible that fish enter from other lakes within the watershed.  The catch rate of walleye was 2.0/gill net.  No walleye were sampled during the initial survey in 1985.  Walleye sampled ranged in length from 15-27 inches with an average length of 23.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of northern pike was similar to 1985 and within the range of expected values for comparable lakes.  Northern pike ranged in length from 23-33 inches with an average length and weight of 27 inches and 4.1 pounds.  Reproduction has occurred in the past, however no northern pike younger than four years old were sampled during the survey.  This is a moderate level of northern pike abundance but should provide an excellent angling opportunity for above-average size northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch was higher than 1985, but at the low end of the expected values for similar lakes.  Bluegill ranged in length from 4-8 inches with an average length of 6.1 inches.  Reproduction has been consistent recently, however, no fish over five years old were sampled.  Bluegills grow to seven inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of black crappie (34.1/trap net) was similar to 1985, and well above  expected values for similar lakes.  Black crappie ranged in length from 4-10 inches with an average length of 7.9 inches.  Many fish in the 7-8 inch size groups should provide good fishing in the near future.  Black crappies from Dutch Lake attain eight inches in five years. <br> \n <br> \nCarp were caught at a rate of 5.3/gill net, slightly higher than reported in 1985.  In 2006, researchers from the University of Minnesota examined the adult carp population of Dutch Lake.  Based on mark-recapture methods, it was estimated that the adult carp population was approximately 13,300 adults or 86 adults per acre.  With an average weight of 4.2 pounds per fish, the estimated biomass of adult carp in Dutch Lake is 361 pounds per acre. <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead catch was only about one percent of the catch reported in 1985. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included: bowfin, golden shiner, smallmouth buffalo, white sucker and yellow bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dutch Lake is a 150 acre lake located on the south side of the City of Howard Lake in southern Wright County. The lake has a maximum depth of 21 feet and has a history of winterkill, most recently in 1997. The watershed is modest and the primary land uses are row crops, open water, and pasture. A public access with limited parking is located on the south end of the lake. Dutch Lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and the last survey was in 2006. Anglers can expect good fishing for Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity is poor and MPCA data shows a 10 year average Secchi depth of 3.0 feet. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish down to 10 feet. No vegetation surveys were conducted on Dutch Lake in 2016. In 2006, emergent vegetation covered 10% of the lake area (primarily cattail) and coontail was the dominant submerged species. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were higher than 2006 and above the expected range for lakes similar to Dutch. Lengths ranged from 16.0 to 33.3 inches with an average length of 22.1 inches. In 2016, 25% of Northern Pike were 24 inches or longer compared to 81% in 2006 when fewer pike were captured. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were captured by daytime electrofishing on May 23 in low numbers and average size. The catch rate was lower than the Sauk Rapids area average and lengths ranged from 3.1 to 16.9 inches with an average length of 10.7 inches. Of catchable size fish (>8 inches), 45% were 15 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were higher than expected for lakes like Dutch, but lower than 2006 results. Lengths in 2016 ranged from 4.3 to 13.0 inches with an average length of 7.4 inches. Bluegill numbers were much higher in 2016 than 2006, but within the expected range of values for lakes similar to Dutch. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.3 to 8.6 inches with a mean length of 5.0 inches. Surveys in late summer likely under represent panfish numbers and size; netting near shore around spawning time would be more effective for both Bluegill and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were higher in 2016 than in 2006 and higher than the expected range of values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 2.8 to 9.2 inches with a mean length of 7.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during the survey included: Bigmouth Buffalo, Black and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green and Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAn Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey was also conducted on Dutch Lake; results for this survey can be found in a separate report. <br> \n</p>",

Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining, except one site where soft sediments prevented the use of a seine.  <br> \n <br> \nNearshore sampling captured 3 species of fish, including Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass. No intolerant species were collected. The near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2016 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Dutch Lake is located in the Mississippi River - North Fork Crow River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",
