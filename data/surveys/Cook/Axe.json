It appeared that recent stocking had contributed little to the population, although natural reproduction had also not produced strong year classes.  The northern pike catch was also average in terms of numbers and size.  Growth rates were fairly good, but mortality appeared to have been high.  Only one fish older than three years of age was collected.  No yellow perch were taken in 2000; their abundance may have declined since walleye were introduced.  No other game fish, and no panfish species, were known to have been present in this lake.</p>",
