The average length sampled was 16 inches; the largest northern pike in the sample was 39.2 inches.   The present northern pike population should provide an opportunity for campers to catch a meal, with a chance to catch a trophy pike.  Yellow perch are present in low numbers; the fish are typically less than 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWonder Lake is located within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW).  The BWCAW is administered by the U.S. Forest Service, there is a fee for overnight camping and a day-use permit is required for shorter trips.  Access to Wonder Lake is a portage trail (220 rods) from the south end of Alton Lake; there are two campsites on the lake.  The U.S. Forest Service offices can provide information and maps regarding the Wonder Lake and Alton Lake areas. <br> \n</p>",
