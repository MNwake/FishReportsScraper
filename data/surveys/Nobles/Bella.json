                "narrative": "<p>Bella Lake is a reservoir located in southern Nobles County.  During an average year, the lake has a surface area of 182 acres and a maximum depth of 14 feet; however, the lake serves as an aquifer replenishment reservoir for municipal water supplies and fluctuates substantially.  In 1996, a management plan was developed and included an objective to establish a self-sustaining northern pike population with secondary populations of yellow perch and black crappie.  Although the primary management species in Bella Lake has been northern pike, no pike were captured in the gill nets and only one 22.5 inch individual was captured in the trap nets.  In 1994, pike were captured at a rate of 1 fish/gill net and 0.56 fish/trap net.  Northern pike spawning habitat can be good in the channel and marshes that connect Bella Lake with Ocheda Lake; however, low water levels have created barriers to these habitats. Although walleye have never been stocked into Bella Lake, it is believed that they likely migrated from Ocheda Lake during high water periods.  Walleye were captured at a rate of 7.0 fish/gill net and 1.67 fish/trap net.  Both of these catch rates were higher than average for similar lakes in southwestern Minnesota.  In 1994, walleye were caught at a rate of 1 fish/gill net and none were captured in the trap nets.  Captured walleye ranged from 10.5 to 23.0 inches.  Age and growth analyses indicated that Bella Lake walleye were growing rather slowly, with age 2, 4 and 6 fish reaching average total lengths of 8.50, 15.19, and 19.74 inches, respectively.  These growth rates are less than typical for lakes in southwestern Minnesota, where age 2, 4, and 6 walleyes usually attain lengths of 11-12, 16-17, and 20-21 inches, respectively.  The slow growth rates, combined with the presence of age-7 walleye and a high proportion of fish between 15 and 20 inches, is typical of a population experiencing limited exploitation.  The condition of walleye in Bella Lake was slightly less than desired, meaning the average walleye was not as plump as preferred.  No young-of-year walleye were captured in the natural reproduction seining; however, the consistent age-structure and frequency of disconnection with other walleye waters, indicates that natural reproduction has been occurring.Secondary management species in Bella Lake are yellow perch and black crappie.  Yellow perch were caught in gill nets at a rate of 1.0 fish/net, a value that is less than most similar lakes.  However, in the trap nets, perch catch rates were 3.33 fish/net, which is similar to slightly above similar lakes.  The yellow perch size structure was good, with a number of fish exceeding 8 inches; however, growth and condition were quite poor.  The age and growth assessment revealed that age 2 and 3 perch in Bella Lake averaged 5.92 and 7.38 inches.  Several other area lakes maintain perch populations that can reach 7 inches by age 2 and surpass 9 inches by age 3.  These poor growth rates are likely attributable to the poor condition of yellow perch in Bella Lake.  All captured yellow perch were extremely thin.Black crappie adults were stocked in 1995 to help establish a population; however, few black crappies have been captured since.  In 2000, the catch rate on black crappie was 3.56 fish/trap net, a value that falls short of the average for lakes in this classification.  The black crappies ranged in total length from 6 to 13 inches, included 3 year classes, and were in good condition.  Although black crappies were introduced to the lake, white crappies have become more abundant.  The white crappies were captured at a rate of 47.56 fish/trap net, a value that greatly exceeds most lakes in southern Minnesota.  The white crappie size structure was also very good, with high proportions exceeding 10 inches and several also exceeding 12 inches.  The body condition of these white crappie was extremely good.  The average lengths at age 2 were quite different for black and white crappie in Bella Lake, with black crappies attaining a mean length of 5.76 inches and white crappies reaching 6.78 inches.  The difference was less notable by ages 3 and 4, with black crappies reaching 8.38 and 10.34 inches and white crappies measuring 9.11 and 10.60 inches, respectively.Yellow and black bullhead species were present during the 2000 survey and caught at rates of  2.11 and 74.0 fish/net, respectively.  These catch rates are similar to other lakes in this classification. The abundance of yellow bullheads has increased since the 1994 survey; however, their condition has declined. The yellow bullhead total lengths ranged from 6 to 11 inches. Yellow bullheads have a tendency to not overpopulate and the size structure typically remains good. Black bullhead abundance has also increased slightly since 1994.  Black bullheads ranged in length from 4.5 to 10.5 inches; however, nearly all of these fish were <8 inches and body condition was low to moderate.Common carp were caught at a rate of 58.33 fish/gill net and 9.67 fish/ trap net.  Both of these rates greatly exceeded most lakes in this class.  With a slight increase in density over the past 6 years, the common carp size structure has also declined.  Carp ranged in length from 7.5 to 24.0 inches; however, a large proportion of these carp were <18 inches.  Another strong year class of carp was produced in 2000, with numerous age-0 specimens sampled during the natural reproduction assessment.  With a greater number of small carp feeding in this system, the likelihood of decreasing water clarity and vegetation becomes a greater concern and competition for benthic food resources becomes probable.The lake has maintained a relatively constant bigmouth buffalo population.  The 2000 gill net catch rate was 6.0 fish/net and is similar to other lakes in the classification.  Buffalo condition and size structure were also comparable between 1994 and 2000, with fish widely dispersed between 11 and 28 inches in length.Other species captured during the 2000 assessment included (total number in parentheses) channel catfish (3), bluegill (16), pumpkinseed (1), and white sucker (3) and numerous fathead minnows.  The channel catfish were caught at a rate of 1 fish/gill net.  The bluegill were captured at a rate of 1.78 fish/ trap net and ranged in total length from 5 to 8 inches.  Several year classes of bluegill were present, indicating that some successful reproduction had likely occurred.  The management plan objective of two pike per gill net set was not achieved.  In fact, northern pike were absent from the 2000 gill net assessment.  The predator population in the lake is certainly not without a good predator species, as the walleye abundance has greatly increased.  Secondary management of yellow perch and black crappies have also met with several obstacles, including low black crappie density and extremely poor yellow perch condition.  Yellow perch tend to rely on benthic food resources; however, the relatively high abundance of small common carp and bullheads, has likely reduced food availability and decreased water clarity.  The panfish population, though, has been bolstered with a couple of strong year classes of white crappies.  White crappie density is somewhat high; however, the growth and condition of this population is excellent, indicating that there is a sufficient food supply and environmental condition are within tolerable parameters.  Additionally, water clarity in Bella Lake has been historically poor and white crappies have been known to succeed in turbid reservoirs where black crappies have failed.Bella Lake has relatively good walleye, northern pike, crappie, yellow perch and bluegill habitats during average to high water years.  The walleye appear to be succeeding in the lake with little assistance; however, to increase the potential predator base, an occasional fingerling stocking could be completed.  When water levels are low, bluegill and northern pike cover is unavailable; however, pike should continue to be managed for the years when water levels are high.  Although black crappies were introduced and have been the target of management efforts, white crappies have faired better and provided a quality population.  The yellow perch population is in relatively poor condition; however, perch populations can highly vary from year to year.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bella Lake is a 182-acre reservoir located 8 miles south of the City of Worthington, in Nobles County.  On a year with average water level fluctuations, the lake has a maximum depth of 14 ft.  Bella Lake serves as an aquifer replenishment reservoir for Worthington municipal water supplies, and thus has substantial water level fluctuations (up to 5 ft.).  Due to these water level fluctuations, shoreline erosion is prevalent around Bella Lake.  Bella Lake is managed primarily for White Crappie and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Walleye and Northern Pike.  The winter of 2022-2023 proved to be harsh on many area lakes, resulting in low dissolved oxygen levels and subsequent fish kills.  While dissolved oxygen was not measured on Bella Lake, reports of dead fish were received at ice out, thus a winterkill check was done on May 15, 2023, using boat electrofishing to gauge the extent of the winterkill.  The previous standard survey done on Bella Lake in 2017 documented 12 species of fish present in the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe electrofishing survey done in 2023 captured two species of fish, Bigmouth Buffalo (82.9 per hour) and Fathead Minnow (2857.1 per hour).  The lack of other species being captured suggests that Bella Lake had a significant partial winterkill.  It is possible that other species weren't sampled with electrofishing, but regardless a winterkill occurred.  Bella Lake was stocked with 180,000 Walleye fry in the spring of 2023 to try to establish a top-level predator in that system.   <br> \n</p>",

The northern pike population is low according to results from our 1994 lake survey.  Bella was stocked with approximately 725 adult northern pike during the winter of 1994.  With the excellent spawning habitat available to northern pike upstream, it is hoped we will reach our long range goal of 6 northern pike per net.  A fair to good yellow perch population exists in Bella according to our survey.  The present population consists of primarily 2 and 3 year old fish.  Perch fishing should be good during the summer and winter of 1995.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5 to 9.5 inches and the average weight was about 1/4 of a pound.The black crappie population was low in 1994.  The present plan is to stock adult black crappie in 1995 with hopes of establishing a self-sustaining population for future years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bella Lake is a reservoir located in southern Nobles County.  During an average year, the Lake has a surface area of 182 acres and a maximum depth of 14 feet; however, the lake serves as an aquifer replenishment reservoir for municipal water supplies and fluctuates substantially.  In 2002 a new management plan was developed to include white crappie as primary management species, and northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch as species of secondary management.   <br> \n <br> \nBella Lake is primarily managed for white crappie and supports a good population when compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths of white crappie were 3.7 to 10.5 inches with a mean of 8.9 inches.  While the numbers are extremely high, there are good numbers of respectable sized fish that can be caught.  Of the 65 white crappies sampled, 62% of those fish were in the 9 to 10.5 inch range.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch of 1.0 per net was in the lower range for lakes similar to Bella.  Lengths of northern pike were 18.4 to 21.9 inches with a mean of 19.7 inches.  There was a total of 8 northern pike sampled in this assessment, compared to 1 in 2000. Bella has potential to have a naturally self-sustaining population with the upstream channels and wetlands that connect it to Lake Ocheda. Starting in 2012 we will be stocking 3600 northern pike fingerlings every 3 years in an effort to improve numbers and provide an additional predator on small common carp. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch of 4.3 per gill net is in the middle of the road, so-to-speak, for lakes similar to Bella.  Lengths of walleye were 6.5 to 17.8 inches with a mean of 12.2 inches. Although the average length is 12.2, 44% of the walleye sampled were 14.0 to 18.1 inches.  That being said, the potential is there to catch good \"eaters\". <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill net catch of 5.0 per net was in the lower range for lakes similar to Bella.  Lengths of yellow perch were 5.4 to 8.6 inches with a mean of 6.2 inches.  The overall size of yellow perch in Bella are small.  This may be due in part to the large black bullhead population, and competition for forage.  <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead gillnet catch of 112.0 per net is well within the upper threshold for lakes similar to Bella. Lengths of black bullhead were 3.8 to 10.2 inches with a mean of 7.0 inches.  The yellow bullhead trap net catch of 2.4 per net is also in the upper threshold for lakes similar to Bella.  If you are looking for a peaceful wind protected place to catch some nice spring time bullheads, Bella would be a good option. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sample in the 2011 assessment included; black crappie, pumpkinseed, bigmouth buffalo, common carp, freshwater drum, and white sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Luke Rossow <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bella Lake is a 182-acre reservoir located 8 miles south of the City of Worthington, in Nobles County.  On a year with average water level fluctuations, the lake has a maximum depth of 14 ft.  Bella Lake serves as an aquifer replenishment reservoir for Worthington municipal water supplies, and thus has substantial water level fluctuations (up to 5 ft.).  Due to these water level fluctuations, shoreline erosion is prevalent around Bella Lake.  Bella Lake is managed primarily for White Crappie and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Walleye and Northern Pike.  A survey was conducted the week of June 19, 2017 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nThe White Crappie catch rate was 3.1 per trap net in 2017 which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 6.0 per trap net).  Lengths of White Crappies ranged from 8.8 to 12.5 inches and averaged 10.2 inches.  The trap net catch rate of Black Crappie was 5.3 per net, with lengths ranging from 5.0 to 10.4 inches.  While not abundant, some keeper sized crappie are available in Bella Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were captured at a rate of 0.3 per gill net in 2017, which is below expected catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Presently Bella Lake does not have a fishable perch population.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were captured at a rate of 3.7 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Walleye have historically occurred in low abundance in Bella Lake, as catch rates have never exceeded 7.0 per gill net. Lengths of Walleye ranged from 8.3 to 24.1 inches and averaged 13.8 inches.  Five year classes were sampled (age-1 to age-5), with age-1 Walleye accounting for 50 percent of aged fish.  While not highly abundant, Bella Lake has a fishable population of Walleye, with nice sized fish available.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate was 1.3 per gill net, which is the highest observed catch rate on Bella Lake, and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Lengths ranged from 12.5 to 32.9 inches and averaged 18.0 inches.  Pike fishing should be good in a couple of years when pike grow to larger sizes.  Beginning on the 2018 fishing opener, the Northern Pike daily limit changes to 2, and all Northern Pike less than 24 inches need to be released.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Channel Catfish catch rate was 8.3 per gill net, which is the highest observed catch rate on Bella Lake. Catfish lengths ranged from 7.7 to 22.5 inches and averaged 10.4 inches.  This population is sustained through natural reproduction as stocking of Channel Catfish hasn't occurred.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",
