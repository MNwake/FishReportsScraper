                "narrative": "<p>Orange Lake is found in ecological lake class #29 but has an alternate class of #20.  It is a centrarchid lake that historically has had some smallmouth and largemouth bass and no northern pike and walleye.  Since the lake is only 86 acres, only four gill nets and four trap nets were set.  Because of this, the information from this netting must be viewed cautiously, a spring muskellunge assessment was also conducted this year.  The summer and spring data together provide a rather good perspective as to what is happening on this lake.This assessment again sampled no walleye or northern pike.  No smallmouth bass were sampled in the nets but one was captured in the shoreline seining.  Muskellunge are still present, but from the spring netting, only a very small number still exists.  Largemouth bass have increased to high levels, as indicated by the gill net catch of 5.8.  The lake class first and third quartile for this species is 0.4 and 1.8, respectively.Yellow perch are at high levels, as indicated by the gill net CPUE of 39.8.  This is above the third quartile of 23.5.Bluegill and black crappie appear to be present at low numbers, as indicated by both gill net and trap net indices.  Both are below the first quartile for both types of gear.Due to the low numbers of fish sampled only aging was done.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Orange Lake is a 104 acre lake located 11 miles south of Marcell, Minnesota within the Soumi Hills Recreational Area.  Soumi Hills is within the Chippewa National Forest and is designated as a semi-primitive non-motorized area.  There is a carry-in public access down a long, steep hill from the north, which crosses the non-motorized designated boundary.  The 2004 Lake Management Plan (LMP) indicated Largemouth Bass and Muskie were primary management species while Black Crappie was a secondary management species.  The LMP goals included maintaining the Muskie population at approximately 50 adults, and maintain Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass populations through natural reproduction to provide a diversity of angling opportunities.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskies are difficult to sample using the standard summer gears because they exist at such low densities.  Consequently, targeted Muskie sampling attempts to capture fish during the spring when they move into the shallows to spawn.  In the spring of 2017, a targeted survey using 10 large-framed trap nets was conducted to evaluate the Muskie population.  The nets were fished in the same locations for four days.  Due to challenges in getting boats and sampling equipment into the lake, information on other species in the fish community was collected during the survey.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 25 Black Crappie were caught during the survey (0.6 fish/net).  The sampled fish ranged from 6.0 to 13.1 inches and averaged 9.6 inches.  Five age-classes were observed with age-3 fish representing 78% of the sample.  Fish averaged 10.3 inches after four years of growth, which is fast for the lake type.  Black Crappie may at times provide good fishing but due to the size of the lake they could be vulnerable to overharvest. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were caught at a rate of 9.3/net.  The fish ranged from 3.1 to 9.4 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.   Nine age-classes from 3 to 12 were present.  Bluegill growth is generally slow in lakes like Orange.  The fish averaged 6.2 inches after five years of growth.  Though the numbers and size of Bluegill may attract some anglers, the prevalent Neascus spp. (Black spot) on the fish will likely deter many anglers from harvesting them. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were caught at a rate of 4.2 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 10.3 to 20.6 inches and averaged 14.7 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this survey.  Anglers can find good bass fishing on Orange Lake. <br> \n <br> \nMuskie were originally stocked in Orange Lake to provide Shoepack strain brood fish for the Muskie stocking program.  The last stocking occurred in 1969 and the population has been maintained by natural reproduction ever since.  In the 2017 survey, 14 different fish were captured.  A population estimate was calculated based on the number of fish marked and the proportion of fish recaptured.  The adult population estimate was 16 fish and with 95% confidence, there was not less than 10 or more than 32 adults (or 1 adult per 3.3 to 10.4 acres) in the lake.  No juvenile fish were sampled.  The males ranged from 31.8 to 35.0 inches and averaged 33.3 while females ranged from 35.5 to 42.7 inches and averaged 38.7 inches.  The average length for all Muskies was 36.7 inches.  Age and growth were not estimated due to difficulty in aging the slower growing Shoepack strain fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe LMP goal of 50 adult Muskies was not met but the fish were larger than normal for Orange Lake.   Shoepack strain fish often do not get much longer than 36 inches, especially in smaller waterbodies, so the presences of fewer but larger fish would be expected.  Muskies may provide an exciting experience on Orange Lake, especially in smaller boats like canoes. <br> \n <br> \nNearly 2,000 Yellow Perch were sampled for a catch of 48.9/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 4.9 to 11.9 inches and had a mean length of 8.4 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this survey.  Based on the number and size of Yellow Perch sampled, they likely provide good angling opportunities as well as an important prey species.</p>",
