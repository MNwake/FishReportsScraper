The largemouth bass population has been shown to be good in previous assessments, with fish caught up to 20 inches and about 1 in 4 fish exceeding 16 inches.  Bluegill are of moderate density and average 6 inches in length, but only 11% of bluegills exceed 7 inches.  Black crappie are abundant, but averaged only 6.9 inches.  Twenty-five percent exceeded 8 inches.  Northern pike density is low, but the opportunity to catch a large fish is present.  One pike exceeding 40 inches was sampled in the 2001 survey, although the average size is a more modest 21.8 inches.  Tiger muskellunge are stocked every third year in Piersons Lake, but abundance and growth of these fish has been low.  Carp are abundant, and likely contribute to poor water quality in the lake.  Also present in low numbers are bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pierson Lake is a Class 24 lake located southwest of Victoria in Carver County.  It is 235 acres, with a maximum depth of 40 feet. There is a state owned public boat access on the west shore, but shore fishing access is limited.  The lake is managed for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill.  Hybrid (Tiger) Muskellunge were stocked from 1984 to 2006.  Walleye fry and fingerlings were stocked by private permit in 2012; no Walleye were sampled in this assessment.    <br> \n <br> \nThe 2013 population assessment consisted of summer gill netting and fall trap netting; however, neither gear targets Hybrid Muskellunge or Largemouth Bass effectively.  One Hybrid Muskellunge was sampled during this survey, measuring 28.6 inches and 16.0 pounds.  The Largemouth Bass catch included 2 from gill nets and 5 from trap nets ranging from 6.9 to 21.3 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population has increased in abundance and decreased in size since the previous (2007).  The gill net catch rate in 2013, 7.3 fish per net, was higher than the previous survey value (6.2 fish per net).  Average weight of the fish decreased over this same period, from 3.51 pounds  to 2.31 pounds.  Northern Pike ranged from 15.3 to 32.3 inches, averaging 21.1 inches.  Forty-two percent of the sample was larger than 21 inches, and only 5% of the sample was larger than 28 inches. The fish exhibited average growth rate, reaching 20.8 inches by age 4.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population was much lower in abundance (19.7/net) compared to the 2007 value (171.8/net), yet the average size remained similar.  Fish averaged 5.2 inches and 0.12 pounds.  Only 28 percent of the sample was larger than 6 inches, and 11% were larger than 7 inches.  Bluegill growth rates are average in Pierson Lake, with fish reaching 6.4 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were moderately abundant in the 2013 survey, and of average size.  The catch rate of 5.2 fish per gill net, is a decrease from the previous survey, when 8.3 fish per net were caught.  Black Crappie averaged 7.3 inches and 0.21 pounds.  The largest fish measured 8.9 inches.  Only 23% of the sample was larger than 8 inches, and no fish exceeded 9 inches in length.  Black Crappie in Pierson Lake exhibit below-average growth rates, reaching 7.8 inches by age 5. <br> \n</p>",

The average size of sampled bluegill was only 5.5 inches in length and rate of growth was found to be below average. No bluegill were captured in excess of 7.0 inches. Record high numbers of carp were also sampled, but individuals averaged only 11.5 inches in length. Northern pike, Hybrid Muskellunge, and largemouth bass are the gamefish species present in Pierson Lake. While the northern pike population has decreased in abundance since 1989, they are still present in above median levels with average size of sampled individuals being improved over previous surveys. Hybrid Muskellunge are presently stocked but relative abundance in the sample and below average growth may reflect their inability to compete against the existing northern pike population. Largemouth bass are present in good numbers with several fish over 18 inches being captured in the electrofishing sample.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pierson Lake is a 235-acre, class 24 lake located southwest of Victoria in Carver County.  There is a state owned public boat access on the west shore, but shore fishing access is limited.  The lake is primarily managed for hybrid muskellunge and largemouth bass with secondary emphasis on bluegill.  \nThe management plan schedules this lake for hybrid muskellunge stocking of 1.5 per littoral acre every three years, however due to availability and lake priority, the last four stocking events occurred in 2006, 2001, 1997, and 1994.\n\nThis summer population assessment consisted of 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets, however neither gear targets hybrid muskellunge or largemouth bass effectively.  No hybrid muskellunge were sampled during this survey and only 1 surveyed in each of the two previous surveys (2001 and 1994).  The largemouth bass catch included 2 from gill nets and 6 from trap nets ranging from 6.9 to 15.0 inches long and 2 to 5 years old.\n\nThe northern pike population has increased in abundance and size since the previous survey.  In 2001, northern pike were sampled at 3.8 per gill net, while in 2007, abundance has increased to 6.2 per gill net.  Additionally, mean weight has increased to 3.5 pounds.  Northern pike ranged from 18.4 up to 34.4 inches and averaged 24.5 inches in length.\n\nThe bluegill catch (171.8 per trap net) was nearly three times higher than the third quartile for this lake class, while the mean weight was low (0.1 pound).  Pierson Lake bluegills are small, averaging 5.6 inches, and no fish were sampled larger than 7 inches.  \n\nBlack crappie abundance was above average (8.3 per gill net) and mean weight (0.2 pounds) was average for similar lakes in this area.  Mean length was 7.2 inches but individuals up to 12.8 inches were recorded in the catch.  Age analysis indicated that recruitment is relatively consistent because ages 2 through10 (excluding age 9) are present in the population.  Compared with similar lake in the area, growth is slow, requiring 5 years to reach 7 inches.  \n\nOther fish species sampled during this survey include pumpkinseed, green, and hybrid sunfishes, black bullhead, bowfin, common carp, white sucker and yellow bullhead.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Piersons Lake is a 267-acre lake with a maximum depth of 40 feet. Piersons is located southwest of the City of Victoria in central Carver County. Public water access is provided by the DNR (3 vehicle parking spaces and 8 vehicle/trailer parking spaces).  Piersons is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass but also supports catchable populations of Walleye, Bluegill and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was conducted on Piersons Lake during the week of 7/21/2020 to assess the fishery. During the 2020 survey, Piersons had good water clarity, measured at 9.0 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen was zero parts per million (ppm) below 18 feet during the survey period. Eurasian Watermilfoil and Zebra Mussels have been found in Piersons Lake and remain present. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye in Piersons Lake are maintained through private stocking. During the 2020 survey Walleye were captured at 1.3/net, near the low end of their expected catch rate compared to similar lakes. There were 8 Walleye sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 19.3 inches and the largest measured at 24.7 inches. Despite inherent hurdles such as high predator numbers (Northern Pike), and a low forage base (Yellow Perch), private stocking has created a low abundance Walleye fishery in Piersons Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Piersons Lake, although targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2020 survey due to COVID-19 sampling restrictions. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught 15 Largemouth Bass, with an average length of 7.9 inches and the largest measured at 14.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled with gill nets (7.8/net) above the high end of their expected catch rate compared to similar metro lakes. Pike numbers have continued increasing in Piersons Lake over the previous four surveys, reaching a record high in 2020. There were 50 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 23.9 inches and the largest measured at 34.5 inches. Despite high abundances, Northern Pike are growing moderately fast, reaching 19 inches by age-3. Large sizes and fast growth are creating a desirable Northern Pike fishery on Piersons Lake. However, if pike numbers continue to increase to the point size and growth rates are negatively affected, anglers can help control the population through harvest. Effective 2018, anglers can keep 10 northern pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (70.3/net) above the expected catch rate compared to similar lakes. There were 633 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2020 survey, with an average length of 5.2 inches and the largest measured at 7.5 inches. Less than 5% of Bluegill sampled were greater than 7 inches. High numbers of Bluegill are likely keeping competition high and growth rates and sizes low. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (13.7/net); while trap net catches (1.4/net) were much lower. While the 2020 catch rates varied substantially between gears, average size of these fish has increased from previous surveys, with an average length of 7.9 inches and a maximum length of 10.5 inches. Over 60% of Black Crappie sampled were greater than 8 inches, providing ample angling opportunity for those looking to fill a limit of small-medium sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",
