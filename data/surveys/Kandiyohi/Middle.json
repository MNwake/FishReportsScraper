                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Middle Lake was conducted in June of 2015. An initial lake survey was conducted in 2010. Middle is a moderate to small sized (368 acres), shallow (11 feet maximum depth), non-aerated and productive lake located between Norway and Andrew lakes in northwestern Kandiyohi County. Historically, Middle Lake was known as an excellent waterfowl hunting lake. Low dissolved oxygen can be a persistent problem during some late winters (i.e. heavy snowfall conditions) for Middle resulting in winterkill of various fish species. A partial winterkill of Northern Pike occurred along the west side of Middle in March of 2011. Residential development (2 homes) is minimal, in addition to a few homes or farm sites across roads adjacent to the lake. There are two public access sites, which includes a carry-in canoe access via Sibley State Park on the east shore and a public gravel boat access adjacent to an Aquatic Management Area along the southwest shore. The immediate watershed consists mostly of hardwood areas associated with nearby Sibley State Park, wetland areas, agricultural row crops south of the lake and nearby residential lake homes on Andrew and Norway lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nEmergent vegetation (cattail species, hardstem bulrush, cane, reed canary grass) densities are abundant within the basin and along the shoreline. Other abundant aquatic vegetation species present included filamentous algae, muskgrass, northern milfoil and coontail. The most common occurring Shoalwater substrates are sand and silt. Water clarity was excellent (9.50 feet) during early June of 2015. Water levels were below normal during the spring and fall, but normal in the summer of 2015. Nutrient inputs are primarily from agricultural row crop runoff via several intermittent inlets along the south shore. There are several intermittent marsh connected inlets along the north and east shores. The outlet connects to Lake Andrew. The outlet connection frequently resulted in fish species (i.e. Northern Pike, Common Carp, etc.) moving into Middle Lake from Andrew to spawn when flows were adequate. Presently, there is a swinging finger fish barrier structure on the outlet culvert. It is unclear the effectiveness of this barrier due to recent low water conditions inhibiting fish movement between Middle and Andrew. Middle Lake was directly connected to Norway Lake in the past along the county road, but this connection has not been present for many years since the road was upgraded. Middle Lake has only two recorded fish stockings which occurred during May-June of 1997 with adult Bluegill (945 fish, 135 pounds) and Black Crappie (81 fish, 45 pounds). Middle Lake had been a popular lake for winter crappie fishing in past years when winter oxygen levels were adequate to sustain fish survival over several years. Middle is presently managed as a boom and bust fishery primarily for Northern Pike in conjunction with the DNR shallow lakes program. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were abundant in 2015 (19.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range. The 2015 Northern Pike average size was moderate to small (2.78 pounds and 22.8 inches) from the gillnet catch. There were moderate numbers of 28.0 inch plus Northern Pike in Middle. Northern Pike growth rates were moderate in Middle. Most of the Northern Pike captured in the survey belonged to the 2011 and 2013 year classes. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were also abundant in 2015 (136.11 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range. The Bluegill average size was small (0.07 pounds and 4.6 inches) due to mostly younger bluegill (2012 year class) present in Middle. There were a few larger Bluegill also present. Bluegill growth rates were moderate in Middle. Abundant numbers of other sunfish species such as Pumpkinseed (12.78 fish/trapnet), Green Sunfish (4.89 fish/trapnet) and Hybrid Sunfish (14.89 fish/trapnet) were also captured in 2015, but these fish were also small sized (0.07-0.14 pounds average size). <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2015 (5.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range. The Yellow Perch average size was moderate (0.24 pounds and 8.0 inches) from the gillnet catch. Yellow perch growth rates were good in Middle. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured included high numbers of small sized (7.1 inches average) Black Bullhead (207.00 fish/gillnet), high numbers of Bowfin \"dogfish\" (1.89 fish/trapnet), moderate numbers of Yellow Bullhead (1.67 fish/trapnet), and no Common Carp in 2015 survey nets. Common Carp numbers were moderately abundant in the previous 2010 survey (5.00 fish/gillnet, 3.11 fish/trapnet). The recent 2011 partial winterkill may have greatly reduced the Common Carp population in Middle.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Middle include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Middle Lake fishery will be assessed in the 2019 summer for all fish species.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Middle Lake was conducted in June of 2019. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).   <br> \n <br> \nMiddle is a moderate to small sized (368 acres), shallow (11 feet maximum depth), non-aerated and productive lake located between Norway and Andrew lakes in northwestern Kandiyohi County. Historically, Middle Lake was known as an excellent waterfowl hunting lake. Low dissolved oxygen can be a persistent problem during some late winters (i.e. heavy snowfall conditions) for Middle resulting in winterkill of various fish species. A partial winterkill of Northern Pike occurred along the west side of Middle in March of 2011. A partial winterkill (i.e. Sunfish species and Largemouth Bass?) probably occurred during February of 2019, although dead floating fish were not initially apparent in Middle. Winter dissolved oxygen levels were below 0.25 ppm on March 8, 2019. Residential development (2 homes) is minimal, in addition to a few homes or farm sites across roads adjacent to the lake. There are two public access sites, which includes a carry-in canoe access via Sibley State Park on the east shore and a public gravel boat access adjacent to an Aquatic Management Area along the southwest shore. The immediate watershed consists mostly of hardwood areas associated with nearby Sibley State Park, wetland areas, agricultural row crops south of the lake and nearby residential lake homes on Andrew and Norway lakes. Nutrient levels were high (total phosphorus=0.055 mg/l, chlorophyll-a=43.2 ppb) during June of 2010 for Middle. Nutrient inputs are primarily from agricultural row crop runoff via several intermittent inlets along the south shore. Water clarity was excellent (10.00 feet) on June 10, 2019. Dissolved oxygen was near 12 ppm at depths from 1-9 feet. Emergent vegetation (cattail species, hardstem bulrush, cane, reed canary grass) densities are abundant within and along the shoreline of Middle. Submergent vegetation species were limited and moderate in density during 2010. The most common occurring submergent species present within Middle were bushy pondweed, flat-stem pondweed, floating-leaf pondweed, muskgrass and northern milfoil in 2010. In 2015, filamentous algae, coontail and northern milfoil were abundant and inhibited navigation in Middle. In 2019, frequently occurring aquatic vegetation included bushy pondweed, Canada waterweed, filamentous algae, northern milfoil, water moss, coontail, flat-stemmed pondweed, floating pondweed and sago pondweed. The most common occurring shoalwater substrates include sand and silt. Water levels were above normal in 2019. There are several intermittent marsh connected inlets along the north and east shores. The outlet connects to Lake Andrew. The outlet connection frequently resulted in fish species moving into Middle Lake (i.e. Northern Pike, Common Carp, etc.) to spawn in the spring and early summer when flows are adequate. There was a swinging finger fish barrier structure on the outlet culvert, but it was ineffective during high flows. A new stainless steel barrier with a one piece front plate composed of small slots, instead of individual swinging fingers, was installed during the 2019 spring. Middle Lake was directly connected to Norway Lake in the past along the county road, but this connection has not been present for many years since the road was upgraded. Middle Lake has only two recorded fish stockings which occurred during May-June of 1997 with adult Bluegill (945 fish, 135 pounds) and Black Crappie (81 fish, 45 pounds). Middle Lake had been a popular lake for winter Black Crappie fishing in past years when winter oxygen levels were adequate to sustain fish survival over several years. Middle is presently managed as a boom and bust fishery primarily for Northern Pike in conjunction with the DNR shallow lakes program. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were moderate in 2019 (5.00 fish/gillnet). Northern Pike abundance was high in 2015 (19.00 fish/gillnet, 22.87 inches) and 2010 (18.33 fish/gillnet, 20.48 inches). The 2019 Northern Pike gillnet average size was small (1.81 pounds and 20.50 inches). Only one Northern Pike greater than 23.00 inches was captured in the 2019 survey nets. Northern Pike growth rates were slow in Middle. The 2016 year class comprised 82% of the 2019 Northern Pike survey catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Middle in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were not sampled in survey nets during 2019. Bluegill abundance was high in 2015 (136.11 fish/trapnet, 4.58 inches). Bluegill likely succumbed to winterkill in Middle Lake during February of 2019. There were no other sunfish species such as Pumpkinseed or Hybrid Sunfish present in the 2019 survey nets. Abundant numbers of Pumpkinseed (12.78 fish/trapnet), Green Sunfish (4.89 fish/trapnet) and Hybrid Sunfish (14.89 fish/trapnet) were captured in 2015. These sunfish species were generally small sized (0.07-0.14 pounds average size) in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2019 (3.00 fish/gillnet. The 2015 Yellow Perch catch rate was 5.00 fish/gillnet. The 2019 Yellow Perch gillnet average size was small (0.08 pounds and 5.56 inches). The 2016 year class comprised 100% of the 2019 Yellow Perch survey catch. Yellow Perch growth rates were slow in Middle. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2019 (7.00 fish/gillnet). Black Bullhead abundance was high in 2015 (207.00 fish/gillnet). The 2019 Black Bullhead gillnet average size was moderate (0.60 pounds and 10.20 inches). No Yellow Bullhead were present in the 2019 survey nets. Yellow Bullhead abundance was 1.67 fish/gillnet in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were not captured in the 2019 and 2015 survey nets. Common Carp abundance in high the 2010 survey (5.00 fish/gillnet, 3.11 fish/trapnet). Three Golden Shiners were captured in the 2019 survey nets. Bowfin were not present in the 2019 survey nets. Bowfin abundance was 1.89 fish/trapnet in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Middle include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Middle Lake fishery will be assessed in the 2024 summer for all fish species. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>An initial survey of Middle Lake was conducted in June of 2010. Middle is a moderate to small sized (352 acres), shallow (11 feet maximum depth), non-aerated and productive lake located between Norway and Andrew lakes in northwestern Kandiyohi County. Historically, Middle Lake was known as an excellent waterfowl hunting lake. Low dissolved oxygen can be a persistent problem during some late winters (i.e. heavy snowfall conditions) for Middle resulting in winterkill of various fish species. Residential development (2 homes) is minimal, in addition to a few homes or farm sites across roads adjacent to the lake. There are two public access sites, which includes a carry-in canoe access via Sibley State Park on the east shore and a new Aquatic Management Area along the southwest shore. The immediate watershed consists mostly of hardwood areas associated with nearby Sibley State Park, wetland areas, agricultural row crops south of the lake and nearby residential lake homes on Andrew and Norway lakes. Nutrient levels were high (total phosphorus=0.055 mg/l, chlorophyll-a=43.2 ppb) during June of 2010 for Middle. Water clarity was poor (2.0 feet) during June of 2010. Nutrient inputs are primarily from agricultural row crop runoff via several intermittent inlets along the south shore. There are several intermittent marsh connected inlets along the north and east shores. The outlet connects to Lake Andrew. The outlet connection frequently results in fish species moving into Middle Lake (i.e. northern pike, carp, etc.) to spawn in the spring and early summer when flows are adequate. Middle Lake was directly connected to Norway Lake in the past along the county road, but this connection has not been present for many years since the road was upgraded.  <br> \n <br> \nEmergent vegetation (cattail species, hardstem bulrush, cane, reed canary grass) densities were prevalent within Middle. Submergent vegetation species are limited and moderate in density within Middle. The most common occurring submergent species present within Middle were bushy pondweed, flat-stem pondweed, floating-leaf pondweed and northern milfoil. The most common occurring substrates included sand and silt. Dissolved oxygen levels were low during 2009 and 2010 in many aerated and non-aerated shallow lakes in the Spicer Area. A report of partial winterkill of northern pike along the west side of Middle occurred in March of 2011. Middle Lake has been a popular lake for winter crappie fishing in past years when dissolved oxygen readings were adequate to sustain fish survival over several years. Middle is managed as a boom and bust fishery primarily for northern pike, yellow perch and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2010 (18.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2010 northern pike average size was small (2.06 pounds and 20.50 inches) from gillnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was moderate to high (4.67 fish/gillnet). The 2010 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger northern pike was moderate (1.67 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates in Middle were generally within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5, but below the normal ranges for ages 6-8. The 2008 northern pike year class comprised 82% of the 2010 northern pike catch from gillnets and trapnets. The largest northern pike captured was 31.8 inches in the 2010 survey nets. There were no gamefish such as black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, walleye or yellow perch present in the 2010 survey nets. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2010 (17.67 fish/gillnet, 14.89 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2010 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.22 pounds and 7.22 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were moderate in 2010 (5.00 fish/gillnet, 3.11 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for similar lakes. The 2010 carp average size was small (2.08 pounds from gillnets and 4.17 pounds from trapnets).  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Middle include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Middle Lake fishery will be assessed in the 2015 summer for all fish species.  <br> \n</p>",
