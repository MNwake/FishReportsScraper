Unless it can be shown that the presence of an over abundance of perch is harmful to the other species in the lake, no removal operations appear necesssary at this time.A sufficiently high population of smallmouth bass appears to be present in Hunter Lake at the present time. No stocking of this species is recommended for the present.  The stocking of other species of fish is not recommended.No special regulations are necessary at present.</p>",
