                "narrative": "<p>Gale Lake is located 9 miles southeast of Bigfork, MN in the Big Fork River watershed.  The lake has a surface area of 73 acres and a maximum depth of 50 feet.  Gale Lake is in ecological lake class #28.  Other area lakes in this class include Arrowhead, Batson and Raddison Lakes. Gale Lake has no developed public access. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch rate in the 2008 assessment was 4.0/net.  This is similar to the lake class average (5.0/net) and equal to the catch from the only previous assessment in 1979.  Northern pike size structure was fairly poor.  Sampled pike ranged from 13.8 to 26.6 inches, with a mean length of 20.6 inches.  Mean back-calculated length at age was similar to the statewide average for all ages.  <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch rate for bluegill in 2008 was moderate at 13.0/net.  This is slightly below the lake class average and similar to the 1979 catch rate of 10.0/net.  Bluegill size structure was relatively good in 2008; sampled bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 9.1 inches, with a mean length of 6.5 inches.  Mean back-calculated length at age was similar to the lake class average for ages 1 and 2, and over 115% of the statewide average for ages 3-6. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at 2.0/trap net, above the lake class average of 1.3/net and substantially higher than the 1979 catch rate (0.5/net).  Size structure was modest; sampled crappie ranged from 7.8 to 10.8 inches, with a mean length of 9.2 inches.  Ages 3 through 7 were represented in the sample.  Mean back-calculated length at age was similar to the lake class average for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nAs in the prior assessment, net catches for yellow perch were very low in 2008.  Only four perch were captured in gill nets for a catch rate of 1.3/net.  Only one was captured in a trap net for a catch rate of 0.2/net.  These catch rates are below the lake class normal range but similar to the previous survey.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and yellow bullhead.  Numerous small largemouth bass were observed in the shallows, though none were captured in the assessment nets.   <br> \n</p>",
