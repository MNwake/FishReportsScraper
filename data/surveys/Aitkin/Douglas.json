                "narrative": "<p>Douglas Lake is an elongated lake with muck bays on both ends, sand along much of the rest of theshoreline, and an island in the middle. Dense vegetation grows in the bays and along the shoreline outto about 50 feet from shore. The water is moderately hard and fertile, and lightly bog-stained.Reasonable access to the lake is limited to private residences.       This survey revealed that northern pike abundance and average size (20 inches) are aboutaverage. The northerns, which were 11 to 28 inches long, have plenty to eat. The primary items on thepike menu are golden shiners, black crappies and yellow perch, all of which are more abundant thanaverage. Some  of the yellow perch and black crappies are large enough (up to 9 inches long) to supportnormal growth of even the larger pike.       Bluegill abundance is at the low end of normal and the fish are mostly over 7 inches long.Smaller bluegills are sparse, possibly because natural reproduction in Douglas Lake has been poor inthe last few years. The survey crew observed many females that had not spawned yet, despite the latedate (late June). Black crappies and yellow perch are also presently abundant enough to gobble up mostof the bluegill fry that do make it out of the nest. Intense predation on bluegill fry may furtherlimit the production of bluegills in the last few years.       Black crappies are growing slowly in Douglas Lake. Year class strength alternated between strongand weak years from 1988 to 1992. Fluctuations in both bluegill and crappie abundances probably leadsto variability in angling success.       Between 1988 and 1991 a large population of bigmouth buffalo fish became established. Acommercial fisherman removed four tons of bigmouth buffalos from the lake in June of 1992. No bigmouthbuffalos were caught during the current survey.       Black bullheads, particularly 7 to 9 inchers, were abundant. The combination of perch, shiners,bullheads and crappies probably results in a high catch rate although not necessarily for quality-sizedfish, or for northern pike which already have plenty to eat.</p>",
