As a result, black bullhead were extremely abundant in the nets, with more captured than in any previous netting.  Black crappie were present in low numbers, with a few fish over 10 inches present.  Bluegill were present in moderate numbers, with one-fifth of the fish over 8 inches in length.  Northern pike were present in low numbers, similar to previously, with a few fish over 25 inches long.  Very small numbers of golden shiner, yellow perch, largemouth bass, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish were sampled.</p>",

Channel catfish sampled were of large size - growth appeared good.  Hybrid sunfish were taken at median levels.  Bluegill were sampled in high numbers - more than 10 times the local median.  Growth of BLG was average for the area.  Black crappie were average size and abundant, being sampled at about 5 times the median rate for the area.  Largemouth bass sampled by electrofishing exhibited average growth.  LMB reproduction was verified by shoreline seining.  Walleye were sampled near the local median trapnet level.  All of the WAE sampled were of the 1985 year class and exhibited average growth.</p>",

There is a fishing pier and a small boat launch in the city park. No gas motors are allowed on the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are the most abundant species found in the lake but only average slightly more than 5.5 inches in length. Black crappies are found in moderate numbers and also of small size. No crappies over 10 inches were sampled in this survey. Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers. Northern pike were also sampled in average numbers. Walleyes are found in low numbers even though they have been stocked every other year since 2001. Channel catfish are stocked annually. This has resulted in one of the better channel catfish lakes in the east metro area. The average size catfish sampled during the survey was 24.4 inches in length.        <br> \n</p>",

Carp were taken only in trapnets.Northern pike were found to be in numbers more than 2.5 times the local median.  All ages from I annulus through VI annulus were found as was an VIII annulus fish.  The most abundant ages were those with IV (6 fish) and V (5 fish) annuli.  Growth at those ages was average.  The ages present would indicate natural reproduction occurs.  There does not, however, appear to have been significant reproduction over the last several years.Although higher than the statewide median, the bluegill catch rate was lower than the local median.  Bluegill numbers are significantly higher now (1979) than found in 1976 (15.0 vs. 2.4 per lift).  The major portion of the population is made up of II annulus fish (20/26 aged).  Fish at this age showed very fast growth.  Substantial numbers of young of the year sunfish were found in shoreline seining.  Black crappie numbers are much higher than the statewide median, the local median and the 1976 catch rate.  Black crappies aged were III and IV annulus fish exhibiting average growth.  Yellow perch numbers are very high and III annulus fish with average growth were most abundant.  Young of the year perch were found in seining.  Black bullhead numbers are higher than the local median and the 1976 catch.  The fish tend to be small with the median length group being 6.0-6.4 inches.  Carp numbers are not high.  Presence of a small fish would indicate some natural reproduction does occur at times.</p>",

This catch exceeds the local median 21 times.  Walleye and largemouth bass are above the medians, while bluegill are significantly less than the local median.  The 1986 bluegill catch was also well under the medians.  Four species not stocked after the fall 1984 reclamation were sampled in the test nets.  Black bullhead and northern pike are present in numbers above the local median while black crappie and hybrid sunfish are below.  Growth of sampled northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill is normal.  Walleye growth is above the statewide average.</p>",

The majority of the fish are 3 years old and show average growth.  Eighty-three largemouth bass were captured electrofishing and they exhibit good to fast growth.  Seining showed a very strong year class of largemouth bass.  Six northern pike YY were seined, verifying natural reproduction.  The number of northern pike captured in the gill nets were 3 times the local median catch rate and these fish are very fast growing.  One walleye netted and two shocked; they were 15-19\" and exhibited fast growth.  Eleven channel catfish were sampled. Ten measured 18-21\" and one 24\".  Black bullhead trapnet CPUE rose from 4 fish per trap in 1988 to 17.8 this year.  Black crappie trapnet CPUE declined from 63 per trap in 1988 to 10.8 in 1989.  Most crappie were in the 5.5 to 8.0\" group.  Three hybrid sunfish captured and 1 green sunfish.</p>",

This situation has brought about the frequent winterkill which is disabling, yet incomplete.  The black bullhead has found this habitat ideally suited to its needs, being able to better withstand the arduous winters.  That this species is not particularly wanted is evident.  The population control attempted to date has not been productive.  Further, it is doubtful that such measures can be effective, short of total destruction, for such a program fails to consider the reproductive capacity of a few bullheads.  A possible solution entails a program of self-help on the part of the local populus in cooperation with the Conservation Department, the action being \"bullhead school\" destruction under the guidance of fisheries personnel.The other components of the Golden Lake fish population were found to be in good condition in numbers and growth.  It is extreme youthfulness, rather than slow growth, which is the cause of the present small size of the fish being caught.</p>",

There is a fishing pier and a small boat launch in the city park. An electric motor only boating regulation is in place on this lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most abundant species found in the lake but only averaged slightly more than 6.15 inches. Black Crappies are found in moderate numbers and are of moderate size. Only one Black Crappie over 10 inches was sampled in this survey and it was 10.35 inches long. Largemouth Bass were sampled in average numbers for lakes like Golden but were of small size. Northern Pike were also sampled in modest numbers but the fish found were good sized. No Walleye were observed in this survey even though fry have been stocked every other year since 2001. Of the east metro lakes stocked with Channel Catfish, Golden has been one of the more successful and historically had one of the highest net catches for Channel Catfish, however none were detected in 2013. Channel Catfish yearlings were last stocked 2009.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Golden Lake is a small (57 acre) class 38 lake located at the lower end of a sub-watershed of the Rice Creek Watershed in the City of Circle Pines. Maximum depth is 25 feet. A portion of the lakeshore is included in a City of Circle Pines park that contains a boat access and shore facilities for a cascade type winter aeration system. The city park also hosts a fishing pier, swimming beach and a small boat launch. An electric motor only boating regulation is in place on this lake. The aeration system is a permanent structure buried in the ground. The system discharges below the water surface to minimize open water areas in winter. Golden Lake in the past has been stocked with Channel Catfish and Walleye of various sizes off and on since 1984. Efforts to establish a fishable Walleye population have been difficult as no Walleye have been sampled in the last two surveys. The last Channel Catfish stocking effort occurred in 2009 and continued stocking efforts are dependent on finding a quality source of Channel Catfish. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were found in slightly above average abundance for lakes similar to Golden with average size being a little more than 6.0 inches. Black Crappies can be found in average numbers and are of below average size. Largemouth Bass were sampled in average numbers for lakes like Golden and are of average size. Northern Pike were also sampled in below average numbers but the fish found were decent sized and averaged just less than 26 inches. Of the east metro lakes stocked with Channel Catfish, Golden has been one of the more successful and historically had one of the highest net catches for Channel Catfish. One 19.0 inch Channel Catfish was sampled in 2018.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
