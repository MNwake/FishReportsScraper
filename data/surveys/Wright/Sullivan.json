Age classes 2-6 were represented with age 6 the most common. Growth was average. A limited sample of Largemouth Bass suggests that growth is slow for this species. Bluegill numbers are about average. However, this is down from 85.0/trap net in 1972. Age 4 fish dominated the catch and growth was average. Black Crappie were below the local average in abundance, compared to 1972 when Black Crappie were caught at a rate of 4.3/trap net. Age 4 dominated, and growth bordered on slow. Yellow Bullhead are high in numbers (9.7/trap net, 29.6/gill net) compared with the local average.</p>",

Fifty-three largemouth bass ranging in length from 3.5 to 19.1 inches were captured in spring seining efforts. The median length increment was 7.0-7.4 inches. Growth was slow during the first 4 years of life and good in successive years. Bluegill abundance was near the local median and down from 49.50/lift in 1983. Bluegills ranged in length from 3.5 to 6.5 inches in length with a modal length increment of 6.0-6.4 inches. Growth of bluegills was slow. Yellow bullhead abundance was similar to the 1983 catch of 9.75/lift. Modal length increment was 8.0-8.4 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sullivan Lake is a small (73 acre), highly developed lake located between Buffalo and Maple Lake in Wright County. The lake has a maximum depth of 58 feet with moderate water quality with an average summer water clarity of seven (7) feet. There is one (1) public access located on the east side of the lake. A lake survey was completed July 6 - 9, 2020 to update fisheries data last collected in 2001 and included summer gill netting and trap netting. <br> \n <br> \nA floating leaf and emergent vegetation survey was completed in September. Cattail (50 acres) and waterlilies (17 acres) were the most abundant species and covered 48% and 66% of the shoreline, respectively. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing is the preferred sampling method to assess Largemouth Bass populations; however Largemouth Bass sampling was not conducted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Largemouth Bass were last surveyed by electrofishing in 2001 with only 10 small fish sampled ranging in length from five (5) to seven (7) inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch for gill net sampling in 2020 was lower than 2001, but within the range of expected values for similar lakes. The trap net catch in 2020 was similar to 2001 and the long term average for the lake. Twenty-two Black Crappie were sampled and ranged in length from six (6) to 10 inches with an average length of seven (7) inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were abundant and small during the 1970s and 1980s, but abundance has declined to more normal levels recently. The catch in 2020 was significantly higher than 2001, but still within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Sullivan. Bluegill sampled ranged in length from three (3) to eight (8) inches with an average length of six (6) inches. Forty percent of the Bluegill sampled were longer than six (6) inches and none were longer than eight (8) inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant and offer anglers the opportunity to catch good numbers as well as quality-sized pike. However, anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike (<22 inches) and release the medium-sized pike (>26 inches) to help balance the size structure. Northern Pike numbers in 2020 were high, but similar to 2001 and above the range of expected values for similar lakes. Northern Pike ranged in length from 18 to 32 inches with an average length and weight of 23 inches and three (3) pounds. Twenty-one percent of the Northern Pike sampled were longer than 26 inches and 4% were longer than 30 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are not a managed species in the lake and have never been stocked in the lake by the state. No Walleye were sampled in 2020 and only three (3) Walleye (all caught in 2001) have ever been sampled in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was extremely low. Over the course of four (4) surveys (1983 - 2020) only 10 Yellow Perch have ever been sampled. Low numbers of Yellow Perch is likely due to the high Northern Pike abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sullivan Lake is located in central Wright County, between the cities of Buffalo and Maple Lake.  The lake is small (73 acres), with a maximum depth of 58 feet.  Water clarity is good, but dense vegetation may make angling difficult in shallow areas of the lake.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  A fisheries survey conducted in 2001 included electrofishing, gillnetting, trapnetting, seining, and a vegetation survey.The northern pike population appeared high for a lake like Sullivan, with individuals averaging 2.3 pounds.  Most of the fish were 20-22 inches in length, with some as large as 27 inches.  Stocking of pike fingerlings in 1990 and 1991 appears to have helped restore the pike fishery following the 1989 survey, when none were caught.  A few walleye were also sampled during the 2001 survey, ranging from 19 to 24 inches.Largemouth bass were mostly small and slow-growing.  Few were sampled during spring electrofishing, and the average size was less than six inches.  Bluegill numbers also appeared low, although heavy vegetation may have limited the catch in trap nets.  Most individuals were 6-7 inches in length.  Black crappie were sampled in numbers typical for a lake like Sullivan, and most were 6-7 inches in length.  Low numbers of small perch are present, which is expected, given the abundant northern pike in the lake.</p>",
