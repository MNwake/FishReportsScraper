                "narrative": "<p>Sylvia Lake is a small, scenic lake in northern Stearns County about 5 miles north of Melrose. It's connected to Little Birch Lake via a short, but non-navigable channel. A fishing pier and shoreline fishing-site is located in Lake Sylvia County Park on the south end of the lake near the public boat access which is immediately east of the Park.  <br> \n <br> \nSylvia is a relatively clear-water lake that supports a slightly unusual fish community for lakes in this area of the state. In addition to common species such as Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth and Largemouth Bass, the lake also contains Channel catfish, Shorthead Redhorse, Greater Redhorse and Bigmouth Buffalo; all migrants from the Sauk River via Adley Creek (lake outlet). Cisco, a species on the southern edge of its range, is also supported in Sylvia Lake due to the lakes high water quality.   <br> \n  <br> \nRecent surveys depict a Smallmouth Bass fishery that may be of most interest to anglers.  Electrofishing surveys capture good numbers of smallmouth, some up to 18 inches or more. Largemouth Bass are present in fewer numbers but attain large size as well. Northern Pike and Walleye appear to be quite low in abundance, however, large individuals of both species have been sampled in nets. Bluegill and Black Crappie are average in abundance and size however, lengths up to 8 and 13 inches have been recorded for each respective species. Good shore-fishing opportunities for panfish are available at Lake Sylvia County Park.  <br> \n <br> \nCiscoes are coldwater fish present in Sylvia Lake. They're indicator species of lakes with high water quality. Ciscoes are declining in many Minnesota lakes due to climate change and nutrient runoff. The greatest period of stress occurs in late summer when oxy-thermal habitat is most limited. Summer oxy-thermal habitat is found at mid-lake depths where the temperature is below 70 degrees and dissolved oxygen is adequately present. Hotter, longer summers coupled with high nutrient runoff can put the squeeze on this deeper layer of oxy-thermal habitat Ciscoes depend on.  Since Ciscoes demonstrate some resilience to warmer water temperatures, farmers, lakeshore residents, townships, counties and other stakeholders are encouraged  to minimize nutrient runoff by giving up the use of fertilizers and adopt shoreline vegetative buffer strips or cover crops as the situation pertains.  <br> \n <br> \nThe bog ecosystem with its many springs on the west side of Sylvia Lake is rare in central Minnesota and preserving it is essential to maintaining lake water quality. Steep drop-offs around much of the lake limit the amount of vegetated habitat. As such, vegetation removal is discouraged and protection of remaining fish habitat is critical. Unfortunately, Eurasian Watermilfoil was documented for the first time in Sylvia Lake in 2011. Significant growth was noted in early summer 2018 but appeared to diminish by late summer. Sylvia also contains zebra mussels. Lake visitors must be diligent about inspecting and cleaning watercraft when leaving the lake.  Selective fish harvest is also encouraged to minimize impacts to the fish community.  Releasing large panfish helps sustain angling quality into the future, especially in smaller lakes like Sylvia. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Sylvia Lake is a small, scenic lake in northern Stearns County which  is influenced by both Little Birch Lake which is upstream and the outlet, Adley Creek which is connected to the Sauk River.  A fishing pier and shoreline fishing site at the county park on the southwest side of the lake along with a public access on the south side provide opportunities for anglers.  Water clarity was 8 feet which appears to be typical for the lake in August when looking at past records.   <br> \n     The lake supports an unusual fish community for this area of the state.  The gamefish portion is comprised of walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, channel catfish, and yellow perch.   Average size of the northern pike observed in the assessment was about two pounds, but fish over 30 inches can be found.   Immigration from Little Birch Lake and/or natural reproduction appears to sustain the walleye population and some large walleye have been documented in the past.  Sylvia Lake appears to be well suited for smallmouth bass as they were more numerous than largemouth bass in the assessment, but more of the larger bass observed were largemouth bass.  Local residents reported a decrease in bullhead abundance and an increase in catfish numbers although few of either species were caught in the assessment.   <br> \n      Roughfish species include tullibee or cisco, white suckers, shorthead redhorse, greater redhorse, bigmouth buffalo, bowfin or dogfish, common carp and two species of bullhead.  Bigmouth buffalo were documented for the first time in the lake in 2011.  The presence of that species along with the greater redhorse, shorthead redhorse, and channel catfish indicates the influence of a river connection.  With the diversity of roughfish species available as prey, the gamefish display good growth rates and body condition.  A wide range of sizes were observed in the tullibee catch with some measuring up to 18 inches.  The tullibee appeared to be free of Triaenophorus or white grub. <br> \n     There are also several panfish species available to anglers such as bluegill, black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass.   Shoreline fishermen are typically seen catching crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass from the county park fishing pier and shoreline.  Both quality size crappie and bluegill were observed, but average size of the bluegill was about six inches while crappie over nine inches were common in the assessment.  <br> \n     The bog ecosystem with its many springs on the west side of Sylvia Lake is rare in central Minnesota and preserving it is encouraged.  With the steep drop-offs around much of the lake, vegetation beds are few.  Limiting vegetation removal is necessary to protect what sparse fish habitat there is.  Lake associations on the lakes higher in the watershed, Big Birch and Little Birch, have taken steps to address nutrients entering their lakes.  Improving water quality in the upper watershed should help the quality in Sylvia Lake.  Eurasian watermilfoil was documented for the first time in Sylvia Lake in 2011, so boaters should be diligent about removing vegetation from their boats when leaving the lake.  Selective fish harvest is also encouraged to minimize impacts to the fish community.  Releasing larger walleye and northern pike, smallmouth bass and voluntarily limiting harvest of large panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community, especially in smaller lakes like Sylvia. <br> \n       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>         Spring night electrofishing was conducted in early April of 2012 in place of an ice-out assessment.  Due to workload and available manpower an ice-out assessment was not possible.  The primary objective for the electrofishing was to capture walleye, a species which was absent in the 2011 summer population assessment.  The entire shoreline was electrofished in two runs for a total of almost 1.25 hours of on-time.   <br> \n       Eleven walleye between 8.7 and 30.2 inches in length were netted for a catch rate of 8.8 per hour.  Although there were over seven year classes represented, a significant portion (45%; n=5) of the sample was comprised of fish exceeding twenty inches in length.  Ages 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, and 15 plus were represented in the sample.  There were no more than two fish in any age group.  Since walleye stocking was discontinued in 1989, the population is likely sustained through immigration from Little Birch Lake, the Sauk River, and/or natural reproduction. <br> \n       Walleye have also been caught in previous spring electrofishing efforts that have targeted bass or both smallmouth bass and walleye.  Spring daytime electrofishing was attempted in mid-May of 2011 targeting black crappie, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass.  Only four walleye were netted in that effort.  A spring night time electrofishing effort in mid-June of 2005 for largemouth and smallmouth bass, sampled three walleye.  Spring night electrofishing in mid-May of 1997 for largemouth bass was very effective at also sampling walleye.  While few bass of either species were netted, twenty-five juvenile walleye were caught.  The fish ranged from 5.4 to 12.7 inches in length.   <br> \n       Smallmouth bass was the most abundant species in the 2012 electrofishing effort, with thirty-six caught.  While most of the bass were from twelve to sixteen inches in length, one 19.4-inch smallmouth bass was measured.  PSD for the smallmouth bass sample was 73.  Four largemouth bass between nine and sixteen inches were sampled along with three black crappie between 11.5 and 12 inches.  Northern pike were the second most common species in the 2012 spring electrofishing.  Seventeen pike from 9.4 to 24.1 inches in length were captured.   <br> \n       An ice-out trap net assessment may be necessary to determine if trap netting would prove more effective for sampling the walleye population in Sylvia Lake than electrofishing.  Spring night electrofishing appears to be more effective for sampling walleye than daytime efforts in Sylvia and other area lakes.  <br> \n</p>",

A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the south shore. Sylvia Lake has 1.99 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 56 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Black Crappie and secondarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. The lake was initially surveyed in 1957 and 8 fish sampling surveys or investigations have occurred since then with the most recent prior sampling in 2016. <br> \nA targeted survey for Northern Pike and Walleye was conducted on Sylvia Lake following ice out using trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 42 Northern Pike were captured during the ice out survey with trap nets. The 2017 trap net catch rate was 3.0 fish/net night. This was the first ice-out trap netting survey, therefore data for comparison is unavailable. Size structure analyses were not run due to sample size. The mean length of Northern Pike sampled was 19.74 inches with lengths ranging from 11.7 to 27.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNo Walleye were captured.</p>",

NO FISH YOUNGER THAN AGE V WERE CAUGHT IN THE GEAR AND ONLY AGE V AND VI FISH WERE REPRESENTED.  THE 1991 NOP GILLNET CATCH INDICATES A SURVEY RISING FROM 2/SET TO 11.00/SET.  MEAN WEIGHT DECREASED FROM 3.77 LBS/FISH IN 1986 TO 1.95 LBS/FISH IN 1991.  NOP GILLNET CATCHES HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN LOW; 0.50/SET IN 1975, 1.00/SET IN 1979, AND 2.00/SET IN 1986.  THE INCREASE IN THE NOP POPULATION POSES CONCERN AND MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOW CATCH RATES AND LOW NUMBERS OF AGE IV AND UNDER TLC.  THE INCREASE IN NOP NUMBERS MAY ADVERSELY EFFECT OTHER SPECIES AS WELL.  AGE I THROUGH V NOP WERE REPRESENTED IN THE CATCH.  GROWTH RATES FOR ALL AGE CLASSES WERE  SAMPLED.  THE GILLNET CATCH FOR SHR WAS 0.67/SET AND MEAN WEIGHT WAS 2.64/SET AND MEAN WEIGHT WAS 2.64 LBS/FISH.  THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THIS SPECIES WAS SAMPLED IN GILLNETS IN SYLVIA LAKE. YEP GILLNET CATCH RATES FOR 1991 (0.33/SET) WERE DOWN FROM 1986 (1.33/SET).  YEP WERE NOT FOUND IN THE 1979 AND 1975 SURVEYS.  THE GILLNET CATCH FOR WAE INCREASED FROM 0.66/SET IN 1986 TO 4.67/SET IN 1991.  MEAN WEIGHT ALSO INCREASED FORM 1.67 LBS/ FISH IN 1986 TO 2.2 LBS/FISH IN 1991.  AGES II, III, V, AND VII WERE PRESENT IN THE 1991 SURVEY REFLECTING THE EVERY OTHER YEAR STOCKING SCHEME. SOME AGE II FISH MAY HAVE MIGRATED FROM LITTLE BIRCH LAKE OR MAY HAVE BEEN NATURALLY REPRODUCED. GROWTH FOR ALL AGES WAS NORMAL.  SMB TRAPNET CATCHES HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN ALL SURVEY YEARS INDICATING A NORMAL POPULATION FOR THIS LAKE CLASSIFICATION.  ONLY AGE II FISH WERE SAMPLED IN 1991 AND THEY DISPLAYED NORMAL GROWTH WHEN COMPARED TO STATEWIDE MEANS.  FOUR YOY SMB WERE CAPTURED IN THE NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS.  LMB TRAPNET CATCHES INCLUDED FISH FROM AGES I-III AND ALL AGES DISPLAYED NORMAL GROWTH.  THIS WAS THE FIRST SURVEY LMB WERE CAPTURED IN TRAPNETS ON SYLVIA LAKE AND THE AVERAGE CATCH WAS 0.75/SET. PRIOR NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF LMB.  FIFTEEN YOUNG OF YEAR AND FIVE YEARLING LMB WERE CAPTURED IN THE NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS IN 1991.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sylvia Lake is a small, scenic lake in northern Stearns County.  Sylvia is the last lake in a chain of three lake which starts at Big Birch Lake with Little Birch Lake in the middle.  Most of the development occurs on the moderate to steep slopes on the east side of the lake.  The west side of the lake has deciduous forests and tamarack/spruce bogs which are used as cattle pastures.  A county park on the southwest side of the lake has a fishing pier and also provides shoreline fishing.  Much of the shoreline is sand with some silt.  The silt suspends easily which clouds the water.  Water clarity was only 7 feet which appears to be typical for the lake in August when looking at past records.  Aquatic vegetation does grow down to a depth of 13 feet and while there is a diverse variety of plants there are few dense beds of any one species.     The lake supports a unusual fish community for this area of the state.  The gamefish community is comprised of walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, channel catfish, and yellow perch, while roughfish species include tullibee, white suckers, shorthead redhorse, carp, greater redhorse, and three species of bullheads.  There are also several panfish species available to anglers such as bluegills, black crappies, pumpkinseeds, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass.  With the diverse roughfish species available in the lake, the gamefish display good growth rates and body condition.  Anglers do report having a hard time catching fish on the lake and one local commented that the water remains \"milky\" throughout the winter.  Shore fishermen are typically seen catching crappies, bluegills, and largemouth bass from the county park pier and shoreline.   Fish are known to migrate to Sylvia from the Sauk River and also between Little Birch Lake and Sylvia which has produced a catfish and carp population in both of the lakes.     Sylvia is a unique lake for this area of the state and every effort should be made to protect the water quality and shoreline habitats.  The bog ecosystem with its many springs on the west side of the lake is rare in central Minnesota and preserving it is encouraged.  Limiting vegetation removal in Sylvia Lake is necessary to protect what sparse fish habitat there is.  Lake associations on the lakes higher in the watershed, Big Birch and Little Birch, have taken steps to address nutrients entering their lakes.  Improving water quality in the upper watershed should help the quality in the lower lakes.  Eurasian water milfoil has been found in Little Birch Lake so homeowners and boaters should be diligent about removing vegetation from their boats before leaving any of the lakes in the watershed.  Selective fish harvest is also encouraged to minimize impacts to the fish community.  Releasing larger walleye and northern pike and voluntarily limiting harvest of the large panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community, especially in smaller lakes like Sylvia.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sylvia Lake is a small lake in northern Stearns County with high recreationalvalue.  The lake is still relatively scenic, water clarity is excellent for a lakein this area of the state, and much of the shoreline is sand.  The east half of thelake has moderate development while the west shore is undeveloped with some cattlegrazing and a county park.  The park has a fishing pier and also provides bankangling.  Moderate to steep topography with mixed hardwoods can be found on theeast side of the lake while the west shore has a tamarack/spruce bog with numeroussprings.       Sylvia Lake supports a fish community more common in northern Minnesota. Walleye and northern pike populations are unlike those found in most of the arealakes.  Abundance of walleye was high when compared to similar lake types and mostof the fish sampled were over 20 inches in length with an average weight of 3.4pounds.  Trophy size walleye up to twenty-nine inches were also observed.  The sizestructure of the northern pike population was also good, with an average length ofmore than 24 inches and average weight of almost four pounds.  Smallmouth andlargemouth bass are both present in the lake.  Population levels for the smallmouthappear normal for the lake type while largemouth bass numbers were low.  Basstypically are difficult to assess with standard lake survey gear, so springelectrofishing was used to better evaluate the populations.  All bass sampled wereless than 15 inches in length.  The tullibee population level appeared normal andwas dominated by the '96 year class.  The largest tullibee sampled was aboutthirteen inches in length with the adult fish showing poor growth.  Tullibee arethe principal prey species in the lake for the walleye and northern pike with thelow yellow perch population.  Bluegill numbers were also low in the survey whileblack crappie numbers appeared normal for the lake type.  Average size for thebluegills was 5.5 inches, but some individuals up to seven inches were observed. Average size for the crappies was also small (8 inches), but several ten to eleveninch crappies were sampled.  Other panfish present in the lake include pumpkinseed,hybrid sunfish, and rock bass.     Sylvia Lake's roughfish community is made up of many different speciesincluding carp, white suckers, greater redhorse, silver redhorse, shortheadredhorse, bowfin or dogfish, and yellow bullhead.  Population levels for all thespecies were low to normal for the lake type posing little concern.     Neascus was common on the walleye and occasional on several other species. Neascus is a black trematode or parasite that burrows into the skin of fish.  Thelife cycle includes snails, fish, and fish-eating birds, such as herons.  Humanscan not be infested.  Skinning the fish usually remove most of the parasites andcooking will kill the rest.  Some of the larger tullibee were infested withtriaenophorus or white worm found in the back muscle of the fish.  The worm is inthe immature stage in tullibee and later develops into the adult form in theintestines of northern pike which feeds on the tullibee.  This parasite is harmlessto man.     Every effort should be made to protect the water quality and shorelinehabitats of Sylvia Lake.  The bog ecosystem found on the west side of the lake israre in central Minnesota and preserving  it is encouraged.  Lakes higher in thewatershed, Big Birch and Little Birch, have taken steps to address nutrientsentering their lakes.  Big Birch Lake Association working with the Sauk RiverWatershed District, has been particularly aggressive in working toward solutions. Improving water quality the in upper watershed will lead to better water qualityin the lower lakes.  Selective fish harvest is also encouraged to minimize impactsto the fish community.  Releasing larger walleye and northern pike and voluntarilylimiting harvest of large panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of thefish community, especially in smaller lakes like Sylvia.</p>",

FEW LENGTHS AND WEIGHTS ARE AVAILABLE FROM PREVIOUS SURVEYS, MAKING COMPARISONS NOT PRACTICAL. GROWTH RATES ARE FASTER THAN NORMAL. WALLEYES WERE CAP- TURED BARELY BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE IN GILLNETS (2.0) AND ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE IN TRAPNETS (1.0), PROBABLY INDICATING AN AVERAGE SIZE POPULA- TION. SIZES RANGED FROM 11.5 TO 18.9 INCHES. THOUGH WALLEYES HAVE BEEN STOCKED  SINCE 1970, THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE EVER BEEN NETTED GROWTH APPEARS NORMAL. YELLOW PERCH ARE PRESENT IN BELOW AVERAGE NUMBERS. SIZES RANGED FROM 5.0-6.4 INCHES. YOUNG-OF-THE- YEAR WERE PRESENT IN THE NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS. TULLIBEE NUMBERS REMAIN WELL ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE IN GILLNETS. SIZES RANGED FROM 8.5- 12.9 INCHES. LARGEMOUTH BASS HAVE NEVER BEEN CAUGHT IN STANDARD NETTING GEAR, YET YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR WERE CAPTURED IN THIS N.R.C. AND IN A PREVIOUS ONE. SMALLMOUTH BASS WERE CAUGHT IN TRAPNETS AT 2-1/2 TIMES THE STATE AVERAGE YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR WERE CAPTURED IN THE NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECK. BOWFIN, BLACK BULLHEAD, YELLOW BULLHEAD, BLUEGILL, AND BLACK CRAPPIE INDICATED HIGHER THAN AVERAGE POPULATIONS. CRAPPIES EXHIBITED A WIDE RANGE OF SIZES (5.5'-9.9'). WITH AN AVERAGE WT OF 0.29 PDS. COMPARED TO A PREVIOUS AVERAGE OF 0.14 PDS. CORRE- SPONDING TO THIS, THE MEAN LENGTH HAS INCREASED ONE INCH TO 7.5-7.9. WHITE SUCKER, BROWN BULLHEAD, ROCK BASS, AND PUMPKINSEED CATCHES INDICATE AVG POPULATIONS. SIX SPECIES WERE CAPTURED THAT WERE NEVER RECORDED IN OTHER SURVEYS. THEY ARE:  BOWFIN WALLEYE, SHORTHEAD REDHORSE, PUMPKINSEED, ROCK BASS AND WHITE SUCKER.</p>",
