                "narrative": "<p>Jack the Horse Lake is a 383 acre lake located northeast of Marcell, MN.  The lake has a carry-in access off of U.S. Forest Service road 2182.  There had not been a lake management plan developed for the lake at the time of this assessment.In 2004, the black crappie gill-net catch rate was 1.3/net while the trap-net catch rate was 1.0/net.  Both gears sampled black crappie within the normal range for this type of lake.  Fish sampled in gill nets ranged from 5.4 to 10.0 inches and had a mean length of 8.3 inches while trap net captured fish ranged from 4.7 to 8.9 inches and had a mean length of 6.3 inches.  Five year-classes from age 2 to age 6 were sampled.  Age-2 fish were the most prevalent, representing 41% of the sample.  Growth was slower than the statewide average.The bluegill trap-net catch rate was 51.0 fish/net.  The catch in 2004 was the highest on record and exceeded the upper end of the normal range.  The fish ranged from 2.6 to 8.7 inches and averaged 5.3 inches.  Eight year-classes were identified ranging from 3 to 13 years old.  The 1998 year class represented 46% of the sample.  Growth was slow through age 5 but average for older fish.In 2004, largemouth bass were sampled with spring night electrofishing.  Thirty-eight largemouth bass were captured for a catch rate of 28.5 fish/hr.  The fish ranged from 6.2 to 18.8 inches and averaged 12.3 inches.  The population appeared to have fairly consistent but low reproduction.  Eight year-classes were identified with the 1998 year-class representing 37% of the sample.  It appears that conditions were favorable for bluegill and bass production in 1998 since that was the strongest age-class for both species.Northern pike gill-net catch rates have been stable in the last three assessments, ranging from 6.0 to 7.5 fish/net.  However, the first two assessments in 1956 and 1972 documented catch rates of 2.3 and 3.3 fish/gill net.  In 2004, the northern pike gill-net catch rate was 7.5 fish/net.  The catch was above the lake average 5.3 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 14.0 and 34.3 inches and averaged 21.3 inches.  Seven age-classes were sampled from two to eight years old.  Recruitment appears to be consistent and moderate with age-3, age-4 and age-5 fish representing 30, 27, and 18% of the sample.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages.  A population with moderate recruitment, a good prey base of tullibee, and average growth should be able to produce preferred-length fish on a consistent basis.  It appears that northern pike size structure may be on the edge of being negatively affected by angler harvest. Tullibee are important prey for predators like walleye and northern pike.  The presence of a healthy tullibee population is often associated with trophy predators.  In the last four assessments since 1972 tullibee catch rates were above average.  The gill-net catch rates have declined in each assessment from 31.1 fish/net in 1976 to 12.7 in 1982 and finally to 9.5 in 2004.  Interestingly, the distribution of tullibee throughout the lake was essentially limited to two basins (one net captured 53 of the 76 fish sampled).  The fish sampled in 2004 ranged from 6.0 to 13.1 inches and averaged 9.5 inches.Walleye have never been stocked in Jack the Horse Lake and only one had ever been sampled prior to 2004.  Three walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 0.4 fish/net.  The fish ranged from 19.9 to 24.8 inches and averaged 22.2 inches.  The three fish were from the 1996 and 1999 year-classes.  Growth was similar to statewide averages. Yellow perch were sampled at a gill-net catch rate of 0.5 fish/net, which was below normal for this lake type.  Gill-net catch rates have never exceeded 3.0 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.8 to 7.5 inches with a average length of 6.4 inches.  The fish were all four or five years old and growth was slow compared to statewide averages.In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

Natural reproduction of northern pike was apparently successful in 1954 and these fish should enter the catch in sizeable numbers in 1957.Crappies and sunfish are mostly 4 years old and are showing normal growth.  The present size of these fish is satisfactory and average sizes of crappies and sunfish will likely increase during 1957 and 1958.  Some decrease in panfish size may be noted after 1958 as the present strong year-classes decrease in the catch and younger year-classes enter.Dogfish, although numerous are important predators in a lake of this type and aid in maintaining a favorable population balance between predator and prey species.</p>",
