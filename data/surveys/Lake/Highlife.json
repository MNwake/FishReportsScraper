                "narrative": "<p>Fish collected in DNR test nets in the 1999 assessment were: brook trout, yellow perch, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish.     In recent years Highlife Lake has been managed as a \"two story lake\".  This refers to a lake that is managed for both warmwater and coldwater fish species.  In the case of this lake the warmwater species are bluegill and largemouth bass and the coldwater specie is brook trout.     Bluegill were sampled in average numbers compared to other lakes of this type during the 1999 assessment.  The fish averaged 7.2 inches and ranged from 5.0 inches to 9.0 inches.  About 33% of the bluegills were between 7.5 inches and 8.5 inches which are acceptable sizes for most anglers.     Brook trout that were collected had been stocked as yearlings the previous spring and averaged 10.8 inches when captured, with fish up to 12 inches recorded in the sample.  The lake has shown it can grow some quality size brook trout as fish between 15 inches and 16 inches were not uncommon after brook trout were first introduced in 1997.  The lake is scheduled to be stocked every other year with 500 brook trout yearlings, with the next stocking in 2001.     Largemouth bass are present in the lake but the population is difficult to evaluate using nets.  This species is best evaluated using electrofishing equipment however the rough road and poor access doesn't allow for this type of gear to be used.  On the few occasions when largemouth bass have been collected in nets the largest individual sampled was 15.5 inches.</p>",

The average size was about 7 inches with fish over 9 inches present.  Largemouth bass were also present; however, it is difficult to assess their numbers and size structure without utilizing specialized equipment that the difficult access will not allow. <br> \n <br> \nAccess to Highlife Lake is on an unmarked logging road that wraps around the north side of the lake and ends on the northeast shore with a carry-down to the lake.  This access road is rough and brushy with many tight corners, only high-clearance vehicles with well-worn paint should travel this route. <br> \n</p>",

The lake historically supported a population of largemouth bass, bluegill and yellow perch.  However, due to the small size of the bluegill and low interest in largemouth bass, fishing pressure on this lake is low.In 1997 the lake was experimentally stocked with a small number of brook trout.  Test nets in the fall of 1998 indicated the stocking was successful with a fair number of brook trout sampled.  The average size was 13.9 inches, with fish ranging from 12.4 inches to 15.1 inches.  Due to the relatively short life span of brook trout most of these fish probably will have moved through the system by the summer of 1999.  Brook trout are scheduled to be stocked again in 1999 and it is anticipated that by the fall of 2000 similar size trout could be present.  Current plans are to continue stocking brook trout every-other-year.</p>",

Previous surveys have indicated largemouth bass are normally not very abundant and test nets in 1995 suggest this still holds true. Few largemouth bass were sampled however due to their warines of nets their actual abundance may be underestimated. History has shown that the lake can produce some quality fish, however none over 6.0 inches were recorded in the 1995 assessment.     Bluegill are present in below average numbers and are predominately small fish with 92% of the bluegill sampled being less than 6.5 inches. Fish in excess of 8 inches are present but not common.     Yellow perch and pumpkinseed sunfish abundance and size is such that no angling effort is directed at either species.</p>",

The maximum depth of Highlife Lake is 22 feet and 88% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet. The lake is accessible by a 1,500' trail from the Chub Lake Tavern. There are no inlets and one intermittent outlet. Shoal soils are mostly muck; limited areas of sand and boulders are also present. Most of the land surrounding the lake is marsh and low forest land.     At the time of the survey, moderate amounts of aquatic vegetation were found to depths of eight feet. Three trapnets and two gillnets caught three Largemouth Bass and four Yellow Perch. No seining was possible. Spawning facilities were rated \"fair\" for Largemouth Bass and centrarchid panfish and \"poor\" for other gamefish if general.     The lake has occasionally produced good catches of Largemouth Bass. Residents reported planting the lake with Largemouth Bass in 1938, but none were caught until about 1948.      Fish and water samples collected in October, 1961 were tested by the Minnesota Department of Health, Division of Environmental Sanitation. The tests indicated a total water hardness of 8.0 ppm, an alkalinity of 4.0 ppm, sulfate at 8.9 ppm, and calcium as CaCO3 at 1.5 ppm. Largemouth bass flesh contained 320(+or- 5) micromicrocuries of strontium 90 per gram of calcium.      Temperatures and dissolved oxygen were taken during August, 1962. A narrow band of cool well-oxygenated water was found between 12' and 14'.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Highlife Lake is a small remote lake that traditionally supported a population of largemouth bass and bluegill.  In 1997 the lake was stocked with brook trout in order to increase angling opportunities for additional species in the lake.  Largemouth bass and bluegill continue to maintain populations through natural reproduction.  The lake has been stocked with 500 yearling brook trout every odd year.  This is not a designated stream trout lake and it is legal to use live minnows for bait.  The lake is one mile from a paved road on a very rough logging road.  Only high clearance vehicles are recommended on this road.  There is a carry-down access suitable for launching canoes and small boats.  Towing a trailer on the access road is not recommended.Test nets in 2004 sampled average numbers of brook trout, which ranged in length from 12.1 to 14.2 inches.  All the brook trout in the sample were from a 2003 stocking.Bluegill were sampled in average numbers.  One large bluegill (10.6 inches) was sampled and some fish between 6.5 and 7.5 inches were collected; however, most were less than 6.5 inches.Largemouth bass were known to have been present, although none were taken in this assessment.  This species is \"net shy\" and it is difficult to evaluate the population using netting gear.  Largemouth bass populations are best evaluated using electrofishing boats; however, it is not feasible getting that type of equipment into this lake because of poor access.  Reports are occasionally received from anglers who report catching some large largemouth bass.Yellow perch were collected in average numbers with fish up to 10.1 inches sampled; however, most of the fish were too small to interest anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Highlife Lake is a small remote lake located in Lake County near Isabella. A fisheries crew improved an existing user created hiking trail into a new carry-in access in the southwest corner of the lake in 2018. From State Highway 1 turn east on the minimum maintenance logging road about 300 yards north of the East Chub Lake public access. Proceed approximately 100 yards and stay left at the first intersection, then travel a quarter mile to the parking area. The improved carry-in access trail extends to the northeast and traverses approximately 500 feet to the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of the 2018 standard survey was to update the status of the Bluegill and Largemouth Bass populations and provide information that will guide future management decisions. Few adult Bluegill were captured during the assessment in any sampling gear but some young fish were caught. The limited data suggests the Bluegill population has been able to persist at a low density with sporadic natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in good numbers on the other hand. Several thousand young-of-the-year fish were captured in special mini-trap nets used to sample the lake from a canoe. In addition, adult bass in the 12 to 14 inch size range were well represented. Age analysis identified 10 year classes with young-of-the-year through age-9 fish sampled. Growth was generally slow for the area. A mature population with slow growing fish can be susceptible to overexploitation so anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to maintain the current size structure.</p>",
