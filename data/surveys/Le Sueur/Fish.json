                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nFish Lake is a 78 acre lake located in Le Sueur County north of the city of Elysian. A DNR-owned public access is located on southeast corner of the lake off Le Sueur county road 14. Fish Lake is a small, clear lake with a maximum depth of 55 feet. Minimal shoreline development, abundant and diverse aquatic vegetation, and a nearly undisturbed watershed make Fish Lake an outlier among southern Minnesota lakes. Fish Lake is managed primarily for bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike and secondarily managed for black crappie. No stocking plan exists for Fish Lake, so the fish community persists exclusively from natural recruitment. Fish Lake was surveyed the week of June 2, 2014 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying gill nets and trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. To assess the largemouth bass population, daytime boat electrofishing was also conducted.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant fish in 2014 survey, with a total of 179 fish collected in the trap nets (22.4 fish/net). However, this catch rate is below the long-term average for Fish Lake (27.8 fish/net) and is the lowest since 1984. Bluegill lengths ranged from 2.9 to 8.8 inches and averaged 7.1 inches, indicating a moderate size structure for bluegill in Fish Lake. Fifteen percent of the bluegill from trap nets measured 8.0 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \nThe largemouth bass population in Fish Lake was assessed by boat electrofishing along the entire shoreline. All largemouth bass (N = 61) were measured, weighed, and released after scale samples were removed for aging. The catch rate of largemouth bass was 70.8 fish/hour, which is above the lake average of 53.8 fish/hour. However, this is a decrease from the catch rate in 2009 (104.6 fish/hour). Largemouth bass lengths ranged from 2.8 to 19.3 inches and averaged 7.4 inches, indicating a relatively small size structure. Despite the relatively high catch rate, most of the population consists of young individuals, as 87% of the total catch was five years old or less. The average length of largemouth bass in Fish Lake was 5.7 inches at age-2, 7.7 inches at age-3, 10.8 inches at age-4, and 11.3 inches at age-5. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate in Fish Lake has remained moderate to high compared to similar lakes in every survey conducted since 1979, until 2014 when the catch rate was 2.0 fish/gill net. This catch rate is well below the long-term average for Fish Lake (7.0 fish/net). The length of northern pike ranged from 14.6 to 32.0 inches and averaged 24.0 inches, indicating moderate size structure. Like all fish species in Fish Lake, northern pike are completely sustained through natural recruitment. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates from 1989 to 2009 averaged only 0.3 fish/trap net. However, the 2014 survey yielded 1.5 fish/net, which is a significant increase from previous years. Black crappie were also collected in the gill nets at a rate of 4.0 fish/net, which is considerably high compared to similar lakes. Black crappie from both gear types averaged 8.1 inches in length. However, the largest individual measured was over 13.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed <br> \nLike bluegill, pumpkinseed are members of the sunfish family and are enjoyable to catch on light tackle. The 2014 catch rate of pumpkinseed (8.9 fish/trap net) was the highest on record for Fish Lake. Pumpkinseed lengths ranged from 4.8 to 7.2 inches and averaged 6.1 inches, indicating a small size structure. Pumpkinseed can be distinguished from bluegill by the orange spot at the tip of the opercular flap and the lack of a dark blotch near the back of the dorsal fin. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead <br> \nUnlike the black bullhead, yellow bullheads prefer to inhabit clear, less productive water, much like that of Fish Lake. The catch rate of yellow bullheads in the 2014 survey was 10.0 fish/gill net, which is slightly above average compared to similar lakes. Although this catch rate is lower than that of the 2009 survey (16.5 fish/gill net), it is still above the long-term average for Fish Lake (5.9 fish/gill net). Yellow bullheads were also collected in trap nets at a rate of 4.8 fish/net. The length of yellow bullheads from both gear types ranged from 4.9 to 12.7 inches and averaged 10.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nAdditional fish species collected in low abundance during the 2014 survey included black bullhead (N = 10) and bowfin (N = 11). Although they were not observed in this survey, yellow perch are also present in Fish Lake in low abundance. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Fish Lake was conducted on July 12, 2022, by DNR Fisheries staff.  Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 7 sampling stations, but 3 stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 2 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 5 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 3 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 12 species of fish including 5 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and 0 species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Least Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Fish Lake is in good health, and near exceptional health, as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Cannon River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake in Le Sueur County is a 78 acre lake north of the city of Elysian. A DNR-owned public access is located on the southeast end of the lake off Le Sueur county road 14. Fish Lake's small and wooded watershed, natural environment designation with little shoreline development, clear water and abundant plant growth make this lake a gem in south central Minnesota. <br> \n <br> \nFish Lake was surveyed the week of June 1, 2009 to monitor the fish community. Bluegills were the most abundant fish in the survey, averaging 44 fish per trap net lift, a value that exceeds the upper quartile for class 28 lakes. Size structure was also favorable; average bluegill weight was 0.25 pounds per fish, also in excess of the upper quartile for this lake class. Bluegill length ranged from 3.0 to 8.6 inches with an average length of 6.8 inches, an intermediate size between quality and preferred length category stock values. Bluegills do well in Fish Lake's clear water and healthy aquatic vegetation community. Secchi disk readings, a measure of water clarity, were reported at 15 feet. Aquatic vegetation grows to this depth as well. <br> \n <br> \nTwelve black crappie were caught in gill and trap nets. Average crappie size between all gears was just under 9 inches. Anglers report good crappie fishing in the fall, with fish suspended over the 55 foot deep hole in the center of the lake. Because of the exceptional water clarity and steep breaklines around shore, crappies may not be well sampled in Fish Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike averaged 7 fish per gill net lift. Pike size was favorable; the average fish weight was 3 pounds. Pike ranged from 16 to 37 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullheads were the most abundant fish in the gill nets at 17 fish per lift. Yellow bullhead are indicators of good water quality, unlike black bullheads that generally live in disturbed and turbid waters. Yellow bullhead ranged from 8 to 12 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are doing well in Fish Lake's clear water, abundant macrophyte, bass-panfish community. Fish Lake was sampled with an electrofishing boat one week prior to the netting survey. Largemouth bass abundance totaled 105 fish per hour of on time. Average size ran small, with average weight around 0.4 pounds and average length 8.3 inches. Less than five percent of the fish sampled exceeded fifteen inches in length. Other fish sampled in the survey include pumpkinseed, black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Fish Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 78-acre lake located in Le Sueur County north of the city of Elysian. A DNR-owned public access is located on southeast corner of the lake off Le Sueur County Road 14. Fish Lake is a small, clear lake with a maximum depth of 55 feet. Minimal shoreline development, abundant and diverse aquatic vegetation, and a nearly undisturbed watershed make Fish Lake an outlier among southern Minnesota lakes. Fish Lake is managed primarily for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike and secondarily for Black Crappie. No stocking plan exists for Fish Lake, so the fish community persists exclusively from natural recruitment.  <br> \nFish Lake was surveyed the week of June 3, 2019 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This standard survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying gill nets and trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant fish in 2019 survey, with a total of 456 fish collected in trap nets (57.0 fish/net). This catch rate is well above the long-term average for Fish Lake (31.4 fish/net) and is the highest recorded since 1979. Bluegill lengths ranged from 2.9 to 9.0 inches and averaged 7.1 inches, indicating a moderate size for Bluegill in Fish Lake. Seventeen percent of Bluegill from trap nets measured 8.0 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population in Fish Lake was assessed by boat electrofishing along the entire shoreline.  In 2019 electrofishing was conducted at night for the first time. All Largemouth Bass (N = 130) were measured and released after scale samples were taken for aging. Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 4.8 to 19.8 inches and averaged 9.7 inches, indicating a relatively small size structure. Most of the population consists of young individuals, as 89% of the total catch was five years old or less. The average length of Largemouth Bass in Fish Lake was 6.1 inches at age-2, 8.9 inches at age-3, and 10.7 inches at age-4, and 11.9 inches at age-5. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate in Fish Lake has historically been moderate to high compared to similar lakes since 1979. Catch rates fell in 2014 when the catch rate was 2.0 fish/gill net and again in 2019 when the catch rate was only 1.5 fish/gill net. The 2019 catch rate is well below the long-term average for Fish Lake (6.3 fish/net). The length of Northern Pike ranged from 18.0 to 37.2 inches and averaged 26.5 inches, indicating moderate size. Like all fish species in Fish Lake, Northern Pike are completely sustained through natural recruitment.  <br> \n  <br> \nFish Lake is located in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. To legally harvest Northern Pike in the Southern zone, the fish must be over 24 inches in total length. The daily limit is 2 fish in this zone. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates from 1989 to 2014 averaged only 1.1 fish/trap net. However, the 2019 survey yielded 4.1 fish/net, which is a significant increase from previous years. Black Crappie were also collected in gill nets at a rate of 0.5 fish/net, which is high compared to similar lakes. Black Crappie from both gear types averaged 7.9 inches in length. The largest individual measured was 11.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLike Bluegill, Pumpkinseed are members of the sunfish family and are enjoyable to catch on light tackle. The 2019 catch rate of Pumpkinseed (7.0 fish/trap net) was the second highest on record for Fish Lake. Pumpkinseed lengths ranged from 4.3 to 7.5 inches and averaged 5.9 inches, indicating a small size. Pumpkinseed can be distinguished from Bluegill by the orange spot at the tip of the opercular flap and the lack of a dark blotch near the back of the dorsal fin. <br> \n <br> \nUnlike the Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullheads prefer to inhabit clear, less productive water, much like that of Fish Lake. The catch rate of Yellow Bullheads in the 2019 survey was 1.5 fish/gill net, which is slightly below average compared to similar lakes. This catch rate is the lowest on record for Fish lake, and it is well below the long-term average for Fish Lake (5.4 fish/gill net). Yellow Bullheads were also collected in trap nets at a rate of 6.8 fish/net. The length of Yellow Bullheads from both gear types ranged from 9.0 to 13.9 inches and averaged 11.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nAdditional fish species collected in low abundance during the 2019 survey included Brown Bullhead (N = 1), Bowfin (dogfish) (N = 2), and Common Carp (N=1). Although they were not observed in this survey, Yellow Perch are also present in Fish Lake in low abundance. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, natural resource specialist <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

BLUEGILL SHOWS SLOW GROWTH IN THEIR FIRST 2-3 YEARS. THE LUSH SUBMERGED VEGETATION MAY BE PROTE- CTING THE SMALL BLUEGILLS FROM PREDATION. PUMPKIN- SEEDS ARE ALSO DOMINATED BY SMALL FISH AND HAVE INCREASED FROM 2.75/TRAPNET IN '79 TO 6.00/TRAPNET IN '84. FIVE YEAR CLASSES WERE SAMPLED WITH 4 YR OLDS DOMINATING. BLACK CRAPPIES SHOWED UP POORLY IN NETTING. WITH ONY ONE FISH CAPTURED WINTER ANGLING FOR CRAPPIES IN 83-84 WAS GOOD. THE LOW PERCH CATCH REFLECTS THE HIGH PREDATOR POPULATION PRESENT, WHICH WAS THE SAME SITUATION IN '79. YELLOW AND BLACK BULLHEADS HAVE INCREASED SINCE 79, WHILE BOWFIN NUMBERS REMAIN LOW.</p>",

Water clarity is very high with visibility usually around 15 ft.  A fishery survey was conducted on Fish Lake in 2003 to assess the fish community and lake habitat.  Northern pike are common in Fish Lake with most fish between 13 and 30 inches in length.  Bluegill are abundant.  Most are between 5 and 7 inches long, although fish up to around 8 inches are present.  While not reflected in the netting results, largemouth bass are common in Fish Lake and provide excellent angling opportunities.  Other species present included black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, bowfin, black and yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  A boat motor 20 horsepower maximum limit is in effect on Fish Lake.</p>",
