                "narrative": "<p>Upper Panasa Lake is a small, eutrophic lake located one mile south of Calumet, Minnesota in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake has a total surface area of 174 acres and a maximum depth of 13 feet.  Water clarity has been poor, as Secchi disk transparency has ranged from 1.5 to 4.5 ft.  The inlets originate from Mud Lake, a swamp drainage, and from a sewage treatment plant.  The outlet, Upper Panasa Creek, flows into Lower Panasa Lake.  The lake has a limited plant community due to poor water clarity and the shorelines have been disturbed by past mining activity.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan was last revised in 2002.  Northern Pike were the primary management species and Black Crappie and Walleye were secondary management species.  The goals of the lake management plan were to maintain the Northern Pike gill net catch rate at 7.0 fish/net and maintain the Black Crappie trap net catch at 2.1 fish/net or gill-net catch at 2.5 fish/net.   <br> \n <br> \nA population assessment was conducted in August of 2014 to assess the status of the fish community.  This assessment consisted of 3 gill net sets and 9 trap net sets. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the most commonly captured fish and the gill net catch was high compared to similar lakes and was the highest catch reported for the lake.  Perch were generally too small to interest anglers, as length ranged from 5.3 to 10.4 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  Four year classes were present (2-5) and growth was near the statewide average with individuals exceeding 7 inches in five years. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Panasa Lake has a history of high Black Bullhead catches.  Black Bullhead were common in 2014 as the gill net catch was high compared to similar lakes.   Size structure was poor, as Bullhead ranged from 5.0 to 10.3 inches and averaged 7.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were the primary gamefish present and the catch was typical for the lake class and similar to past catches on Upper Panasa.  This catch met the lake management plan goal set in 2002.  Size structure was moderate as Pike ranged from 18.2 to 27.2 inches and averaged 23.6 inches.  Age analysis identified 5 year classes (1-5) and growth was fast as Pike exceeded 24 inches by age 4.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species present include Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  The fish community was representative of a lake with occasional winterkill events.  No fish were estimated to be older than age 5, and no Walleye or Black Crappie were captured, suggesting winterkill in the recent past.  The winter of 2008/2009 included several heavy late winter snowfalls and a later than normal ice out date.  It is likely that a winterkill event took place and the fish community is still in recovery.    <br> \n <br> \nUpper Panasa Lake supports invasive Chinese Mystery snails.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Panasa Lake is 174 acres, has a maximum depth of 13 ft, and is located near Calumet.  The lake is impacted by mining activities and also indirectly receives treated sewage from Calumet and Marble.  Water clarity is poor and secchi depth was only 1.8 ft due to algae blooms.  Upper Panasa was used by the mining industry as a water source for many years and water levels were maintained by an earthen dike on the outlet to Lower Panasa.  Upper Panasa was periodically dredge by the mining companies to maintain adequate depth.  Both Upper and Lower Panasa have been collectively referred to as \"Red Lakes\" because of the red sediments washed into the lake from nearby tailings basins after heavy rainstorms.  Currently, the earthen dike has washed out allowing fish to move freely between Upper and Lower Panasa.  Hill Annex mine annually pumps millions of gallons of groundwater into Upper Panasa.  The addition of groundwater may alleviate the potential of winter kills which have occurred in the past.  Local anglers fish Upper Panasa for walleye, northern pike, and black crappie.Walleye gill net catch was 4.8/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Average weight was 2.7 pounds and length varied from 16 to 26 inches.  Size structure was good with several fish over 20 inches.  Walleye are not stocked in Upper Panasa, but walleye fry are stocked in Lower Panasa and are thought to migrate to Upper Panasa.  The quality walleye population in Upper Panasa is unusual considering it is only 13 ft deep and has poor water quality.Northern pike gill net catch was 10.5/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Mean weight was 2.1 pounds and length varied from 16 to 25 inches.  Size structure was poor with no fish of preferred length (28 inches).  Black crappie trap net catch was 1.1/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Black crappie have not been sampled in recent assessments dating back to 1980.  Size structure was poor and no fish larger than 7 inches were sampled.  Only one bluegill was sampled in trap nets, which is of interest because they had not previously been sampled in Upper Panasa.  Black bullhead are still very abundant, however, their numbers are decreasing.  Black bullhead gill net catch was 166/set which is above the expected range, however the gill net catch was 415.3/set in 1991.  The lake has previously been commercially fished to remove bullhead.Water quality is a primary concern on Upper Panasa Lake.  Sediment from tailing basins and treated sewage effluent are likely the primary causes for low water clarity, algae blooms, and heavy aquatic vegetation growth.  It is unlikely that substantial changes in the fishery can occur before water quality issues are addressed.</p>",
