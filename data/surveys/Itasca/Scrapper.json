                "narrative": "<p>Scrapper is a small, shallow lake located 15 miles north of Bovey, MN in the Mississippi River watershed. Scrapper Lake has moderate water clarity and productivity.  Scrapper is part of a chain of lakes including Haskell and Balsam.  Small boats are able to navigate between the lakes through a shallow channel.  Most of Scrapper's shoreline is undeveloped and in a natural state.  Aquatic vegetation is abundant and provides good fish habitat. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 lake management plan listed Northern Pike as a primary management species due to angler interest and habitat suitability.  The lake is also well suited to Black Crappie, Bluegill and Largemouth Bass and these were considered secondary management species.  A standard lake survey was conducted in July 2016 to update information on the fish population. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Northern Pike gill-net catch was typical for lakes with similar habitat and average for Scrapper Lake.  Size structure was moderate with pike ranging from 15.6 to 36.2 inches and averaging 23.5 inches and 3.3 pounds.  Eight year classes were represented, indicating regular natural reproduction.  Growth was considered average with pike averaging 27.6 inches after six years. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch for Black Crappie was higher than expected for lakes with similar habitats and higher than previous surveys on Scrapper.  Size structure was modest with only one crappie exceeding ten inches.  Black crappie averaged 8.1 inches from trap nets and 8.8 inches from gill nets.  Seven year classes were represented with age 4 and 5 fish making up a majority of the sample.  Growth was slower than the lake class average with crappie averaging 8.1 inches after 5 years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most common fish captured in trap nets in 2016.  The 2016 catch was within the typical range for the lakes with similar habitats, but higher than previous surveys on Scrapper.  As in past samples, size structure in 2016 was modest with few fish exceeding 8 inches, although 34% of the trap net sample exceeded 7 inches.  Reproduction appeared consistent and adult mortality appeared fairly low, as fish up to age 12 were present.  Growth was comparable to the lake class average with Bluegill averaging 6.1 inches after six years of growth.  Sampled fish exceeding 7 inches were generally eight years or older. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Tullibee, Yellow Perch and Black, Brown and Yellow Bullheads. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of nearshore fish species was conducted on July 25, 2016 by IBI Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but 3 stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 4 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 1 station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 5 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including 6 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for Scrapper Lake is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and is indicative of a healthy fish community.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Scrapper Lake is located in the Mississippi River-Grand Rapids Watershed. <br> \n</p>",
