Catch indices for northern pike, pumpkinseed and largemouth bass are between the first and third area quartiles. The trap net index for bluegill is below the first area quartile. North- ern pike ranged from one to eight plus years of age. Age two and age three fish dominated the sample with twenty five percent each; age one, age four and age six each made up thirteen percent of the sample. Growth the first, second and third increments were normal. Growth the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh increments progressed from forty five percent to sixty nine percent slower than normal. Pumpkinseed were all three years old. Growth rates for all three increments were normal. Bluegill were from four to eight years old. Growth for the first increment was eighty percent faster than normal and the second increment was sixty percent faster than normal. The third increment had a normal growth rate. The fourth and fifth increments were thirty three and twenty three percent slower than normal respectively. Largemouth bass were two and three years old. Growth for the first increment was twenty percent faster than normal, the second increments growth was thirty four percent faster than normal and the third increment had normal growth. Yellow perch ranged from three to seven years old with no dominate year class seen in the sample. Growth rates for all increments were within the range that is considered normal for yellow perch in Minnesota.</p>",
