                "narrative": "<p>Ray (Bass) Lake is part of the Gull Lake chain and is located about two miles west of Nisswa.  Access is through a navigable channel from Upper Gull Lake.  It is 136 acres with a maximum depth of 27 feet.  About 82% of the lake is less than 15 feet  deep.  Shoreline substrate is composed primarily of sand and gravel, with silt and mucky soils present in marshy areas.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 32 species present.  Emergent and floating leaf plants such as bulrush, water lilies, and wild rice are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for northern pike, bass, and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.Northern pike were sampled in average numbers in 2001 at a rate of 7.8/gill net.  Previous catches have ranged from 3.5 to 10.3/gill net.  Compared to 1996, average length increased from 19.1\" to 23.3\" and average weight from 1.8 lbs to 3.5 lbs.  Walleye were sampled in below average numbers at 0.2/gill net.  Previous catches have ranged from 0 to 1.0/gill net.The largemouth bass catch of 1.7/trap net was above average and the highest to date.  Past catches have ranged from 0 to 1.3/trap net.Black crappie catches have ranged from 0.8 to 11.5 per trap net.  The 2001 crappie abundance was average at 1.3/trap net.  The gill net catch of 1.2/lift was the highest to date.  About 36% of all crappies measured were 8\" or larger.  Bluegill abundance has ranged from 19.3 to 84.3/trap net.  The 2001 catch was 67.0/trap net.  Ten percent of the fish measured 7\" or larger, compared to 20% in 1996 and 10% in 1991.Yellow perch, white suckers, and tullibee are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Yellow perch abundance was average when compared to similar type lakes, but the highest to date for this lake, at 4.6/gill net.  White suckers were sampled in below average numbers.  Tullibees were first sampled in 1991 at a rate of 1.5/gill net.  None have been sampled since then.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ray is a small 136 acre lake that can be accessed through a channel from Upper Gull Lake.  During the summer, much of the lake is choked with weeds and is inaccessible.  Early season may provide fishing opportunities for bluegill which were caught in average numbers (29.4/net).  Average size was 6.6\" and 36% of the fish were at least 7\" long.  Northern pike were the one other species that show promise for anglers.  Caught at a rate of 5.7/net, the average length was 23.5\" and 35% were 24\" or larger.  Other fish caught in average numbers were bowfin (dogfish), pumpkinseed, largemouth bass, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.  Black bullhead, brown bullhead, black crappie, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, yellow perch, walleye, and white sucker were also captured in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nRay is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels in Gull Lake.  Lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Roy (Bass) Lake is part of the Gull Lake chain and located about two miles west of Nisswa.  Public access is from Upper Gull Lake, via a navigable channel. Size is 136 acres and maximum depth is 27 feet.  About 82% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  It is a hardwater lake with moderate phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is about average for area lakes.  Sand and gravel are common shallow water soils, however, muck and silt predominate in marshy areas.  The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Bulrush, the commonest emergent plant, is important because it helps reduce erosion caused by wave action, helps cycle nutrients and improves the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish.  Wild rice can be important as spawning habitat for northern pike.  Submergent plants are abundant in the lake to a depth of about 17 feet.  These plants are important because they provide vital food and cover to a wide variety of aquatic species.Northern pike was the most abundant gamefish found in the 1996 test netting.  Bluegill was the most common panfish.The northern pike catch was in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes, and was also similar to previous net catches in this lake.  Six year classes were sampled and growth was good.  The strongest year class in the sample was 1994.  Since 1991, average length dropped from 19 to 17 inches, but average weight remained at 1.8 lbs..Largemouth bass are difficult to sample with stationary nets.  The '96 bass catch was in the \"low\" category, as it was in previous nettings.Black crappies were caught in \"average\" numbers, similar to 1984 results.  The '91 catch was in the \"high\" category.  Of the three year classes sampled, a majority of the crappies were aged to 1994 and had slow growth.Bluegills were caught in \"average\" numbers for the third time in the four nettings done to date.  In '91, the catch was in the \"high\" category.  Seven year classes were sampled and growth was slow until the fish reached about age seven.  Fish size has remained fairly constant over the years.  Average size has remained about 5.5 inches and has ranged from 3.0-8.5 inches for fish measured from trapnets in the past three nettings.  In 1991, about 10% of these fish were at least 7.0 inches long, while about 20% were that size in 1996.Yellow perch, white sucker and tullibees are frequently important food sources to gamefish.  Yellow perch were caught in \"low\" numbers in '96, as has been the case in previous nettings.  White suckers were caught in numbers which boardered on \"low.\"  Tullibees were only sampled in the lake in 1991, and may not be \"resident\" members of the lake's fish community because of their need for cold, well oxygenated water.Other species which were sampled in the 1996 netting included brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ray is a small 136 acre lake that can be accessed through a channel from Upper Gull Lake.  During the summer, motorized boat travel in much of the lake is limited due to abundant aquatic vegetation.  The primary management species on Ray is bluegill.  The 2019 catch rate dropped to 11.5/trap net from 29.4 in 2013.  Size seemed to have dropped too, with a mean length of 6.1\" versus 6.6\" in 2013 and 28% of the fish were 7\" or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nThe other fish that showed some promise to anglers was walleye.  The catch per net of 1.7 was average when compared to similar lakes, but the highest to date in Ray.  Average length was 20\" and all of the fish were over 15\".  Walleye are not stocked directly into Ray, but connected Gull Lake receives 2,825,000 fry annually and fingerlings were also stocked in Gull in 2018.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in average numbers (7.3/gill net), but average size in gill nets was only 18.9\" and only one fish sampled in a trap net was over the 22\"-26\" protected slot.  Lakes in this part of the state have a northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish caught included black crappie, northern pike, largemouth bass, common carp, pumpkinseed, white sucker, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, bowfin (dogfish), rock bass, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on June 21, 2019, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 2 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 3 stations.  Heavy vegetation and/or soft bottom prevented the use of seines at the other 5 sampling sites.  Nineteen species were sampled, including 6 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: banded killifish, blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, mimic shiner, pugnose shiner, and rock bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on June 17-19, 2019 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

Five age classes were present, with 54% being from the 1988 year class.  Growth appeared to be good.  Median length was 19 inches.  Bluegills (84.25/trapnet) rose over 300% since 1984 (19.25/ trapnet) and was high.  Average size was again equal to the lower quartile value.  Median length 5.5 inches, as in 1984 as well.  About 10% of measured bluegills were 7.0 inches or longer in 1984.  Two age classes were present and appeared to have slow growth.  Black crappie (11.5/trapnet) increased tenfold since 1984 and was of average abundance for the lake class.  Cisco was sampled for the first time in 1991.  Their abundance (1.5/gillnet) was three times the median value of 0.5/gillnet.  All were in the 14 inch class.  Yellow perch (0.5/gillnet) was not abundant.  Only one perch was caught.  The three species of bullhead were present.  All caught in average numbers for the lake class.  Yellow bullhead (0.46 lb) and brown bullhead (0.65 lb) were of average size for the lake class, while black bullhead (0.68 lb) were large.  White sucker (2.5/gillnet) was also present in average numbers, after not being sampled in 1984.</p>",
