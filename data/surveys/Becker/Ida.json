                "narrative": "<p>Lake Ida is a 580 acre, shallow, heavily-developed prairie lake noted for relatively good angling forpanfish, bass, walleye and northern pike.  Although submergent vegetation growth is heavy and maximum depth isonly 20 feet, the lake has reportedly never winterkilled.     Fish populations in Lake Ida have undergone several changes since the original lake survey in 1965.  Somechanges are undoubtedly due to natural cycles and others are probably due to the influence of stocking, anglingor habitat changes.  Overall, fish populations in the lake appear to be relatively healthy.  There are a fewnotable exceptions.  Possible species of concern include bluegill (overabundant in recent years), black crappie,and largemouth bass (apparently declining in abundance).     Northern pike are present in \"normal\" numbers compared to similar lakes.  As in several other area lakes,there appears to have been a significant increase in pike abundance beginning during the eighties, probably havingmore to do with water levels and spawning success than with stocking.  Northern pike numbers were actuallyconsidered quite low during the sixties and seventies even though they were being heavily stocked at the time. An average pike in Lake Ida in 1993 weighed 2.2 lb. and was about 21\" long, although some much larger fish werepresent.     The bluegill population is unfortunately undergoing a trend similar to that in several Minnesota lakes inrecent years, increasing numbers and decreasing size. The average length of sampled bluegills is currently 5.6\"although fish over 8\" long were captured in test nets.  Quality bluegill remain available, though in lesserproportions than during previous surveys.  Growth rates appear slower than normal, probably due to competitionamong smaller fish for proper sized food.     Contrary to bluegill and northern pike, black crappie numbers seem to be lower than they were twenty orthirty years ago.  Although they are difficult to assess during normal mid-summer test netting, black crappieappear to have decreased during recent years.     Bullhead species and numbers have remained stable since the sixties.  Few black bullheads have been sampled. Yellow and brown bullheads dominate the bullhead catch.  Those species range from \"normal\" to slightlyhigher-than-normal in abundance for class 29 lakes.  Bullheads average nearly 12\" long (just over 10\" for yellows)and weigh about a pound.     Yellow perch are the preferred food source for Lake Ida's gamefish.  They seem to be making a comeback fromhistoric low numbers during the eighties.  This increase is not readily explainable since populations of the twoprimary perch predators in Lake Ida, northern pike and walleye, have not decreased significantly.  Walleyeabundance, in fact, appears to be higher than it was five years ago.  Mean length of sampled perch is 6.3\". Lengths ranged from 5.0\" to 8.1\".  Growth rates appear normal.     Walleyes are more abundant in Ida than in most of the lakes in it's class.  The walleye population,supplemented by fingerling stocking, has remained relatively stable throughout the past thirty years, althoughabundance appears to have been significantly lower during 1988.  Average size remains good at 17.1\" long andweighing 2.0 lb.  Sampled walleyes ranged from 11\" to 25\" long.  Year classes 1988 and 1990 (stocking years) weredominant but fish of all ages through eight years (and several older) were represented in the sample.  Fingerlingstocking was difficult to evaluate in this assessment due to the stocking of yearlings as well as fingerlings inrecent years.  However, past surveys have indicated everything from near-total reliance upon stocking to maintaina walleye population in Lake Ida (1988) to apparently good natural reproduction (1965).  Both conditions wereprobably true at the time they were reported, influenced by factors of weather, water levels and othercircumstances affecting walleye spawning success.  It would seem reasonable to conclude that there is some naturalreproduction of walleye in Lake Ida, albeit sporadic.     Increasing development of the shoreline and pressure upon the fish resource make protection of the existingbulrush stands even more important than in the past.  The importance of emergent vegetation for binding ofnutrients and pollutants, shoreline protection, and fish and wildlife benefits cannot be overstated.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Ida has a diverse and productive fish community that has historically been noted for its panfish, bass, northern pike, and walleye angling.  In 1998, water levels were high and so were populations of northern pike, walleye, and bluegill.  Growth was good for each of these species.  Natural reproduction sustained northern pike and bluegill populations while walleye numbers were supplemented by stocking.Recent high water generally meant there was more pike spawning habitat available.  Net catches of pike reached an all-time high of 14.0 per net.  Many young northern pike were present and sampled pike averaged 1.3 pounds (17.7 inches long) but there were also fish over 30 inches captured.Walleye were abundant and averaged 15.6 inches long and 1.4 pounds.  Several year classes were present and there was a healthy mix of sizes.Average length of bluegills has increased from 5.6 to 7.1 inches since the 1993 assessment.  Most (80%) were older than four years of age.Net catches of black crappie and largemouth bass remained low.  The few surviving crappies were large (11.0 inches average length).While some indicators of water quality show that Lake Ida's is relatively good, there are things riparian owners and other watershed dwellers can do to help sustain quality water, fish populations, and property values.  These things can all help: (1) exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, (2) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizer, (3) leaving wide shoreline buffer zones of unmowed, natural vegetation, (4) leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially emergents like cattails and bulrushes) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water, and (5) acquiring DNR permits for aquatic plant removal and shoreline alterations and asking advice about how to achieve water use goals without sacrificing water quality, fish communities, and eventually, property values.  Guides are available for riparian owner who desire to alter shoreline areas while doing the least harm to the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Ida Lake was conducted on September 6th-7th, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at fourteen sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due soft sediments. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations, and a 15-foot seine was used to sample two stations, and three stations were not seined due to soft sediments. Nearshore sampling captured twenty species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Blackchin Shiner, and Blacknose Shiner) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Ida Lake is healthy, as indicated by an FIBI score that scores above the impairment threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous findings, which indicated that Ida Lake fully supported aquatic life use based on the FIBI.  These survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Bluegills and northern pike have been particularly prolific in Lake Ida.  Test net catches of both species were high in 2003.It is likely that northern pike numbers were aided by high water levels between 1997 and 2002.  High water made available more areas with preferred spawning habitat for pike.  A few large pike (over 30 inches long) were found in test nets, but the average size was considerably smaller at 19.1 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Release of northern pike greater than 24 inches would help control the overabundant pike population and improve the health of the whole fish community.Bluegills averaged 6.9 inches and several over eight inches were sampled.  Growth rates for bluegill are somewhat slower in Ida than in the average Minnesota lake.  Anglers should keep in mind that it takes about nine to ten years to grow an eight inch bluegill in Lake Ida.  Releasing a portion of the larger fish and keeping some of the smaller ones for eating can help to maintain a more balanced population.Walleye catch rates decreased in 2003, but were still near the lake's historical average.  Northern pike predation may be having an impact upon the stocked fingerlings in recent years.  Although walleye numbers may be temporarily down, sizes are relatively large with an average walleye weight of 2.6 pounds for sampled fish.Ecologically, the lake is categorized as borderline mesotrophic/eutrophic which means it is very fertile.  Lakeshore and watershed landowners should be concerned about the lake becoming more fertile and aging prematurely.  Water quality should always be considered when doing shoreline landscaping, mowing, building, installing septic systems, etc.  Several good sources of information are available for shoreline landscaping in ways that do the least damage and have the greatest benefit to the lake's water quality, fish community, and property values.  Two of these are \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and the computer CD \"Restore Your Shore\" which are both available through the Minnesota Bookstore.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ida Lake is a 632-acre, heavily developed lake located in southwestern Becker County, near Detroit Lakes, MN.  The watershed is primarily hardwood forest.  With no natural inlet or outlet, Lake Ida is primarily influenced by groundwater and water levels have fluctuated 4.5 feet since 1987.  There is a piped outlet on the east shore to prevent severe property damage from a 100-year flood event.  Zebra mussels were discovered in Ida Lake in 2015.  A standard fisheries survey was completed on Lake Ida in June 2023 to assess the fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find a high number of Northern Pike in Ida Lake, however, most of these fish will be on the small side.  The average size of the pike sampled in 2023 was 19 inches, but one 30-inch fish was measured.  Walleye numbers are average for the lake and there is good size to the fish.  Almost all of the Walleye captured were over 15 inches and 35% were over 20 inches.  Bluegill numbers have decreased since recent surveys, but anglers can expect to find better size.  About 19% of the Bluegills sampled in 2023 were over eight inches and several Bluegills over nine inches were observed.  Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were captured in low numbers in the nets, which is often the case with this sampling gear.  Black Crappie up to 11 inches were measured and Largemouth Bass up to 17 inches were measured.  Other fish species observed were Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Ida has historically been known as a northern pike, bass, and panfish fishery with occasional good walleye fishing, as well.  Due to the lack of high quality walleye spawning habitat, fingerlings are regularly stocked to supplement the fishery.  Other species reproduce naturally and are not stocked.  Bluegills and northern pike have been particularly prolific in Lake Ida.  Test net catches of both species reached historical high rates in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nIt is likely that northern pike numbers were aided by high water levels since 1997.  High water made available more areas with preferred spawning habitat for pike.  A few large pike (over 30 inches long) were found in test nets, but the average size was considerably smaller at 21.1 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Voluntary release of northern pike greater than 24 inches may help control the overabundant pike population and improve the health of the whole fish community. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills averaged 7.4 inches and several over eight inches were sampled.  Growth rates for bluegill were similar to those in the average Minnesota lake.  Anglers should keep in mind that it takes about six to ten years to grow an eight-inch bluegill in Lake Ida.  Releasing a portion of the larger fish and keeping some of the smaller ones for eating can help to maintain a more balanced population. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were similar to those in 2003 and were slightly less than the lake's historical average.  Northern pike predation is likely having an impact upon the stocked fingerlings in recent years.  Annual stocking has not seemed to affect the walleye catch rate significantly.  Walleyes in Lake Ida are generally decent-sized with an average length of 17.7 inches and average weight of 2.1 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass and black crappie are also present in modest numbers.  A good portion of the crappies sampled were over ten inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nEcologically, the lake is categorized as eutrophic which means it is quite fertile and productive.  Lakeshore and watershed landowners should be concerned about the lake becoming more fertile and aging prematurely.  Water quality should always be considered when doing shoreline landscaping, mowing, building, installing septic systems, etc.  Several good sources of information are available for shoreline landscaping in ways that do the least damage and have the greatest benefit to the lake's water quality, fish community, and property values.  Two of these are \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and the computer CD \"Restore Your Shore\" which are both available through the Minnesota Bookstore. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Ida has historically been known as a Northern Pike, bass, and panfish fishery with occasional good Walleye fishing, as well.  Due to the lack of high quality Walleye spawning habitat, fingerlings are regularly stocked to supplement the fishery.  Other species reproduce naturally and are not stocked.  Bluegills and Northern Pike have been particularly prolific in Lake Ida.  Test net catches of both species were higher than their historical averages in 2013.  Bluegills were particularly abundant, though smaller than the past. <br> \n <br> \nIt is likely that Northern Pike numbers were aided by high water levels since 1997.  High water made available more areas with preferred spawning habitat for pike.  A few large pike (over 30 inches long) were found in test nets, but the average size was considerably smaller at 23.4 inches in length and 2.1 pounds in weight.  Voluntary release of Northern Pike greater than 24 inches may help control the overabundant pike population and improve the health of the whole fish community. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills averaged 6.2 inches and very few over eight inches were sampled.  Growth rates for Bluegill were slower than those in the average Minnesota lake.  Anglers should keep in mind that it takes about eight or nine years to grow an eight-inch Bluegill in Lake Ida.  Releasing a portion of the larger fish and keeping some of the smaller ones for eating can help to maintain a more balanced population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate (7.0 fish per set) also increased and was higher than the lake's historical average of 5.9.  Walleyes in Lake Ida are generally good-sized with an average length of 18.7 inches and average weight of 2.4 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Black Crappie were also present in higher numbers than normal for Lake Ida.  Young and small fish dominated the samples of both species.  Crappies over 10 inches in length were very rare. <br> \n <br> \nEcologically, the lake is categorized as eutrophic which means it is quite fertile and productive.  Lakeshore and watershed landowners should be concerned about the lake becoming more fertile and aging prematurely.  Water quality should always be considered when doing shoreline landscaping, mowing, building, installing septic systems, etc.  Several good sources of information are available for shoreline landscaping in ways that do the least damage and have the greatest benefit to the lake's water quality, fish community, and property values.  Two of these are \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and the computer CD \"Restore Your Shore\" which are both available through the Minnesota Bookstore.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ida is a 632-acre, heavily developed lake located in southwestern Becker County, near Detroit Lakes, MN.  The lake is surrounded by hardwood forest.  The lake has an average water clarity of 8.3 feet and a maximum depth of 20.0 feet.  With no inlet or outlet, Lake Ida is primarily influenced by groundwater and water levels have fluctuated 4.5 feet since 1987.  The only island on the lake is located in the southern portion of the lake and is an Aquatic Management Area (AMA) owned by the Department of Natural Resources.  As an AMA, it is open to public use such as shorefishing and hunting. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed on Lake Ida in late June 2018 to assess the fish community.  This survey was completed using nine gill nets and nine trap nets.  Gamefish species targeted by anglers in this lake include Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes ranged in length from 10.9 to 28.7 inches and averaged 19.0 inches.  Walleye abundance has been consistent in recent years and near historical average for Lake Ida.  Walleye fingerlings are annually stocked, since Walleye spawning habitat is sparse.  A total of 11 year classes were sampled in 2018, with the oldest and largest Walleye being 20 years old. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike abundance has increased consistently since 1993 and was at a historic high in 2008, which was likely due to higher water levels.  Northern Pike abundance has decreased since 2008, but is still above the historical average for this lake.  Northern Pike total lengths ranged from 12.2 to 33.4 inches and averaged 2.8 pounds.  The average length was 22.8 inches and 35% of the Northern Pike measured were over 24 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were abundant in Lake Ida and averaged 6.3 inches in length.  Like previous surveys, Bluegill growth rates remain slow in Lake Ida.  Bluegills over 8.0 inches were sampled, which are typically 8 years or older.  It is recommended anglers keep smaller Bluegills and release the majority of larger Bluegills to maintain a balanced population. <br> \n <br> \nCompared to 2013, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch abundance decreased in 2018.  No Black Crappie over 10.0 inches were caught, but a few Largemouth Bass over 17.0 inches were sampled.  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 5.3 to 11.6 inches and averaged 6.9 inches.  Other species of fish sampled during the survey included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nThe shorelines of Lake Ida are heavily developed and few emergent aquatic plants exist.  Lakeshore and watershed landowners should be concerned about the riparian habitat and the potential effect on water quality.  In order to protect water quality, habitat, and good fishing, lakeshore residents should use phosphorus-free fertilizers, leave aquatic vegetation intact (especially emergent vegetation like bulrush and cattail), and leave natural vegetation buffers on shoreline lots.  Preventative actions will preserve habitat and water quality, while slowing the natural aging process and decreasing the potential for winterkill.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, zebra mussels were discovered in Lake Ida.  Zebra mussels are a destructive Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) that can impact water clarity and reduce the amount of food available to small fish.  AIS, such as zebra mussels, can be transferred from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners.  To avoid the spreading of AIS to other waters, please follow the current AIS regulations.</p>",
