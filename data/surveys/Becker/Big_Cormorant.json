Test net catches of carp, first captured in 1972, have remained relatively stable near similar lake classification medians.  Bullhead and bluegill numbers remain relatively low while rock bass and smallmouth bass populations are somewhat more abundant than in comparable lakes.  Growth rates for all gamefishes appears to be good.  That of walleyes, however, exhibits a peculiar pattern of faster than normal growth for the first two years of life and lower than normal growth past age 5.  Net catches of walleye continue to fluctuate slightly between 20 and 30 fish/gillnet/day, several times the lake class and local medians.  Age groups I-III made up the bulk of the catch but all year classes between 1982 and 1989 (inclusive) were well-represented.  Black crappies and largemouth bass are present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Cormorant is regarded as an excellent natural prairie walleye lake.  At 3,421 acres, it is the second largest lake in Becker County.  Its relatively close proximity to the Fargo-Moorhead area results in heavy angling pressure and shoreline development. <br> \n <br> \nHigh water levels during the late 1990's resulted not only in changes to the shoreline and low-lying homes and cabins, but also in changes to the fish community.  The recently high water levels opened up additional northern pike spawning habitat and the lake's pike population is still responding.  The catch rate of pike reached its historical high in 2008 at 9.5 pike per gill net.  The lake's historic average is 3.5 pike per set.  The high water effects on the pike population is illustrated in the fact that in seven surveys prior to 2002, the average catch rate of northern pike was just 1.8 per set.  Increases in numbers of small pike often result in decreases in yellow perch, the primary forage fish for walleye and northern pike in most lakes.  This is what appears to be occurring in Big Cormorant since yellow perch catches have remained substantially lower than normal since 2002. <br> \n <br> \nFortunately, the walleye population does not appear to have been adversely affected by the abnormally high northern pike numbers.  The 2008 walleye catch rate was higher than the lake's historical average at 30.1 walleyes per experimental gill net.  Sampled walleyes averaged approximately 14 inches in length and 1.2 pounds in weight in 2008.  Cormorant Lake is an excellent natural walleye lake with two strong year classes poised to enter the current fishery.  The 2005 and 2006 year classes both made up significant portions of the walleye sample in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to the periodic, mid-summer test netting, the DNR began annual, fall electrofishing for young-of-the-year walleyes in Big Cormorant in 2000.  These studies indicated that year classes from the years 2000 and 2004 were weak and those from 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2007 were relatively strong.  Age class frequencies from mid-summer test netting in 2008 appear to show similar findings.  This means that fall electrofishing data can probably be used as a reliable indicator of year class strengths in Big Cormorant.  While fish from the 2007 and 2008 year classes were too small to be completely vulnerable to sampling gear in summer, fall electrofishing yielded catch rates of 38 and 32 young walleyes per hour, respectively.  Fall electrofishing catch rates over 30 young-of-the-year walleyes per hour are considered relatively strong and this bodes well for near future walleye angling in Big Cormorant. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass are another target species present in good numbers.  Smallmouth bass and bluegill catches were higher in 2008 than those reported in any of the nine previous surveys since 1954.  Black crappies and largemouth bass can also be found in moderate numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Cormorant Lake is a 3,657-acre lake located five miles southwest of the town of Audubon in Becker County.  The lake possesses suitable spawning habitat for Walleye reproduction and sustains one of the area's major natural Walleye fisheries.  Surveys intended to target Walleye are currently performed annually on Big Cormorant Lake to monitor the fishery and assess Walleye year-class strength.  The 2020 survey was performed in early August utilizing standard gill nets.    <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch rates have declined in Big Cormorant Lake over the last decade.  On average 11 Walleye were caught per gill net in the 2020 survey, markedly lower than the lake's historic average of about 22 Walleye per net.  Walleye sampled in 2020 ranged in length from 9.1 to 25.7 inches, averaging 17.0 inches long.  Walleye belonging to the 2017 and 2011 year-classes were most abundant accounting for about 50% of the total Walleye catch, indicative of highly variable year-class strength. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches of Northern Pike have increased in Big Cormorant Lake since 2002.  The 2020 catch rate of Northern Pike was eight pike per net.  Pike sampled in 2020 measured between 7.9 and 35.6 inches, with a mean length of 21.8 inches. Approximately 10% of sampled pike measured 30 inches or longer in length.   <br> \nEight Yellow Perch were caught per gill net in the 2020 survey, slightly lower than the lake's historic average of 13 perch per net.  Sampled perch averaged 6.3 inches in length, ranging from 3.9 to 8.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 survey did not utilize a sampling gear that targeted panfish species, limiting their discussion in this summary.  Nevertheless, bass and panfish comprise a large portion of the fish community in Big Cormorant Lake.  Additional catch was dominated by Rock Bass and Smallmouth Bass.  Other species sampled included Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Largemouth Bass, Bullhead (Brown and Yellow), Black Crappie, Hybrid Sunfish, and White Sucker. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cormorant Lake may be classified as a walleye lake capable also of supporting a good population of northern pike, smallmouth, largemouth bass and panfish.  There appears to be good evidence that the present large walleye population is the result of the introduction of fry during the early part of the century.  In the early book, \"A Pioneer History of Becker County\" by West and Wilcox, (Pioneer Press Co., 1907) the following reference to Cormorant Lake is presented: \"Walleye Pike, as they are commonly known, although the \"books\" call them \"pickerel\" and pike perch\" are natives of most of the lakes of the county.  Cormorant being a notable exception.  The reason for the absence of pike from the lake has never been explained.\"Big Cormorant is a large hardwater walleye lake with good chemical fertility.  It has a maximum depth of 66 feet and does not stratify thermally.  It has an area of 4704 acres and contains oxygen in adequate amounts for fish life over the entire bottom.  There are good populations of walleyes, northern, large and smallmouth bass and rock bass.  Crappies and bluegills are low and the perch population is contained in proper proportion to the game fish species.  There appears to be no special problem concerning the fish population that will require attention in the next few years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Located 6 miles southwest of Audubon, MN, Big Cormorant Lake is a 3657-acre lake with a maximum depth of 75 feet. A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by IBI Program Staff on Big Cormorant Lake on 17 - 19 August 2015 to assess populations of non-game species and small sport fish. Twenty-four 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, eighteen sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and one was sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented seining at 5 sites. Backpack electrofishing was done on foot along the shoreline at 22 sites and from the boat for 2 sites. Nearshore sampling captured 21 species of fish including many species intolerant of disturbance such as Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass. Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hornyhead Chub, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Spottail Shiner, Weed Shiner, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. Nearshore catches are used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a survey on 28 July - 6 August 2014, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Big Cormorant Lake. The fish IBI score for Big Cormorant Lake was above the impairment threshold; of note were the high number cyprinids species and the high proportion of intolerant individuals sampled in the nearshore. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. Big Cormorant Lake is located in the Otter Tail River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Cormorant is regarded as an excellent natural prairie Walleye lake.  At 3,657 acres, it is the second largest lake in Becker County, with a Walleye population sustained by natural reproduction.  Its relatively close proximity to the Fargo-Moorhead area results in heavy angling pressure and shoreline development.  Zebra mussels were discovered in the lake in 2015.  Unlike standard surveys that are intended to gain a comprehensive overview of resident fish communities, this survey only utilized standard gill nets in early August with the intention of targeting Walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch rates have remained relatively stable in Big Cormorant Lake, with the exception of a slight decline that has been observed since 2014.  Nonetheless, Walleye abundance in 2019 was similar to surveys completed in 2014 and 2017.  Walleye size was also similar to past surveys, with fish having an average size of 16 inches.  Older Walleye made up a considerable portion of the catch, suggesting declines may be tied to poor recruitment in recent years.  Despite reduced catches, Big Cormorant continues to sustain a hearty Walleye population relative to lakes of similar size and habitat characteristics. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches of Northern Pike increased dramatically between 1990 and 2002, speculated to be a result of consecutive years of high water expanding spawning habitat.  However, the 2019 catch rate of Northern Pike was around six pike per net, similar to the lake's historic average.  Pike sampled in 2019 measured between 10.5 and 34 inches, with an average length of 22 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Yellow Perch have remained consistently low since 1998.  Observed reductions in Yellow Perch numbers coincide with the marked increase in Northern Pike catch rates.  Sampled perch averaged about 6 inches in length, and ranged from 5.5 to 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass were found to be in record abundance in 2019, which was likely driven by the large number of small fish caught in the gill nets.  Although some bass up to 18 inches long were measured, 43% of the Smallmouth Bass sampled were less than 6.5 inches long.  Bluegill and Black Crappie were caught in modest numbers, while Rock Bass were abundant.  Other species sampled in 2019 included White Sucker, Bullhead (Black, Brown, and Yellow), Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, and hybrid sunfish.  Common Carp were not sampled in 2019, but have been caught in previous assessments.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Cormorant Lake is regarded as an excellent, natural prairie walleye lake.  Heavy angling pressure and shoreline development also attest to this fact.  At 3,421 acres, it is the second largest lake in Becker County.  Recent high water levels have flooded homes and caused much frustration to riparian owners and those downstream from the lake.  However, those same high water levels have not harmed the fish community.  High water has apparently increased the amount or the quality of spawning habitat for walleye and other fish species.  In fact, populations of several species, including walleyes, were higher than ever recorded since test netting began in 1954.The 1954 report gave evidence that walleyes were not present in the lake before the early 1900s, when they were stocked.  Since then, however, walleye test net catches have remained much higher than normal compared to similar lakes.  Even though walleyes have not been stocked in Big Cormorant since 1985, natural reproduction continues to drive abundance upward.  In 1998, test net catches averaged 49.7 walleyes per lift, over double the historical average for the lake.  Excellent year classes in 1995 and 1996 mean that the average size of sampled walleyes was small, 0.73 pounds and 12.6 inches.  While this bodes well for anglers in the near future, it must be recognized that small walleyes will be most readily caught for the time being.Heavy recent natural reproduction, high proportions of young walleye, and the relatively low proportions of larger or older walleye are indicators of heavy fishing pressure and possibly overfishing.  If larger fish are desired, anglers are encouraged to release a portion of the medium-sized fish they catch, rather than killing and eating every \"keeper\" walleye.  While walleye are most desired as table fare, it must be recognized that a lake with heavy angling pressure will not have many large walleye if every one that reaches preferred size is removed from the lake.While walleyes are the primary angling targets in Big Cormorant, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and smallmouth bass have all increased in abundance with recent high water conditions.  Growth is fast to average for these species and the higher numbers should translate to higher catch rates for anglers within a short time.Big Cormorant is a popular lake within a short commute from Fargo-Moorhead.  Consequently, shoreline development increased dramatically over the past 40 years.  Forgetting or not realizing high and low water levels of the past, many homes and cottages were built in areas that are now flooded, causing not only frustration and financial loss but also increased pollution of the lake via flooded septic systems, eroded lawns, etc.  While the water level is currently high, and nutrients may be temporarily diluted from that condition, it will eventually drop again.  With lower water levels, the lake is essentially land-locked and whatever nutrients are present remain in the system.  This can lead to heavy blue-green algal blooms, like those observed by Fisheries crews in early August 1994.The upshot of this is that individuals can help preserve not only the excellent fish community, but also water quality and property values by using best management practices throughout the watershed and particularly along the shoreline.  Shoreline buffer zones of natural vegetation, building on high ground with knowledge of past water levels, not fertilizing or using phosphorus-free fertilizers on lawns, leaving stands of bulrushes and other fish habitat intact, and releasing a portion of \"keeper\" fish caught; each can help to sustain the quality of Big Cormorant Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Cormorant is regarded as an excellent natural prairie Walleye lake.  At 3,657 acres, it is the second largest lake in Becker County.  Besides Walleye, the lake also provides anglers with the opportunity to catch Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Smallmouth Bass.  The lake's proximity to the Fargo-Moorhead area results in heavy angling pressure and shoreline development.   <br> \n <br> \nBig Cormorant continues to sustain a hearty Walleye population relative to lakes of similar size and habitat characteristics.  In 2023, the Walleye gill net catch rate remained similar to past surveys at almost 17 fish per net.  Walleye size did drop, however, with fish averaging 15 inches long and ranging between seven and 27 inches.  The smaller size likely was the result of most of the Walleye being three years of age and younger.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 catch rate of Northern Pike was around eight pike per net, which is higher than the lake's historic average.  Pike sampled in 2023 measured between nine and 36 inches, with an average length of 24 inches.  Forty-three percent of the pike captured in gill nets were 24 inches long or longer. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Yellow Perch were 15 fish per net, which was the highest they've been since 1998.  Sampled perch averaged about six inches in length and ranged from just under six inches, to nine inches.  Smallmouth Bass numbers were the lowest seen since 2019.  Bass averaged 13 inches with the largest being nearly 19 inches long.  Bluegill and Black Crappie were caught in modest numbers, while Rock Bass were abundant.  Other species sampled in 2023 included White Sucker, Bullhead (Black, Brown, and Yellow), Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, and hybrid sunfish.  Two juvenile Common Carp were also captured during the 2023 survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Cormorant Lake is a 3,657-acre lake located five miles southwest of the town of Audubon in Becker County. The lake possesses suitable spawning habitat for Walleye reproduction and sustains one of the area's major natural Walleye fisheries. Surveys intended to target Walleye are currently performed annually on Big Cormorant Lake to monitor the fishery and assess Walleye abundance. The 2021 survey was performed in early August utilizing standard gill nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance appeared to increase in 2021, with gill nets catching 17 Walleye per net. Walleye sampled in 2021 ranged in length from 9.3 to 23.5 inches, averaging 17.1 inches long. The 2011, 2015, 2017, and 2020 year classes accounted for 57.3% of the Walleye sampled. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance increased dramatically from 1990 to 2008, but have since begun to decline to more normal levels for Big Cormorant Lake. Gill nets captured five pike per net in 2021. Pike measured between 17.7 and 37.2 inches, and averaged 24.6 inches long. Approximately 13.3% of sampled pike measured were 30 inches or greater.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass continued their increase in abundance in Big Cormorant Lake, reaching a record-high catch rate of 11 bass per gill net. Smallmouth Bass measured between five and 19 inches, with an average length of 9.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Yellow Perch, Rock Bass, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Largemouth Bass, Bullhead (Brown, Black, and Yellow), Black Crappie, hybrid sunfish, and White Sucker.  Additional and future studies will continue to be conducted within Big Cormorant Lake to evaluate and monitor the fish populations in the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Cormorant is regarded as an excellent, natural, prairie, walleye lake.  At 3,421 acres, it is the second largest lake in Becker County.  Its relatively close proximity to the Fargo-Moorhead area results in heavy angling pressure and shoreline development.High water levels during the late 1990's resulted not only in changes to the shoreline and low-lying homes and cabins, but also in changes to the fish community.  Three strong year classes of walleye were produced in the late 1990's.  Two of these year classes were responsible for driving test net catches to extremely high levels in 1998 when the catch was 49.7 walleyes per set.  Those fish have now grown and strong 1996 and 1997 year classes still dominate the catch.  Now, however, walleyes in Big Cormorant average 16.0 inches in length rather than the 12.6 inches they averaged in 1998.Fishing pressure and northern pike predation have taken a toll on the walleye population during the past four years.  Test net catches that historically averaged 24.2 walleyes per set dropped to 13.8 walleyes per set in 2002.  This is still a good catch rate compared to most walleye lakes.The recently high water levels opened up additional northern pike spawning habitat and the lake's pike population responded.  Catch rates of pike were higher in 2002 than during any previous survey since 1954.  Increases in pike numbers in a lake often result in decreases in yellow perch, the primary forage fish for walleye and northern pike in most lakes.  Big Cormorant was no exception.  The average perch catch dropped to its historic low in 2002.Besides the increase in average walleye size, there were other positive factors indicated by recent test net and electrofishing studies.  First, fall electrofishing for young-of-the-year walleyes during 2000, 2001, and 2002 showed that the latter two year classes were relatively strong.  Those two year classes should recruit to the fishery in two to three years.  Next, the 1999 year class of northern pike should continue to grow and provide good fishing for that species for a few more years.  Lastly, smallmouth bass catches continued to increase in 2002 and angling reports were good for those who were seeking smallmouths.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2017 survey of Big Cormorant Lake was performed in early August.  Unlike standard surveys intended to sample a wide variety of game and nongame fish, this survey only included gill nets with the intention of targeting Walleye.  This rotation of standard survey followed by an abbreviated survey every three years has been performed since 2002.  This sampling regime maximizes the amount of important data and DNR resources.  <br> \n <br> \nThe recent high water levels and an increase in available spawning habitat are believed to be responsible for the historically high test net catches of Northern Pike since 2002.  The 2017 catch rate remained high at 8.67 Northern Pike per net.  The lake's historical mean is 4.6 Northern Pike per net.  The mean weight of sampled pike was 2.9 pounds and the mean length was 23.2 inches.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 14.7 to 36.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Yellow Perch once again dropped from the previous survey.  The catch rate in 2017 of 3.75 fish per net was just above the lowest ever recorded.  Big Cormorant's historical mean catch rate is 13.3 Yellow Perch per gill net.  Catch rates for Yellow Perch have been below the historical average in every survey since 1998.  The mean length of Yellow Perch in 2017 was 6.6 inches and lengths ranged from 5.6 to 8.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches were similar to 2014 and remained below the lake's historical average (23.5 per net) at 15.4 Walleyes per set in 2017.  The mean length of Walleyes sampled in gill nets in 2017 was 16.7 inches and lengths ranged from 7.9 to 25.7 inches.  Similar to the 2014 survey, the 2005 and 2011 year-classes were important contributors to the 2017 survey.  In fact, the 2005 year-class, now 12 years old, was the fourth most represented year-class out of the fifteen year-classes sampled in 2017.  The 2009 year-class has also been previously identified as strong, with evidence of this again in 2017.  The 2015 year class was also found to be abundant in the 2017 survey.  In light of these persistent strong year-classes, it would seem reasonable to assume it is these periodic large year-classes that create, and perhaps most importantly, maintain high catch rates of Walleye in Big Cormorant Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBass and sunfish species continue to occupy a portion of the fish community in Big Cormorant Lake.  Rock Bass were once again the most prevalent member of the sunfishes at 24.8 fish per net, but the Bluegill catch rate was similar at 23.6 fish per net.  The mean length of sampled Bluegills was 6.0 inches and lengths ranged from 3.5 to 9.0 inches.  Both Smallmouth and Largemouth Bass were sampled by gill nets in Big Cormorant.  Smallmouth Bass catch rates were slightly higher in 2017 than 2014, and ranged from 5.3 to 18.4 inches in length with a mean of 13.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp (initially found in Big Cormorant in 1972), White Sucker, Black, Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Green Sunfish and Hybrid Sunfish were also part of the fish community sampled in 2017.  Their populations appeared to largely unchanged from past assessments.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Cormorant Lake is regarded as an exceptional prairie walleye lake.  At 3,421 acres, it is the second largest lake in Becker County.  Shoal waters are generally firm (gravel, rubble, and sand with some boulder) and wave-washed with little vegetative cover.  In other words, walleye spawning conditions are excellent.Test netting results reflect the physical characteristics of the lake.  Walleye abundance is high, over 20 per net set, and relatively stable since 1972.  Walleye have not been stocked in Big Cormorant since 1985, and none of the 170 fish aged in 1994 were from the 1985 year class.  Of the six fisheries surveys completed since 1954, walleye numbers were actually lowest on the 1954 survey, at a time when annual walleye stocking was occurring.  An interesting historical sidenote is that the 1954 survey gives evidence that walleye were not present in the lake before the early 1900s.The present walleye population is heavily composed of three and four-year-old fish weighing an average of 1.2 pounds each.  Even with much higher-than-normal abundance, walleye exhibit average growth in Big Cormorant Lake.  An excellent forage base in the form of yellow perch and shiners and little competition from northern pike undoubtedly account for that growth.The same physical factors that make Big Cormorant such an excellent walleye lake tend to make it less favorable for northern pike and bluegill.  Populations of both of those species have historically remained lower than normal in abundance for similar lakes.  The other lakes in the Cormorant chain tend to be much more conducive to pike/panfish reproduction, but, flooded meadow grasses (northern pike spawning habitat) and heavily-vegetated firm bottom shoals (panfish spawning habitat) are lacking in Big Cormorant Lake.  In most western Minnesota lakes, increased growth rates are expected for fish species with low abundance.  Bluegill growth rates in the lake, however, are relatively slow.  A shortage of preferred forage is likely due more to ecological lake type than to competitive over-grazing by fish.Both smallmouth and largemouth bass are present in Big Cormorant Lake.  Though test nets are not an extremely reliable indicator for either species due to their invulnerability to mid-summer test netting, present populations appear to be at or somewhat above normal abundance.  Interestingly, smallmouth bass numbers have remained stable since walleye stocking was discontinued in 1985.  During the three surveys previous to that, trapnet catches of smallmouth bass were very high one year and very low (one fish caught) another.  Trapnet catches of largemouth bass have remained erratic throughout the testnetting history of the lake.  Like bluegill, largemouth bass growth rates are slow in Big Cormorant.  Depressed growth rates may be a factor of low numbers of a primary food fish-bluegill.Except for 1972, when carp were first captured in test nets, carp abundance appears to have remained relatively stable around the normal abundance range.  Carp have seemingly reached some sort of balance or equilibrium with their environment.  As previously indicated, spawning habitat for carp is very restricted in Big Cormorant.  However, extensive marsh areas in Nelson, Upper Cormorant, and other \"chain\" lakes are often accessible to carp during spawning migrations.Large-scale, expensive efforts at carp control and eradication have been attempted by DNR, private groups, and commercial fishermen for over fifty years, with little success and many failures.  Since introduction in the early part of the century, carp have not only maintained, but have greatly expanded their range in Minnesota.  There are documented cases of carp removal doing more harm than good in some lakes.  Generally, biologists prefer the presence of fewer, larger carp in a lake to many smaller carp.  Large-scale carp removal efforts have often resulted in greatly increased natural reproduction, i.e. the presence of many small carp.  Consequently, carp control efforts have evolved from inneffective and expensive attempts by DNR to eradicate carp (under-ice seining, extensive rough fish traps, etc.) to commercial utilization of harvestable populations.  Sportfishing for carp has occasionally been promoted with modest success.Private stakeholders including lake associations and sportsmen's clubs continue to maintain barriers to block carp spawning migrations and, less frequently, to operate traps for rough fish removal in some areas of the state.  These measures are usually popular with the general public, but, must be evaluated on an individual basis since barriers may block gamefish/panfish spawning migrations as well as those of carp.  The Cormorant Lakes Sportsmen's Club operates various numbers of roughfish traps on the Cormorant chain annually, depending upon water conditions.  Carp control efforts, if continued, may be most efficient if directed at the largest potential spawning migrations.A larger  threat to sustaining fish populations is the dramatically increased shoreline development on Big Cormorant.  Between 1954 and 1990, the number of homes and cabins increased over 700 percent and the number of boats at survey time increased nearly 1,000 percent.  Expanded shoreline development can mean higher risk of cultural eutrophication; loss of fish habitat due to vegetation removal or sedimentation of spawning reefs; and overharvest due to heavy fishing pressure.  It is a testament to nature's ability to sustain itself that Big Cormorant's fish community makeup is essentially the same as it was in 1954, except for the presence of carp, increases in walleye and yellow perch numbers, and decrease in rock bass abundance.  It behooves all watershed landowners, especially riparian owners, to guard against nutrient runoff and infiltration through faulty septic systems and fertilization of lawns and fields.  In water chemistry tests, total phosphorus doubled from 1954 to 1990.  Additionally, a \"heavy\" blue-green algal bloom was observed by the netting crew during early August 1994.  Those two conditions are merely symptoms of an underlying cause, increased shoreline development.Remaining bulrush stands need protection in order to help sustain fish populations, to help prevent shoreline erosion, and to help remove nutrients and pollutants from the lake.  It is interesting to note that bulrushes, while never abundant, were most common along the northwest and south shores of Big Cormorant Lake in 1954.  Presently, there are few, if any, remaining along the northwest shore.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Cormorant is regarded as an excellent natural prairie walleye lake.  At 3,657 acres, it is the second largest lake in Becker County.  Its relatively close proximity to the Fargo-Moorhead area results in heavy angling pressure and shoreline development. <br> \n <br> \nHigh water levels during the late 1990's resulted not only in changes to the shoreline and low-lying homes and cabins, but also in changes to the fish community.  The recently high water levels opened up additional northern pike spawning habitat and the lake's pike population is still responding.  Catch rates of pike prior to 2002 averaged 1.8 per set while those since have averaged 7.5 per set.  The 2011 catch rate of northern pike was 7.2 pike per set and the lake's historic average is 3.9 pike per set. <br> \n <br> \nThe strong 2005 year class of walleyes is now recruited to the fishery and providing good opportunities along with several other less abundant age groups.  Another very strong year class (the 2011) should provide good fishing in the future.  The 2011 gill net catch rate of 24.2 walleyes per set was nearly identical to the lake's historical mean of 24.9.  This is a very high catch rate compared to most walleye lakes.  Sampled walleyes averaged 15.2 inches in length and 1.4 pounds in weight in 2011.  Cormorant Lake is an excellent natural walleye lake with several strong year classes poised to move through the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass are another target species present in good numbers.  While bluegills are not particularly abundant, catches have continued to slowly increase and the average size is very respectable with an average length over seven inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Cormorant is regarded as an excellent natural prairie Walleye lake.  At 3,657 acres, it is the second largest lake in Becker County.  Its relatively close proximity to the Fargo-Moorhead area results in heavy angling pressure and shoreline development. <br> \n <br> \nHigh water levels during the late 1990's resulted not only in changes to the shoreline and low-lying homes and cabins, but also in changes to the fish community.  The recently high water levels opened up additional Northern Pike spawning habitat and the lake's pike population is still responding.  The catch rate of pike has been well above normal for this lake since 2002 with a combined average over five surveys of 7.8 pike per net.  The high water effects on the pike population is illustrated in the fact that in seven surveys prior to 2002, the average catch rate of Northern Pike was just 1.8 per set.  Increases in numbers of small pike often result in decreases in Yellow Perch, the primary forage fish for Walleye and Northern Pike in most lakes.  This is what appears to be occurring in Big Cormorant since Yellow Perch catches have remained lower than normal since 2002. <br> \n <br> \nFortunately, the Walleye population does not appear to have been adversely affected by the abnormally high Northern Pike numbers.  The 2014 Walleye catch rate was lower than the lake's historical average, but still well above the normal range for similar lakes.  Sampled Walleyes averaged 15.4 inches in length and 1.5 pounds in weight in 2014.  In addition to the periodic, mid-summer test netting, the DNR began annual, fall electrofishing for young-of-the-year Walleyes in Big Cormorant in 2000.  These studies have been good predictors of year class strengths for the future fishery.  Cormorant Lake is an excellent natural Walleye lake with a strong 2011 year class poised to enter the current fishery.  The 2005 and 2009 year classes also continue to make up significant portions of the Walleye sample in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass are another target species present in good numbers.  Smallmouth Bass and Bluegill catches were higher than the lake's historical averages in 2014 and sizes are good for both species.  Smallmouth Bass over 19 inches and Bluegills over nine inches were sampled during test netting and spring electrofishing.  Black Crappies and Largemouth Bass can also be found in moderate numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Cormorant Lake is a 3,657-acre lake located five miles southwest of the town of Audubon in Becker County.  The lake possesses suitable spawning habitat for Walleye reproduction and sustains one of the area's major natural Walleye fisheries.  Surveys intended to target Walleye are currently performed annually on Big Cormorant Lake to monitor the fishery and assess Walleye abundance.  The 2022 survey was performed in late August utilizing standard gill nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was below average in 2022, with gill nets catching 10 Walleye per net.  Walleye ranged in length from six to 24 inches, averaging 17 inches long.  Northern Pike abundance was above average in 2022 and slightly higher than what was observed in 2021.  Pike size was respectable, with fish averaging 25 inches long.  Over 53% of the pike measured were 24 inches or longer.  Smallmouth Bass abundance was similar to past surveys with fish ranging from six to 18 inches long.  Rock Bass abundance was above average with fish ranging in size from four to 11 inches.  Bluegill observed in gill nets had an average length of almost 7 inches, but fish over nine inches were also measured.  Yellow Perch abundance was below average in 2022, with the largest individuals measuring nine inches.  Other species sampled included Pumpkinseed, Largemouth Bass, Bullhead (Brown, Black, and Yellow), Black Crappie, and White Sucker.  Additional and future studies will continue to be conducted within Big Cormorant Lake to evaluate and monitor the fish populations in the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Big Cormorant Lake was conducted on June 26-29, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at twenty-four sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample twenty stations and a 15-foot seine was used at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured twenty-five species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish and Common Carp). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Big Cormorant Lake is adversely impacted by stressors, as indicated by an FIBI score near the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Big Cormorant Lake is vulnerable to impairment for aquatic life use. The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
