                "narrative": "<p>Stowe Lake is a 366-acre basin located northwest of Brandon in Douglas County. The lake has a large watershed with two major inlets.  Hoplin Creek enters the lake on the east side and delivers water from Big and Little Chippewa and Devils Lake.  Wolf Creek enters the lake on the north side and flows from Stockhausen, Stockhaven and Upper and Lower Hunt Lakes. This large, predominantly agricultural watershed has contributed large amounts of sediment and nutrients to Stowe Lake.  Strong winds and wave actions can result in re-suspension of fine silts and attached nutrients, stimulating frequent algal blooms.  Water clarity and recreational uses can be seasonally impaired. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry or fingerlings have been stocked on a biennial frequency to supplement natural recruitment and sustain greater abundance.  Catches during the 2009 survey averaged 6.1 walleye/net.  Gillnets catches were within the normal range for the lake type, and slightly higher than management objectives.  Growth is above average and thus fishing quality in terms of size caught, is relatively good.  Walleye captures averaged 17.4 inches and 2.4 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nMost black crappie were captured in gillnets. Catches averaged 4.0 fish/gillnet which depicts a moderately abundant population. Total length at capture ranged from 6.0 to 13.0 inches. Average size caught was 9.0 inches and weighed 0.5 lbs.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are only moderately abundant due to difficult habitat conditions.  Electrofishing averaged 30.0 fish/hour.   Mean length and weight were 13.4 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Twenty per cent of captured largemouth bass exceeded 15.0 inches in total length.   <br> \n <br> \nIn response to limited aquatic vegetation coverage providing feeding sites and escape cover, bluegills are not abundant.  Low abundance typically translates to fast growth.  Due to fast growth fishing quality, expressed in terms of average size, is very good.   Sixty-eight per cent of captured bluegill exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Mean weight of captured bluegill was 0.4 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are moderately abundant.  Survey catches averaged 6.3 fish/gillnet.   Much of the population is comprised of young fish.  Sixty per cent of the fish came from the 2003 and 2005 year classes.  Average size of pike caught in gillnets was 20.8 inches and 2.2 pounds.   The largest pike measured was over 34.0 inches in length.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on August 15, 2019 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Nearshore sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 stations. A 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations and a 15-foot seine was used at two stations. The nearshore sampling captured 17 native fish species including two species (Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) intolerant of habitat disturbance and four species (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Fathead Minnow) that are tolerant of disturbance.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey and trap net survey is combined with data from a standard gill netting survey to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Stowe Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Chippewa River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stowe Lake is a 366-acre basin located northwest of Brandon in Douglas County. The lake has a large watershed with two major inlets. Hoplin Creek enters the lake on the east side and delivers water from Big and Little Chippewa and Devils Lake. Wolf Creek enters the lake on the north side and flows from Stockhausen, Stockhaven and Upper and Lower Hunt Lakes. This large, predominantly agricultural watershed has contributed large amounts of sediment and nutrients to Stowe Lake.  Strong winds and wave actions can result in re-suspension of fine silts and attached nutrients, stimulating frequent algal blooms.  Water clarity and recreational uses can be seasonally impaired. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry or fingerlings have been stocked on a biennial frequency to supplement limited natural recruitment and sustain greater abundance.  Catch statistics from the 2007 survey did not show a strong correlation between year of stocking and elevated catches of walleye produced in stocked years.  Gillnets catches were just with the lower range of normal for the lake type, but lower than management objectives.  Growth is above average and thus fishing quality in terms of size caught, is relatively good.  Walleye captured in gillnets averaged 15.8 inches and 1.7 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catches were greater during the 2007 survey than preceding surveys.  The increased catch rate was largely attributable to an abundance of three-year-olds produced in 2004.  Cohorts of this age group averaged 8.3 inches at time of capture.  Assuming normal growth, these fish should approach 10.0 inches in length during the summer of 2008. <br> \n <br> \nSurvey statistics shifts and population expansions within the fish community that could be expected with improving water clarity and greater vegetation coverage.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and yellow perch catches have increased during the last three surveys.  Natural recruitment of each population proved good to exceptional from 2000 to 2005.  Causative environmental factors may include milder winters, little or much reduced spring runoff, and likely, more stable water level.  Expansion of aquatic plant coverage would further enhance water quality by binding silts and tying up phosphorus that would otherwise stimulate algal blooms. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing catches in 2003 and 2007 characterized a moderately abundant population of fast growing largemouth bass.  Mean length and weight were 13.4 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Over 40% of captured exceeded 15.0 inches in total length.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance has steadily increased since 1993 assessment.  Average trapnet catch approached the upper catch rate considered normal for similar lakes.  Nearly 72% of bluegill caught were four-year-olds and too small to stimulate much harvest.  Mean length was 6.7 inches.   If growth rate can be sustained at an average rate, these fish should grow to near 7.5 inches in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches in 2007 exceeded the median catch rate for similar lakes.  Most captures were relatively young.  The oldest pike aged was eight years old.  Average size of pike caught in gillnets was 23.3 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Shallowness of the lake and lack of a cool water refuge during summer months can be project to diminish growth potential of pike.  The largest pike measured was 32.0 inches in length.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small northern pike and largemouth bass.  Expansion of these predator populations may partially explain poor success of supplemental walleye stockings. <br> \n <br> \nHabitat tolerant species, specifically black bullhead, white sucker, and common carp continue to make up an inordinate portion of the lake's carrying capacity.  These underutilized fish comprised over 85% of the total weight of fish captured in gillnets.  It appears that greater predator densities and competition with gamefishes has resulted in a decline in black bullhead abundance.  Hopefully, habitat improvements and result fish community improvements can be sustained.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stowe Lake is a 376-acre shallow basin located two miles northwest of Brandon in Douglas County. The basin has a maximum depth of 14.0 feet and averages 10.0 feet.  Water quality is seasonally poor in response to algae blooms stimulated by excessive phosphorous loading.  Strong winds and wave actions can also re-suspend fine silts and recycle nutrients.  Water transparency measurements averaged 5.6 feet during summers of 2008 and 2009.  Average total phosphorus measurements approached the water quality impairment standard of 60 ug/L.  Excessive nutrient loads stem from Stowe Lake's very large, well-drained watershed.  Hoplin Creek enters the lake on the east side and delivers water from Big and Little Chippewa and Devils Lake.  Runoff from Stockhausen, Stockhaven, and Upper and Lower Hunt Lakes is carried by Wolf Creek which outlets to Stowe Lake from the north.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry or fingerlings have been stocked on a biennial frequency to supplement limited natural recruitment and sustain greater abundance.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 7.7 fish/net which is well within the range of expected catches for similar lakes.  The population has a broad size distribution.  Gillnet captures ranged from 7.1 to 29.6 inches.  Average length of the catch was 14.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches were higher than expected, averaging 13.7 fish/gillnet. This catch rate is the highest recorded among all preceding surveys.  The pike catch averaged 20.9 inches and had an average weight of 2.2 lbs.  The lake also supported some large pike.  Three fish exceeded 36.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies are more tolerant of seasonally poor water clarity and limited aquatic plants than other sunfishes.   The crappie population proved to be abundant.  Size distribution of the population sample was also very good.  Over 60% percent of crappies caught were over 10.0 inches in length. Average size was 8.9 inches and 0.5 lbs.  Bluegill sunfish catches were modest in comparison to other clear water lakes, but the trapnet catch rate of 10.2-bluegills/net is good for Stowe Lake.  Average size of bluegills measured was 6.5 inches and 0.25 lbs.  The largest bluegill caught measured 9.9 inches.  While not abundant, the largemouth bass population offers quality fishing opportunity.  Average size of electrofishing captures was 11.8 inches. Nearly 30% of bass measured exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  The largest bass capture measured 18.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catches were greater than anticipated given relatively high predator densities.  Harvestable-size perch were rare.  Average length was 6.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA significant change in fish community structure was evident.  Black bullheads dominated gillnet catches through the 2007 survey.  None were caught in 2013.  Environmental factors limiting bullhead recruitment and survival are uncertain. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stowe Lake has a history of dense algal blooms, elevated levels  of suspended solids, and overall poorwater quality.  Recent anecdotal reports and information collected in the 1993 lake survey suggeststhat water quality and aquatic habitat have improved in recent years.  Secchi disk measurement was 11.0feet at the end of June and coverage of emergent and submergent vegetation have expanded.  The factorscontributing to the improvement in water quality are unknown.  There has been no regular monitoring ofwater clarity or water levels.  Water clarity may be highly variable and subject to existing climaticconditions.  A contour map of the lake completed in 1952 shows a maximum depth of 14 feet, howeverlakeshore residents have reported depths of up to 25 feet.  The absence of documented winterkill eventswould support the observations of depths greater than 14 feet by local residents.Walleye gillnet catches averaged 1.1 fish/net in 1993.  Gillnet catches averaged 0.5, 2.8, and 7.8fish/net in 1987, 1982, and 1977, respectively.  The normal range of mean catch rates for lakes withsimilar chemical and physical characteristics is 2.7 - 9.9 fish/gillnet.  The average weight of fishcaptured was 1.3 pounds.  Past surveys have noted little correlation between walleye stocking and yearclass strength.   The age class distribution of walleye captured indicates little difference in yearclass strength between years of fingerling stocking, fry stocking, and no stocking.  Northern pikecatch rate decreased from 7.8 fish/net in 1987 to 1.3 fish/net in 1993.  The normal range of mean catchrates from this lake type is 2.0 - 9.2 fish/net.  The average weight of fish captured was 3.0 pounds. Fish ranged from 20 - 30 inches in total length.  The recent decline in northern pike catch rate islikely the result of poor reproductive success during drought conditions in the late 1980's and 1990. Many other area lakes have experienced a similar decline in northern pike abundance.  Electrofishingyielded 18.0 fish per hour in 1993.  The size structure of the largemouth bass is indicative of aquality fishery.  Approximately 45% of the fish captured exceeded 15 inches in length.  The averageweight of fish captured was 1.9 pounds.  Bluegill abundance is limited.  Trapnet catches averaged 0.4fish/net in 1993.  Catches have ranged from 0.0 - 2.9 fish/net in surveys dating back to 1977.  Naturalreproduction appears to be limited.  Few offspring were collected in shoreline seine hauls in 1992 and1993.  Black crappie catches averaged 0.1 fish/trapnet in 1993.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 0.7 - 3.7 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1977.  Black crappie may have produced a strong yearclass in 1993.  Shoreline seining averaged 80 age-0 fish per haul ion 1993.  The yellow perchpopulation has expanded in since 1987.  Gillnet catches averaged 35.8 fish/net in 1993.  Catchesaveraged 7.8, 11.5, and 13.3 fish/net in 1977, 1982, and 1987, respectively.  The average weight offish captured was 0.2 pounds.  The decline in northern pike abundance may be a factor in the recentincrease in yellow perch abundance.  There is also little competition with bluegill and blackbullheads.  The black bullhead population has crashed.  Gillnet catches averaged 0.3 fish/net in 1993. Catches ranged from 100.3 - 230.5 fish/net in  surveys dating back to 1977.  Natural factors are likelyresponsible for the decline in abundance.  Commercial fishing removed only 40 pounds of black bullheadbetween 1987 and 1993.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stowe Lake is a 366 acre eutrophic lake located northwest of Brandon in Douglas County.  The lake has a history of dense algal blooms, elevated levels of suspended solids, and overall poor water quality.  The large, predominately agricultural watershed likely contributes a significant amount of nutrients and sediment.  A contour map completed in 1952 shows a maximum depth of 14 feet, however lakeshore residents have reported depths of up to 25 feet.  The survey crew tried to confirm these depths, but were unable to locate depths greater than 15 feet.Stowe Lake supports a diverse and moderately abundant aquatic plant community.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush and cattail) is present along the western shore and forms dense beds in the southwest corner of the lake.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 8 feet and is scattered around the lake.  The abundance of aquatic vegetation may have increased over the past ten years. This is a positive sign for the health of the lake and fish community.  Aquatic plants provide critical habitat for many species of fish and compete with green algae for available nutrients.Anglers tend to target Stowe Lake in the early portion of the open water season due to the dense algal blooms that occur during summer months.  Ice fishing is also popular on Stowe Lake.  Most anglers are seeking walleye and black crappie.  Walleye gill net catches averaged 4.0 fish/net in 1998.  Most of the fish captured were less than 12 inches in length.  Age-2 fish comprised 60% of the fish captured.  This year class corresponds to a fry stocking in 1996.  Fry are stocked in even numbered years to maintain the walleye fishery.  Some limited natural reproduction is also known to occur.  Largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie numbers are limited.  However, low densities result in fast growth and large average size.  These species can provide some quality angling opportunities if anglers are searching for larger fish.   </p>",

The growth rate of the Walleye sampled was very good with the age 2 walleye being 13.5 inches long. Black Bullhead continue to be the dominant species in Stowes Lake. Mean size has increased slightly from the 1982 survey. The larger bullhead (10.0+ inches) should be commercially acceptable. Northern Pike gill net indices have steadily increased through the surveys. The mean size was small (1.82 lbs/Northern Pike) but one-quarter of the Northern Pike were over 22.0 inches and they have a proportional quality index (PQD) of 92. Growth rates for bluegill are very fast with age 4 bluegill averaging 6.87 inches. Largemouth Bass also have excellent growth in Stowe Lake. Mean lengths of age 5 bass was 15.8 long. Largemouth Bass may have limited natural reproduction. Freshwater Drum were present in the 1955 and 1977 surveys but have been absent in the 1982 and 1987 survey. White Sucker gill net indices continue to increase.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stowe Lake is a 376-acre shallow, productive basin located two miles northwest of Brandon in Douglas County.  Mean and maximum depths are 10 and 14 feet, respectively.  This basin receives inflows from Hoplin and Wolf creeks and outflows to the west branch of the Chippewa River. Water quality and clarity have improved in recent years, but can be seasonally poor in response to algae blooms stimulated by excessive nutrient levels that come from a large, predominantly agricultural watershed.  Residential development surrounding the lake is minimal.  A public access with limited parking is located on the west shoreline.\n\nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in summer 2019 to assess the fish community of Stowe Lake.  Survey results indicated that habitat conditions and the corresponding fish community have changed substantially over the past few decades.  In the late 1990s, this basin was turbid and submerged aquatic plants were sparse.  These harsh habitat conditions were not conducive to gamefish survival.  The fish community was dominated by Black Bullheads and other underutilized species.  Habitat conditions (i.e., clearer water and more diverse submerged aquatic plants) have greatly improved in recent years, which has led to expansion of gamefish populations and a drastic reduction in Black Bullhead abundance.  Further changes in habitat conditions and the fish community are probable with an infestation of zebra mussels in 2017.  For more information regarding zebra mussels and other aquatic invasive species in Minnesota see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html\n\nIn 2019, record-high numbers of Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Walleye were captured in gill nets.  Spring electrofishing efforts also produced record-high numbers of Largemouth Bass.  Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were also collected in gill nets but relative abundance of these species has declined in recent years.  Growth rates of most fishes in Stowe Lake are rapid due to the high fertility of this basin.  Consequently, gamefish populations are often skewed towards larger fish.  The one exception in 2019 was the Walleye population.  Most Walleyes sampled were young fish from a strong 2017 year class.  Mean size (13.6 inches and 1.0 pounds) was on the smaller side but angler reports indicate this fishery was extremely popular during the first few weeks of the 2019 season.  Walleye size structure will improve in the near future as fish from the 2017 year class grow older.  Other fish species sampled during the 2019 survey include Bigmouth Buffalo, Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, and White Sucker.  The next standard MN DNR lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2025.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stowe Lake is a 366-acre basin located northwest of Brandon in Douglas County.  It is the last basin forming the headwaters of the West Branch of the Chippewa River.  This large, predominately agricultural watershed has contributed excessive amounts of nutrients and sediments to Stowe Lake over the years.  The lake has a history of dense algal blooms, high levels of suspended sediment, and overall poor water quality.  These adverse environmental conditions have limited the fish community in Stowe Lake.  However, aquatic habitat seems to have improved over the past ten years.  Aquatic vegetation has become more widespread and dense.  These plants provide critical habitat for many fish species, especially sunfish.  The aquatic plants also compete with nuisance algae for the available nutrients in the lake.Largemouth bass numbers have increased in recent years.  They are now relatively abundant and the average size of the fish should provide quality angling opportunities.  Forty percent of the fish captured were 15 inches in length or greater.   Bluegill abundance has also increased and may provide some additional fishing opportunities.  Bluegill are experiencing rapid growth rates which results in a desirable size structure.  The average length of fish captured was 7.5 inches.     Walleye numbers were limited in 2003.  Gill net catches averaged 1.8 fish/net.  Gill net catches averaged 4.0 fish/net in 1998 and 1.1 fish/net in 1993.  Walleye fry were stocked in even numbered years between 1994 and 2000.  In response to low catch rates, the stocking strategy was changed to fingerlings in even numbered years starting in 2002.  Walleye fingerlings were also purchased and stocked under private stocking permits in 2001 and 2003.  Black bullhead still dominate the fish community, both in terms of numbers and biomass.  However, these fish are of no value to the recreational fishery and have no commercial value because they are mostly small fish.   </p>",
