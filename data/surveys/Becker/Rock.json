                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake is locally noted for good panfish angling and fair walleye, bass, and northern pike fishing between winter kill events.  Even though minimal kills have occurred fairly frequently, severe winter kills have occurred only about once in every 15 to 20 years in Rock Lake.  Severe kills usually result in the loss of most or all gamefish and panfish with only bullheads and possibly a few northern pike and yellow perch surviving.  This is what happened in Rock Lake in 1996.In spring of 1996, following this winter kill, the DNR restocked the lake with broodstock bluegills, black crappies, and largemouth bass.  Walleye fry were also stocked.  Northern pike and yellow perch survived in strong enough numbers to naturally restock the lake.Four years later, in summer of 2000, the lake appears to be rebounding well from the winter kill.  There are at least two significant year classes of crappies, bluegills, northern pike, and walleyes present and a promising number of young-of-the-year bass, as well.The younger age groups are not yet big enough to be acceptable to anglers but seem to be fairly abundant.  The older year classes of bluegills and crappies have grown rapidly and are not abundant but are \"nice-sized.\"  In fact, most fish grow rapidly after a winter kill due to the lack of competition for available food.  Walleyes averaged 15.1 inches in length and about a pound and a quarter in weight.  Northern pike averaged 16.6 inches but none were larger than 20 inches and their mean weight was less than a pound.  Most pike were either one, two, or three years old.Rock Lake is lightly developed and much of the shoreline remains in a natural state.  Aquatic vegetation, including large bulrush stands, remains relatively undisturbed and provides excellent fish and wildlife habitat.  In the fall, Rock Lake attracts ducks and duck hunters for these same reasons.  The Buffalo River runs through it adding another interesting characteristic to the lake.  If future development occurs on Rock Lake, efforts should be taken to minimize disturbance to these natural features and the aesthetic quality of the lake.</p>",

Even though light to moderate kills have occurred fairly frequently, severe winterkills have occurred about every 15 years in Rock Lake.  The last severe winterkill occurred in 1996.  Severe kills usually result in the loss of most or all gamefish and panfish with only bullheads and possibly a few Northern Pike and Yellow Perch surviving.  This is what happened in Rock Lake in 1996.  In spring of 1996, following this winterkill, the DNR restocked the lake with broodstock Bluegills, Black Crappies, and Largemouth Bass.  Walleye fry were also stocked.  Northern Pike and Yellow Perch survived in strong enough numbers to naturally repopulate the lake.  Since this time light to moderate kills have happened in 2001, 2011, and 2014. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike test net catch rates remained near their historic highs.  High Northern Pike numbers may be suppressing recent Walleye recruitment to the fishery.  Although there are high numbers of small Northern Pike, there are also some large specimens in the population.  Northern Pike averaged almost 18 inches long, but one fish was nearly 36 inches in length.  The younger age groups may be more acceptable to anglers in the next 2 to 3 years. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill also had a historic high test net catch, with an average length of 6.7 inches.  Bluegill were found to take 7 years to reach 8 inches long.  A modest population of Black Crappie exist, with an average size of around 8 inches.  It was found that 10-inch-long Black Crappie were about 7 to 8 years old.  Largemouth Bass that were sampled ranged in lengths from 8 to 14 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThough the Walleye population is slightly lower than it has been in recent surveys, the average size of Walleyes is the highest it has ever been.  The average size Walleye caught in Rock Lake is 19.3 inches in length and weighs 2.4 pounds. The largest Walleye caught in 2016 was 26.5 inches long and weighed 6 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nRock Lake is lightly developed and much of the shoreline remains in a natural state.  Aquatic vegetation, including large bulrush stands, remains relatively undisturbed and provides excellent fish and wildlife habitat.  In the fall, Rock Lake attracts ducks and duck hunters for these same reasons.  The Buffalo River runs through it adding another interesting characteristic to the lake.  If future development occurs on Rock Lake, efforts should be taken to minimize disturbance to these natural features and aesthetics of the lake to conserve habitat and protect water quality.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake is locally noted for good panfish angling and fair walleye, bass, and northern pike fishing between winterkill events.  Even though light to moderate kills have occurred fairly frequently, severe winterkills have occurred about every 15 years in Rock Lake.  The last severe winterkill occurred in 1996.  Severe kills usually result in the loss of most or all gamefish and panfish with only bullheads and possibly a few northern pike and yellow perch surviving.  This is what happened in Rock Lake in 1996.  In spring of 1996, following this winterkill, the DNR restocked the lake with broodstock bluegills, black crappies, and largemouth bass.  Walleye fry were also stocked.  Northern pike and yellow perch survived in strong enough numbers to naturally repopulate the lake. <br> \n <br> \nFourteen years later, in summer of 2010, test nets showed the lake has recovered well from the winterkill.  Northern pike and bluegill test net catch rates remained near their historic highs and there continue to be modest populations of walleye, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  High northern pike numbers may be suppressing recent walleye recruitment to the fishery.  Age and growth information indicated several successful year classes of bluegills and stocked walleyes and a strong population of young northern pike.  The younger age groups may not yet be big enough to be acceptable to anglers but average or better growth rates should bring them into the fishery soon.  The older year classes of bluegills have grown rapidly and are not abundant but are \"nice-sized.\"  Most fish grow relatively rapidly after a winterkill due to the lack of competition for available food.  Walleyes in 2010 averaged 17.3 inches in length and 2.2 pounds in weight.  Northern pike averaged 20.3 inches in length and lengths of sampled pike ranged from 10.4 to 32.9 inches.  Trap net sampled bluegills averaged 6.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRock Lake is lightly developed and much of the shoreline remains in a natural state.  Aquatic vegetation, including large bulrush stands, remains relatively undisturbed and provides excellent fish and wildlife habitat.  In the fall, Rock Lake attracts ducks and duck hunters for these same reasons.  The Buffalo River runs through it adding another interesting characteristic to the lake.  If future development occurs on Rock Lake, efforts should be taken to minimize disturbance to these natural features and aesthetics of the lake to conserve habitat and protect water quality.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake is a 1,048-acre lake located about eight miles northeast of Detroit Lakes in central Becker County.  It is locally noted for good panfish angling and fair Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike fishing between winterkill events.  Unfortunately, a severe winterkill occurred in the winter of 2022-2023, so please use caution with these results as the fish populations have changed since this survey was completed in July 2022. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in Rock Lake have continued a slow decline since initial surveys.  The 2022 gill net catch matched a historic low set in 2016 of 2.0 per net.  This is below the lake's historic average of 6.5 per net.  However, large fish dominate the population with the average Walleye sampled being 22.4 inches.  Lengths of sampled fish ranged from 19.1 inches to 27.6 inches.  Walleyes 20 inches or larger made up 88% of the fish sampled.   <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has been increasing since the early 2000's.  The gill net catch rate of 16.6 per net was a record for the lake and much higher than the lake's average of 5.7 per gill net.  The average length of sampled Northern Pike was 19.3 inches, but fish up to 33.0 inches were sampled.  Abundant spawning habitat will likely keep the Northern Pike population above the historical average. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch for Bluegills averaged 34.1 per set in 2022, which is slightly below the historical average for the lake.  Bluegills averaged almost seven inches and were abundant over six inches.  The 2015 year-class remains strong and is averaging 7.0 inches.  Black Crappies were sampled in moderate numbers with an average length of 8.6 inches, but fish up to 12.0 inches were sampled.  Largemouth Bass were sampled in low numbers and lengths ranged from 9.6 to 16.5 inches.  It is important to note that nets do not sample bass well and electrofishing is the preferred method for assessing bass populations, but electrofishing was not part of this survey.  The Yellow Perch gill net catch rate remains below the historical average.  Yellow Perch average length was 6.5 inches and only one fish over ten inches was sampled.  Other sampled species included Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake is a 1,048-acre lake located about eight miles northeast of Detroit Lakes in central Becker County.  The lake periodically experiences winterkill of varying degrees.  Very light winterkills, where a few dead fish are observed at the outlet in the spring, are relatively common.  Property owners reported dead fish in the spring of 2023.  A targeted fisheries survey was conducted in May 2023 to observe the severity of the winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nDead fish of all species were observed while surveying.  Trap nets captured Northern Pike, White Sucker, Tadpole Madtom, Yellow Perch, and three species of bullhead, all species which are more tolerant to low oxygen conditions.  Bullheads were abundant.  Northern Pike were caught in good numbers with an average length of 20 inches.  Unfortunately, Rock Lake appears to have experienced a significant winterkill for Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass during the 2022-2023 winter.  This would be the first major winterkill since the winter of 1995-1996.  As a result, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie were reintroduced during 2023.  Angling opportunities for Northern Pike are still available, but it will take a few years to have quality fishing for other species.</p>",

Walleyes have declined from a level above the local median in 1985 to what is currently just under the local median.  In contrast to the decline in northern pike and walleyes is a doubling of yellow perch.  Yellow perch are now at a level above the local median.  The trapnet catch of bluegills has increased slightly to a level that is currently just under the local median.  A substantial yellow bullhead population is present.  Frequency and severity of winterkill events is a major factor influencing the population dynamics of Rock Lake.  Walleye fry stocking under these circumstances has succeeded in maintaining a walleye population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rock Lake is a fairly large (1,048 acres) shallow lake (18 ft. max. depth) that periodically experiences winterkill of varying degree.  Very light winterkills, where a few dead fish are observed at the outlet in the spring, are relatively common.  However, severe winterkills have been rare.  The last major winterkill in Rock Lake reportedly occurred in 1977.  Rock Lake is locally known for producing \"good sized\" bluegills and black crappies.  Light winterkills may actually benefit panfish populations by preventing overabundance.  Northern pike and walleye fishing is also reported to be good at times.  Walleye fry have been stocked regularly since the 1940's as walleye spawning habitat is minimal and winterkill is suspected of occasionally reducing the population.  Rock Lake is only lightly developed and much of the shoreline remains in a natural state.  Aquatic vegetation, including large bulrush stands, remain undisturbed and provide excellent fish and wildlife habitat.  In the fall, Rock Lake attracts ducks and duck hunters for these same reasons.  The Buffalo River runs through Rock Lake adding another interesting characteristic.   If future development occurs on Rock Lake, efforts should be taken to minimize disturbance to these natural features and the aesthic quality of the lake.ADDENDUM:  Subsequent to the 1995 population assessment, in the winter of 1995/1996, Rock Lake suffered a major winterkill that saw dead fish of all species lining the shore at ice-out.  Consequently, this report does not reflect the current fish community in Rock Lake.  Spring trapnetting in 1996 identified only bullheads, white suckers, a few northern pike, and a few yellow perch as having survived.  In addition to walleye fry stocking, stocking with adult bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass is planned for 1996.  The adult fish will serve as broodstock to rebuild these populations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of near shore fish species was conducted by Detroit Lakes Area Fisheries Staff on Rock Lake (03029300) on June 23, 2016.  Rock Lake is 1,048 acres, located six miles northeast of Detroit Lakes, MN.  During this survey, 14 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with either a 50-foot or a 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this survey, three sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine, and eight were sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Site conditions prevented the use of seines at three sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at 14 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured eleven species of fish including three species intolerant of disturbance and/or poor water quality.  Intolerant species sampled were Badned Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Central Mudminnow, Golden Shiner, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Tadpole Madtom, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from a July, 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Rock Lake is located in the Buffalo River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",
