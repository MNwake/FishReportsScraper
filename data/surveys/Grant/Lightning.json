                "narrative": "<p>Lightning Lake is a 500-acre basin located on the upper reach of the Mustinka River in northwest Grant County.  Turbidity is often high and dense algae blooms are common during summer months.  Water quality and gamefish habitat is poor.  Maximum depth of this shallow basin is just 11.0 feet, which makes it prone to occasional winterkill.  The last winterkill event occurred during the winter of 2007-2008.  Consequently,  fish community diversity and fishing opportunities are limited.  Similar to many shallow lakes in western Minnesota, the walleye fishery is often \"boom or bust\" depending on presence of strong year classes and frequency and severity of winterkill events.  Walleye fry are stocked on an alternate year basis and strong year classes usually correspond to a successful fry stocking.  Most of the total annual fishing pressure occurs early in the season, prior to onset of algae blooms.    <br> \n <br> \n2008 survey results revealed the impact of the 2007-2008 winterkill event.  With exception of northern pike, other gamefish catches were limited.  Pike abundance was considered moderate.  Larger pike were present but most were small- to medium-sized individuals.  Mean size was 21.3 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Other game fish collected were black crappie, walleye, and yellow perch.  Catch rates of these species were extremely low.  Non-game fishes tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels comprised the most of the total capture sample.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2012.  <br> \n</p>",

White Suckers and an abundant Black Bullhead population were also present.  Walleye fry were stocked in spring 2023.</p>",

Survey components included late-winter water quality measurement and early-spring trap netting.  Late-winter dissolved oxygen readings were low, which indicated gamefish losses due to winterkill were likely.  Trap netting results and abundance of dead fish along the shoreline suggested that winterkill was severe and restorative stockings were warranted.  The only fishes captured were two Walleyes and four Black Bullheads.  Restorative stockings of Black Crappie and Walleye were completed during spring 2019.  Yellow Perch were stocked in fall 2019.  In absence of future winterkill events, fishable populations for these species likely won't become established until 2021 or later.</p>",

Water quality and aquatic habitat conditions favor morepelagic species such as walleye and yellow perch, and limit the abundance of centrarchid species.Walleye catches averaged 7.3 fish/gillnet in 1995.  Gillnet catches averaged 1.0 fish/net in 1984 and8.5 fish/net in 1979.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar physical andchemical characteristics is 2.3 - 18.1 fish/gillnet.  Approximately 45% of the walleye captured ingillnets were 15 inches in total length or greater and 20% exceeded 20 inches.  Mean weight of fishcaptured was 1.7 pounds.  Yellow perch catches averaged 31.8 fish/gillnet which exceeds the normalrange of mean catch rates from similar lakes (2.7 - 25.0 fish/gillnet).   Gillnet catches averaged 12.6fish/net in 1984 and 59.0 fish/net in 1979.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.  Blackcrappie trapnet catches averaged 2.1 fish/net.  Ninety-five percent of the fish captured were age-1. This may indicate the development of a relatively strong year class in 1994.  The abundance of otherfish is limited.  Northern pike catches averaged 1.0 fish/gillnet and bluegill catches averaged 1.1fish/trapnet.  Non-game species captured included black bullhead, yellow bullhead, and common carp. </p>",

Gill netting results indicated that extent of winterkill in 2021-2022 was minimal.  Gamefish species present included Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.  Northern Pike (15.3/gill net) and Walleye (25.3/gill net) were particularly abundant and both populations exhibited a broad size distribution.  Restorative stockings of Black Crappie, Walleye, and Yellow Perch following the 2018-2019 winterkill event were successful.  Multiple year classes and harvestable-size fish are now present for these three species. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lightning Lake is a shallow, 541-acre basin located within the upper Mustinka River in northwest Grant County.  Maximum depth is 11.0 feet.  Average depth is estimated at 7.0 feet.  Lightning Lake is highly productive system and can offer periods of very good fishing, but fishing experiences can be degraded by persistent algae blooms during summer months.  Fishing success and size structure of gamefishes is also strongly impacted by periodic winterkill events.   <br> \n <br> \nThe last winterkill occurred early in 2014.  Walleye fry and adult Yellow Perch were stocked following documentation of the winterkill to quickly re-establish a predator community and restore lost fishing opportunities.  A standard lake survey was completed in 2018 to assess the fish community of Lightning Lake. The netting survey was conducted June 11-14. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry stockings in 2014 and 2016 were very successful.  Age distribution of Walleye captures revealed modest numbers of older Walleyes that may have survived the winterkill or migrated into the lake along with good catches of one-year-old Walleyes that likely stemmed from natural reproduction.  Walleye catches averaged 30.0 fish/gill net and averaged 13.8 inches. Lengths at time of capture ranged from 7.8 to 25.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch stocking was also successful in re-establishing a self-sustaining population.  Gill net catches averaged 31.2 fish/net.  Perch grew fast following winterkill and some were approaching a harvestable size.  Average length of perch caught was 8.7 inches.  The largest measured 10.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLightning Lake supports a low density of Northern Pike. Those few pike captured were relatively large fish that may have migrated into the lake during seasonal spawning runs.  Average length was 23.5 inches.  The largest pike measured 33.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNo Black Crappies were captured during the 2018 survey.  Bluegill, Pumpkinseed and Largemouth Bass were not stocked following winterkill, but these gamefishes were represented in the survey catch.  Catch rates were low.  While not abundant, some of the Bluegill captures were large.  The largest Bluegill caught measured 9.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTypical of winterkill lakes and lakes with poor water quality, tolerant fishes such as Black Bullheads and Common Carp comprised a significant portion of total fish catches in 2018.  While moderately abundant, Black Bullhead catches were much lower than in prior surveys.  Carp catches increased.  Re-establishment of gamefish populations and predators may help keep bullhead population density in check. <br> \n <br> \nAt time of the 2018 survey, Lightning Lake was supporting elevated numbers of harvestable size Walleye and Yellow Perch.  Based on severity to the winter of 2018-19, it is probable that some uncertain level of fish losses have occurred in response to low dissolved oxygen levels and winterkill.  If winterkill is severe, Walleye, Yellow Perch, and Black Crappie populations will be restored.  Anglers are encouraged to contact the DNR Fisheries Office in Glenwood in advance of the May 11 fishing opener if considering a fishing trip to Lightning Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLightning Lake is not currently a designated infested water. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can negatively affect lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain water from their boat before leaving the access. For more information regarding aquatic invasive species see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html <br> \n <br> \nThere is a city owned concrete access on the west side of the lake off County Road 11. <br> \n</p>",

Maximum depth is only 11 feet, making the lake prone to occasional winterkill.  The lastwinterkill occurred during the winter of 1989-90.  Water quality and aquatic habitat are poor.  Densealgae blooms are common during summer months.Fishing opportunities are somewhat limited on Lightning Lake.  Walleye angling can be characterized asa boom or bust fishery, depending on the presence of strong year classes.  These strong year classesusually correspond to a successful fry stocking.  Most of the angling occurs early in the season, priorto the development of algae blooms.  Winter fishing pressure and success also fluctuates with thepresence of occasional large year classes.  The recent increase in northern pike abundance may provide some additional angling opportunities in thenear future.  Fish were abundant in 1999 and averaged about 22 inches in length.  Black crappie fishingmay also improve.  There was some indication that a large year class developed in 1997. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lightning Lake is a shallow, turbid lake on the upper reach of the Mustinka River in northwest Grant County.  Maximum depth is only 11 feet, making the lake prone to occasional winterkill.  The last winterkill occurred during the winter of 1989-90.  Water quality and aquatic habitat are poor.  Dense algae blooms are common during summer months.The fish community and fishing opportunities are limited on Lightning Lake.  Walleye angling can be characterized as a boom or bust fishery, depending on the presence of strong year classes.  These strong year classes usually correspond to a successful fry stocking.  Most of the angling occurs early in the season, prior to the development of algae blooms.  Winter fishing pressure and success also fluctuates with the presence of occasional large year classes.  Northern pike and walleye were present in low to moderate numbers in 2003.  Gill net catches averaged 5.0 walleye and 5.8 northern pike per net.  Walleye ranged from 13 to 29 inches in length and average weight was 3.0 pounds.  Northern pike ranged from 17 to 32 inches in length and averaged 2.7 pounds.   </p>",
