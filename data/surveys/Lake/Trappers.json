The 21.5/lift was nearly 2 times the historical average, with Age I fish representing 87% of the catch. Average Brook Trout lengths in 1990 were 8.5\", which was the smallest average size recorded in all the past assessments. Brook Trout have exhibited a steady decline in size during the last 5 years. White Sucker numbers are at an all time low. Much of this decline can be attributed to a White Sucker removal project carried out in 1987 - 1988.</p>",

One gill net was set to collect a larger sample of brook trout for analysis and the resulting catch was similar to previous gill net catches.  The average length of the total catch was 10 inches and ranged from 6.7 to 13.2 inches.  The growth rate was about average for brook trout when compared to other area brook trout lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe brook trout stocking schedule was changed in 2003 to every-odd-year from the previous annual stocking.  This change was made in an attempt to improve growth while maintaining adequate brook trout numbers in Trappers Lake.  Four years of assessment netting (beginning in 2005) were scheduled to document changes in the population size structure and to look for brook trout natural reproduction.  Based on the age analysis of the 2007 catch, natural reproduction is supplementing the brook trout population. <br> \n <br> \nA large number of small white suckers were sampled in 2007, which was normal for Trappers Lake.  Common shiner and creek chubs were also sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

This change was made in an attempt to improve growth while maintaining near normal brook trout numbers.  Four years of assessment netting (beginning in 2005) were scheduled to document changes in the population size structure and look for brook trout natural reproduction in years with stocking blanks. <br> \n <br> \nA large number of small white suckers were sampled, normal for Trappers Lake.

Fishing hours for stream trout on inland waters are from one hour before sunrise to 11 p.m.  All stream trout must have head, tail, fins and skin intact when being transported.     Fish collected in DNR test nets in 1999 were brook trout and white sucker.  Brook trout were sampled in average numbers compared to other lakes of this type.  The fish averaged 9.6 inches, and ranged from 5.6 inches to 14.3 inches (1.1 pounds).     Trappers Lake is stocking by airplane each fall with 1500 brook trout fingerlings.  It is a spring fed lake with very clear water, indicated by a secchi disk reading of greater than 13 feet (bottom). </p>",

The lake is located 2.5 miles northeast of Isabella, MN and is accessible by a 0.25 mile carry off the Sawbill Landing Road.  Brook trout are stocked every odd year by airplane.Brook trout, white sucker and minnows were collected in the 2005 assessment on this lake.  Brook trout were sampled in average numbers compared to similar stream trout lakes in the area, but the catch was somewhat lower than historic catches in this lake.  Mean length was 8.1 inches with brook trout up to 12.6 inches sampled.  This is typical of the size of brook trout caught in past assessments on this lake.  At least 80% of the brook trout collected in this lake in 2005 (all of the age-1 fish) had been produced naturally .Possessing live minnows or using them for bait on designated trout lakes is prohibited.  Only one line is permitted any time.  All stream trout must have head, tail fins and skin intact when being transported.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Trappers Lake is located two miles northeast of Isabella in the Superior National Forest. Public access is a 0.25 mile trail from the parking area along the Trappers Lake Road (USFS Road 369) to the southwest end of the lake. The lake is surrounded by United States Forest Service land and the shoreline is comprised mainly of pines and cedar. The lake has an area of 19 acres with a maximum depth of 13 feet; on June 29, 2015 you could see to the bottom in light green stained water. The lake has moderately hard water of low fertility. Boulder and rubble are the most common bottom substrates followed by muck, decaying organic matter, gravel and a very limited amount of sand.  Vegetation was found growing to a depth of 11 feet with twenty species/groups of aquatic vegetation identified. Arrowhead Creek enters and exits the lake, is a designated trout stream and supports naturally reproducing populations of Brook Trout.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 survey was completed to assess the status of natural reproduction in the lake after the discontinuation of Brook Trout stocking after 2007.  Brook Trout were stocked from 1963 until 2007.  <br> \n <br> \nBrook Trout trap net catch in 2015 was slightly below average compared to other similar lakes in the Finland Area.  However, the catch was very similar of previous catch rates in Trappers Lake.  The average weight was a quarter pound and the largest fish sampled was 11.3 inches long.  Growth is slower than average by Finland Area standards. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Suckers were caught in high numbers with small average size, as has been the case in all past assessments.  Common Shiners and Creek Chubs were also caught, but in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nTrappers Lake is a designated trout lake and as such, applicable rules apply.  The lake is very clear with sparse vegetation and some downed cedar along the south shore.  Much caution is advised in winter due to the inlet and springs; the lake is very susceptible to slush and at times there have been small open areas near the middle of the lake. <br> \n</p>",
