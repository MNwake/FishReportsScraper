A partial winterkill, despite winter oxygen testing that did not detect extreme oxygen depletion, is suspected as the reason for the declines.  Bullheads remain excessively abundant.  Most other species are well below their respective local medians.  Walleyes are currently at approximately one-third the local median.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boyer Lake is a 438-acre lake located in western Becker County, within the Buffalo River watershed.  Boyer Lake is moderately developed, and can be prone to occasional winterkill.  There is a public boat access located on the northwest shore of the lake, adjacent to U.S. Highway 10 east of Lake Park.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and panfish are all popular targets for anglers on this lake.  The Islands found in Boyer Lake are State-owned Waterfowl Management Areas.  Boyer Lake is within an established Game Refuge, therefore waterfowl hunting is not allowed within the Refuge boundaries.     <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed on Boyer Lake on 08/13/2018 to assess the fish community.  This survey utilized nine gill nets and nine trap nets.  Shoreline habitat conditions and near-shore fish populations were also assessed in 2017, with references in this report.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate in the 2018 survey was within the normal range for this lake, with pike sampled ranging between 10 and 32 inches long.  The average length of pike sampled was just over 22 inches.  Occasionally, silver phase Northern Pike are caught in Boyer Lake.  Anglers often mistakenly identify this color phase of Northern Pike as Muskellunge.   <br> \n <br> \nBoyer Lake is known for holding large Walleyes.  Walleyes sampled during this survey ranged from 11 to nearly 30 inches in length.   Multiple year-classes of Walleyes were sampled, indicating that fry stocking continues to be successful for Boyer Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass, Bluegills, and Black Crappies are all components of the fish community in Boyer Lake.  Bluegills are at their highest abundance ever observed in Boyer Lake.  The majority of the population is small (less than five inches), yet fish over nine inches were observed during this survey.   Largemouth Bass and Black Crappies are not well sampled by gear utilized in this survey, yet decent numbers and size ranges of both species were found.  Bass fishing is popular on Boyer Lake during summer months, and anglers can expect to find bass from six to 17 inches long.  Crappies are a popular target for winter anglers, but the largest crappies sampled during this survey were only around eight inches long.  Yellow Perch sampled during this survey reached lengths over 10 inches, and have also become popular with anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nChinese Mystery Snails and Curly-Leaf Pond weed are aquatic invasive species (AIS) present in Boyer Lake.  AIS can be transferred from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can negatively impact lakes and aquatic communities.  To avoid the spreading of AIS to other waters, please follow the current AIS regulations.     <br> \n <br> \nThe near-shore fish community was sampled in Boyer Lake in 2017. The results of this survey suggest that the fish population in Boyer Lake meets expectations for lakes of similar characteristics, and the lake is not biologically impaired.  Shoreline habitat was also assessed in 2017 through a Score the Shore survey, designed to provide a means to quantify and compare lakeshore habitat between lakes. The Boyer Lake shoreline habitat score was slightly lower than the statewide lake score.  Future development on Boyer Lake should make an effort to preserve aquatic and shoreline habitat so that the health of Boyer Lake is preserved for future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boyer Lake is a 438-acre lake located in western Becker County, within the Buffalo River watershed.  It is moderately developed with a public boat access located on the northwest shore of the lake, adjacent to U.S. Highway 10 east of Lake Park.  The Islands found in Boyer Lake are State-owned Waterfowl Management Areas.  A standard fisheries survey was completed on Boyer Lake in August 2023 to assess the fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nTraditionally, Boyer Lake has had a low abundance of Northern Pike, but numbers have increased recently.  The Northern Pike population now has moderate numbers.  The size of the pike tend to be good with 41% of the pike sampled in 2023 being over 24 inches.  Pike up to 34 inches were measured.  Boyer Lake also contains a fairly numerous population of silver pike, which are often mistaken for Muskellunge by anglers.  About 21% of the pike captured in 2023 were silver pike.  Walleye numbers were well above average for the lake and good size fish were available for anglers to catch.  About 54% of the Walleye captured in 2023 were over 15 inches and 37% were over 20 inches.  Bluegill were found in small numbers at the lake compared to other area lakes and very few fish over eight inches were observed.  The longest Bluegill measured was 9.5 inches.  Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were captured in low numbers in the nets, which is often the case with this sampling gear.  Black Crappie up to ten inches were measured and Largemouth Bass up to 18.5 inches were captured.  Yellow Perch were abundant in Boyer Lake, but only averaged 6.5 inches in length.  Other fish species observed were Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boyer Lake is a lightly developed, occasional winterkill lake located in western Becker County.  A public boat access was recently constructed on the northwest shore of the lake, adjacent to U.S. Highway 10 east of Lake Park.  Fishing for any of several species can be good in between winterkills.  The most recent winterkill in Boyer Lake was recorded in 1986.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, and panfish are all popular targets of anglers on this lake.Northern pike test net catches have decreased since 1998, but are still about normal for this lake.  Pike averaged about three pounds each in 2003.  Occasionally, silver phase northern pike are caught in Boyer Lake and some anglers mistakenly believe they are muskies.Since walleye spawning habitat is very limited in this lake, the walleye fishery is sustained by biennial fry stocking.  Sampled walleyes also averaged about three pounds during this study.  The most abundant year class is the 1997.  Walleyes from that group were about 22 inches long and weighed well over three pounds during the 2003 assessment.Largemouth bass, bluegills, and black crappies are all parts of the fish community in Boyer Lake.  While none of these species are particularly abundant, a few larger specimens are occasionally caught.Boyer is a relatively scenic lake in prairie country with several small islands, bays, and peninsulas.  High precipitation levels in the late 1990's resulted in a water level increase of several feet in this lake.  This higher water level is part of the long term water level variability pattern.  When water levels recede in the future, it is not known what effect this will have on the fishery.  For now, fish populations and fishing are good.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boyer Lake is located in western Becker County two miles east of Lake Park, MN.  A scenic, lightly developed lake with many bays and small islands, Boyer appears out of place in its prairie setting.  With a mean depth of 12.5 feet and a maximum depth of 26 feet, Boyer is subject to periodic winterkill, the most recent occurring in 1986.  The fish community often reflects the winterkill nature of the lake.  Impacted by a highly agricultural watershed, Boyer is a very fertile lake, often experiencing heavy midsummer algal blooms but also capable of tremendous fish growth.  Recent Minnesota Department of Transportation improvements to state highway 10 forced the removal of the public access.  Plans for a new access are currently being developed.Past management actions have included: stocking, rough fish removal, dissolved oxygen monitoring and winterkill assessment.  Since 1946, Boyer Lake has been stocked nine times with bluegill, twenty times with walleye, two times with crappie and one time with northern pike.  The current management plan calls for biennial walleye fry stocking at a rate of 1000 fry/littoral acre.  Other game fish may also be stocked if post-winterkill evaluation determines a need.  Since 1966, 67,630 pounds of rough fish (bullheads, suckers and yellow perch) have been commercially harvested.Until recently, northern pike catch rates have been near or below lake class median levels.  The current catch rate of 11.83/gill net set is over double the class median (5.08/set) and is the highest reported from Boyer Lake.  A very successful 1997 year class dominated the catch, comprising 90% of the sample.  The dominance of young fish in the population is reflected by a PSD of 24, a mean length of 19.3 inches, and a mean weight of 1.65 pounds.  Growth rates were excellent, anglers can expect a very good northern pike fishery in the near future.  The current walleye catch rate of 9.17/gill net set is over three times the lake class median (2.75/set) and represents a historical high.  As with northern pike, the walleye catch was dominated by young fish (94% age III or less).  Mean lengths and weights of the sample were 13.9 inches and 1.24 pounds respectively.  Growth rates were exceptional, greatly exceeding statewide averages.  Anglers can expect an improved walleye fishery in the next year or two.The current yellow perch catch rate of 15.00/gill net set nearly mirrors the lake class median value of 11.50/set.  Mean lengths and weights were 7.3 inches and 0.22 pounds, respectively.  Due to periodic partial winterkill, centrarchid species have exhibited limited success in these waters.  Bluegills, though not abundant (1.0/trap net set), have a tremendous potential for growth with some specimens exceeding 10.0 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Largemouth bass too demonstrated excellent growth rates but have produced few strong year classes.Boyer Lake supports all three species of bullhead with the black bullhead being the dominant species.  Historically, bullhead numbers have fluctuated greatly.  From historical highs reported from the mid to late 1980's to historical lows of recent years, bullheads best demonstrate the dynamics of a winterkill lake.  Though the quality of the bullhead population has improved (mean weight=0.71 pound), their low abundance would draw little commercial interest.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boyer Lake is a lightly developed, occasional winterkill lake located in western Becker County.  There is a public boat access located on the northwest shore of the lake, adjacent to U.S. Highway 10 east of Lake Park.  Fishing for any of several species can be good between winterkills.  The most recent winterkill in Boyer Lake was recorded in 1986.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, and panfish are all popular targets of anglers on this lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike test net catches have decreased since 1998, but are still about normal for this lake.  Pike averaged just under three pounds each in 2008.  Occasionally, silver phase northern pike are caught in Boyer Lake and some anglers mistakenly believe they are muskies. <br> \n <br> \nSince walleye spawning habitat is very limited in this lake, the walleye fishery is sustained by biennial fry stocking.  Sampled walleyes also averaged about three pounds during this study.  The most abundant year class is the 2005.  This age-three group was nearly fully recruited to the fishery in this fast-growing population.  Fry-stocked walleyes from two older age groups (five and eleven) were also present in good numbers. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass, bluegills, and black crappies are all parts of the fish community in Boyer Lake.  While none of these species are particularly abundant, a few larger specimens are occasionally caught. <br> \n <br> \nBoyer is a relatively scenic lake in prairie country with several small islands, bays, and peninsulas.  High precipitation levels in the late 1990's resulted in a water level increase of several feet in this lake.  This higher water level is part of the long term water level variability pattern.  When water levels recede in the future, it is not known what effect this will have on the fishery.  For now, fish populations and fishing are relatively good. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boyer Lake is a lightly developed, occasional winterkill lake located in western Becker County.  There is a public boat access located on the northwest shore of the lake, adjacent to U.S. Highway 10 east of Lake Park.  Fishing for any of several species can be good between winterkills.  The most recent winterkill in Boyer Lake was documented in 1986.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and panfish are all popular targets of anglers on this lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike test net catches have decreased since 1998, but are still about normal for this lake.  Pike averaged just under three and a half pounds each in 2013.  Occasionally, silver phase Northern Pike are caught in Boyer Lake and some anglers mistakenly believe they are muskies. <br> \n <br> \nSince Walleye spawning habitat is very limited in this lake, the Walleye fishery is sustained by fry stocking.  The Walleye catch rate in 2013 was higher than average for Boyer Lake, with sampled Walleyes averaging just under two pounds during this study.  The most abundant year class was the 2011.  This age-two group should be fully recruited to the fishery within a year or two in this fast-growing population.  Fry-stocked Walleyes from several older age groups were also present in good numbers. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass, Bluegills, and Black Crappies are all components of the fish community in Boyer Lake.  Bluegills have recently become very abundant, but were relatively small and young in 2013.  Fast Bluegill growth rates should help expand fishing opportunities greatly in the near future, barring a winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nBoyer is a relatively scenic lake in prairie country with several small islands, bays, and peninsulas.  High precipitation levels in the late 1990's resulted in a water level increase of several feet in this lake.  This higher water level is part of the long term water level variability pattern.  When water levels recede in the future, it is not known what effect this will have on the fishery.  For now, it appears fish populations and fishing are relatively good.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boyer Lake is a shallow (25 ft. max. depth), fertile lake with numerous bays and islands.  It is subject tovery heavy summer algal blooms and periodic winterkills or partial winterkills.  A severe winterkill wasdocumented in 1986.  Development is limited to a nursing home off U.S. Highway 10 on the north shore and two farmsites on the remainder of the lake.  Bulrushes and cattails are present along much of the shoreline and acormorant rookery exists on the largest island.   The lack of development and natural setting is astheticallypleasing for anglers and other users.  The fish community is typical of winterkill lakes and is comprisedprimarily of bullheads, some yellow perch, walleyes from fry stockings, and a few scattered survivors of otherspecies.  No northern pike, largemouth bass, or black crappies were sampled in the current survey's test nets. Only one bluegill was sampled.  Young-of-the-year largemouth bass were sampled during shoreline seining however,confirming the survival of at least some adult bass.  Also, one young-of-the-year bluegill was collected.  Walleyefry stocking has periodically produced a significant fishery, attracting numerous anglers despite the poor access(access is an unimproved area off the highway right-of-way).  The current survey found one, three, and four-year-old walleyes to be present.  They exhibit fast growth.  The bullhead population, extremely high in previoussurveys, has declined significantly.  Commercial harvest in the late 80's, walleye predation and increasedcormorant activity are all likely contributors to the bullhead decline.</p>",

This data will be analyzed in conjunction with the standard survey that will be completed in 2018 to provide a complete assessment of the fish community that will be used to evaluate the biological condition of Boyer Lake, and contribute to the assessment of the watershed. <br> \nTen sites within Boyer Lake were sampled during this survey.  Dense vegetation, soft substrate, and woody habitat within Boyer Lake resulted in difficult sampling conditions at some stations.  Electrofishing was conducted from the boat at two stations.  Seines were used at a total of seven stations (all 15-foot seine hauls).  Steep drop-offs along shore resulted in some narrow seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nOnly five fish species were sampled during this survey.  Species sampled included Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, and White Sucker.  All White Sucker, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass sampled were from the 2017 age-class. The results of this survey suggest that the fish population in Boyer Lake meets expectations for lakes of similar characteristics, and the lake is not biologically impaired.  </p>",
