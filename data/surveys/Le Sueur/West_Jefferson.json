                "narrative": "<p>\tWest Jefferson Lake is a 441 acre lake in LeSueur county located northwest of Elysian. A DNR owned public access is located in the northeast corner of the lake off LeSueur county road 15.  <br> \n\tWest Jefferson was surveyed the week of July 28th, 2008 to monitor the fish community. Black bullheads were prolific, measuring 104 fish per gill net lift. Bullhead numbers have diminished since the 2002 survey, when 149 fish per net was observed. Black crappie abundance was in the upper quartile, at 22.2 fish per gill net. Black crappie trap netted nearly identically at 20 fish per trap net. Gill net and trap net catches are up from 2002 levels of 15.7 and 6.8 respectively. <br> \n\tNorthern pike abundance was low in test netting, having dropped from near record highs of 15 fish per net in 2002. Pike were gill netted at a rate of 1.5 fish per net and 0.2 fish per trap net. Pike sampled ranged from 22 to 35 inches. Walleye were caught at a rate of 1.8 fish per gill net. Most fish were 19 inches. Walleye catch has been stable since the 2002 survey that found an average of less than one walleye per gill net. <br> \n\tBluegills were gill netted at a rate of 8.8 fish per net, and trap netted at a rate of 89.2 fish per net. Bluegill length ranged from 4 to 8 inches, with an average (mean) of 6.5 inches. The bluegill catch in 2002 was 30 fish per trap net. Other fish surveyed include bigmouth buffalo, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, freshwater drum (sheephead), golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n\tLargemouth bass were sampled in mid-May using a Smith Root electrofishing boat. A catch per unit effort of 68 fish per hour of on time was recorded. Bass ranged from 5 to 20 inches. An excellent assortment of ages and sizes exist in West Jefferson lake. A number of bass angling tournaments select the Jefferson chain of lakes as a host site. <br> \n\tAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in West Jefferson Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n\tShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. <br> \n\tShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

No age-0 Walleyes were sampled or observed. Past Walleye management in West Jefferson has consisted of frequent fry stockings and has failed to result in anything but low gill net catch rates during summer surveys. With the expanded production of Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye fry, perhaps there remains hope for producing a good Walleye year class in the future. </p>",

A DNR owned public access is located on the northeast corner of the lake off Le Sueur County Road 15.  West Jefferson Lake is managed to provide a bluegill and crappie fishery with secondary opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye.  West Jefferson Lake was surveyed the week of August 5th, 2013 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR.  The 2013 survey consisted of deploying trap and gill nets to monitor the fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nFish species such as bluegill, black crappie, and black bullhead were most abundant in the net catches.  Bluegills had the highest abundance; they were captured in gill nets at a rate of 3.3 fish/net, and sampled in trap nets at a rate of 27.6 fish/net, which is average for a lake of this type.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 2.5 to 8.9 inches, with a mean length of 5.2 inches.  Black crappie were second-most abundant in the survey, they were caught at a rate of 13.1 fish/trap net and 6.6 fish/gill net (average abundances compared to similar lakes in Minnesota).  Black bullheads were sampled at 14.3 fish/gill net, this is considerably less than gill net abundances observed in 2008 (104 fish/gill net) and in 2002 (149 fish/gill net).  Black bullhead lengths averaged around 10.5 inches in total length, which is generally considered acceptable to most anglers.     <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance increased from 2008 to 2013 with gill net catch rates of 1.5 fish/gill net and 6.0 fish/gill net, respectively.  Northern pike abundances were relatively high compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.  Total lengths of northern pike captured during 2013 ranged from 17.5 to 29.1 inches.  Northern pike fry are stocked annually to sustain the population.  Most of the northern pike sampled from this survey were apparently from the 2010 and 2011 stocked year classes, when 29,211 and 22,572 fry were stocked, respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nOnly four largemouth bass were captured in nets during the 2013 survey.  However, largemouth bass typically are not effectively sampled by nets; thus, these numbers may not reflect true abundance.  The Jefferson chain remains a popular largemouth bass destination and location of bass angling tournaments which indicates that the lake supports a fishable bass population.  The largemouth bass captured in nets during the 2013 survey ranged in length from 8.1 to 20.3 inches.  Spring electrofishing should be conducted to properly assess the largemouth bass population in the Jefferson Lake chain. <br> \n <br> \nOnly two walleye were sampled in this survey; one 18.0 inches in total length and the other 26.0.  A walleye maintenance stocking program has been in place at West Jefferson Lake to sustain the population.  Walleye fry are stocked three of every four years.  Common carp were sampled at a rate (3.67 fish/gill net) above average for this lake type.  Yellow perch catch rates illustrated below-average abundances for this type of lake. Other fish surveyed include bigmouth buffalo, bowfin (dogfish), freshwater drum (sheephead), golden shiner, white sucker, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in West Jefferson Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural, undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n-Prepared by:  Matt Mork, Fisheries Specialist. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on West Jefferson Lake was conducted on July 9, 2018 by Waterville Area Fisheries staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten stations. Seining was completed at all ten stations using a 50-foot seine. Nearshore sampling captured 16 native species of fish. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in July 2018 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for West Jefferson Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Jefferson Lake is a 441-acre lake located approximately 3 miles south-southeast of the town of Cleveland in Le Sueur County. A DNR-maintained public access is located on the east side of the lake off County Highway 15. The maximum depth is 24 feet with 79% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. The lake is considered eutrophic with generally poor water clarity and frequent algae blooms caused by elevated nutrient levels. West Jefferson Lake is designated as an infested water body due to the establishment of Eurasian Watermilfoil. West Jefferson Lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie and Bluegill and secondarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye. The current management plan calls for stocking 25,000 Northern Pike fry annually and 349,000 Walleye fry every other year in odd years. Recent stocking events include Northern Pike in 2013 through 2018 and Walleye fry in 2017, 2019, and 2021. West Jefferson Lake is managed along with Middle Jefferson Lake, East Jefferson Lake, and German Lake as part of a chain of lakes known collectively as the Jefferson Chain. Since these lakes are openly connected to one another, fish migration must be considered, and management is coordinated as such. <br> \n <br> \nWest Jefferson Lake was surveyed the week of 20 July 2021 as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. The survey was completed to assess the fish community using 9 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and spring boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie was the most common species sampled in the gill nets (43.8/net) and trap nets (70.8/net). Both numbers were the highest Black Crappie catch rates recorded since 1994. Black Crappie sampled with trap nets ranged from 4.2 to 11.7 inches and averaged of 8.6 inches in length. Black Crappie sampled in gill nets ranged from 2.6 to 9.8 inches long with a mean of 6.8 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 8 years with 8 year classes present. Over 67% of Black Crappie sampled were 3 years old or younger. Like other lakes in the Jefferson Chain, West Jefferson supports an abundant Black Crappie population. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 376 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 47.0/net. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.4 to 8.4 inches and averaged of 6.5 inches. An additional 233 Bluegills, ranging from 4.0 to 8.0 inches, were sampled with gill nets. Bluegill ages from both gears ranged from 2 to 8 years with 7 year classes present. Three year old Bluegills accounted for 34% of the sample, this was the largest age group sampled. The Bluegill population of West Jefferson Lake appears healthy, yet efforts should be made to improve size structure. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 25 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets in 2021 for a catch rate of 2.8/net. Northern Pike lengths ranged from 18.2 to 36.2 inches with an average of 25.2 inches. Approximately 70% of Northern Pike exceeded the legal minimum length of 24 inches. Northern Pike ages ranged from 2 to 7 years with 6 year classes present. Despite stocking, Northern Pike catch rates continue to be inconsistent in West Jefferson Lake. However, age and length data suggest moderate growth rates to the 24 inch limit and beyond. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled with spring boat electrofishing in 2021 for just the third time. A total of 42 fish were sampled for a catch rate of 30.4/hour. Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 7.2 to 18.9 inches with an average of 10.7 inches. An additional 4 Largemouth Bass ranging from 8.0 to 15.1 inches were sampled with the net gears. West Jefferson Lake offers quality Largemouth Bass habitat and should be sampled with spring boat electrofishing in all future surveys. <br> \n <br> \nJust 2 Walleyes ranging from 18.8 to 24.2 inches were sampled with gill nets in 2021 for a catch rate of 0.2/net. Only twice since 1994 has the Walleye catch rate exceeded 0.5/net. Both fish sampled belonged to the 2014 year class.  <br> \n <br> \nJust 3 Black Bullheads were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.3/net, near the lowest catch rate on record. Historically, Black Bullheads have been very abundant in West Jefferson Lake. In 5 surveys from 1994 to 2013, catch rates exceeded 100.0/net 3 times with a mean of 114.8/net. The recent decline follows with an area-wide trend of declining Black Bullhead numbers. On the other hand, Yellow Bullheads increased to an all-time high of 9.1/net. This suggests the lake has been more stable in recent years and, in the absence of winterkill, this trend should continue. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp gill net numbers were also near an all-time low of 0.2/net which was below the lake class first quartile (3.3/net). From 1994 to 2021, catch rates varied from 0.2/net to 6.6/net with a mean of 2.6/net. The increased stability and health of the Jefferson Chain is reflected in the decline of Black Bullhead and Common Carp numbers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2021 include Bowfin (dogfish), Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, White Crappie, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

THE BLC LENGTH DISTRIBUTION WAS BIMODAL, WITH PEAKS AT 5.0-5.9 INCHES AND 8.5-9.9 INCHES.  AGES 2 AND 6 CRAPPIE WERE MOST COMMON, AND AGES 1,3, AND 5 WERE ALSO CAPTURED. GROWTH OF BLC IS FAST AT AGE 1 THEN SLOWS, AND AT AGE 4 AND LATER, BLC ARE AN INCH OR MORE SHORTER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE.  WHC AVERAGED 1.67/TRAP NET, A REDUCTION FROM 6.25/NET IN 1986.  BOTH TRAP AND GILL NET CATCHES IN 1992 WERE WITHIN THE CLASS 32 IQR.  MOST WHC CAPTURED WERE FROM 5.5-6.4 INCHES OR 8.5-9.4 INCHES.  AGES 1-5 WERE SAMPLED, WITH AGE 1 ACCOUNTING FOR OVER HALF THE SAMPLE. NOP, AT 4.67/GILL NET, WERE CAPTURED AT A LEVEL WITHIN THE IQR FOR CLASS 32 LAKES, THE FIRST SUCH OCCURRENCE SINCE SURVEYS BEGAN IN 1951.  ALL PREVIOUS SURVEYS HAD ENCOUNTERED THIS SPECIES IN MUCH SMALLER QUANTITIES.  LENGTHS RANGED FROM 15.0-24.9 INCHES, WITH A MODAL LENGTH OF 17.0-17.9 INCHES AND AGES I THROUGH 5 ASSIGNED.  IT APPEARS LIKELY, HOWEVER, THAT MOST OR, PERHAPS, ALL OF THESE FISH WERE BORN IN 1991.  UNUSUALLY-HIGH SURVEY CATCHES OF SMALL NOP WERE OBSERVED ON ALL FIVE OF THESE BASINS IN 1992 AND IT APPEARS THAT THIS SPECIES WAS ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SPAWNING HABITAT CREATED BY THE INUNDATION OF PREVIOUSLY-DRY SHORE LINE IN 1990 AND 1991.  THE WATER LEVEL IN THESE BASINS ROSE SEVERAL FEET PRIOR TO THE 1991 SPAWNING EVENT.  CREATING AN EXTRAODINARY OPPORTUNITY FOR NATURAL REPRODUCTION. 1.17 WAE/GILL NET AND 1.67/TRAP NET WERE CAPTURED, WITHIN AND ABOVE THE RESPECTIVE IQR'S FOR CLASS 32 LAKES, AND SIMILAR TO THE 1986 CATCHES OF 0.75/ GILL NET AND 1.00/TRAP NET.  THE TWO LARGE FISH WERE BOTH AGED 9, AND THE OTHERS WERE AGED 3 AND 4.  THE 3 YEAR OLDS MATCH A 1989 FRY STOCKING, BUT THE AGE 4 FISH DO NOT CORRESPOND TO ANY STOCKING. THE STOCKING OF ADULTS INTO OTHER BASINS OF JEFFERSON, AND INTO GERMAN IN 1990, 1990, AND 1988 MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEPARATE STOCKING FROM ANY NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  TWO OF THE WAE CAPTURED WERE OVER 25.0 INCHES; THE OTHERS WERE FROM 13.0- 15.9 INCHES.  GROWTH TO AGE WAS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS MEASURED IN THE 1986 SURVEY, AND GROWTH TO EACH ANNULUS WAS SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE.  OTHER GAME FISH CAPTURED IN LOW NUMBERS WERE LMB, BLG, AND YEP.  BOTH BLH AND CARP CAPTURED IN TRAP NETS AT LEVELS ABOVE THE IQRS FOR THOSE SPECIES, AT 219.50 AND 4.17/NET, RESPECTIVELY.  THESE ARE INCREASES FROM THE 1986 TRAP NET CATCHES OF 38.75 BLB/NET AND 1.00 CARP/ NET.  THE BLB LENGTH DISTRIBUTION HAS TWO DISTINCT LENGTH RANGES FROM 4.0-5.4 INCHES AND 8.0-10.9 INCHES.  IN 1986, CARP WERE PREDOMINANTLY 20.0- 22.9 INCHES; THIS SURVEY CONTAINED FEW FISH OF THOSE LENGTHS, WITH LENGTHS COMMONLY 15.0-18.9 INCHES.  OTHER NON-GAME FISH CAPTURED IN THIS SURVEY WERE BOF, WTS, BIB, YEB, AND FRD.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Jefferson Lake is a 441-acre lake located approximately 3 miles south-southeast of the town of Cleveland in Le Sueur County. A DNR-maintained public access is located on the east side of the lake off County Highway 15. The maximum depth is 24 feet with 79% classified as littoral area. The lake is considered eutrophic with generally poor water clarity and frequent algae blooms caused by elevated nutrient levels. It is designated as an infested water body due to the establishment of Eurasian Watermilfoil. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie and Bluegill and secondarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye. The current management plan calls for stocking 25,000 Northern Pike fry annually and 349,000 Walleye fry every other year in odd years. Recent stocking events include Northern Pike in 2013 through 2018 and Walleye fry in 2013, 2015, and 2017. Additionally, 8,900 Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2014 to attempt to boost catch rates. West Jefferson Lake is managed along with Middle and East Jefferson Lakes and German Lake as part of chain of lakes known collectively as the Jefferson Chain. Since these lakes are openly connected to one another, fish migration must be considered and management is coordinated as such.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was performed the week of July 23, 2018 as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). The survey was completed to assess the fish community using 9 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and 90 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie was the most common species sampled in the gill nets (18.3/net) and trap nets (56.3/net). Both numbers indicated the presence of an abundant population and were among the highest Black Crappie catch rates recorded since 1994. Trap netted fish ranged from 4.6 to 11.5 inches with an average of 8.5 inches and gill netted fish ranged from 4.4 to 9.7 inches with an average of 6.9 inches. Approximately 74% of the catchable size fish from the trap nets were 8 inches or larger. Ages ranged from 2 to 8 years old with 5 year classes present. Over 62% were 3 years old. Like other lakes in the Jefferson Chain, West Jefferson supports an abundant Black Crappie population. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 310 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 34.4/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Historically, catch rates have varied between 5.5/net and 89.2/net with an average of 33.5/net. Lengths ranged from 3.8 to 8.9 inches with an average of 6.3 inches. Approximately 66% were larger than 6 inches and 2% were larger than 8 inches. An additional 34 fish ranging from 4.7 to 7.1 inches were sampled with gill nets. Ages from both gears ranged from 3 to 8 years old with 5 year classes present. Four year old fish accounted for 66% of the sample. The Bluegill population of West Jefferson Lake appears healthy yet efforts should be made to improve size structure. <br> \n <br> \nJust 15 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets in 2018 for a catch rate of 1.7/net, indicating low to moderate numbers were present. Catch rates have been highly variable over the years with 4 catch rates falling below 2.0/net and the other two 2 exceeding 6.0/net. Lengths ranged from 22.0 to 29.3 inches with an average of 25.8 inches. Approximately 80% of the sample exceeded the legal minimum length of 24 inches. Another 14 Northern Pike ranging from 21.8 to 34.4 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish were young and appeared to be fast growing. Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations are in effect for West Jefferson Lake. Anglers are allowed two fish per day. All fish under 24 inches must be immediately released. <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled with spring boat electrofishing in 2018 for just the second time. A total of 77 fish were sampled for a catch rate of 51.3/hour. The 2008 catch rate was 68.0/hour. Lengths ranged from 4.5 to 17.2 inches with an average of 11.3 inches. Of catchable size fish, approximately 28% were larger than 15 inches. An additional 11 Largemouth Bass ranging from 9.4 to 20.5 inches were sampled with the net gears. West Jefferson Lake offers quality Largemouth Bass habitat and should be sampled with spring boat electrofishing in all future surveys. <br> \n <br> \nJust 4 Walleyes ranging from 19.3 to 21.1 inches were sampled with gill nets in 2018 for a catch rate of 0.4/net, indicating low numbers were present. Only twice since 1994 has the catch rate exceeded 0.5/net. An additional 7 fish ranging from 16.9 to 21.9 inches were sampled with trap nets. Of the fish that were aged, all were 4 years old. This aligns with the 2014 fingerling stocked year class that has also shown up strong in other Jefferson Chain surveys in 2018. It appears possible that the fingerlings stocked in West Jefferson in 2014 survived well and dispersed throughout the Jefferson Chain. Genetic analysis is underway to help determine if this is the case. <br> \n <br> \nJust 2 Black Bullheads were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was by far the lowest catch rate on record. Historically, Black Bullheads have been very abundant in West Jefferson Lake. In 5 surveys from 1994 to 2013, catch rates exceeded 100.0/net 3 times with an average of 114.8/net. The recent decline follows with an area-wide trend of declining Black Bullhead numbers. On the other hand, Yellow Bullheads increased to an all-time high of 3.0/net. This suggests the lake has been more stable in recent years and, in the absence of winterkill, this trend should continue. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp gill net numbers also declined to an all-time low of 0.2/net. Catch rates varied from 0.2/net to 6.6/net with an average of 3.0/net from 1994 through 2018. The increased stability and health of the Jefferson Chain is reflected in the decline of Black Bullhead and Common Carp numbers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2018 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (dogfish), Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, White Bass, White Crappie, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements included water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and secchi depth. Water clarity was poor with a secchi depth of 1.8 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 10.3 ppm and 78.1 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 0.0 ppm and 51.1 degrees Fahrenheit at 22 feet. A thermocline was detected between 13 and 16 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, specialist <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike also remain consistent in abundance with previous years, but the average size is an impressive 29 inches and 6 pounds.  Bluegill numbers continue to be stable with many fish between 5 - 6.5 inches.  Crappie numbers remain consistent but much of the population is made up of fish less than 8 inches.  Some black crappies currently exceed 8 inches, but nearly all of the white crappies are less than 7 inches at this time.  By the summer of 1998, many of these fish should exceed 8 inches and provide some fishing.Bullhead numbers are average to below average compared with previous surveys, with most fish being around 8.3 inches and 0.4 pounds.  In summary, the fish community in West Jefferson has changed very little over the last 15 years.  Intermittent panfish reproduction seems to govern the fishing on this lake.  As strong year-classes of panfish reach acceptable size, anglers respond.  This trend should continue.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Low oxygen conditions occurred in the winter of 2000 - 2001 resulting in winterkill of fish in West Jefferson.  Following the winterkill, yellow perch, northern pike largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie adults were stocked in West Jefferson in the spring of 2001.  Additionally, walleye and northern pike fry were also stocked.  A fishery survey was conducted on West Jefferson Lake in late-July 2002 to monitor the fish community and lake characteristics.  Black bullhead were the most abundant fish in both gill and trap net catches, exhibiting the typical rapid increase in abundance after a winterkill.  Northern pike were common in both gill and trap net samples.  Most of the northern pike were around 18 to 19 inches long and were age 1.  These fish were likely from the 2001 northern pike fry stocking.  Bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch adults were present in West Jefferson Lake.  Many of these adult panfish were likely from stockings made in 2001 and emigration from Middle Jefferson.  Age 0 and 1 panfish were common and should experience rapid growth in the next few years.  A diverse fish community has been reestablished in West Jefferson Lake following the winterkill in 2000 - 2001, however, high black bullhead abundance may hinder the development of a quality fishery.  </p>",
