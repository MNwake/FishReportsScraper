                "narrative": "<p>Tin Can Mike Lake is located within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) within the Superior National Forest and is a non-motorized lake.  It is approximately 11 miles northeast of Ely. There are two portage accesses to the lake consisting of a 130 rod portage from Sandpit Lake and a 90 rod portage from Horse Lake. There are two relatively small inlets and one outlet that flows to Horse Lake.  \n\nTin Can Mike is 145 acres with a maximum depth of 29 feet and light green colored water.  Most of the eastern shoreline is forested but the western side contains a fair amount of lowland bog area close to the lake edge.  Three campsites are located on the lake.\n\nOn August 15, 2016 oxygen levels were adequate for fish to a depth of 16 feet where the water temperature was 69 F.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Tin Can Mike consist of boulder, rubble, gravel and sand.  Aquatic plants are confined mostly to the shallow bays.  Several deadheads (remnant logs from logging days that are stuck in the bottom and stick up high enough to reach the water surface) remain in the southern bay.  \n\nThe 2016 overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 19.2 fish/net.  Fish species sampled were northern pike, yellow perch, rock bass, bluegill, walleye, and largemouth bass.\n\nEight walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 1.3 fish/gill net, which was below average compared to other similar lakes and lower than both previous surveys on Tin Can Mike.  Lengths ranged from 10 to 24 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 12.  Tin Can Mike was stocked with walleye four times between 1975 and 1981.  Three walleye were captured in the initial survey in 1965 so they were present in the lake prior to our first record of stocking.\n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 8.3 fish/net which was high compared to other similar lakes but lower than catches from the previous surveys from Tin Can Mike.  The average weight was nearly two pounds which was slightly above average compared to other similar lakes.  Sizes ranged from 11 to 29 inches with an average of 20 inches.\n\nLargemouth bass were sampled for the first time on Tin Can Mike Lake. Catch rate was 0.7 fish/net which was above average compared to other similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 8 to 15 inches.  Ages ranged from 2 to 5 years old.\n\nThe bluegill catch rate was 2.8 fish/net which was similar to the first survey but lower than the previous survey.  Sizes were small ranging from 3.5 to 6 inches with an average of 5 inches.  Bluegill ranged from 3 to 6 years old.  Growth was slow compared to other bluegill lakes in the Tower area.  \n\nThe yellow perch gillnet catch was 3 fish/net which was above average compared to other similar lakes but not a lot different than previous surveys on the lake.  Sizes were small ranging from 6 to 9 inches with an average of nearly 7 inches.  \n\nEighteen rock bass were caught for a rate of 3 fish/net.  This was the highest catch on record for the lake and quite high compared to other similar lakes.  Sizes ranged from 4 to 7 inches.  \n</p>",
