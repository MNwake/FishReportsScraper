The present water level is nearly 3 feet higher compared to previous readings. The shoreline is forested up to the waters edge in most places with some areas of bog also. The lake bottom is mostly soft with detritus and an occasional boulder near shore. Aquatic vegetation is common throughout the lake. <br> \n <br> \nAccess is by portage from Battle Lake (140 rods), Lunetta Lake (280 rods) or Saca Lake (80 rods). There is one designated USFS campsite on the lake. <br> \n <br> \nHybrid sunfish (5.3/gill net) and one yellow perch were sampled in 3 gill nets during this initial investigation. The average sunfish sampled was 6.9 inches and the largest observed was 10.0 inches long. The parent species are likely bluegill and green sunfish. No other gamefish were sampled or observed. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
