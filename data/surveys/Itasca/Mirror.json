The lake is 105 acres and has a maximum depth of 45 feet.  A survey targeting nearshore fish species was conducted by Area staff on 3 July, 2017.  Ten sampling sites (100 feet long) were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-ft or 15-ft 1/8th inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining was conducted at 9 sites; 5 using a 50-ft seine and 4 using a 15-ft seine.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured a total of 8 different species; 6 species by seining and 8 species by backpack electrofishing.  The species can be found in the gear-specific catch tables in this report. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used with the gill net and trap net data from the standard survey conducted on 12 June, 2017, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of lake health.  The surveys will assist the watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mirror Lake is a small 105 acre lake with 48 littoral acres and a maximum depth of 45 feet.  Development along the 1.9 mile shoreline is mostly limited to the northeast.  There are no inlets or outlets.  Walleye are considered a primary management species with a management goal of maintaining a catch of 2.5/gill net.  Though natural reproduction has been documented, Walleye fingerlings have been stocked at a rate of 0.5 pounds/littoral acre (25 pounds) every three years since 2009.  Largemouth Bass are considered another primary management species with a goal of maintaining an electrofishing catch rate of 30/hour and with 40% longer than 12 inches.  Northern Pike are considered a secondary management species.  The fisheries lake management plan was last revised in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch was within the expected range for lakes similar to Mirror Lake, yet lower than the previous survey and management goals.  Lakes with similar habitat are not known to produce abundant Walleye fisheries.  Lengths ranged from 10.5 to 20.5 inches, and were similar to the previous assessment.  Age analysis indicated all the fish corresponded to a stocked year class. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled with electrofishing at a rate of 23/hr.  The catch was lower than the management goal and the previous survey.  A quality size structure was observed, meeting management goals.  Lengths ranged from 5.3 to 17.9 inches with an average length of 11.9 inches and was similar to the previous survey.  Scale analysis identified ages 2 to 9 and 11 present with growth similar to the statewide average.  Largemouth Bass averaged almost 12 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were abundant, and sampled above the expected range in most surveys.  Size structure was favorable and slightly better than past surveys.  Lengths ranged from 11.0 to 35.8 inches with an average length of 22.7 inches.  Age analysis identified ages 1 to 11 present.  Growth was slow early but close to the statewide average by age 3.  Northern Pike averaged 24.5 inches by age 6.  Anglers are encouraged to release pike over 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled Bluegill at a rate nearly triple the expected range, similar to past catches which have typically been abundant.  Size structure has characteristically been poor, common for high density Bluegill populations.  Scale analysis determined ages 3 to 10 and 12 were represented with growth similar to the lake class averages. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie gill net and trap net catches were comparable to lakes with similar habitats.  Catches in past surveys tended to be variable.  Size structure was favorable with lengths from 6.8 to 11.8 inches and an average length of 9.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the most numerous species caught in gill nets.  The catch was almost double the expected range and the highest catch since 1979.  Lengths ranged from 5.7 to 10.7 inches with an average length 7.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Golden Shiner and Rock Bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mirror Lake is a 105 acre lake located 5 miles west of Togo, MN in northeastern Itasca County.  Mirror Lake is considered primarily a bass/panfish lake, but has also historically supported a modest walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for walleye increased from 0.5/net in the 1996 assessment to 5.2/net in 2006.  Results of the 2006 assessment indicated that natural reproduction contributed substantially to the walleye population in recent years.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 3 of the previous 10 years.  Ages 1 thru 9, and 11 were represented in the 2006 sample, with only 4 of 21 fish (19%) coming from stocked years.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 10.8 to 25.1 inches, with a mean length of 17.5 inches.  Growth of walleye was similar to the statewide average.   <br> \n  <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch was well above the lake class normal range (12.8/net) in the previous assessment, but decreased to 6.2/net in 2006.  Gill-net sampled pike ranged in length from 9.3 to 31.3 inches with an average length of 20.9 inches.  The average weight of sampled pike was 2.2 pounds.  Ages 1 through 8 were represented in the sample and growth was similar to the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill-net catch rate was within the lake class normal range at 15.5/net.  Sampled perch ranged in length from 6.1 to 8.5 inches with a mean length of inches 6.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch for black crappie was relatively at 4.2/net. Sampled crappie ranged from 7.8 to 12.1 inches with an average length of 9.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to previous assessments, the trap-net catch rate for bluegill remained well above the lake class normal range at 75.3/net.  Sampled bluegill ranged from 3.4 to 8.5 inches, with an average length of 5.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA night electrofishing assessment for largemouth and smallmouth bass was conducted in spring 2006.  This was the first electrofishing assessment ever conducted on Mirror Lake.  The catch rate for largemouth bass was relatively high at 59.1/hour of on-time, while the catch rate for smallmouth bass was much lower at 5.9/hour.  Largemouth bass in the sample ranged from 3.4 to 18.1 inches, with an average length of 10.5 inches.  Smallmouth bass ranged from 8.0 to 19.8 inches, with an average length of 12.4 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for both species. <br> \n <br> \n    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Mirror Lake was conducted on July 25th, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured 11species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blacknose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and zero species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted during the week of July 25th, 2022 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill (85%) and Rock Bass (5%) comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number, and Bluegill (59%), Northern Pike (16%), and Largemouth Bass (10%) comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill and Rock Bass sampled per net were above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 20 lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Smallmouth Bass, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Mirror Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Big Fork River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mirror Lake is a bass-panfish lake that has historically had a modest population of walleye.  It is an infertile lake with soft, very clear water.  Bluegill, yellow perch and northern pike were the most numerous species in this assessment.       Information from this assessment suggests that natural reproduction of walleye is limited and recent fingerling stocking has done little to increase the walleye population.  Only two walleye were sampled in this assessment.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1989, 1991, and 1994.     Northern pike numbers have been high in recent years on Mirror Lake.  Pike up to 33.1 inches were sampled in this assessment. They averaged 2.0 pounds and 19.6 inches in length.       Bluegill have been sampled at high levels in the past, as was the case in this assessment.  Although growth was slow, many of those sampled (73%) were greater than 6.0 inches.  The largest was 9.1 inches.     Smallmouth bass and black crappie are present in the lake but none were sampled.  Both species were, however, observed during the assessment.         </p>",
