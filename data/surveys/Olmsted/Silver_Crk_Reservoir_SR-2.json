                "narrative": "<p>Silver Creek Reservoir (SR-2) is a 107 acre flood control reservoir east of Rochester on Olmsted county 11. The maximum depth is 13 feet depending on precipitation amounts.  There is a gravel parking lot on the base of the dam, with a crushed asphalt path over the dam to the water. The reservoir is open to angling from dawn until 7:00 pm and is closed to the public in November.  <br> \n  <br> \nTwo electrofishing runs were completed on May 13, 2021 to assess the game fish population in Silver Creek Reservoir (SR-2).  Dissolved oxygen sampling was completed on February 26, 2021 and again on July 29, 2021 due to conditions likely for a fish kill to occur. <br> \n   <br> \nA total of 23 Black Crappie were sampled for a catch rate of 27.6 fish/hour.  This was a decrease from the 2010 electrofishing survey catch rate of 94 fish/hour.  The average size increased from 8.5 inches in 2010 to 8.8 inches.  The largest individual was smaller at 9.6 inches compared to 10.5 inches in 2010.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate for Bluegill increased to 15.6 fish/hour from 9.9 fish/hour in 2010.  However, the average size decreased from 6.5 inches in 2010 to 5.1 inches in 2010.  The largest individual in 2021 was 7.8 inches, which was smaller than the largest Bluegill in 2010 at 8.2 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nThe catch rate for Largemouth Bass increased to 43.2 fish/hour in 2021, compared to the 6.6 fish/hour in 2010.  The average size also increased from 9.6 inches in 2010 to 11.4 inches in 2021.  The maximum size of the largest Largemouth Bass in 2021 was 20.5 inches, compared to 14.3 inches in 2010.  There were four Largemouth Bass 18 inches or longer in the 2021 survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate increased from 37.6 fish/hr in 2010 to 96 fish/hr in 2021.  However, the average size and maximum size decreased.  In 2010 the average length Yellow Perch was 6.6 inches and was 4.7 inches in 2021.  The maximum size in 2010 was 9.6 and the maximum size in 2021 was 8.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTen Green Sunfish were sampled in 2021 for a catch rate of 12 fish/hour.  The average length was 4.6 inches and the largest was 5.4 inches.  A White Sucker was sampled with a length of 20.7 inches.  One Northern Pike was observed while electrofishing, but was not netted. <br> \n <br> \nDissolved oxygen in the February 26, 2021 sampling event was excellent with oxygen levels above 9 parts per million throughout the entire water column.  Dissolved oxygen sampling on July 29, 2021 was less than the February sampling, but still able to support all game fish species down to 10 feet in depth.   Dissolved oxygen in July at the surface was 8.9 parts per million and dropped to 5.1 parts per million at 10 feet and at 11 feet dissolved oxygen was 1.1 parts per million which is lower than the requirements for most game fish.  Dissolved oxygen further declined to 0.1 parts per million near the bottom.   <br> \n</p>",

It has become popular with anglers in the Rochester area, particularly during winter.  The 2008 assessment was the first conducted on Silver Creek Reservoir.  The reservoir currently has good populations of yellow perch, black crappie, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  Yellow perch average 7.6 inches, black crapppie 8.9 inches, northern pike 23.4 inches and largemouth bass 8.1 inches.  The largest northern pike collected was 31.9 inches and the largest largemouth bass was 17.9 inches.  DNR Fisheries has not stocked Silver Creek Reservoir. <br> \n <br> \nThe City of Rochester conducted a signficant fishing access improvement project at the reservoir in 2008.  This included installation of a paved parking area, fencing and guard rails, and a paved walking trail around the dam and down to the reservoir.   <br> \n <br> \nHaverhill Township, where the lake is located, has implemented some usage restrictions on the reservoir.  The lake is open for angling from dawn until 7:00 pm and is closed during November for migratory waterfowl use.  The use of gas outboards is also prohibited.  </p>",
