                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is included in a walleye stocking study along with several other Minnesota lakes.  The study is designed to test the effectiveness of stocking fingerlings, frylings, or fry of various stocking rates.  Even with a high predator density, this lake has shown in the past that the stocking of small walleye fingerlings can be quite successful.  Walleye fry, however, had not previously been tested in this lake.  During the study, walleye fry were stocked in 2001 at 1,000 fry per littoral acre (141,000 fry).  This stocking appears to have resulted in a strong 2001 year class that still made up 20% of the total walleye sample in 2006.  These fish grew fast and now average over 19 inches in length.  The average size of all sampled walleyes in Eagle Lake was 18.0 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Walleye catch rates were similar to the past two Eagle Lake studies and the lake's historic mean at 8.3 per gill net. <br> \n <br> \nExcept for the final special assessment in 2008 (three years after the last experimental stocking), the study has been completed.  The lake's revised management plan (based on the success of the 2001 fry stocking) calls for walleye fry stocking at a rate of 141,000 fry annually, beginning in 2007.  If fry stocking continues to work well, it would be preferred to more expensive fingerling stocking.  However, if the 2011 fish population assessment shows that the long-range goal (at least 8.0 fish per set) for the walleye population in Eagle Lake is not being met, fingerling stocking would likely be resumed. <br> \n <br> \nFish species other than walleye will be studied more intensively during the 2011 assessment.  It should be noted, however, that the catch rate of northern pike was at an all-time high of 12.8 per set in 2006.  The pike averaged approximately 21 inches in length and 2.0 pounds in weight.  High densities of yellow perch in recent years may help to buffer pike predation on walleye.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake's fish community, like most, is constantly undergoing change.  Weather patterns, fishing pressure, shoreline development, fish stocking and other factors each play a part in the change.  Some of those changes are easily explained while others are not.Walleye numbers, for instance, have recently decreased despite walleye fingerling stocking during three of the past four years.  Conversely, northern pike numbers are up despite the discontinuation of pike stocking in 1982.  Greater numbers of pike are likely feeding upon stocked walleyes, especially since perch numbers are down.  Large northern pike and walleye remain available to Eagle Lake anglers.In addition, good numbers of large (over 7.0 inches) bluegills are present.  Even though Eagle Lake bluegills are slow growing (stunted) and abundant, a large proportion of the population consists of older fish.  Black crappie and largemouth bass are also popular angling targets.All lakes, but particularly small ones with increasing shoreline development, require responsible protection by riparian owners.  Protecting fish habitat like bulrushes, cattails and other aquatic vegetation can help to maintain water quality, fish populations, and property values.</p>",

At the present time it is supporting large populations of walleyes, black crappies, perch and common suckers.A strong three-year-old class of crappies should provide good fishing for this species for two or three years but may be followed by a period of poor crappie fishing before another dominant age-class enters the fishery.The large walleye population appears to be primarily the result of walleye stocking.  Spawning conditions for walleyes are considered as poor.</p>",

There has also been a large increase of pumpkinseeds, with a decrease of black crappies.Walleye fishing has been poor for the last few years.  Panfish are the most frequently caught and fished.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake has a diverse, warm water fishery best known for bass, panfish, and northern pike.  However, a moderate to good walleye fishery also exists in this lake.  Walleye spawning habitat is limited in Eagle Lake and this fishery is sustained by stocking. <br> \n <br> \nUnfortunately, like in many area lakes, large bluegills are no longer found in catchable numbers.  Bluegills over eight or nine inches were common in Eagle Lake in the three studies before 1970.  Only a few longer than seven inches were sampled in 2012.  Bluegill growth rates are slower than they were previous to 1970.  Special bluegill harvest regulations may have potential for restoring large fish in this lake if there is strong public support. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes sampled in 2012 were relatively large with an average weight of 3.0 pounds.  Over 62% of these walleyes were attributed to a single year class (2005) stocked as fingerlings during a stocking study.  Recent fry stockings have not been as successful as that of 2001 and a return to fingerling stocking is likely. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike, largemouth bass, and black crappie are also popular and relatively abundant angling targets in Eagle Lake.  Large fish of these species are not abundant, but can be found within these waters. <br> \n <br> \nEagle Lake's small size (312 acres) and increasing shoreline development make it potentially vulnerable to declining water quality and fish populations.  Watershed landowners can help maintain water quality and property values by using good land stewardship practices.  Anglers can help provide larger fish for catching by releasing medium sized fish.  Anglers are particulary encouraged to voluntarily release pike over 24 inches and keep smaller ones for eating.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Eagle Lake was conducted on August 30, 2022 by Detroit Lakes Area Fisheries Staff.  Data collected during this nearshore survey were combined with trap net and gill net data to calculate a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score for the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe FIBI Tool-4 was used for scoring and resulted in a FIBI score of 34.  The previous score for Eagle Lake was 33 in July 2017.  The impairment threshold score is 38, suggesting that the fish population in Eagle Lake does not meet expectations for lakes of similar characteristics, and the fish community of Eagle Lake is affected by disturbances within the watershed or along the shoreline of Eagle Lake.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 312-acre, class 31 lake located two miles west of Frazee.  The city of Frazee owns the park and public access on the southeast shore of the lake.  The south and west shores are heavily developed while the north and east shores are lightly developed, although there is a RV campground on the north shore.  There were 43 private homes or cottages and one resort with nine cabins in 2004. The lake mesotrophic with a Carlson's trophic state index in the upper forties. <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2014, Eagle Lake was stocked annually with Walleye fry.  Beginning in 2014, Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in even years.  The gill net catch rate of Walleyes in 2017 increased slightly to 3.5 fish per net.  Sampled Walleyes averaged 18.1 inches in length and ranged from 13.5 to 24.1 inches.  The 2014 year class comprised half of the sample.  If future stockings continue to be successful, the relative abundance of Walleye in Eagle Lake should continue to improve. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Northern Pike remained higher than the lake's historical mean at 10.3 fish per net.  The lake's historical mean catch rate is 6.8 fish per net.  Northern Pike were stocked frequently in this lake during the 1960's and 1970's when catch rates were low, but none have been stocked since 1982.  Northern Pike sampled in 2017 ranged from 13.7 to 30.1 inches in length with a mean of 20.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch rate of Bluegills set a new historical low of 5.5 fish per net.  The historical mean catch rate for Eagle Lake is 48.4 Bluegills per trap net.  Sampled Bluegill lengths ranged from 2.8 to 7.0 inches with a mean of 4.42 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOnly five Black Crappie were captured in trap nets and gill nets combined in 2017, however catches have historically been very low.  Largemouth Bass catch rates have also been very low.  Black Bullheads have not been caught in test nets since 1983.  Brown Bullheads are present in small numbers and Yellow Bullheads are abundant. <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota DNR Fisheries IBI program staff conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on Eagle Lake on 07/25/2017, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 30 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone(the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100ft), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50ft of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 83.3 (+/- 3.3) out of 100 possible. Approximately 46 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 75.8 (+/- 6.4), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 89.9 (+/- 1.6). The Score the Shore survey was designed to provide a means to quantify and compare lakeshore habitat between lakes. The Eagle Lake shoreline habitat score was higher than the statewide lake score average of 73.6. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 312-acre lake located two miles west of Frazee.  The city of Frazee owns the park and public access on the southeast shore of the lake.  The south and west shores are heavily developed while the north and east shores are lightly developed, with the exception of an RV campground on the north shore.  Submerged vegetation is common throughout near shore areas.  A standard fisheries survey was completed in August 2023 to assess the fish populations in Eagle Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find a high number of Northern Pike in Eagle Lake, however, most of these fish will be on the small side.  The catch rate of Northern Pike in the 2023 survey was the highest ever observed for Eagle Lake.  The average size of the pike captured was 20 inches, but one 36-inch pike was measured.  Walleye numbers were average for the lake and the size was good.  Almost 98% of the Walleye captured in 2023 were over 15 inches and 59% were over 20 inches.  Bluegill numbers were down for the lake and most of the fish were small.  Only one percent of the Bluegills caught in trap nets were over eight inches.  The longest Bluegill measured in 2023 was 8.5 inches.  Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were captured in low numbers in the nets, which is often the case with this sampling gear.  Black Crappie up to 13 inches were measured and Largemouth Bass up to 17 inches were captured.  Other fish species observed were Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Current test net data indicates that dramatic changes have taken place in the fish community of Eagle Lake since the 1988 survey.  Abundant northern pike and yellow perch populations appear to have collapsed, a very abundant bluegill population has expanded even further, largemouth bass trapnet catches have increased significantly, and the walleye population shows a major increase in abundance.  The increased walleye abundance can be attributed to fingerling stocking but a reason for the other population shifts is not readily apparent.The northern pike gillnet catch has declined from a high of 8.83/GN in 1988 to 0.83/GN in the current survey.  This is well below the first quartile for this lake class (#31).  Only five fish (2 three-year-olds, 2 five-year-olds, and one six-year-old) were taken in test nets during the current survey.  The three and five-year-olds exhibit fast growth while the six-year-olds growth is slow.  The only plausible explanation for such a dramatic decline in northern pike abundance is lack of recruitment, possibly through restricted access to spawning habitat by low water conditions or predation on YOY by the overabundant bluegills, although this is very speculative.Yellow bullheads are abundant.  Trapnet catches are between the first and third quartile for this lake class but gillnet catches are far above the third quartile.  The size distribution may be attractive to commercial fishermen.  Interestingly, black bullheads, although never abundant, have not appeared in test nets in the last two surveys.The current bluegill trapnet catch-rate of 130.10/TN is over double the third quartile value for this lake class and nearly double the previous survey's.  Bluegill trapnet catches have varied widely but have generally been very high since the late 1970's.  Size structure is poor, PSD=6 and RSD(8)=0, and growth rate is slow.  Overabundant and \"stunted\" would accurately describe the bluegill population.  Only in the earliest surveys, 1956 and 1969, when bluegills were below the first quartile for this lake class, was their growth rate good and size structure desirable.  Eight and nine inch bluegills were not uncommon.  Why the bluegills exploded in abundance in the late 1970's is not clear.  There appeared to be no significant changes in the rest of the fish community.  Selective angler harvest then becomes suspect.  Years of bluegill removal for stocking elsewhere has had no effect in reducing bluegill abundance.Largemouth bass did not appear in survey gillnets or trapnets until 1979, even though they had been stocked in earlier years.  The current survey suggests a significant increase in largemouth bass has recently occurred.  At 4.30/TN they are well above the third quartile for this lake class.  The majority of fish in the current survey were two-year-olds and all were under five years old, 85% were less than eight inches in length.  Their growth rate is average or slightly below.Black crappie trapnet and gillnet catches in the current survey declined from the modest interquartile catches of the last 20 years to a level that is now below the first quartile for this lake class.  Five of the six fish taken in test nets were three-year-olds and exhibit average growth.The gillnet catch-rate for yellow perch indicates a major decline in abundance, from 29.50/GN in 1988 to 6.67/GN in the current survey.  Increased predation from a greatly improved walleye population might be the first conclusion drawn.  However, a collapse of the northern pike population during the same period would seem to more than off-set any increased predation by walleyes.  It has been shown in some lakes that an abundance of sunfish can inhibit yellow perch populations.  This has not been the history of Eagle Lake however, where abundant bluegill and yellow perch populations have coexisted since the late 1970's.  Why the yellow perch have suddenly declined is puzzling.The current walleye gillnet catch of 15.33/GN is nearly three times the third quartile value for this lake class.  Major year classes coincide with fingerling stocking years.  Three-year-olds comprise 65% of the fish taken in test nets and exhibit average growth.  Fish greater than six years old exhibit below average growth.  The huge year-class of three-year-olds can be attributed to exceptional survival of the large number of 70/lb. fingerlings stocked in 1989, but why growth rates would improve in the face of declining yellow perch abundance is another puzzling aspect of this lake.  In any case, an excellent walleye population is now present with PSD=70 and RSD(20)=29.Lake surveys can often provide enough information to formulate basic cause and effect type relationships for changes in the fish community, even if all the factors and interrelationships are not fully understood.  This is not the case regarding the recent changes in Eagle Lake.  The number and magnitude of changes suggests a multitude of factors and complex interrelationships that defy easy analysis.  Let it suffice to say that walleye stocking has produced an excellent walleye population and outstanding opportunity for the angler at the present.  Also, that continued monitoring of the fish community may give us greater insight into the factors governing the changing fish community in Eagle Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake has a diverse warm water fishery best known for bass, panfish, and northern pike.  However, a good walleye fishery also exists in this lake.  Walleye spawning habitat is limited in Eagle Lake and this fishery is sustained by stocking.Unfortunately, like in many area lakes, large bluegills are no longer found in catchable numbers.  Bluegills over eight or nine inches were common in Eagle Lake in the three studies before 1970.  None longer than seven inches were sampled in 2004.  Bluegill growth rates are slower than they were previous to 1970.  Special bluegill harvest regulations may have potential for restoring large fish in this lake if there is public support.Walleye sampled in 2004 were relatively large with an average weight of 2.4 pounds.  Half of these walleyes were attributed to a single year class (2001) stocked as fry during a stocking study.  This was the first year since 1945 in which fry, rather than fingerlings or larger fish, were used to stock Eagle Lake.  Although the current lake management plan calls for continued stocking of walleye fingerlings, it may be more effective to stock walleye fry.Northern pike, largemouth bass, and black crappie are also popular angling targets in Eagle Lake.  Large fish of these species are not abundant, but can be found within these waters.Eagle Lake's small size (308 acres) and increasing shoreline development make it potentially vulnerable to declining water quality and fish populations.  Watershed landowners can help maintain lakes and property values by using good land stewardship practices.  Anglers can help provide larger fish for catching by releasing medium sized fish.  They are particulary encouraged to voluntarily release pike over 24 inches and keep smaller ones for eating.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff conducted a targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on July 27, 2017. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with one site sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at one sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including four species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) as well as one tolerant species (Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  The FIBI score for Eagle Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. </p>",
