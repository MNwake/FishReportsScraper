Fish were small, with less than a fourth over 6.0 inches in length.  Other sunfish species were present in low numbers and were even smaller than bluegill.  Black crappie numbers were on the low side of normal for this type of lake.  One-fourth of the fish captured measured 10.0 inches or more in length with the longest measuring 12.1 inches.Northern pike numbers were high, with less than a tenth of the fish measuring 25.0 inches or longer.  Largemouth bass numbers were high in nets but low in electrofishing.  Fish were small, with the longest measuring 14.3 inches.  Walleye were captured for the first time in this lake.  The fish were from an accidental 1992 stocking and were between 15 and 20 inches in length.Yellow bullhead were present in above average numbers while black bullhead were present on the low side of average for this type of lake.  Fish were of moderate size, with over a tenth at least 10.0 inches in length.  Carp were captured in low numbers.  Golden shiner numbers were low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>In comparison to other lakes in the region, Lake Josephine can be said to have high populations of white sucker, northern pike, black and brown bullhead, and white and black crappie.  Yellow perch exist in low numbers.  Yellow bullhead, carp and bluegill numbers appear average for lakes in this area.No stocking of northern pike has been done since 1975.  No fish aged can be traced to that (1975) year class.  The rather high population of northern pike is dominated by the 1977 and 1978 year classes.  Since no stocking has been conducted, natural reproduction, in some years at least, is sufficient to develop good populations.  Largemouth bass are said to have winterkilled to the point of elimination in 1969-70.  A stocking of adults was made in 1973.  The few young of the year bass found in 1981 are the result of this stocking.  Under present conditions of sparse vegetation, it is assumed that, while present, the bass population is not large.Bluegill numbers appear to have increased since 1971 and possibly since 1976.  The 1981 catch was similar in size pattern to the 1976 catch, consisting primarily of small fish.  The increase in population size is somewhat surprising due to lack of cover in the form of rooted vegetation.Black crappie numbers are high and are much higher than in 1976 but nothing like the levels found in 1971.  Most fish are small.  White crappie numbers probably reflect a change from the 1976 assessment, especially if one notes the much wider range of sizes and presence of smaller fish in 1981.  White crappie were not found in either the 1963 or 1971 surveys.  They may have been introduced in the 1972 stocking.Black and brown bullhead appear to have increased in population size since 1976.  Black bullhead in particular show many more age classes and smaller average size.  Populations of both black and brown bullhead appear much reduced since 1971 but not since 1976.  Very few age classes are present.  Low levels of yellow bullhead are not surprising in turbid lakes of poor water quality.Carp catches in 1981 and 1976 are remarkably similar.  In both years the catch is much smaller than1971 when many small carp were present.  All three recent nettings indicate there is probably a higher carp population than in 1963.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>There are 118 acres covered by the waters of Lake Josephine.  About 68 percent of the lake's area, or 81 acres, is less than 15 feet deep.  The maximum depth is 44 feet and the median depth is 8 feet.  A moderate growth of submerged aquatic vegetation consisting mainly of sago pondweed, coontail, muskgrass, and Berchtold's pondweed is supported by the hard (total alkalinity) lake waters.  Soils of the lake bed in shallow water appear to be 50 percent silt over a gravelly sand, 40 percent sand, and a 10 percent gravel-rubble-sand mixture.  A secchi disc lowered into the lake could not be seen beyond the 3-foot depth.  There are 3 inlets and an outlet all of which were dry at the time of the survey.  Two of the inlets originate from storm sewers.  A small lowland area is present along the inlet on the north lake shore and there is a lowland in the vicinity of the lake's outlet.  The small unnamed lake on the southeast corner of Lake Josephine has a cattail lowland.At the time of the lake survey 58 boats and 55 suburban homesites were noted.  A Ramsey County bathing beach and picnic area exists on the east shore.  However, no public boat launching area is present.  Fishing pressure is judged to range from light to moderate.Test nets revealed that golden shiner, northern pike, yellow bullhead, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, and black crappie were taken in numbers that exceeded their respective state-wide medians.  Few white sucker, carp, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, and pumpkinseed were netted.</p>",

Northern pike are common, but of average size.  No pike larger than 30\" were sampled.  Largemouth bass were sampled in average abundance, but small size.  Only one largemouth larger than 16\" was sampled.  The walleye catch was average for this lake type, but the 2012 catch rate was the highest for this lake since recent walleye management was initiated in 1997.   The average size of the walleye harvested was 19\" long and weighed 2.5 lbs.  Yellow bullhead were abundant, and of average size.  Yellow perch, white sucker, carp and other sunfish species were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

Yellow perch, carp, and black bullhead were found at near median levels.  Yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, bluegill, and black crappie were found at above local median abundance.  Largemouth bass were also sampled, and natural reproduction verified by shoreline seining.  Carp abundance has remained relatively stable over the last four netting samples.  Northern pike have dropped significantly in abundance since the 1986 netting, probably due to the effects of the last three years of drought.  Northern pike average weight has increased from the previous netting.  Bluegill have doubled in abundance since 1976, although the median size has changed from 4.5\" to 5.5\".  The PSD for bluegill was 15.7 in 1991.  The average size of black crappie is small (less than 8\") although some larger individuals were sampled.</p>",

The average length sampled was only 5.46 inches. Only 27% of the bluegills sampled exceeded 6 inches in length. Black crappie numbers continue to be low for this type of lake. They ranged in size from 5 to 13.4 inches, but only 2 exceeded 10 inches in length. Pumpkinseed, green, and hybrid sunfish were each sampled in average numbers, but are small in size. Yellow bullhead are quite abundant and individuals over 13 inches are present. Black bullhead are present in low numbers. Northern pike were sampled at the highest level for this lake. The average northern pike captured had a length slightly over 21 inches. Nearly 10% were over 25 inches. Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers, but were small. Walleye are not abundant in Lake Josephine. The few walleye that were sampled measured between 11.97 to 21.0 inches in length. The walleye stocking strategy for this lake was changed in 2001 from fry stocking to fingerling in an effort to increase the population. By stocking 6 to 8 inch fingerlings losses due to panfish predation can be eliminated, but larger predators can still be a concern.  </p>",

They ranged from 4.5 to 7.8 inches with none exceeding 10 inches. Pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled in average numbers. Hybrid sunfish were sampled in their highest numbers since 1967. Green sunfish were sampled in above average numbers. All three species exhibited small average sizes. Yellow bullhead are abundant with fish exceeding 12 inches available. Black bullhead are present in low numbers. Northern pike were sampled in the second highest level for this lake. The average northern pike captured had a length over 22 inches. Over 17% were larger than 25 inches. Largemouth bass were sampled in high abundance but were small. The walleye population continues to be low in Lake Josephine. Only 4 walleye total were sampled.        </p>",

Many of the northern pike were affected with \"red sore\" disease and were also in poor condition.  Small carp, 7 to 12 inches in length, were caught in large numbers in the gillnets.  Many dead suckers, northern pike and bullheads were seen on the shoreline.  Most of the bluegills and apparently all of the largemouth bass were eliminated by the partial winterkill of 1969-70.</p>",
