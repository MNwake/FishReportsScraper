A fish population survey was conducted to assess the fish community.\n\nThe majority of the fish community consisted of black and yellow bullheads and black crappie including some over 10 inches.  Some riverine species were observed including golden redhorse and white sucker indicating periodic connectivity to the Upper Iowa River.  The sand pit holds potential for a nice fishing location close to town.</p>",

The sand pit was electrofished once and three trap nets were set over one night to assess fish community structure.  This assessment was the first fisheries sampling ever conducted on LeRoy Sand Pit.The following species were collected in order of relative abundance:  black crappie, white crappie, largemouth bass, carp, golden redhorse, green sunfish, white sucker, yellow bullhead.  Age data taken from the first three species indicated that largemouth bass are reproducing and that three year old fish dominate the populations of both crappie species.  Multiple age groups for the crappie populations also suggest a level of natural reproduction for these species as well.  A temperature/ dissolved oxygen profile taken at the deepest point (14 feet), indicated that the sand pit was only weakly stratified.  Dissolved oxygen levels appear to be adequate to support fish life throughout the growing season.     </p>",
