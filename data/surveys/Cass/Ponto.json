                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Ponto Lake was conducted on July 2, 2018 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing and a 50-foot seine were used to sample ten stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blacknose Shiner, Burbot, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Burbot, and Smallmouth Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The primary reason for this assessment was to collect a late summer gillnet sample of northern pike, yellow perch and walleye.  The previous two assessments were conducted during June, while the earliest were during August.  Through time, even though there was consistent natural reproduction of walleye, the gillnet CPUE had declined considerably.  It was felt this decline was at least partially attributed to June sampling versus August sampling.The 1992 gillnet CPUE of walleye was 3.9 compared to 1.8 in 1989.  This catch rate is within the interquartile range and greater than the median value for Lake Class 23 lakes.  Between electofishing and gillnetting, all age classes of walleye up to 9 were sampled.  The strongest year classes were years when no walleye stocking took place.  Eighty-one percent of the walleye sampled were the result of natural reproduction; the remaining 19 percent would be the result of walleye stocking and/or natural reproduction.The northern pike gillnet CPUE remains high; greater than the third quartile value for Lake Class 23 lakes.  There are  quality fish present in Ponto (RSD-P = 8), but the majority of the sample collected are small fish (RSD S-Q=74).The yellow perch gillnet CPUE of 1.9 was equivalent to the first quartile value.  Historically, the yellow perch gillnet CPUE has been greater than the third quartile value.Though the 1992 gillnet CPUE of walleye is somewhat lower than during 1950 and 1976, the present abundance is characteristic of other Lake Class 23 lakes.  Natural reproduction is excellent and all age classes are present.  The apparent increase in abundance of small northern pike and the decrease in abundance of yellow perch may be responsible for the decrease in the gillnet CPUE of walleye.Night electrofishing during May captured 28 largemouth bass, for a catch rate of 20.2 per hour.  These fish ranged in length from 6.5 to 18 inches and exhibited PSD and RSD-P values of 25 and 8.  The growth rate of these fish was well above the average rate for Lake Class 23 lakes in this area, averaging 9.2 inches long at the formation of their third annulus.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ponto Lake (DOW # 110234) is a 347-acre lake located east of Backus, MN.  A public access is located on the southeast shore just north of State Highway 84.  Ponto Lake has a maximum depth of 60 feet, and 29% of the surface area is littoral (less than 15 feet).  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota\u0019s lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Ponto Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally very clear, very deep, have a low percentage of shallow water area, and have a very irregularly shaped shoreline with many bays or points.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in the 2009 sampling in Ponto Lake was similar to that found in other lakes of this ecological type.  Fish from 8 to 28 inches were sampled in MNDNR test nets.  Walleye naturally reproduce in Ponto Lake; however the lake is also currently stocked with walleye fingerlings.  Both the number and average size of northern pike in Ponto Lake is good; sampled fish ranged from 12 to 35 inches and had an average length of 20 inches.  The bluegill population is comparable to other lakes of this type, and fish up to 8.2 inches were found, however most of the bluegill are small.  Black crappie from 7 to 11 inches were collected in DNR test nets.  Yellow perch were scarce in the 2009 Ponto Lake sample.   <br> \n <br> \nThe abundance of largemouth bass in Ponto Lake compared favorably with other lakes of this type, and largemouth from 6 to 18 inches were found.   Other species sampled in 2009 included  black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), hybrid sunfish,   largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n   <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Ponto Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ponto Lake (DOW# 11-0234; Lake Class 23) is a 388-acre lake located near Backus, MN. A DNR owned public access is located on the southeast shore. Ponto Lake has 4.56 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 60 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Ponto Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class tend to be deep, have a low percentage of area less than 15 feet deep, have hard water and be very clear. <br> \n <br> \nPonto Lake is a diverse multi-species fishery that offers something for all anglers. Northern Pike are abundant with fish up to 35 inches. Walleye numbers are similar to other lakes in this class. The majority of Walleye sampled in 2015 were harvestable sizes (14-19 inches). Black Crappie and Bluegill also can offer opportunities with decent numbers of quality-sized fish. While few Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass were sampled due to sampling limitations, quality opportunities are still available to anglers targeting bass. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. No aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Ponto Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ponto Lake is a 388-acre lake located northeast of Backus, Minnesota. A DNR owned public access is located on the southeast shore. Ponto Lake has 4.53 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 60 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Ponto Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class tend to be deep, clear, have a low percentage of littoral area (less than 15 feet deep), and hard water. Other area lakes in this class include Baby, Mule, Grave, and Jack. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike, and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPonto Lake has an abundant population of Northern Pike (9.0 fish per net) with an average length and weight of 20.0 inches and 1.7 pounds. Northern Pike lengths ranged from 11.5 to 36.5 inches.  Bluegill were low in abundance (4.1 fish per net) and small in size, with the majority below 6.0 inches. Bluegill ranged in length from 3.0 to 7.7 inches. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 7.3 to 19.5 inches, with an average length and weight of 12.4 inches and 1.2 pounds. Walleye were moderately abundant (3.6 fish per net) with an average length and weight of 19.4 inches and 2.4 pounds. Walleye lengths ranged from 13.9 to 23.1 inches. Black Crappie were abundant (3.9 fish per net). Lengths ranged from 5.2 to 14.0 inches with a mean length and weight of 10.2 inches and 0.7 pounds. Other species sampled included Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Yellow Bullhead, Yellow Perch, Rock Bass, and Pumpkinseed. No Smallmouth Bass were sampled in 2018 but they are present in the lake.    <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. No aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Ponto Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ponto is a 347-acre lake located nine miles northeast of Backus, Minnesota.  The lake has a maximum depth of 60 feet with 29 percent of the lake less than 15 feet deep.  A state-owned public access is located at the southeast end of the lake.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Ponto is in Lake Class 23.  Other local lakes in this classification include Big Deep (7 miles southeast of Hackensack), Stony (3 miles northeast of Hackensack), and Mule (6 miles southwest of Longville).  Walleye abundance during the 1996 survey was greater than most lakes in this class and higher than most previous surveys.  Sampled walleye had a good size distribution, with fish in every inch group from 11 through 23 inches.  Ponto Lake has good natural reproduction with all ages of fish from one to nine years old found during the survey.     Abundance of northern pike during the 1996 survey was greater than most lakes in this class and similar to previous surveys on Ponto Lake. Northern pike sampled in the 1996 netting ranged from 7.4 to 31.5 inches.  Large northern pike were not abundant in this lake, though growth rates were similar to rates in other local lakes in this class.The number of yellow perch per survey net in the 1996 survey was about average for lakes in this class, and was similar to the two most recent surveys.  Sampled yellow perch had an average length of 7.9 inches and a maximum length of 11.3 inches. Few black crappie were sampled in the 1996 survey.Bluegill abundance was low when compared to other lakes in this class and previous surveys. Growth of Ponto Lake bluegill was slow; average length at age 5 was 3.7 inches.  However, many bluegill sampled in the 1996 netting were large enough to be acceptable to most anglers: about half of them were in the 6- or 7-inch categories.Largemouth bass up to 16.5 inches long were sampled by night electrofishing in June 1996.  Largemouth growth rates in Ponto Lake were similar to growth rates of other Class 23 lakes in this area. Largemouth bass had an average length of 11.9 inches at age 4 in Ponto Lake.Other species sampled by netting included white sucker, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, burbot and rock bass.A 1950 lake survey reported that there were 40 cabins and 2 resorts on the shoreline of Ponto Lake.  By 1969, the resorts were no longer present, but 120 cabins were counted.  The 1996 survey found 131 lake homes or cabins around Ponto Lake.   To maintain quality fish populations in Ponto Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or re-establishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife, help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by humans, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters. They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young. Protection of the Ponto Lake watershed is also needed to maintain water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve quality fishing by practicing catch and release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Ponto Lake and provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ponto Lake is a 347-acre lake located 2 miles north and 8 miles east of Backus, Minnesota.  A public access is located on the southeast shore just north of State Highway 84.  The Minnesota Dept. of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Ponto Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class generally have hard water, are very deep and clear, and have a low amount of lake area less than 15 feet deep.  This lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike and secondarily for bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.  Ponto Lake has an abundant population of naturally reproducing walleye. The average length of these walleye was 17 inches, and the largest sampled was 27 inches.   Northern pike were also abundant, averaged about 18 inches long, and had a maximum length of 37 inches.  Ponto Lake has a good population of largemouth bass, and fish up to 16 inches were sampled.   Bluegill, black crappie and yellow perch are available for anglers, however numbers sampled in the 2002 assessment were low. Other fish species sampled during this population assessment include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Ponto Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ponto Lake is a 388-acre lake located northeast of Backus, Minnesota. A DNR owned public access is located on the southeast shore. Ponto Lake has 4.53 miles of shoreline, 102 littoral acres and a maximum depth of 60 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Ponto Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class tend to be deep, clear, have a low percentage of littoral area (less than 15 feet deep), and hard water. Other area lakes in this class include Baby, Mule, Grave, and Jack. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike, and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate was below the management goal despite even-year stocking of fingerlings. Walleye lengths ranged from 14 to 23 inches. Northern Pike were caught at moderate rates and were within the management goal range for the first time since 2009. Sampled Northern Pike ranged in length from 16 to 29 inches. Bluegill were caught at moderate levels and were generally small. The Bluegill catch met the management goal and fish ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches. Black Crappie were caught at moderate levels and met the management goal. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 5 to 14 inches. Largemouth Bass were abundant with fish up to 19 inches sampled; management goals are based on spring electrofishing which was not conducted. Only three Smallmouth Bass up to 14 inches were sampled. Yellow Perch catches remained below the management goal but doubled from consecutive historically low catches during 2009-2018.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in Ponto Lake include, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Ponto Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
