                "narrative": "<p>Warner Lake is located two miles west of Clearwater in eastern Stearns County. It has a surface area of 27 acres and a maximum depth of 38 feet. The watershed is large and primarily agriculture, forest, pasture, and wetland. Water quality is good, especially given the large watershed; July water clarity was over eight feet. A total of 21 species of aquatic plants were found and the near shore area is mostly covered with emergent and floating-leaf vegetation, especially waterlilies. The lake is surrounded by a county park with no residential development. A nature center and boat ramp are located on the north end of the lake. The last survey was in 2002. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in numbers within the expected range for similar lakes and nearly the same as in 2002. Average length (21 inches) and weight (two pounds) were also similar to 2002. The largest northern pike was 30 inches long. Growth was fast, reaching 20 inches in three years and nearly all northern pike were one or three years old. Anglers can help improve the fishery by releasing larger fish (>24 inches) and keeping smaller northern pike to eat. <br> \n <br> \nDaytime electrofishing for largemouth bass in May resulted in a catch rate of 16/hr. This is less than the Montrose median for daytime electrofishing of 38/hr and less than the 2002 catch of 29/hr. Average length was 13 inches and the largest individual was 19 inches. Twenty-nine percent of adult largemouth bass were longer than 15 inches. One smallmouth bass was also caught. Anglers are encouraged to help improve the fishery by practicing catch and release for largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates have been low in all surveys. The 2012 catch was lower than 2002, but within the expected range for similar lakes. Average length (6 inches) and weight were low and the largest individual was 9 inches. Black crappie growth was slow. The bluegill catch rate was low, but within the expected range for similar lakes. Past catches have been higher, ranging from six to 29 per trap net. Bluegill average length was over six inches and the largest individual was eight inches. Young bluegill grew quickly, reaching five inches at age two, but growth for older fish was average, reaching seven inches at age five. Most bluegill were four to six years old. <br> \n <br> \nA few large channel catfish, one small walleye, and one yellow perch were also caught during the survey. Other species included: bigmouth buffalo, hybrid sunfish, yellow bullhead, and white sucker. Warner Lake is connected to the Mississippi River via Plum Creek, which may account for the presence of bigmouth buffalo, channel catfish and walleye.</p>",

No adult Largemouth or Smallmouth Bass were sampled however 10 young of the year Largemouth Bass and 5 young of the year Smallmouth Bass were sampled by shoreline seining. Bluegill abundance was similar to 1983 levels and the local median. Ages 2 and 3 were most abundant and growth was good. Abundances of White and Black Crappie were near the local first quartile and the catch of Black Crappies in 1983 was 8.0/trap net. No Yellow Perch were taken in this survey though they were present in low numbers in 1983. Other species collected were: Bowfin, Common Carp, Black Bullhead and several forage species.</p>",

Panfish abundances are low for Pumpkinseed (0.5/trap net) and hybrid sunfish (0.3/trap net), average for Bluegills (28.8/trap net) and White Crappies (2.5/trap net), and high for Black Crappies (8.0/trap net). For the last three species, 3-4 age classes were sampled and only Black Crappie growth was below average Yellow Perch abundance (3.5/gill net) is be low the local median but other forage appears abundant. The Common Carp population (2.0/gill net) is at least average for this area. White Suckers and Silver Redhorse numbers appear about average also.

                "narrative": "<p>Warner Lake is located in eastern Stearns County, one mile west of Clearwater.  It has a surface area of 28 acres and a maximum depth of 38 feet.  The lake is unique in that it lies almost entirely within a Stearns County park, and has little development along the shoreline.  Plum Creek flows through the lake, and connects it with the Mississippi River two miles downstream.  As a result, the fish community includes several species typically found in rivers.  Gas-powered motors are prohibited on the lake, but a boat ramp is available for public use.  A fishing pier is also located within the county park.A survey was conducted in 2002 to assess fish populations, and included spring electrofishing and summer netting (trap nets, gill nets, and seines).  Catch rates were compared to lakes with similar characteristics as a way to evaluate the fish populations of Warner Lake.  Catch rates were also compared to past surveys on Warner Lake (most recently in 1989), to historic trends in the fishery.  The survey also included water chemistry analysis, watershed mapping, and an aquatic plant survey.Warner Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and panfish, and catch rates of these species were within the normal range in 2002.  Northern pike were mostly medium-sized, with an average weight just under two pounds.  Bluegill and black crappie were small, on average.Bass populations were sampled by electrofishing in spring.  Twenty largemouth bass and two smallmouth bass were captured.  The largemouth bass catch rate was lower than average for the area.  Four walleye were caught during spring electrofishing, but none were caught during summer sampling.  There is not appropriate spawning habitat within Warner Lake for walleye, and none have been stocked.  However, walleye are probably able migrate into the lake from Plum Creek or the Mississippi River, or spawn within Plum Creek.A large number of small buffalo were caught during the 2002 survey, which was unusual.  Several other species were also sampled, but in low numbers: bowfin, carp, redhorse sucker, white sucker, yellow perch, and black, yellow and brown bullheads. Despite a large watershed that drains into Plum Creek and through Warner Lake, water quality is relatively good.  Submerged plants grow as deep as ten feet, indicating that water clarity remains favorable throughout the summer.  A diverse mixture of emergent and upland species is also present along much of the shoreline.</p>",
