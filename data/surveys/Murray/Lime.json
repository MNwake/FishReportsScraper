                "narrative": "<p>Lime is a 338 acre lake located on the edge of Avoca in Murray County.  The lake is 7 feet deep and has just over 4 miles of shoreline.  A partial winterkill was suspected during the winter of 2000 and 20001.  Lime is presently managed for northern pike as the primary species while yellow perch are managed secondarily.  There is a public and a county access located on the lake.Lime lake has a fair northern pike population compared to other lakes like Lime.  The lengths of northern pike sampled during our survey ranged from 17 to 33.5 inches and averaged almost 24 inches.  High water during April and May of 2001 may have helped the northern pike population spawn successfully.  Northern pike fry were also stocked during the Spring of 2001.  This could mean good northern pike fishing in the future.The yellow perch population in Lime is down and could be due to the partial winterkill during the winter of 2000 and 2001.  No perch were sampled during our assessment.Black bullhead numbers are good in Lime and should provide a bullhead fishery for people interested in bullheads.  There were good numbers of bullhead in the 8 to 11 inch range.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Lime Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lime Lake is a shallow 316-acre lake adjacent to the City of Avoca in Murray County. Due to its shallowness (maximum depth of 5.0 ft.), Lime Lake has been highly vulnerable to winterkill.  Historically, Lime Lake has been managed as a Northern Pike and Yellow Perch fishery because of the extensive network of wetlands that were connected upstream of the lake (Big Slough), which provided ideal spawning areas for Northern Pike, and because these species tend to have a higher tolerance of hypoxic conditions. Primary management species include Northern Pike and secondary management species include Yellow Perch. A targeted survey was conducted during the week of May 22, 2019 to monitor fish populations using 6 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates have varied from 0.6 per trap net in 1992 to 3.1 per trap net in 2007 and have averaged 1.5 per trap net since 1987.  The 2019 catch rate was 0.8 per trap net, which is within expected catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (0.1 to 0.9 per trap net).  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 21.8 to 28.4 inches and averaged 23.5 inches.  Although trap net catches indicate that the Northern Pike population may be within the expected range for numbers in Lime Lake, it is unknown how effectively trap nets sample Northern Pike in late May because it was post spawn. It is possible that the netting may be underestimating the abundance of pike in Lime Lake. Evidence from brood fish collections in the spring suggests that the Northern Pike population is more abundant than observed in this survey, as 150 to 200 northern pike are collected in 1 to 2 days annually. Lime Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the new Northern Pike zone regulations, so the limit is two and they must be 24 inches or longer to be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nOne 5.4 inch Yellow Perch was sampled in the survey, triggering stocking of pre-spawn adult Yellow Perch in the spring of 2020.  Catch rates of Yellow Perch have ranged from 0.0 per trap net in 2001 to 4.2 per trap net in 1997 and have averaged 1.7 since 1987. Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo (0.8 per trap net), Black Bullhead (12.3 per trap net), Black Crappie (0.3 per trap net), Common Carp (4.7 per trap net), and White Sucker (1.3 per trap net).  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lime Lake, adjacent to the City of Avoca, covers 316 acres and has a maximum depth of seven feet.  It has a history of low oxygen levels, having been opened to liberalized fishing 18 times since 1950.  Because of shallowness and low oxygen levels, the lake is managed for northern pike and yellow perch, which are more tolerant of these conditions.  The lake is the source of Lime Creek, which is directly connected to the West Fork of the Des Moines River.  This has allowed fish populations to rapidly re-establish after winterkill with very little stocking.  An aeration system consisting of three \"Ice Eaters\" was installed for the winter of 1997-98.  Unfortunately, most often the species that are quickly re-established are less desirable (common carp, and black bullhead).  Due to shallowness, only trap nets were used to conduct the survey. <br> \n <br> \nLime Lake has provided good angling for yellow perch, northern pike, and occasionally black crappie in past years.  Yellow perch numbers have remained relatively high with no perch stocking since 1982, indicating that good spawning habitat exists.  Northern pike numbers, after declining during the drought period of the late 1980's, are coming back with the return of sufficient water levels. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population is on the rise when compared back to the early 1990\u0019s.  The northern pike trap net catch rate was 3.1 per set during the 2007 survey.  The trap net catch rate was 1.8 in 2001 and 1.4 in 1997.  Because we take adult northern pike from Lime for broodstock, the lake is stocked annually with northern pike fingerlings.  Lengths of northern pike caught in trap nets ranged from 13.4 to 27.5 inches averaged18.6 inches.  Lime Lake was stocked with northern pike adults in 2004 and 2007 while northern pike fingerlings were stocked in 2006 and 2007.  The adults stocked were from the rearing ponds, which were stocked with adults in the spring.  Five consecutive year classes starting in 2001 were observed during the survey indicating good natural recruitment.  Age-1 fish represented 55 percent of the northern pike sampled. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population is also doing quite well in Lime Lake.  The yellow perch trap net catch rate was 3.2 in 2007 compared to 0 in 2001 and 4.2 in 1997.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in trap nets ranged from 5.4 to 10.1 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLime Lake has a high black crappie population with some very nice sized black crappie present.  The black crappie trap net catch rate 23.9 in 2007 compared to 0 in 2001 and 1.3 in 1997.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 3.8 to 14.0 inches and had an average length of 10.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead and common carp numbers were down substantially from the surveys conducted in 2001 and 1997.  It is hopeful that if this trend continues, a resurgence of vegetation and improved water quality will occur.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining indicated natural reproduction of bigmouth buffalo, black crappie, channel catfish, orangespotted sunfish, quillback, and yellow perch.  Other fish sampled during the survey included green sunfish, white crappie, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and fathead minnow.  <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Lime Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lime Lake,  adjacent to the city of Avoca, covers 316 acres and has a maximum depth of 7 feet.  The lake has a history of low oxygen levels.  Because of shallowness and low oxygen levels, the lake is managed for northern pike and yellow perch, which are more tolerant of these conditions.  The lake is the source of Lime Creek which is directly connected to the West Fork of the Des Moines River.  This has allowed fish populations to rapidly reestablish after winterkill with very little stocking.  The lake was last officially stocked in 1987 with adult northern pike.Yellow perch appear to be targeted most often by anglers on Lime Lake.  Local reports and news  photos have documented good yellow perch angling the past three winters, with some fish over a pound.  Lime Lake's yellow perch numbers are considered above average and have increased since the 1992 and 1987 assessments.  Perch collected in trapnets ranged from 5?-13 inches, with an average length just under 9? inches.  With consistent natural reproduction, excellent size and age structure, and the installation of an aereator in 1997, Lime Lake should provide good perch angling for many years to come.   Northern pike are the primary management species in Lime Lake.  A catch rate of 1.4 fish/trapnet indicated a moderately dense population of northern pike were present.  These fish ranged in length from approximately 22-37 inches.  They had an average length of 27? inches, and an average weight near 5? pounds.  With the good growth rates present in Lime Lake, due to abundant perch and sucker forage, anglers could expect some hefty northern pike being caughtin the future.Black bullhead numbers were considered average compared to similar lakes in our area.  Black bullheads collected in trapnets ranged from 3-12 inches long, with an average length of 8 inches.A small black crappie population persists on Lime Lake, but trapnet catch rates have remained well below average compared to similar lakes.  Although numbers of black crappie are typically low, average size of these fish was 10 inches.To promote and maintain healthy fish popoulations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, water quality of Lime Lake through watershed management.  Improved land use practices will help insure this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

Due to its shallowness (maximum depth of 5.0 ft.), Lime Lake has been highly vulnerable to winterkill.  The winter of 2022-2023 proved to be harsh, as dissolved oxygen levels in Lime Lake were less than 0.7 for most of the winter.  Historically, Lime Lake has been managed as a Northern Pike and Yellow Perch fishery because of the extensive network of wetlands that were connected upstream of the lake (Big Slough), which provided ideal spawning areas for Northern Pike, and because these species tend to have a higher tolerance of hypoxic conditions during winter. Primary management species include Northern Pike and secondary management species include Yellow Perch. A winterkill check was done on May 15, 2023, using boat electrofishing to determine the extent of the winterkill and the impacts on the fish community of Lime Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nLime Lake had seven species of fish present in the 2019 targeted survey.  In the 2023 winterkill check, three species were sampled including Bigmouth Buffalo (45.4 per hour), Black Bullhead (5.9 per hour), and Fathead Minnow (493.7 per hour).  While several species of dead fish were observed at ice-out, Lime Lake likely suffered a partial winterkill that affected species vulnerable to low dissolved oxygen such as Channel Catfish and crappie.  Northern Pike fingerlings (280) were stocked in the fall of 2023 to reestablish a predator base in Lime Lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nLime Lake is a shallow 316-acre lake adjacent to the City of Avoca in Murray County. Due to its shallowness (maximum depth of 5.0 ft.), Lime Lake has been highly vulnerable to winterkill which has resulted in it being opened to liberalized fishing 18 times since 1950. An aeration system is operated on Lime Lake to reduce the likelihood of winterkill, thereby stabilizing fish populations. Historically, Lime Lake has been managed as a pike/perch fishery because of the extensive network of wetlands that were connected upstream of the lake (Big Slough), which provided ideal spawning areas for northern pike, and because these species tend to have a higher tolerance of low oxygen conditions. Primary management species include northern pike and yellow perch. Northern pike fingerlings are stocked annually at a rate of 10 fish per acre, because Lime Lake is used as a brood source for northern pike rearing activities. The yellow perch population is self-sustaining, as yellow perch have not been stocked in the last decade. Black crappie adults were stocked in 2003 to supplement the existing population, but have not been stocked since. A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 17, 2013 to monitor fish populations using 12 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nCatch rates of northern pike in Lime Lake have varied from 0.6 per trap net in 1992 to 3.1 per trap net in 2007, averaging 1.6 per trap net over that time period. The 2013 northern pike catch rates decreased from the previous survey, going from 3.1 per trap net in 2007 to 0.9 per trap net in 2013. Northern pike ranged in length from 20.0 to 25.6 inches and averaged 22.8 inches. Northern pike were skinny indicating that foraging success may be negatively affected by the turbid water present in Lime Lake. Although trap net catches indicate that the northern pike population may be down in Lime Lake, it is unknown how effectively trap nets sample northern pike during mid-June, and may be underestimating the true abundance of pike in the lake. Evidence from MN DNR brood fish collection in the spring suggests that the northern pike population is more abundant than observed in this survey, as 150 to 200 northern pike are collected in 1 to 2 days annually. Annual stocking of northern pike fingerlings should continue to help supplement the existing population.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nThe 2013 yellow perch catch rate of 0.25 per trap net was below the expected range of catch rates (0.3 to 3.8 per trap net) for similar lakes. Yellow perch catch rates have varied from 0.0 per trap net in 2001 to 4.2 per trap net in 1997, and averaged 1.9 per trap net since 1987. Yellow perch ranged from 5.8 to 6.1 inches and averaged 5.9 inches. Sixty-eight young-of-the-year (just hatched in the spring) perch were sampled in a near shore seining and backpack electrofishing survey on July 1, 2013, indicating that some natural reproduction occurred. Yellow perch populations tend to fluctuate, where years of high catch rates are followed by years of low catch rates; therefore, the low catch rate observed in 2013 was not alarming and should not adversely impact the yellow perch population.   <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE  <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates have varied from 0.0 per trap net in 2001 to 23.9 per trap net in 2007, and have averaged 5.3 per trap net since 1987. In 2013, black crappies were captured at a rate of 1.9 per trap net which is within the expected catch range (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net) for lakes similar to Lime Lake, but was a drastic decrease in catch rate since 2007 (23.9 per trap net). Similar to yellow perch, black crappie populations tend to be highly variable where a strong year class is produced every 3-5 years, often resulting in a boom or bust fishery. Lime Lake black crappies were large in 2013, having an average length of 10.5 inches, with the largest crappie being 12.6 inches in length. Twenty-two percent of crappies sample were 12 inches or bigger. It appears that Lime Lake has a relatively stable population of black crappies that is self-sustaining and could provide an additional angling opportunity in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance has steadily declined in Lime Lake, ranging from a high catch rate of 544.3 per trap net in 1987 to a low of 11.4 per trap net in 2013, averaging 146.5 per trap net over that time frame. The 2013 catch rate of 11.4 per trap net was below the expected range (11.5 to 132.6 per trap net) of catch rates for lakes similar to Lime Lake, indicating that bullhead numbers may be low. Black bullheads were relatively small, ranging in length from 5.9 to 10.2 inches and averaging 7.6 inches. The extreme turbidity in Lime Lake coupled with the potentially low abundance of black bullheads may be some of the factors affecting the weights of northern pike, as black bullheads are an important prey resource for northern pike in southern Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nCOMMON CARP <br> \nCatch rates of common carp prior to 2007 commonly exceeded the expected range of catch rates (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net) for similar lakes, as catch rates ranged from 7.3 per trap net in 1987 to 31.0 per trap net in 2001 and averaged 20.1 per trap net from 1987 to 2001. In 2007 and 2013, the catch rates fell to expected levels at 3.0 and 4.8 per trap net, respectively. Common carp size structure was large as lengths of common carp ranged from 13.3 to 30.0 inches and averaged 19.7 inches. The carp population in Lime Lake appears to be well established as multiple year classes were present.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nThree walleyes were captured in 2013 which is the first time that they have been documented in Lime Lake. The walleyes ranged from 15.6 to 16.8 inches and averaged 16.1 inches. Lime Lake is connected to the West Fork of the Des Moines River via Lime Creek, which is likely how walleyes moved into the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth buffalo were captured at a rate of 1.7 per trap net in 2013, which is high compared to similar lakes. Bigmouth buffalo ranged in length from 16.8 inches to 25.8 inches and averaged 21.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included channel catfish (0.4 per trap net), white sucker (0.3 per trap net), and yellow bullhead (0.1 per trap net).  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",
