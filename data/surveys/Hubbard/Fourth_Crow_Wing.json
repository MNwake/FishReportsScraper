                "narrative": "<p>Fourth Crow Wing Lake is located eight miles South of Nevis in southern Hubbard County.  Fourth Crow Wing is part of a chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Fourth Crow Wing Lake has a surface area of 441 acres and a maximum depth of 10 feet.  A public access is located on the east shore of the lake off West Island Lake Road.  Boating access is also available through a narrow channel from Third Crow Wing Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Fourth Crow Wing Lake is in Lake Class 39.  Class 39 lakes are generally shallow with a high littoral area (less than 15 feet in depth), and a regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 39 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: First Crow Wing, Ham, Hennepin, Loon, Minnie, Paine, Peysenski, Portage, Shallow, Upper Twin, Hungryman and Stocking. <br> \n <br> \nFourth Crow Wing Lake supports a healthy panfish population and can provide good fishing for Bluegill, Black Crappie and Yellow Perch.  Bluegills were sampled in good numbers, similar to past surveys. Anglers will find most Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 5.5 - 9 inch size range, with an average length of 7.2 inches.  The Black Crappie catch rate was down, and on the low end when compared to other local lakes.  Crappie size averaged 9.2 inches, with fish up to 12 inches sampled.  Yellow Perch were sampled in average numbers.  Most fish ranged from 5.5 to 8.5 inches, with a few approaching 9.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSampling showed Largemouth Bass were a very good size, but in fairly low numbers. They were an average length of 18.7 inches, with fish sampled over 20 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find a very abundant population of Northern Pike in Fourth Crow Wing Lake.  Northern Pike were an average length and weight of 19 inches and 1.7 pounds, with the largest measured at 35 inches in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nFourth Crow Wing Lake was listed in 2011 as infested with faucet snails, an aquatic invasive species (AIS).  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fourth Crow Wing is a 479 acre lake located in southern Hubbard County, eight miles south of Nevis.  Fourth Crow Wing is a very shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 10 .0 feet.  Due to its shallow depth, Fourth Crow Wing has abundant growth of both submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation such as wild rice, hardstem bulrush, and water lilies.  There is a public access located on the east shore.  The Crow Wing River connects Fourth Crow Wing to Third Crow Wing and boating between these two lakes is possible with small to medium craft.  There is a dam below Fifth Crow Wing Lake that prohibits boat travel between these two lakes.  There is a canoe portage around the dam. <br> \n <br> \nFourth Crow Wing is a popular panfish and northern pike lake.  Anglers can expect to find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie abundance was up from recent surveys, with decent numbers in the 9-11 inch size range.  Northern pike were sampled in high numbers (10.6/gillnet), similar to past surveys.  Abundant northern pike spawning habitat of shallow submerged and flooded aquatic vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of pike in Fourth Crow Wing.  Anglers will find lots of small, \"hammer handle\" pike in Fourth Crow Wing.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 20.2 inches and 2.1 pounds, with pike measured up to 32.2 inches.  Fourth Crow Wing also supports a decent largemouth bass population and provides a popular option for anglers.  Walleye were sampled in very low numbers (0.1 walleye/gillnet), down from past surveys.  No stocking is done on Fourth Crow Wing.  Other species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead, and moderate numbers of brown bullhead, and shorthead redhorse.  Black bullhead, rock bass, and carp were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fourth Crow Wing is a 479-acre lake located in southern Hubbard County, eight miles south of Nevis.  Fourth Crow Wing is a very shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 10.0 feet.  Due to its shallow depth, Fourth Crow Wing has abundant growth of both submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation such as wild rice, hardstem bulrush, and water lilies.  There is a public access located on the east shore.  The Crow Wing River connects Fourth Crow Wing to Third Crow Wing and boating between these two lakes is possible with small to medium craft.  There is a dam below Fifth Crow Wing Lake that prohibits boat travel between these two lakes.  There is a canoe portage around the dam.Fourth Crow Wing is a popular panfish and northern pike lake.  Anglers can expect to find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, down from past surveys.  Bluegill and black crappie exhibited good growth rates when compared to other area lakes.  Northern pike were sampled in high numbers, similar to past surveys.  Abundant northern pike spawning habitat of shallow submerged and flooded aquatic vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of pike in Fourth Crow Wing.  Anglers will find lots of small, \"hammer handle\" pike in Fourth Crow Wing.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19.5 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleye were sampled in low numbers, down from past surveys.  No stocking is done on Fourth Crow Wing.  Other species sampled included high numbers of white sucker and yellow bullhead, and moderate numbers of brown bullhead, bowfin (dog fish), and shorthead redhorse.  Black bullhead, rock bass, and carp were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

The average weight  was 1.9 pounds with 88% in the 15 to 22 inch range.  Natural reproduction, recruitment or migration make up the stable population as the lake is not stocked.  Northern pike abundance and mean weight have also been stable.  Their average size sampled in 1994 was 1.9 pounds and 19.4 inches.  Largemouth bass were not sufficiently sampled with standard survey gear to assess their abundance, growth, or size structure.  Black crappies sampled were from multiple year classes with 16% greater than 10.0 inches.  Bluegills sampled have a nice size structure with 98% over 6.0 inches and 20% 8.0 inches or better with a maximum of 8.7 inches.  Yellow perch abundance is about average for lakes in this class and should provide an excellent forage base.  Ten percent of the yellow perch sampled were over 8 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Fourth Crow Wing Lake was conducted beginning on July 1st, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but five stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at five stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 20 species of fish including six species that were intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and zero that were tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from the week of June 3rd, 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead and Common Carp).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Fourth Crow Wing Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

It has a maximum depth of only 10 feet, yet because of the water flowing through it there has never been a \"freeze out\".  It has heavy growth of wild rice around most of the shoreline.  Bulrush and cattail are also very common.Species of fish taken in numbers greater than the statewide indices were: white sucker, northern pike, walleye, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, and bluegill.  There are on this lake at the present time one resort with seven units, two private cottages, 13 resort boats, and 6 private boats.There were nine fish houses located on this lake during the winter of 1962-63.  There is no public access on this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fourth Crow Wing is a 440.6 acre lake located in southern Hubbard County, eight miles south of Nevis.  Fourth Crow Wing is a very shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 10 feet.  Due to its shallow depth, Fourth Crow Wing has abundant growth of both submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation such as wild rice, hardstem bulrush, and water lilies.  There is a public access located on the east shore.  The Crow Wing River connects Fourth Crow Wing to Third Crow Wing allowing boating access between the two lakes.  There is a dam below the Fifth Crow Wing Lake that prohibits boat travel between these two lakes.  There is a canoe portage around the dam, and 6.5 miles of river between Fifth and Fourth Crow Wing. <br> \n <br> \nFourth Crow Wing is a popular Panfish and Northern Pike lake.  Anglers can expect to find good numbers of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 9-12 inch size range.  Abundant Northern Pike spawning habitat of shallow submerged and flooded aquatic vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of pike in Fourth Crow Wing.  Anglers will find lots of small, \"hammer handle\" pike in Fourth Crow Wing.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 19.3 inches and 1.6 pounds, with pike measured up to 28.9 inches.  Anglers will find a low to moderate Largemouth bass population in Fourth Crow Wing when compared to other lakes in the Crow Wing chain.  Anglers have reported catching large bass in the lake.  Present and past surveys have shown Fourth Crow Wing to have a low Walleye population.   Other species sampled included high numbers of White Sucker, and moderate numbers of Bowfin (Dogfish), Yellow Bullhead, and Shorthead Redhorse.  Brown Bullhead, Black Bullhead, Greater Redhorse, Hybrid Sunfish, and Common Carp were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nNo aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Fourth Crow Wing Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",
