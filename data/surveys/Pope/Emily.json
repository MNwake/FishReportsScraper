                "narrative": "<p>Lake Emily has a large biomass of underutilized species (carp, white sucker, bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead), and an excellent northern pike population. Northern pike had a gillnet index of 16.25/gillnet and a mean size of 2.32 lbs. Growth rate for northerns was excellent with 3 year old fish averaging over 23 inches. The largest northern sampled was over 35 inches long. Despite the high northern pike indices, yellow perch were also abundant. Gillnet catches were 37.25/gillnet. The RSD-10 for the yellow perch sampled was 43. The high RSD number in conjunction with the high net catches suggests a fishable population. Walleye recruitment is limited and is probably the result of a walleye run from another lake. Black and white crappie are both present in the lake. Some of the black crappie sampled were in the 14- 15 inch range.  All species of fish aged had extremely good growth typical of shallow, fertile winterkill lakes.</p>",

The normal range of mean catch ratesfor lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics is 2.3 - 18.1 fish/gillnet.  Mean weightof fish captured in 1995 was 2.1 pounds.  Approximately 75% of the fish were 15 inches in length orgreater and 20% exceeded 20 inches in length.  Downstream migration from Lake Minnewaska, upstreammigration from the Chippewa River, and natural reproduction are possible explanations for the increasein walleye abundance.   The extent of walleye management in Lake Emily is limited to the stocking offry in 1993.  Northern pike are also abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 16.5 fish/net, more thandouble the normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes.  Gillnet catches averaged 16.3 fish/netin 1987.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1995 was 1.8 pounds.  Yellow perch gillnet catches averaged27.0 fish/net in 1995, compared to 37.3 fish/net in 1987.  The normal range of mean catch rates fromsimilar lakes is 2.7 - 25.0 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.3 pounds.  Electrofishingyielded 8.0 largemouth bass per hour.  Fish ranged from 13.0 - 18.0 inches in total length.  Meanweight of fish captured was 1.8 pounds.  The abundance of other sunfish is also limited.  There islittle aquatic habitat to support these species.  Non-game species such as black bullhead, common carp,and bigmouth buffalo are abundant.  Commercial fishermen seine the lake during winter months on aregular basis.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Emily, located southwest of Starbuck, is a shallow, eutrophic lake.  The lake is quite shallow with a pretty consistent depth of five feet throughout the lake.  There are very few areas with aquatic vegetation.  Emergent and submergent vegetation is limited to the far east end of the lake.  Water quality is consistently poor with a summer secchi reading of 1.5 feet.  Sediments are continually re-suspended by the wind.  The substrate is predominately sand with patches of gravel, rubble and silt mixed in.Lake Emily can provide terrific walleye fishing both during the winter and summer.  A catch rate of 26.6 fish/gillnet is up from 19.9 fish/net in 1995.  Mean weight of these fish is 1.2 pounds.  The average length is 14.8 inches with the biggest fish going just over 28 inches.  Several very strong year classes from 1997 and 1998 should provide quality fishing for several years to come.  Locals have had the best success trolling floating Shad Raps and using live bait on Lindy rigs.  Ice anglers target the east end of the lake for good action.Northen pike are also a favored quarry of anglers although their numbers have declined to 7.1 fish/gillnet from 16.5 fish/net in 1995.  There is still quality fishing to be had with the fish averaging 21.2 inches and the largest fish going 30.7 inches.  These fish can be located throughout the lake but ice anglers target the east end of the lake.Another fish to try catching is the black crappie.  Their numbers are up and there are some dandies.  These fish averaged 11.1 inches with the largest fish measuring just shy of 13 inches.    Look for these fish around submerged trees and along the vegetation on the east side.Something unique in our area is the channel catfish in Lake Emily.  These fish averaged 21.7 inches with a mean weight of 4.3 pounds.  The largest fish measured over 28 inches.  They are a great fighting and eating fish.  Shore anglers have good early success along the public access beach.  Stink bait or cut bait seems to work the best.Duck hunters should take note of Lake Emily.  Hunting can be very good with late season mallards stopping over each year.  The points and the far east end are the best bets. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Emily is a shallow 2,377-acre, highly-productive basin located in southwestern Pope County.  Maximum depth is 6 feet.  Despite a low average depth, winterkill events have been rare.  Groundwater exchange, springs, and combined stream flows in the Little Chippewa River and from Lake Minnewaska help sustain adequate dissolved oxygen levels to support fish life during winter months. Notable habitat changes are evident in Lake Emily in probable response to infestations of aquatic invasive species that include curly-leaf pondweed, Eurasian water milfoil, and zebra mussels.  Water transparency has increased to exceed 3 feet in recent years.  Eurasian water milfoil can form dense stands in the east end of the lake and a great expansion of submergent plants within western portions of the basin has occurred as well. Such habitat changes have potential to reshape fish community structure.\n  \nIn June 2022 a standard fish survey was completed to gain current information on the Lake Emily fish community.  Walleye remained moderately abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 6.7 Walleye/net, which is similar to the last survey in 2016, but lower than average for Lake Emily.  Average size of sampled Walleye was over 16 inches with a maximum length of 24 inches.  Growth was rapid with Walleye reaching 16 inches by age 3.  Walleye fry are stocked in even-numbered years to supplement the fishery.  However, aging analysis determined that at least 82% of the Walleye caught during the 2022 survey were from non-stocked years, indicating natural recruitment is currently driving this fishery. Also, while fish movement in and out of Lake Emily definitely occurs, it appears Walleye movement downstream from Lake Minnewaska is likely minimal.  Large year classes are sporadic in both systems and large year classes observed in Lake Minnewaska do not show up in Lake Emily.  An example of this occurred recently.  A large year class of Walleye from 2019 has been observed in several surveys in Lake Minnewaska, and this year class currently dominates the Walleye population in Lake Minnewaska.  At the same time, the large and dominant year class in Lake Emily is from 2020.  While Walleye fishing reports have recently improved in both of these systems, it is not a result of Walleye movement, but instead separate success of different year classes in each system.\n\nLargemouth Bass and Bluegill abundance is increasing in Lake Emily likely due to changing habitat conditions that include increasing water transparency and submergent vegetation.  Catch rates for both species were much higher than any previous surveys. Most of the bass ranged from 12 to 17 inches, with the largest being 18 inches.  Most of the Bluegill were younger and smaller fish. Only a few Bluegill over 8 inches were sampled, but growth rates are fast and many of those smaller fish should be over 8 inches within two years.\n\nLake Emily supports both Black and White Crappie populations and some hybridization of crappies has also been documented.  Black Crappie were sampled in moderate numbers.  Captures averaged 11 inches.  White Crappie were less abundant.  Only one White Crappie was captured during the survey.  Both species grow fast in Lake Emily and can reach impressive sizes.  A few crappies over 15 inches were observed in many surveys.  Northern Pike catches remain modest. Pike captures averaged 27 inches and the largest Northern Pike measured was almost 33 inches.\n  \nLake Emily also supports a unique fishery within the Glenwood Fisheries Management Area, as it is the only lake that supports a fishable population of Channel Catfish.  Channel Catfish and an occasional White Bass have been documented in Lake Emily for a long time, but Channel Catfish catch rates have increased over the last several surveys.  Average size of Channel Catfish was 23 inches and over 4 pounds.  No White Bass were observed in the 2022 survey.  White Bass have maintained a low population abundance in Lake Emily.  \n\nLake Emily is designated as infested with Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels.  Eurasian watermilfoil was first found in Lake Emily in 2014.  The lake is downstream of Lake Minnewaska and was thus added to the infested waters list for zebra mussels in 2012.  Significant habitat changes are occurring following these infestations.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to other lakes.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Emily is a shallow 2,377-acre, highly-productive basin located in southwestern Pope County.  Maximum depth is 6.0 feet.  Despite a low average depth, winterkill events have been rare.  Groundwater exchange, springs, and combined stream flows in the Little Chippewa River and from Lake Minnewaska help sustain adequate dissolved oxygen levels to support fish life during winter months. <br> \n   <br> \nNotable fish habitat changes were evident in Lake Emily in 2016.  A Eurasian water milfoil infestation in the east end of the lake has greatly expanded.  Whether coincidental or a causative response to a more recent infestation of zebra mussels, less wind-induced suspension of fine sediments because of expanded plant growth, or a greater proportion of available phosphorous being tied up in rooted plant growth rather than green algae, water transparency has increased to exceed 3.0 feet.  Extensive submergent plant growth was evident and common throughout the remainder of the basin.  Abundant aquatic vegetation negatively affected recreational opportunities and methods of fishing.  Bacterial decomposition of plant matter under periods of ice cover may also increase threat of winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nA fisheries survey was completed in June of 2016.  An electrofishing survey was conducted during the day on June 2 to gain estimates of Largemouth Bass abundance and population size structure.  The netting component of the standardized survey was completed June 6-9, 2016.  A combination of eight gill nets and 15 trap nets were used to describe fish community attributes.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye remained moderately abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 6.5 Walleyes/net, which represents a decrease in estimated population abundance from that of the 2010 survey.  Average size of captures was 16.9 inches with a maximum length of 28.2 inches.  Growth was rapid with Walleye reaching 16.0 inches by age 3.  Age distribution of captures extended to age 10.  Walleye fry are stocked in even-numbered year to sustain a fishery.  Cohorts of seven age groups were delineated in the catch, whichconfirmed that fry stockings are supplemental to some inconsistent natural reproduction or immigration via the Little Chippewa River.  Lake Emily supports both Black and White Crappie populations.  Some hybridization of crappies was also documented.  Black Crappie were sampled in moderate numbers.  Captures averaged 11.6 inches.  White Crappie proved to be less abundant.  Only six White Crappies were captured during the netting survey.  Average size exceeded that of Black Crappie at 13.3 inches.  Northern Pike catches were modest at an average catch rate of 5.5 fish/gill net.  Pike captures averaged 21.8 inches.  The largest Northern Pike measured exceeded 34.0 inches.  Largemouth Bass and Bluegill persist in Lake Emily but these gamefishes are not yet abundant due to harsh habitat conditions that include poor water transparency and the past paucity of submergent vegetation.  These populations may benefit from greater water clarity and increasing aquatic plant diversity and coverage within the lake. <br> \n <br> \nLake Emily supports a unique fishery within the Glenwood Fisheries Management Area.  It is the only lake that supports a fishable population of Channel Catfish.  Channel Catfish and an occasional White Bass are believed to have moved into Lake Emily from the Minnesota River system.  Channel Catfish catches during the 2016 survey approached that of Walleyes and Northern Pike with an average catch rate of 5.0 catfish/gill net.  Average size of Channel Catfish captures was 21.6 inches and 3.7 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nA single White Bass was caught during the survey.  The first capture of White Bass occurred in 2010.  White Bass have maintained a low population abundance in Lake Emily.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Emily is designated as infested with Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels.  These infestations are relatively recent.  Eurasian watermilfoil was first found in Lake Emily in 2014.  The lake is downstream of Lake Minnewaska and was thus added to the infested waters list for zebra mussels in 2012.  Significant habitat changes are occurring following these infestations.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to other lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This nearshore survey was conducted during summer 2016 to assess populations of non-game species and small game fish using backpack electrofishing and seining.  Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 23 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Emily.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nTwenty-three species were collected during this survey, indicating a relatively diverse nearshore fish community.  Two species (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter) were considered \"intolerant\" and five species (Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, and Orangespotted Sunfish) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Emily.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Emily is a large (2,377 acres), shallow lake located in southwestern Pope County.  Maximum depth is approximately six feet.  Despite shallowness of the lake, winterkill has been limited to infrequent partial fish losses.  Groundwater exchange, springs, and flowage from the Little Chippewa River and Lake Minnewaska are likely very important in maintaining sufficient dissolved oxygen levels to support the fish community.  At present, water quality and clarity is poor due to wave-induced suspension of sediment and algal blooms during summer months.  In addition, a significant nutrient load is delivered to the lake from the Little Chippewa River.  Because of degraded conditions and loss of vegetative habitat the lake presently supports relatively abundant numbers of carp, buffalo, freshwater drum, black bullhead, and white sucker.Existing game fish in Lake Emily are walleye, northern pike, and black crappie.  Walleye gill net catches averaged 5.0 fish per gill net lift, which is within the range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics.  Numerous consecutive age classes are represented in assessment gear even though supplemental stocking occurs on a biennial basis.  There is opportunity at this time to catch larger northern pike in Lake Emily.  Fish larger than 26 inches comprised the majority of fish sampled in the 2005 assessment.  Although not seen in large numbers in assessment gear (2.7/TN lift), black crappie are present and grow rapidly.  The majority of fish sample were between 8.0 to 10.0 inches in the 2005 lake survey, with numerous fish over 12 inches in length.   Channel catfish are also found in Lake Emily. The lake supports the only channel catfish fishery within the Glenwood management area.   Fish ranged from 16.0 to 24.0 inches in assessment gear. Gill net catches averaged 4.0 fish per gill net set.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Emily is a large (2,377 acres), shallow lake located in southwestern Pope County.  Maximum depth is approximately six feet.  Despite shallowness of the lake, winterkill has been limited to infrequent partial fish losses. Groundwater exchange, springs, and flowage from the Little Chippewa River and Lake Minnewaska are likely very important in maintaining sufficient dissolved oxygen levels to support the fish community.  At present, summer water quality and clarity is poor due to wave-induced suspension of sediment and algal blooms.  In addition, a significant nutrient load is delivered to the lake from the Little Chippewa River.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye net catches averaged 31.0 fish per gillnet lift, which greatly exceeds the average catch rate from lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics. Two-year-olds accounted for 73% of the walleye population sample.  These juvenile walleye averaged 11.8 inches at age 2.  Numerous consecutive age classes are represented in assessment gear which indicates some natural reproduction occurs.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches averaged 3.7 fish/gillnet.  Lengths ranged from 13 inches to 33 inches. Mean weight of northern pike captured was 2.4 lbs. Black crappie net catches averaged 5.3 fish per gillnet. Average size of black crappie was small since most captures were young fish (ages 1 and 2). Black crappie grow rapidly in Lake Emily and they should recruit to a harvestable size in 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Emily is unique within the Glenwood management area as it is the only lake that currently supports a channel catfish fishery. Netted channel catfish lengths ranged from 15 to 24 inches with a mean weight of 3.5 lbs. White bass are a recent addition to the fish community.  The species  has moved upstream from the Minnesota River.  A single specimen was netted during the current survey. Angling reports indicate they have been present for several years.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and largemouth bass are present in Lake Emily.  Abundance is limited due to their dependence on rooted vegetation. A species tolerant of poor water quality, white crappie, are abundant with a catch of 7.6 fish per trap net.  Mean size is small, although a few captures exceeded 12 inches in length. Other species captured in the fish community assessment include, bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, brown bullhead, common carp, freshwater drum (sheepshead), shorthead redhorse, white sucker and yellow perch.  <br> \n</p>",
