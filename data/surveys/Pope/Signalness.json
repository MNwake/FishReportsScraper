                "narrative": "<p>Mountain (Signalness) Lake is a small, shallow basin located within the boundaries of Glacial LakesState Park.  The lake has a maximum depth of 13 feet which makes the fish community prone towinterkill.  Fishing is a popular activity for park visitors and angling success is closely related tothe frequency and severity of winterkill events.  The last winterkill occurred during the winter of1988-89.  The lake was re-stocked with adult largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie in the springof 1989.  Walleye fry were also stocked in the spring of 1989.  Northern pike have been resilient to the occasional partial winterkill that has limited other gamefishspecies in Mountain Lake.  Northern pike  gillnet catches averaged 14.0 fish/net in 1994.  Catch rateshave ranged from 7.5 - 15.0 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1978.  The normal range of meancatch rates for lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics is 4.5 - 11.3 fish/net.  Thelength-frequency distribution of fish captured in gillnets is dominated by fish in the 14 -21 inchlength group.  Average weight of fish captured was 1.7 pounds.  Small bluegill are abundant in MountainLake.  Trapnet catches averaged 56.7 fish/net in 1994.  Only 12% of the fish captured were 6.0 inchesin length or greater and no fish exceeded 8.0 inches.  Average weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds. This poor size structure is the result of the winterkill in 1988-89.  Age-3 and 4 fish were the onlyyear classes represented in the catch.  These fish represent the first year classes produced by theadult broodfish stocked after the winterkill.  This size structure should improve in the near futurebecause the fish are experiencing rapid growth.  Black crappie catches averaged 1.8 fish/trapnet and3.3 fish/gillnet.  As with bluegill, age-3 and 4 fish comprised the entire sample of captured fish. Accordingly, the size structure of the population is poor.  Fish were between 5.0 and 8.5 inches intotal length.  These two year classes of black crappie are experiencing poor growth.  Largemouth bassare present and may be an important component of the fish community, however there is no data to assessthe status of the population.  Electrofishing was not conducted in 1994 because of time constraints andlack of suitable access for a large boat.  Yellow perch gillnet catch rate averaged 8.0 fish/net in1994.  Gillnet catches have been consistent in the past two surveys, averaging 7.0 fish/net in 1986 and6.5 fish/net in 1990.  Average weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.  One walleye was captured in thethree gillnets.  It was 22.5 inches in total length and weighed 3.8 pounds.  This fish was age-5 which corresponds to the fry stocking in 1989.  White sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, and hybrid sunfish werealso captured in survey nets.  The absence of inlets and outlet has restricted the number of non-gamefish species in Mountain Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Catch rates for most species were well below those recorded in the 1986 survey.  Low catch rates were expected due to the severe winterkill during 1988-89. Total weight of fish captured decrease from 23.5 lbs/gill net to 12.5 lbs/gill net.  Northern Pike abundance reflected catch rate of 7.5 fish/gill net. Mean weight of fish captured was 1.36 lbs.  All fish captured were 15.0 to 19.0 inches in total length.  This results in a PSD of 0.0%.  Growth of Northern Pike is slightly below average with age 3 fish reaching 17.1 inches in length lack of suitable spawning habitat may be limiting Northern Pike abundance.  No Walleye were captured during the 1990 population assessment.  Fry were stocked in 1989 at a rate of 480/littoral acre (25,000 fish). These fish may have been too small to be caught in the sampling gear at the time of the assessment.  Bluegill catch rates averaged 1.66 fish/trap net.  This compares to catch rates of 39.0 fish/trap net and 6.5 fish/trap net in 1978 and 1986, respectively.  The five Bluegills captured in the present survey were in the preferred- memorable length category (8.0-10.0 inches).  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.70 lbs.  Size distribution probably reflects stocking of adult fish in 1989 and 1990.  Bluegill PSD was also elevated in previous years. A PSD of 86% was calculated in 1986, a year in which trap net catches averaged 39.0 fish/net night.  Black crappie catch rates averaged 2.33 fish/trap net. The seven fish collected measured between 8.5 and 10.5 inches in length.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.54 lbs.  Yellow perch catch rate was 6.5 fish/gill net.  This is similar to the 7.0 fish/gillnet captured in 1986, however the catch rate exceeded 85 fish/gill net in 1978.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1990 was 0.12 lbs.  PSD was calculated at 0.0%.  Atypically, the PSD was 62.0% in 1978, a year in which catch rate averaged 85.5 fish/gill net.  Rough fish are not present in Mountain Lake.  One Yellow Bullhead was collected in 1978, but no bullhead have been taken in the two latest surveys.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mountain (Signalness) Lake is a small, shallow basin located entirely within the boundaries of GlacialLakes State Park.  The lake has a maximum depth of 13 feet which makes the fish community prone towinterkill.  The last winterkill occurred during the winter of 1988-89.  An aeration system waspurchased by the Section of Fisheries in 1997 to prevent winterkill on Mountain Lake.  Anglers shouldnote that a State Park Vehicle Sticker is required to enter the park and that only non-motorized boatsare allowed on Mountain lake.  Electric trolling motors are allowed.Fishing is a popular activity for park visitors.  Northern pike and sunfish are very abundant andprovide consistent action for most anglers.  The average size of these species tends to be small. However, the size structure of fish captured during the lake survey in 1999 was quite respectable. Largemouth bass are also present and should provide some quality angling opportunities.  Mean weightof fish captured was almost two pounds.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in recent years toprovide a \"bonus fishery\".  Only two fish were captured in test nets during the lake survey in 1999. The park manager reported that several walleye were caught by anglers in recent years.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Signalness Lake was conducted over several days between August 3-17, 2020 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured five species of fish including Bluegill, Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey was completed to monitor nongame fish species reintroduction efforts initiated in May 2020. These reintroduction efforts, led by MNDNR Parks and Trails staff and an independent fish contractor, involved translocation of five species (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Least Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) from nearby Union Lake into Signalness Lake, which is located in Glacial Lakes State Park. This was the first of three years where translocations from Union Lake to Signalness Lake are planned to reestablish these populations that were historically present. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough none of the reintroduced species were sampled during this targeted survey, several factors may have influenced this outcome. This was the first year of reintroduction efforts; therefore, the five species have not yet had sufficient time to become established. In addition, the combination of steep shorelines that contained abundant coarse woody habitat and vegetated shorelines that contained soft sediments limited sampling effectiveness overall. Alternative sampling methods should be considered during future surveys if the objective is to confirm whether these species have become established. For example, nighttime sampling did result in detection of Blacknose Shiners in Signalness Lake following the 2020 reintroduction efforts.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Signalness (Mountain) Lake is a small, shallow basin located within Glacial Lakes State Park. Because this basin is located within state park boundaries, a vehicle permit is required to enter the park and access this lake. A fishing license is not required to fish Signalness Lake if you are a Minnesota resident. Public access is located on the west side of the lake but boating is restricted to electric motors only. Canoe and other watercraft rental is available. A fishing pier and small swimming beach are also located on the southwest shoreline of the lake. Both are popular spots for park visitors during summer months. An aeration system is operated in the winter to prevent winterkill, the last of which occurred in 2009.\n\nWalleye fingerlings and yearlings have been stocked to produce a ?bonus' fishery for park visitors but few have been sampled in the past. However, the 2021 survey showed a significant improvement (5.5/gill net) in Walleye abundance and should provide a good opportunity to catch Walleye in Signalness Lake. Walleye ranged in length from 16.5 to 26.1 inches but most were large, averaging 22.4 inches. \n\nAnglers should have no trouble catching Bluegill, but catching quality size fish may be difficult. Bluegill are extremely abundant (116.1/trap net) but the size structure appears to be stunted. The majority of fish (73%) sampled were under 5 inches. A few large Bluegill can still be found, with the largest sampled being 8.9 inches. While most Bluegill are young, size structure is not likely to improve in the coming years with slow growth and early maturation. Few Black Crappie were sampled (3.0/gill net), but this was higher than all previous surveys. Most crappies were young, with an average length of 7.3 inches. The largest crappie sampled was 11.9 inches.\n\nSimilar to recent surveys, Northern Pike continue to be abundant (14.0/gill net). However, size structure is poor (46% below 22 inches) with a maximum length of only 26.5 inches. Anglers are encouraged to harvest small Northern Pike. New Northern Pike regulations were implemented in 2018 to increase size structure. Signalness Lake is in the North-Central Zone, where all pike from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Anglers can keep 10 pike, but not more than two can be longer than 26 inches. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches, or two larger than 26 inches. For more information see: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/pike/index.html.\n\nA moderate number of Largemouth Bass were sampled (25/hour), a slight increase from the 2015 survey. Bass were at sizes that would be of interest to anglers. Average and maximum lengths were 14.9 and 19.2 inches, respectively. Too few Yellow Perch were sampled to make any meaningful conclusions. Other species sampled were Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed. \n</p>",

However, two of the twenty Northern Pike sampled were over 27 inches. They have a good size distribution but are probably considered undesirable to the fishermen because of Black Spot Disease (Neascus). Bluegills are present in sufficient numbers and sizes to benefit the State Park's family fishery. No Largemouth Bass were sampled during the survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mountain (Signalness) Lake is a small, shallow basin located within the boundaries of Glacial Lakes State Park.  The maximum depth of the lake is 13 feet, which makes it prone to partial winterkill.  The last partial winterkill occurred during the winter of 2000-2001.  An aeration system was operated after dissolved oxygen levels dropped below 3.0 ppm, however oxygen levels continued to fall.  Only a small refuge developed in the open water created by the aeration unit.  Bluegill and largemouth bass experienced the highest mortality.  Sampling efforts in the spring of 2001 detected relatively abundant northern pike and black crappie, but largemouth bass were not captured and bluegill numbers were limited.  Pre-spawn adult largemouth bass were stocked in 2001.Fishing is a popular activity for park visitors.  Survey results from 2004 indicate that most of the fish species have rebounded from the partial winterkill in 2001.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and yellow perch are present in good numbers and should provide ample fishing opportunities.  Most of the bass are small, but should reach desirable sizes in a few years.  Black crappie and bluegill catches were low, however a lot of smaller fish were observed in the shallows.  Catches of these species can be expected to increase in the near future. Mountain Lake provides ample spawning habitat for these species.    Three walleye were captured in survey nets.  Fish ranged from 12.7 to 15.7 inches in total length.  Walleye fingerlings and yearlings have been stocked periodically since 1996 to create a bonus fishery for park visitors.  Anglers have reported catching walleye to park staff.   A State Park Vehicle Sticker is required to enter the park and only non-motorized boats are allowed on the lake.  Electric trolling motors are allowed.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Signalness (Mountain) Lake is a small, shallow basin located within the boundaries of Glacial Lakes State Park.  Because this basin is located within state park boundaries, a vehicle permit is required to enter the park and access this lake.  A fishing license is not required to fish Mountain Lake if you are a Minnesota resident.  A public access is located on the west side of the lake.   Canoe rental is available.  Motorized watercraft are restricted to use electric motors only.    A small fishing pier and swimming beach are also located on the southwest shoreline of the lake.  Both are popular spots for park visitors during summer months.  <br> \n  <br> \nMaximum depth of Mountain Lake is 13.0 feet, which makes it prone to partial winterkill.  Anecdotal reports from park staff and previous survey results suggest the last major winterkill event occurred during the winter of 2008-2009.  This partial winterkill event substantially reduced gamefish abundance and degraded the lake's fishery.  Restorative stockings of adult Largemouth Bass occurred in 2010.  A permanent aeration system was installed in 2012 to help reduce the threat of winterkill and minimize the negative impacts these events have on the fish community. <br> \n     <br> \n2015 survey results indicate the fish community has rebounded since the 2008-2009 winterkill event.  Sunfish (Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed) are now abundant but since most are young fish, average size is relatively small (less than 6.0 inches for all three species).  Black Crappies are present but abundance is low.   Only one crappie was captured during the 2015 survey.  The Largemouth Bass population continues to rebound following re-stocking.  Current abundance is considered low to moderate but natural reproduction is now occurring.  Future increases in bass abundance are likely as this population continues to expand.   Northern Pike are very abundant.  Mean size was just 21.3 inches and 2.5 pounds, but pike exceeding 30.0 inches were caught.  Walleye have been stocked to diversify fishing opportunities, but these maintenance stockings have not been very successful in increasing Walleye abundance.  Only one Walleye was captured during the 2015 survey.  This fish measured 16.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2015 included Golden Shiner and Green Sunfish.  The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2021. <br> \n</p>",

A public access is located on the west side of the lake but boating is restricted to electric motors only.  Canoe rental is available.  A small fishing pier and small swimming beach are also located on the west side of the lake.  Both are popular spots for park visitors during summer months. <br> \n   <br> \nMaximum depth of the lake is 13.0 feet, which makes it prone to partial winterkill.  Anecdotal reports from park staff and 2009 survey results suggest a partial winterkill event occurred during the winter of 2008-2009.  The previous partial winterkill event occurred early in 2001.  These winterkill events have negatively impacted the fish community, especially largemouth bass and bluegill populations.  Fishing is a popular activity for park visitors but it will likely be a few years before the fish community rebounds from winterkill events.  The 2009 survey results indicated good numbers of northern pike and yellow perch but both populations were dominated by smaller individuals.  Bluegill and black crappie abundance was limited.  Average size of captured bluegill was 6.5 inches.  Black crappie averaged 8.4 inches in length.  Electrofishing efforts yielded only one juvenile bass.  This species will be restocked in the near future to restore bass fishing opportunities.  Only one walleye was collected in survey nets.  Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, and adults have been stocked periodically since 1996 to create a bonus fishery for park visitors.  Yearlings were stocked in spring 2009 and many small walleye were observed in shallow areas during bass electrofishing efforts.  If this year class can recruit to the sport fishery, walleye fishing should improve in future years. <br> \n     <br> \nOther species sampled in 2009 included green sunfish, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and golden shiner.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2014. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
