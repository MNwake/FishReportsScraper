                "narrative": "<p>Little Jay Gould is a small lake near Cohasset, Minnesota.  The lake is relatively clear and appears to support a diverse aquatic plant community.  The lake is connected to the Mississippi River via connection to Jay Gould Lake and Blackwater Lake and is part of the larger, Pokegama Reservoir.  The US Army Corp of Engineers controls water level at the Pokegama Dam.  Little Jay Gould receives water from Pokegama Lake and the Mississippi River depending on water levels.  Many homes exist on the lake.  The shoreline has been modified and disturbed by residential development in many places.   <br> \n <br> \nA population assessment was conducted in August of 2008 to assess the status and characteristics of the fish community.  Northern pike were the most common fish captured in gill nets.   The catch rate was relatively high but within the expected range when compared to similar lakes.  Little Jay Gould has a history of relatively high pike abundance.  In 2008, the size structure was relatively poor, as most fish did not exceed 21 inches.  Analysis of bony structures identified 7 year-classes.  Growth was average and individuals typically exceeded 21 inches in 5 years.  Few individuals exceed age-5.  Anglers should consider releasing northern pike exceeding 22 inches to increase the number of older, larger fish in the lake.  Although abundant, small mean size may limit the popularity of the northern pike fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were the second most common fish in the gill net.  The gill net catch rate was relatively high when compared to similar lakes.  Size structure was favorable as 60% of the individuals exceed 10 inches.  Analysis of bony structures identified 6 year-classes suggested fairly consistent recruitment.  Growth was average and individuals typically exceeded 8 inches in 5 years.  Thirty-four percent of individuals exceeded age-5.  Given the age and size structure, good angling opportunities likely exist for this species. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rate was relatively low but within the expected range when compared to similar lakes.  Lakes like Little Jay Gould often have low to moderate walleye populations.  Size structure was good, however, as most individuals exceeded 15 inches.  Five year-classes were present.  Growth was average and individuals typically exceeded 15 inches by age-5.  Fifty percent of the individuals exceeded age-5.  Given the catch rate and size structure, fair angling opportunities should exist.  Adjacent Jay Gould and Pokegama lakes are stocked with walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were captured in moderate numbers at a rate within the expected range for the lake type.  Bluegill catches have been low in previous assessments and the 2008 catch was the highest recorded.  The size structure was moderate 48% exceeded 6 inches.  Few individuals exceeded 8 inches, however.  Several year-classes were present and growth was average with individuals typically exceeding 6 inches in 5 years.  Limited numbers and small average size may limit the popularity of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nBass are often difficult to assess with test nets, as net avoidance is high.  Electrofishing was conducted on Little Jay Gould Lake in June to assess the bass populations.  Largemouth bass were sampled in good numbers.  The size structure of largemouth bass was good as 22% exceeded 15 inches.  Several year-classes were present and growth was average with individuals typically exceeding 15 inches in 5 years.  Smallmouth bass were present in limited numbers, as only 3 were captured.  The lake has good largemouth bass habitat and largemouth bass are an important component of the fish community.  Smallmouth bass were not captured in previous assessments and habitat for this species may be limited.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured include bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nThe protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Jay Gould is a small, mesotrophic lake near Cohasset.  It is 178 surface acres, has a littoral area of 78 acres (57%) and has a maximum depth of 56 feet.  The lake is relatively clear and supports a diverse aquatic plant community. The Secchi disk transparency in 2022 was 15 feet and has ranged from 10 to 12 feet in previous surveys.  Zebra Mussels infestation may be contributing to increased water clarity.  The lake is connected to the Mississippi River via connection to Jay Gould and Blackwater lakes and is part of the larger Pokegama Reservoir.  The US Army Corp of Engineers controls water levels at the Pokegama Dam.  Little Jay Gould receives water from Pokegama Lake and the Mississippi River depending on water level.  The shoreline impact zone has been modified and disturbed by residential development in many places.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Lake Management Plan (LMP) lists Largemouth Bass and Bluegill as primary management species and Black Crappie, Walleye and Northern Pike as secondary species.  Little Jay Gould produces a high-quality sunfish fishery.  A special regulation featuring a 5 fish daily limit was implemented on Little Jay Gould and connecting waters in 2021 to protect sunfish size quality.  A Standard Survey was conducted in August of 2015 to assess the status and characteristics of the fish community using 6 gill nets and 7 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nLittle Jay Gould has a history of relatively high pike numbers and Northern Pike were the most common fish captured in gill nets.   The catch rate was average for the lake and resembled catches on similar lakes.  Size structure of pike has been poor in most assessments but improved in 2022.  Pike lengths ranged from 11.2 to 34.6 inches and averaged 19.6 inches.  Analysis of ageing structures identified 7 consecutive year-classes ranging from age-1 to age-7.  Growth was relatively fast with a mean length of 21.2 inches at age-3.  A lack of older, larger individuals appears to limit the age and size structure, as only 10% of individuals exceeded age-5.  Given the numbers and size quality, good pike angling opportunities appear to exist.  Anglers should consider releasing Northern Pike exceeding 22 inches to increase the number of older, larger fish in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nLakes with similar habitats rarely produce robust Walleye fisheries and Jay Gould has maintained modest angling opportunities.  Walleye were captured at a typical rate for the lake.  Size structure was good as lengths ranged from 9.2 to 24.6 inches and averaged 17 inches.  Too few Walleye were sampled to determine growth rates but fish from seven year-classes were identified and fish up to age-10 were present suggesting frequent recruitment and low adult mortality.  Connecting waters, Jay Gould and Pokegama lakes, are stocked with Walleye and migration likely contributes to their presence in Little Jay Gould.  It appears that modest angling opportunities exist. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch have occurred in relatively low numbers. The 2022 catch was average for the lake and typical for lakes with similar habitats.  Lengths ranged from 5.4 to 10.2 inches and averaged 6.9 inches.  Size structure suggests that modest angling opportunities exist.    Relatively high pike and bass abundance may limit Yellow Perch numbers in Little Jay Gould.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were captured at the highest catch rate observed on Little Jay Gould but typical for lakes with similar habitats.  Bluegill trap net catches have historically been low but increased in the last two surveys.  The size structure was moderate.  Bluegill ranged from 3.7 to 9.2 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.  The timing of the survey likely influenced length and age distributions and catch rate.  Six consecutive year classes were identified ranging from age-2 to age-7 and recruitment appeared relatively consistent.  Growth was above average for the lake class, with a mean length of 6.7 inches at age-5 and resembled past surveys.  Like previous surveys, only a few individuals exceeded age-5, but this is likely a function of the timing of the survey.  August surveys can misrepresent sunfish characteristics as larger fish often move to deeper water while juveniles may remain in shallow, vegetated areas.  Spring targeted surveys provide better evaluations of sunfish fisheries.  Targeted surveys conducted in 2016 and 2019 suggest moderate sunfish numbers, fast growth, and good size quality.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie gill net catches have varied, likely due to fluctuations in recruitment but have never been high. The 2022 catch rates were below average for the lake. Size structure was good with crappies averaging 10.2 inches and fish over 13 inches were present. Too few crappies were sampled to determine age and growth.  Modest angling opportunities for large crappie appear to exist given the relatively low catch rates and high average size.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and Smallmouth Bass are infrequently sampled in nets.  Both species were present but too few were captured to describe their population characteristics.  Habitats favor Largemouth Bass.  Previous electrofishing surveys suggest moderate numbers of Largemouth are present and size quality is good.  Smallmouth Bass appear to occur in low numbers and are likely transient from connecting waters.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured include Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Tullibee, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nInvasive species are species that are not native to Minnesota and cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health. They are illegal to introduce into or move between state waters and can impact energy flow, food chains, and fish species assemblages.  Changing environmental conditions resulting from these introductions caused changes in gamefish habitat and habits, which likely impact fish sampling.     <br> \n <br> \nZebra Mussels were found in Lake Winnibigoshish in 2012 and have since been found in the Mississippi River and downstream connecting waters.  Little Jay Gould was listed as infested in 2019.  Zebra Mussels are an efficient filter feeder that have been shown to impact energy transfer and aquatic food webs.  Zebra Mussels likely contributed to periods with increased water clarity, changed aquatic plant communities, shunted energy pathways, and impacted fish behavior, production, and community structure.   Movement of any type of equipment that can trap or hold contaminated water, plant fragments or aquatic organisms can be a potential vector of spread if precautions are not taken. To avoid being an accomplice to the spread of these unwanted species, people should ensure that all equipment is thoroughly cleaned and dried before moving it to a new body of water.

                "narrative": "<p>Little Jay Gould is a 150 acre lake located near Cohasset, MN in the Mississippi River headwaters watershed.  Little Jay Gould is part of a navigable chain of lakes connected to the Mississippi River.  Other lakes in the chain include Pokegama, Jay Gould and Blackwater.  Past sampling indicated quality Bluegill and Black Crappie populations, though sample sizes were fairly modest in mid-summer surveys.  The 2019 targeted survey was the second spring survey conducted to obtain better information on the status of the Bluegill and Black Crappie in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 285 Bluegill were captured for a catch rate of 15.8 per trap net.  The DNR panfish technical committee has defined exceptional size quality as having at least 10% of sampled Bluegill exceeding 8 inches with 9 inch or larger fish present.  The previous spring survey of Little Jay Gould indicated exceptional size quality.  In 2019, Bluegill ranged from 3.3 to 9.1 inches with a mean length of 6.9 inches.  Nineteen percent exceeded 8 inches.  Age analysis indicated ages 3 through 10 were represented, but age 6 and 7 fish made up a majority of the sample.  Growth was near the lake class average with fish averaging 8.0 inches at age 8.  Pumpkinseed were less common than Bluegill and were captured at a rate of 3.6 per trap net.  Size structure was modest as lengths ranged from 4.1 to 9 inches.  Pumpkinseed length averaged 6.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in moderate numbers (2.3 per trap net).  Size structure was similar to the previous spring survey.  Crappie ranged from 5.4 to 11.4 inches and had a mean length of 9.5 inches.  Age analysis identified 6 year classes (ages 2-7).  Most fish were from the 2014 and 2015 year classes, suggesting inconsistent recruitment.  Growth was near the statewide average as crappie averaged 8 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, Little Jay Gould Lake provides good angling opportunities for quality panfish.  Conservation officer reports and anecdotal information from local anglers indicate high harvest of panfish has occurred at times.  High quality Bluegill populations risk size quality decline due to angler harvest.  Anglers are encouraged to limit harvest of larger sunfish to maintain fishing quality.  The DNR panfish technical committee recommends using reduced bag limits to help maintain size quality on lakes with the biological potential for large sunfish and documented public support.   Little Jay Gould Lake was included in a proposal for a 5 sunfish bag limit in 2011, but there was insufficient public support to implement a regulation change at that time.  Since then, public support for sunfish regulations has increased and Little Jay Gould Lake is once again being considered for a reduced bag limit. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Jay Gould is a small, mesotrophic lake near Cohasset, Minnesota.  It is 178 acres in size, has a littoral area of 78 acres (57%) and has a maximum depth of 56 feet.  The lake is relatively clear and supports a diverse aquatic plant community.  The Secchi disk transparency in 2015 was 11.2 feet, and has ranged from 10.0-12.0 feet in previous surveys.  The lake is connected to the Mississippi River via connection to Jay Gould Lake and Blackwater Lake and is part of the larger Pokegama Reservoir.  The US Army Corp of Engineers controls water levels at the Pokegama Dam.  Little Jay Gould receives water from Pokegama Lake and the Mississippi River depending on water level.  The shoreline impact zone has been modified and disturbed by residential development in many places.  Residential development often impacts fish and wildlife habitat by destabilizing shorelines, modifying or removing aquatic plants, and increasing nutrient run off to the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 Lake Management Plan (LMP) lists Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Black Crappie as primary species for management and Walleye and Northern Pike as secondary species.  The LMP goals were to: Maintain a quality Largemouth Bass fishery characterized by electrofishing catches exceeding 40 per hour, maintain quality panfish angling opportunities with Black Crappie and Bluegill populations characterized by trap net catches exceeding 0.2 and 4.7/net; maintain Walleye angling opportunities with a Walleye population characterized by a catch of 3.0/gill net and maintain a Northern Pike fishery characterized by a catch of 6.0/gill net. <br> \n <br> \nA population assessment was conducted in August of 2015 utilizing 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets to assess the status and characteristics of the fish community.  An electrofishing survey was done in May of 2015 to evaluate the bass population.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were the most common fish captured in gill nets.   The catch rate of 5.3/gill net was within the typical range for ecological lake class 25.  Little Jay Gould has a history of relatively high pike abundance as gill net catches have been near the upper end of the expected range in four of five assessments conducted since 1974.  Size structure of pike has been poor in all assessments.   Ageing structures identified 7 consecutive year-classes ranging from age-1 to age-7.  Northern Pike averaged 19.9 inches at age-5, similar to the statewide average.  A lack of older, larger individuals appears to limit the age and size structures, as only 10% of individuals exceeded age-5.  Anglers should consider releasing Northern Pike exceeding 22 inches to increase the number of older, larger fish in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie gill net catch rate decreased from 3.3 /net in 2008 to 1.2/net, which is similar to the lake class median (1.5/net).  Aging structures identified 4 year classes ranging from age-1 to age-5 and suggested fairly consistent recruitment.  Growth was near the statewide average and individuals typically exceeded the quality size of 8 inches in 4 years.  The LMP goal for abundance was met (0.2/trapnet), but not size structure.  However, Black Crappie sample size was small as they are difficult to sample in summer assessments.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were captured at a rate of 1.8/gill net, which was within the typical range for the lake class.  Of the Walleye sampled, 10 of 11 were age-3 and growth was near the statewide average.  Connecting waters, Jay Gould and Pokegama lakes, are currently stocked with Walleye fingerlings.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were captured at a rate of 3.5/gill net, which is within the typical range for the lake class.  Yellow Perch catches have been in the lower end of this range in four of five assessments.  Relatively high Northern Pike abundance may limit perch numbers in Little Jay Gould.  Size has generally been too small to be of interest to anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were captured at a rate of 8.1/trap net, within the typical range for the lake class.  Although Bluegill trap net catches have historically been low, the 2015 catch was the highest recorded.  Seven consecutive year classes were identified ranging from age-1 to age-7 and recruitment appeared relatively consistent. Bluegill averaged 5.2 inches at age-4, which is slightly above the statewide average.  Only 8% of individuals exceeded age-5, suggesting relatively high mortality of older individuals.  The LMP goal for abundance (4.7/net) was met, but not for size structure.  <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing surveys to assess the Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations were conducted in 2008 and 2015.  Largemouth Bass were sampled in good numbers; the on-time catch rate was 33.5/hour compared to 41.9/hour in 2008.  Six year-classes were identified ranging from age-3 to age-8 and recruitment appeared to be consistent.  Growth was near the statewide average and individuals typically exceeded 12 inches in 5 years.  Thirty percent of individuals exceeded age-5.  The lake has good Largemouth Bass habitat and they are an important component of the fish community.  Smallmouth Bass were sampled for the first, and only, time in 2008. LMP goals were met for size structure, but not for electrofishing catch rates. Smallmouth Bass were not captured in previous assessments and habitat for this species may be limited. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Jay Gould is not known to support invasive plant species.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured include Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Tullibee, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Little Jay Gould Lake on August 7, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 16 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 24.3 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 9.6?C (49.3?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations within the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 2008-2015 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2008. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",
