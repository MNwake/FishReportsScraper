                "narrative": "<p>Hide Lake is a 25.5 acre lake with a maximum depth of 7.0 feet and is located approximately 10 miles northwest of Isabella, MN.  The shoreline is primarily mixed forest and bog with a small portion of the shoreline being developed; there is a cabin on the southeast shore.  The remainder of the shoreline is under federal ownership.  The water clarity is above average with a brown bog-stained water color.  Twelve aquatic plant species are present with muck and detritus the most common substrates in the lake.  Northern Pike and Yellow Perch are the most common game fish present within the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake access road breaks off of the Bandana Lake Rd (USFS Rd. 383) about 4.5 miles north of State Highway 1.  The access road is 0.3 miles long and the terrain is rough.  The access road is about 100 yards south of the Beetle Lake access.  A high clearance vehicle is recommended for traveling the road.  There is a small parking area at the end of the road and a short (20 yard) carry down to the lake.  The access is on the north side of the lake.  Fishing pressure appears to be very light.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 survey found the catch rate of Northern Pike to be above average compared to similar lakes in northeastern Minnesota.  The average length of Northern Pike was 18.7 inches with an average weight of 1.7 pounds.  The largest Northern Pike measured was 26.6 inches long and weighed 4.8 pounds.  Seven year classes were represented in the 2015 survey with age-3 pike making up 34% of catch.  Growth of Northern Pike is fast when compared to other lakes in the Finland area.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch was below average for similar lakes in the area.  The average length of Yellow Perch was 6.6 inches and weight was 0.1 pounds.  The largest Yellow Perch was 8.9 inches long and weighed 0.3 pounds.  Five year classes were present for Yellow Perch with fish from age-2 to age-6.  Yellow Perch growth was average for the Finland area.   <br> \n</p>",
