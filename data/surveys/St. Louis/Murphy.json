Murphy Lake is located just west of Central Lakes, MN off U.S. Highway #53 and has a state-administered, concrete, back-in public access.  Murphy was last assessed in 2001.  Murphy was assessed during the summer of 2009 to update information about fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked into Murphy during odd numbered years since 1993.  Walleye abundance of 0.9 per gillnet lift was up slightly from 2001 (0.8) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 16.2 inches, but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  All walleye aged corresponded to stocked year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 30 largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 55.4 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass average length was 12.3 inches.  One-third of the bass captured were greater than 16 inches in length.  Length at age-4 of 11.5 inches represents average growth when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 1999 through 2007 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 3.9 per gillnet lift was down from 2001 (3.6) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Northern pike average length was 24.1 inches and 40% of the gillnet captured fish were greater than 28 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 2.3 per trapnet lift was up from 2001 (2.0) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie average length was 7.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 18.9 per trapnet lift was up from 2001 (7.2) and above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The 2009 bluegill catch rate was the highest recorded on Murphy of eight total investigations dating back to 1950.  Average length of sampled bluegills was poor at 4.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 6.1 per gillnet lift was down slightly from 2001 (7.7) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 6.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include black bullhead, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.    <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike were captured at a rate of 3.4 per gillnet with an average length of 23.2 inches and a range between 16.9 and 39.3 inches.  Bluegill were captured at a rate of 9.2 per trapnet with an average length of 6.2 inches and a range of 2.9 to 7.7 inches.  Black crappie were captured at a rate of 5.7 per trapnet with an average length of 8.1 inches and a range of 4.3 to 10.9 inches.     Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1992, 1993, 1995 and 1996 in an attempt to establish a naturally reproducing population.  Walleye samples obtained during the survey corresponded to stocking years, although it may take years before a population might take hold.     Largemouth bass were present in the spring electrofishing portion of the lake survey and averaged 10.9 inches in length with a range of 2.9 to 16.9 inches.     Other species an angler might encounter were: black bullhead, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, pumpkinseed and white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Murphy is a 354 acre lake with 261 (74%) acres of littoral area and maximum depth of 24 feet. Murphy Lake is located just west of Central Lakes, MN off U.S. Highway #53 and has a state-administered, concrete, back-in public access.  Murphy was last assessed in 2009.  Murphy was surveyed during the summer of 2019 to update information about fish populations.  Walleye and Largemouth Bass are the primary species of management for Murphy Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked into Murphy during odd numbered years since 1993.  Walleye abundance of 4.2 per gillnet lift was up significantly from 2009 (0.9) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Historically, the Walleye gillnet catch for 2019 was the highest on record for Murphy Lake dating back to 1950.  Walleye average length was large at 17.6 inches with some fish captured exceeding 25 inches.  All Walleye aged corresponded to stocked year-classes, suggesting natural reproduction of Walleye is limiting in Murphy Lake.  Anglers should expect quality opportunities for Walleye angling in Murphy Lake in 2020 and beyond.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 34 Largemouth Bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 31.0 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth Bass average length was 14.3 inches with some quality sized fish sampled up to about 18 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 4.1 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Northern pike average length was 23.9 inches and 16% of the gillnet captured fish were greater than 28 inches in length.  One large specimen captured measured 35 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 5.8 per trapnet lift was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black Crappie average length was 7.4 inches.  Bluegill abundance of 8.7 per trapnet lift was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled Bluegill was 5.0 inches. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Murphy is a 395 acre lake with 261 (66%) acres of littoral area and maximum depth of 24 feet.  Murphy Lake is located just west of Central Lakes, MN off U.S. Highway #53 and has a state-administered, concrete, back-in public access.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in 1992, 1993, 1995, 1998, 1999 and 2001.  Primary management species are walleye and largemouth bass, with secondary management for black crappie.     Walleye abundance of 0.8 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  However, anglers reported that walleye were being caught during the 1996 and 2001 fisheries investigations.  One angler provided samples of fish scales from 21 walleye for analysis by the field crew during the 1996 lake survey.  Mean length of walleye sampled in 2001 was 17.9 inches.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 16.7 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed 10 of the 12 aged walleye were born in years that walleye fingerlings were stocked.     Northern pike abundance of 3.6 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 23.8 inches was large.  Growth was average with length at age four of 23.1 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed a strong 1998 year class and all year classes from 1995 through 1999 represented.     Yellow perch abundance of 7.7 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 6.3 inches was small.     Black crappie abundance of 2.0 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie were also sampled at a rate of 10.1 per gillnet lift, which is above average.  Mean length of 7.1 inches was small.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 7.1 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed a very strong 1998 year class and all year classes from 1995 through 1999 represented.     Bluegill abundance of 7.2 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Bluegill were also sampled at a rate of 3.1 per gillnet lift.  Mean length of 5.0 inches was small.  Growth was average with length at age four of 4.8 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed a very strong 1998 year class and all year classes from 1994 through 1999 represented.     Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing in the spring of 2001.  Largemouth bass abundance was 18.2 per hour of electrofishing.  Mean length of largemouth bass was 12.5 inches.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 12.1 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed a strong 1998 year class.     Other fish species present in low abundance include black bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker and yellow bullhead.     Management of walleye changed from single to double-density stocking of walleye fingerlings in 2001.  This was an attempt to increase the density of adult walleye.  Because walleye have not been sampled at a high rate during summer gillnet surveys, electrofishing will be conducted during the spring spawning run.</p>",
