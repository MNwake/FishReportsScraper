The lake is 370 acres and with a maximum depth of 17 feet, nearly all of lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The lake is known to experience winterkill during severe winters with the last being a partial winterkill during the winter of 1995-96.  Development is relatively light with only 4.6 homes/cabins per shoreline mile, most of which are located along the east side of the lake.  One residence on north/west side of the lake was recently converted to a seasonal campground.   Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand, muck, and detritus, though areas of gravel, boulders, rubble, and silt are present as well.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 36 species present and is integral to maintaining good water quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was above average when compared to similar lakes at 13.7/gill net in 2010.  Past catches have ranged from 7 to 12.7/gill net with an average of 10.2/gill net.  Average length and weight were 21.3\" and 2.3 lbs with 26% measuring at least 24\".   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage species for northern pike and they were present in good numbers in 2010 with a catch rate of 37.9/gill net.  This was the highest catch to date.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were caught in average numbers at 15.6/trap net.  Black crappies were also caught in average numbers at 11.1/gill net and 1.2/trap net.  Size was respectable with 27% of bluegills measuring at least 7\" and 25% of all crappies measuring at least 8\".    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blind Lake is located approximately 8 miles north of Aitkin.  The lake is 370 acres and with a maximum depth of 17 feet, nearly all of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The lake is known to experience winterkill during severe winters with some of the last known being partial winterkills during the winter of 1995-96, 2012-2013 and 2017-2018.  Partial winterkills are likely to have occurred in other years too, but were never reported or documented.  Winterkills are not necessarily a bad thing and historically were fairly common in Minnesota.  In recent years, winters have not been as harsh and winterkills have not been as prevalent on a statewide scale.  Partial winterkills are usually good for lakes particularly when it comes to Bluegills.  Following a winterkill there are typically enough survivors to repopulate the lake and growth rates tend to be very good for some time.  As densities increase with the addition of each new year class, the survival decreases and growth rates slow.  The lake then winterkills again, thereby decreasing density, and the whole process of high survival and fast growth repeats itself.  When these lakes go several years without a winterkill, and they do, they then provide for excellent fisheries. <br> \n <br> \nDevelopment is relatively light with only 4.6 homes/cabins per shoreline mile, most of which are located along the east side of the lake.  One seasonal campground exists on the northwest end of the lake.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand, muck, and detritus, though areas of gravel, boulders, rubble, and silt are present as well.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 36 species present and is integral to maintaining good water quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was above average when compared to similar lakes at 10.3/gill net in 2018.  Past catches have ranged from 7 to 13.7/gill net with an average of 10.9/gill net.  Average length and weight were 21.9\" and 2.3 lbs with 16% measuring at least 24\".   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are always an important forage species for Northern Pike and they were present in good numbers the last time the lake was surveyed with a catch rate of 37.9/gill net which was the highest catch to date .  However in 2018, Yellow Perch were down to 8/gill net which is the lowest catch on record. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill seem to have been affected by the winterkill and were caught in lower numbers than usual for this lake at 8.9/trap net.  Black Crappie numbers were not affected as much by the winterkill and were caught in average numbers for the lake at 10.4/gill net.  Size of each species was respectable with 40% of Bluegills measuring at least 7\" and 26% of all crappies measuring at least 8\". <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blind Lake is a shallow lake northwest of Aitkin on county road 24.  There is a state owned public access on the northeast side of the lake.  The northeast portion of the lake is quite shallow and supports abundant wild rice, providing good waterfowl habitat in the fall.  The lake is known to experience winterkill during severe winters, which probably helps to generate fisheries with desirable size structures periodically.  The last known winterkill was a partial kill that affected the lake during the winter of 1995-96.  Game fish species available in Blind Lake are northern pike, black crappie, bluegill and yellow perch.  Although the northern pike abundance in the lake has increased to 12.7 fish per gill net, which is high for this type of lake, the size structure remains good with an average size of over 22.5 inches.  There were also good numbers of fish greater than 24 inches.  Winter fishing for black crappie was quite popular in the winter of 1999-00.  Crappies observed in this assessment were mostly from the 1996-98 year-classes.  Abundance was very high for this type of lake with over 11 fish caught per trap net.  Fishing should be good in a couple of years as these fish reach desirable size, if a winterkill event does not occur before then.  The situation observed in 2000 for bluegills was similar to that of black crappie with high abundance and strong 1997 and 1998 year-classes.  Yellow perch, the preferred forage of northern pike, are present in normal abundance.  </p>",
