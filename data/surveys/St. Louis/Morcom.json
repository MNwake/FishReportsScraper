                "narrative": "<p>Morcom (Paleface) is a shallow, 178 acre, dark water lake located two miles northeast of Melrude.  Access is gained from a developed public landing on the outlet.  Numerous logs and deadheads in both the river and lake create a hazard for boat travel.  Black bullhead dominate the fish community in this lake that periodically winter kills.     Black bullhead were abundant in the 1997 survey with sampled fish averaging 6.4 inches in length.  Northern pike were also numerous with an average length of 21.6 inches and an occasional fish over 28 inches.       Bluegill and black crappie were plentiful with average lengths of 7.6 and 8.5 inches respectively.  Most of the bluegills were aged 8 and older while black crappie were generally 3 and younger.     Pumpkinseed and yellow perch were not as common as the previous species, yet were near the normal range for lakes similar to Morcom.  Anglers might also encounter:  white sucker, yellow bullhead and largemouth bass when fishing on this undeveloped lake.</p>",
