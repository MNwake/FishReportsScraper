                "narrative": "<p>     Orwell Reservoir is a United States Army Corps of Engineers flood control impoundment.  It is located approximately 8 miles southwest of Fergus Falls, MN in Otter Tail County.  Construction of the dam on the Otter Tail River was completed in 1952, and the reservoir encompasses 782-acres at normal pool.  Because the main purpose of the reservoir is flood control, water levels are seasonally fluctuated to maximize storage during periods of high water.  This fluctuation has several negative impacts on the reservoir and the resident fish community.  Riparian vegetation has not been able to establish due to periodic inundation.  This has resulted in severe shoreline erosion.  Eroded material is suspended in the water, increasing turbidity.  The increased turbidity, as well as fluctuating water levels, have prevented the establishment of submerged vegetation important to many fish species.  Fluctuating water levels can also negatively impact the spawning success of some fish species.  Changes to the reservoir operating plan in 1986, which required more stable water level management, has improved fishery conditions, but the fishery will not reach full potential as long as flood control is the primary function of the reservoir.  Zebra mussels have been documented in Orwell Reservoir and it is designated as an infested body of water.  <br> \n     The entire shoreline of Orwell Reservoir is owned by the state of Minnesota.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land.  The Corps of Engineers maintains a public water access on the north shoreline off of County Road 114.  There is a 10 horsepower restriction for outboard motors on the reservoir. <br> \n     A targeted survey was conducted to analyze the Black Crappie, Walleye, and Channel Catfish populations.  Crappie data was collected during a spring trapnetting assessment.  Walleye and Catfish data was collected during a special gillnetting assessment.      <br> \n     Catch data from the spring trapnetting assessment indicate that the Black Crappie population is very abundant.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 6.7 to 14.5 inches with an average length and weight of 9.5 inches and 0.5 pounds.  The 2013 year class is very strong and should provide excellent Black Crappie angling for years.  As a result of the 2013 year class, 87% of the crappies were between 9.0 and 10.0 inches in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.2 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance is the highest recorded for this reservoir.  The 2014 year class is strong and should provide good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.6 to 24.1 inches with an average length and weight of 13.8 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.6 inches at three years of age.   <br> \n     Channel Catfish abundance is also the highest recorded for this reservoir.  Catfish ranged in length from 9.5 to 29.9 inches with an average length and weight of 18.6 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Twenty-seven percent of the Channel Catfish were 24.0 inches or greater in length.  Catfish attain an average length of 18.9 inches at six years of age.        <br> \n        Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in Orwell Reservoir by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Orwell Reservoir is a United States Army Corps of Engineers flood control impoundment located southwest of Fergus Falls, MN in Otter Tail County.  Construction of the dam on the Otter Tail River was completed in 1952, and the reservoir encompasses 782 acres at normal pool.  Because the main purpose of the reservoir is flood control, water levels are seasonally fluctuated to maximize storage during periods of high water.  This fluctuation has several negative impacts on the reservoir and the resident fish community.  Riparian vegetation has not been able to establish due to periodic inundation.  This has resulted in severe shoreline erosion.  Eroded material is suspended in the water, increasing turbidity.  The increased turbidity, as well as fluctuating water levels, have prevented the establishment of submerged vegetation important to many fish species.  Fluctuating water levels also negatively impact spawning of some fish species.  Changes to the reservoir operating plan in 1986, which required more stable water level management have improved fishery conditions, but the fishery will not reach full potential as long as flood control is the primary function of the reservoir.       Presently, there is a quality population of black crappie in the reservoir, along with moderate numbers of walleyes, bluegill, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, channel catfish, and yellow perch.  The reservoir also contains moderate to high numbers of several non-game species.     Black crappie were sampled during a spring trap netting assessment.  Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was 21.1 per net, indicating that good numbers are present in the reservoir.  Black crappie ranged in length from 5.8 to 13.4 inches with a mean length of 10.1 inches.  Eighty-six percent of the crappies sampled exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  Although six consecutive year classes were sampled, the 2001-year class composed 75% of the catch.  Crappie averaged a mean length of 10.0 inches at age 4.  To improve black crappie spawning habitat, 200 pine trees were submerged in one of the northeast bays during the spring of 2005.      Walleye catch per unit effort (CPUE) was 4.1 per gill net, which is the highest ever recorded and is now above the third quartile for this lake class (1.0 - 3.2).  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.7 to 22.1 inches, while the mean length at capture was 17.0 inches.  Eighty-eight percent of the walleyes sampled were 15.0 inches or longer in length.  Age data indicates that four consecutive year classes were present; however, the 2001 and 2002 year classes composed a majority of the sample.  Walleye growth rates appear to be excellent.  Average length for an age 3 walleye is 15.6 inches.  Beginning in 2006, Orwell Reservoir will be stocked annually with 626,000 walleye fry.  The purpose of this stocking is an attempt to increase angler catch rates for walleyes.     Yellow perch CPUE of 13.3 per gill net is the highest on record, but is still within the normal interquartile range (3.8 to 22.8) for this lake class.  Yellow perch length at capture ranged from 5.7 to 10.5 inches with the mean length at capture of 8.3 inches.     Although the smallmouth bass population is known to be well established in this part of the Otter Tail River, the population was not effectively sampled by either gill nets or trap nets.  Smallmouth bass are currently protected by a catch and release regulation.  This regulation will be up for review in 2008.     Largemouth bass were sampled during a spring trap netting assessment.  The CPUE was 1.3 per trap net, indicating that low to moderate numbers are present in the reservoir.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 12.4 to 17.7 inches with a mean length of 14.5 inches.      Seventeen channel catfish ranging in size from 6.6 to 21.3 inches were sampled.  The mean length at capture was 14.3 inches.  The gill net CPUE was 1.1 fish per net</p>",

The water levels in Orwell Reservoir have had major influences on the natural reproduction of game fish populations. In early spring the pool level is allowed to fill with spring run-off water. During May and June of most years the pool is well above the normal level. This procedure greatly inhibits the success of the early spawning fish. The high water conditions increase siltation due to increased erosion of a naturally unstable shoreline. This high siltation level causes high turbidity levels which decreases rooted plant growth. The combination of water fluctuation, siltation, and turbidity are all limiting factors in maintaining a viable sport fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Orwell Reservoir is a United States Army Corps of Engineers flood control impoundment.  It is located approximately eight miles southwest of Fergus Falls, MN in Otter Tail County.  Construction of the dam on the Otter Tail River was completed in 1952, and the reservoir encompasses 782-acres at normal pool.  Because the main purpose of the reservoir is flood control, water levels are seasonally fluctuated to maximize storage during periods of high water.  This fluctuation has several negative impacts on the reservoir and the resident fish community.  Riparian vegetation has not been able to establish due to periodic inundation.  This has resulted in severe shoreline erosion.  Eroded material is suspended in the water, increasing turbidity.  The increased turbidity, as well as fluctuating water levels, have prevented the establishment of submerged vegetation important to many fish species.  Fluctuating water levels can also negatively impact the spawning success of some fish species.  Changes to the reservoir operating plan in 1986, which required more stable water level management, has improved fishery conditions, but the fishery will not reach full potential as long as flood control is the primary function of the reservoir.   <br> \n     The entire shoreline of Orwell Reservoir is owned by the state of Minnesota.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land.  The Corps of Engineers maintains a public water access on the north shoreline off of County Road 114.  There is a 10-horsepower restriction for outboard motors on the reservoir. <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Channel Catfish populations. <br> \n     Walleye abundance is the highest recorded for this reservoir.  The 2022 year class is strong and should provide consistently good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes ranged in length from 4.3 to 25.2 inches with an average length and weight of 12.2 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Walleye growth is very fast with an average length of 16.8 inches at three years of age.   <br> \n     Channel Catfish are also very abundant.  Channel Catfish ranged in length from 5.9 to 30.1 inches with an average length and weight of 19.6 inches and 3.6 pounds.  Thirty-eight percent of the Channel Catfish were 24.0 inches or greater in length.    <br> \n     A catch-and-release only regulation for Smallmouth Bass was implemented in 1997.  The regulation extends throughout the Otter Tail River system from the Friberg Dam, north of Fergus Falls, downstream to the Wilkin County Road 19 Bridge, and includes all impoundments within that stretch.         <br> \n        Anglers can also maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in Orwell Reservoir by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n     Orwell Reservoir was designated as infested with zebra mussels in 2013.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Orwell Reservoir is a United States Army Corps of Engineers flood control impoundment located southwest of the town of Fergus Falls in Otter Tail County.  Construction of the dam on the Otter Tail River was completed in 1952, and the reservoir encompasses 782 acres at normal pool.  Because the main purpose of the reservoir is flood control, water levels are seasonally fluctuated to maximize storage during periods of high water.  This fluctuation has several negative impacts on the reservoir and the resident fish community.  Streambank vegetation has not been able to establish due to periodic inudation.  This has resulted in severe shoreline erosion.  Eroded material is suspended in the water, increasing turbidity.  The increased turbidity, as well as fluctuating water levels, have prevented the establishment of submerged vegetation important to many fish species.  Fluctuating water levels also negatively impact spawning of some fish species.  Changes to the reservoir operating plan in 1986 which required more stable water level management have improved fishery conditions, but the fishery will not reach full potential as long as flood control is the primary function of the reservoir.     Presently, there is a quality population of black crappie present in the reservoir, along with moderate numbers of walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, and several non-game species.  Also present, but in low numbers, are bluegill, channel catfish, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass.  No fish stocking occurs in Orwell Reservoir.     Walleye averaged 1.5 per gill net in the 1999 survey, which is typical of this type of lake.  The previous survey found 2.9 per gill net.  Average size in this survey was 15.4 inches and 1.3 lbs, and 50% were greater than 15.0 inches.  Walleye growth was excellent; the average size was 16.1 inches at age 3.  Gravel and cobble substrates suitable for spawning are not present, so it is likely that walleye spawn in the river above the reservoir.     Northern pike averaged 0.3 per gill net, which is similar to the previous survey but well below the statewide median (6.8) for this lake type.  It is likely that spawning habitat for pike is limited.  The average size was 23.1 inches and 2.4 lbs.     Black crappie were sampled during a spring trap netting assessment.  Catches averaged 14.1 per trap net, indicating that good numbers are present in the reservoir.  The average length of crappie was 9.5 inches, and 37% exceeded 10.0 inches.  The largest individual was 15.0 inches.  Reproduction appears consistent, as four consecutive year classes were sampled in large numbers.  Crappie averaged 8.2 inches at age 4, which is consistent with previous surveys.       Bluegill averaged 1.5 per trap net, well below what is expected for this type of lake.  The previous survey found 4.9 per trap net.  The average length was 6.6 inches, and 60% were greater than 7.0 inches.  The low number of bluegills is likely related to the lack of emergent aquatic vegetation.     Yellow perch averaged 7.3 per gill net, similar to the previous survey and within the expected range for this lake type.  Average length was 8.6 inches.  Forty-two percent of the perch exceeded 9.0 inches in length, but none were longer than 11.0 inches.       Low numbers of  largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and channel catfish were captured, suggesting that the fishery potential of those species in Orwell Reservoir is presently limited.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Orwell Reservoir is a United States Army Corps of Engineers flood control impoundment.  It is located approximately 8 miles southwest of Fergus Falls, MN in Otter Tail County.  Construction of the dam on the Otter Tail River was completed in 1952, and the reservoir encompasses 782-acres at normal pool.  Because the main purpose of the reservoir is flood control, water levels are seasonally fluctuated to maximize storage during periods of high water.  This fluctuation has several negative impacts on the reservoir and the resident fish community.  Riparian vegetation has not been able to establish due to periodic inundation.  This has resulted in severe shoreline erosion.  Eroded material is suspended in the water, increasing turbidity.  The increased turbidity, as well as fluctuating water levels, have prevented the establishment of submerged vegetation important to many fish species.  Fluctuating water levels also negatively impact the spawning success of some fish species.  Changes to the reservoir operating plan in 1986, which required more stable water level management, have improved fishery conditions, but the fishery will not reach full potential as long as flood control is the primary function of the reservoir. <br> \n     The entire shoreline of Orwell Reservoir is owned by the state of Minnesota.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land.  The Corps of Engineers maintains a public water access on the north shoreline off of County Road 114.   <br> \n     Presently, there are quality populations of black crappie, walleye, smallmouth bass, and channel catfish in the reservoir, along with moderate numbers of bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike.  The reservoir also contains moderate to high numbers of several rough-fish species.  <br> \n    Walleye is a primary management specie in Orwell Reservoir.  Walleye ranged in length from 6.9 to 21.7 inches with an average length and weight of 14.1 inches and 1.0 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 12.1 inches at three years of age.   <br> \n     Channel catfish ranged in length from 6.6 to 25.3 inches with an average length and weight of 17.0 inches and 1.8 pounds.   The 2005 year class appears to be strong as it composed a majority of the sample.  Catfish attain an average length of 13.1 inches at four years of age.        <br> \n    Catch data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that the black crappie population is very abundant.  Age data indicate that black crappie reproduction is consistently good.  Black crappies ranged in length from 4.1 to 14.3 inches with an average length and weight of 10.1 inches and 0.7 pounds.  Fifty percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.0 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n    Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in Orwell Reservoir by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n     Zebra mussels, which are an invasive species, have been found in the Pelican River watershed.  The Pelican River enters the Otter Tail River and eventually flows into Orwell Reservoir.  At this time no zebra mussels have been found in the Otter Tail River System.  Orwell Reservoir is not listed as infested water, but special precautions should be taken when entering and leaving the waterbody. <br> \n</p>",
