Water clarity is considered to be good. Shoalwater substrates are dominated by rubble and boulder. Aquatic vegetation is sparse and emergent species are most common. <br> \n <br> \nAccess is by portage from either Snowbank Lake or Disappointment Lake. Both of these portages are 85 rods in length. There are two designated campsites on the lake. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers in 2012 (3.4/gill net) were indentical to the long term average for all assessments on this lake. The average smallmouth sampled was 12.3 inches long and about ten years old. The largest smallmouth sampled was 18.1 inches long and 17 years old. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2012 (2.1/gill net) were higher than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. The average pike sampled was 28.2 inches long and about six years old. The largest pike sampled was 37.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers in 2012 (7.7/gill net) were higher than the long term average for all assessments on this lake.

                "narrative": "<p>Parent Lake is located within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) within the Superior National Forest and is a non-motorized lake.  It is approximately 21 miles east of Ely and just south of Snowbank Lake.  Access to the lake consists of an 80 rod portage from Snowbank Lake or an 85 rod portage from Disappointment Lake.  One small inlet comes in on the northeast corner and the lone exit flows out the southwest corner to Snowbank Lake.  Parent is 451 acres with a maximum depth of 52 feet and clear water.  BWCAW permits are required to visit Parent through an official entry point and there are two U. S. Forest Service maintained campsites, both located on the north side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nOn September 16, 2019 Parent Lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 62 F and a bottom temperature of 45 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 35 feet where the water temperature was 47 F.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder with very little aquatic vegetation.   <br> \n <br> \nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 27.0 fish/net which was higher than average compared to past surveys on the lake.  Yield was 22.4 lbs/net which was below average compared to past surveys on the lake.  Fish species sampled were cisco, white sucker, rock bass, smallmouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch.  <br> \n <br> \nTwelve northern pike were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 1.3 fish/net. One silver pike was included in the catch. Silver pike are northern pike with an uncommom color variation. Since silver phase northern pike are found in surrounding lakes including Snowbank and Disappointment, it's not surprising that one was also captured in Parent. The catch rate was low compared to other similar lakes, but above average compared to past surveys on Parent.  Lengths ranged from 20 to over 40 inches with an average of 30 inches.  The average weight was nearly 7 pounds which was well above average compared to other similar lakes.  Size distribution was good with all but two of the fish over 28 inches.  The only silver pike sampled was also fairly large at just over 35 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-two smallmouth bass were captured in gill nets for a catch rate of 2.4 fish/net.  This was high compared to other similar lakes and above average compared to past surveys on Parent.  Lengths ranged from 7 to nearly 19 inches with an average of just over 12 inches.  Growth rates were extremely slow with an average smallmouth taking 9 years to approach 12 inches.  Ages ranged from 3 to 16 years old. <br> \n <br> \nDespite fry stocking efforts in 2016 and 2018, only two walleye were caught in the gill nets in 2019, and neither was from these stocking events.  Both fish were around 26 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nOne hundred forty-seven cisco were caught in gill nets for a catch rate of 16.3 fish/net.  This was high compared to past surveys on the lake as well as other lakes in the Tower area.  Sizes were very similar to past surveys ranging from 7.5 to 11 inches with an average of 9 inches. These cisco are important forage for northern pike and likely contribute to their attaining large size. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, rock bass, and white sucker were also sampled.  Their catch rates and sizes were similar to previous surveys.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Parent Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are average in size, have shorelines that drop off quickly, and have soft (unmineralized) and very clear water.  Parent Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class.Parent Lake was thermally stratified on 9/3/2002 with a surface temperature of 68 F and a bottom temperature of 45 F.  Five ppm oxygen was retained to a depth of 30 ft, where the temperature was 52 F, and 2 ppm oxygen was retained to a depth of 34 ft, where the temperature was 48 F.Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline on Parent Lake are mostly boulder, rubble, and gravel.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 13 ft; the most common plants are pondweeds and arrowhead.  The inlet from Disappointment Lake and the outlet to Snowbank Lake have no barriers to fish movement at high water.This fish population assessment consisted of nine gillnet sets.  Seven previous investigations, dating back to 1950, consisted of 6-9 gillnet sets.  Most of these investigations were done in August or early September. Trapnets have not been used in this lake because of the difficult portage access.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2002 of 19.9 fish/net was in the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the median catch of 22.1 fish/net in all investigations on this lake.  The total catch of fish by weight in the gillnets in 2002 of 31.4 lb/net was in the third quartile for this lake class and was higher than the median catch of 26.2 lb/net in all investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 5 is one of the more productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.Fish populations in 2002 were dominated by walleye, white sucker, and smallmouth bass, followed by rock bass.  Fewer cisco were captured in 2002 than in previous investigations.  Notable by their absence in this assessment, and for their infrequent presence in previous investigations, were yellow perch.Walleye numbers in 2002 (2.7/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 2.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.   Walleye sizes in 2002 averaged 21.2\" (4.9 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 18.6\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye in 2002 was 28.0\" (11.1 lb).  Walleye scales were difficult to read, but it appears that 83 percent (20 of 24) of walleye captured in 2002 were from year classes stocked with fingerlings.  Growth of walleye captured in 2002 was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards. Sucker numbers in 2002 (4.1/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 5.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2002 averaged 17.7\" (2.2 lb), which was at the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 17.3\" in all investigations on this lake.Smallmouth bass were not captured in the initial Fisheries lake survey in 1950, but were present in the next Fisheries investigation in 1978.  Smallmouth numbers in 2002 (3.4/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 1.5/gillnet in all investigations on this lake since they first appeared.  Many young smallmouth have been observed in the shallows during Fisheries investigations.  Smallmouth sizes in 2002 averaged 13.1\" (1.3 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 11.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest smallmouth in 2002 was 18.7\" (3.4 lb).  Growth of smallmouth captured in 2002 was slower than normal by area standards.Rock bass numbers in 2002 (6.7/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 5.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Rock bass sizes in 2002 averaged 6.0\" (0.18 lb), which was at the first quartile for this lake class and was identical to their average size in all investigations on this lake.Cisco numbers in 2002 (2.4/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 11.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes in 2002 averaged 8.2\" (0.16 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 8.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest cisco in 2002 was 9.4\".Neascus was observed on a few of the fish examined during this investigation.  Bass tapeworm was found in most of the smallmouth examined, and triaenophorus was found in most of the cisco examined.  All of these parasites are native to the area and are common.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Parent Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are average-sized, have shorelines that drop off quickly, and have soft (unmineralized) and very clear water.  Parent Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class.Parent Lake stratifies thermally in midsummer and has less than 5 ppm oxygen below 30 ft, where the temperature is 48 F, and has less than 2 ppm oxygen below 34 ft, where the temperature is 47 F.  The lake bottom along the shoreline is mostly boulder, rubble, and gravel.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 13 ft; the most common plants are various pondweeds and arrowhead.  The inlet from Disappointment Lake and the outlet to Snowbank Lake have no barriers to fish movement at high water.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1997 of 18 fish/net was lower than normal for this lake class and was lower than the long term average catch of 29 fish/net for all seven gillnettings in Parent Lake dating back to 1950.  This long term average catch in Parent Lake was inflated by high catches of cisco in the 1978 and 1987 gillnettings.The total catch of fish by weight in 1997 of 27 lb/net was normal for this lake class and was near the long term average catch of 26 lb/net for this lake.  Lake Class 5 is one of the most productive in northeast Minnesota, in terms of numbers and biomass of fish in gillnet catches.Fish populations in 1997 were dominated by white sucker, northern pike, and walleye.Sucker numbers in 1997 (4/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were lower than the long term average catch of 7/gillnet for this lake.  Sucker sizes were large, averaging 19\".  There is a large spawning run of sucker each spring at the outlet, where the Parent River enters Snowbank Lake.Northern pike numbers in 1997 (2/gillnet) were lower than normal for this lake class and were near the long term average catch of 1/gillnet for this lake.  Pike sizes were large, averaging 25\", although the largest was only 33\".  Pike growth (19\" at age three) was normal for the area.  One silver pike (color variant of northern pike) was caught in 1997.  Silver pike are occasionally reported from adjacent Disappointment and Snowbank Lakes.Walleye numbers in 1997 (2/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were at the long term average catch of 2/gillnet.  Walleye sizes averaged 15\"; the largest was 26\".  Most walleye caught in 1997 were from the fingerling-stocked 1995 year class.  Walleye growth (10\" at age two) was faster than normal for the area.Smallmouth bass numbers in 1997 (1/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were at the long term average catch of 1/gillnet.  Smallmouth were absent in the 1950 survey, but were captured in the 1978 survey.  Smallmouth sizes in 1997 averaged 9\" and the largest was 11\"; smallmouth sizes in previous gillnet catches were larger than in 1997.  Smallmouth growth (8\" at age six) was slower than normal for the area.Cisco numbers in 1997 (2/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were much lower than the long term average catch of 14/gillnet.  Cisco sizes averaged 8\"; the largest was 10\".Neascus (black spot) was present on some of the gamefish examined in 1997.  Many of the smallmouth bass in 1997 had bass tapeworm larvae in the tissues of the abdominal cavity.  Neascus and bass tapeworm are parasites that are native to the area, cannot infect humans, and are killed by cooking.</p>",
