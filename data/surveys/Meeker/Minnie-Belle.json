                "narrative": "<p>During the week of 6/5/06 Lake Minnie-Belle in Meeker County was netted as part of a lake resurvey to determine the composition of different fish that are in the lake.  Other parts of this resurvey included shoreline seining, which measures natural reproduction, and night electrofishing which targets largemouth bass.   <br> \n <br> \nThe netting in June consisted of 9 gill net sets and 9 trap net sets.  The number of species captured in gill nets was12, while the number of species captured in trap nets was 9.  Yellow bullheads were the most common fish in the gill net sets, and bluegill were the most common fish in the trap net sets. <br> \n <br> \nMinniebelle Lake is one of the clearest lakes in Meeker County and visibility was good down to 12.5 feet in early June.  A high quality submergent plant community is present at Minniebelle and helps maintain the fish populations and  excellent water quality. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 51 walleye were sampled by gill nets for a catch rate of 5.7/net.  This catch rate was slightly down from the last gill netting in 2003 (6.7/net).  Of the 51 fish netted, 75% were 15 inches or larger and 16% were 20 inches or larger.  The average length of fish captured in 2006 (16.9\") remained about the same compared to 2003 (16.7\").  Fish age determined from fish scale samples revealed walleye of 11 separate ages.  Fish that were 3, 5, 6, and 7 years old were most common.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year at Minniebelle to supplement natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 80 northern pike were sampled by gill nets for a catch rate of 8.9/net.  This catch rate was down from the last gill netting in 2003 (10.3/net).  The average length of fish captured in 2006 (25.1\") increased by almost 4 inches from 2003 (21.3\").  Northern pike were of 6 ages, the majority being 2, 3, 4, and 5 years old.   Proportionally 96% of the fish netted in 2006 were 21 inches or longer and 25% were 28 inches or longer.  A protected slot limit of 24\" to 36\" for northern pike was established in 2003 in an effort to provide anglers with an opportunity to eventually catch larger fish.  More time will be needed to properly evaluate the regulation.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap netting captured a total of 269 bluegills for a catch rate of 29.9/net.  The catch rate in 2003 was 10.2/net.  Numbers of large bluegills was small with about 2% of the catch being 8 inches or larger.  The average length of trap netted bluegill was 5.6 inches.  Bluegil were of 9 ages with most fish being 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 years old. <br> \n <br> \nSpring  electrofishng in May 2006 captured 43 largemouth bass. The same locations and sampling effort captured 92 fish in 2003.  The mean length of fish captured in 2006 was 11.7\", while fish in 2003 were 10.5\", Largemouth bass were of 6 ages.  Fish of ages 3, 4, 5, and 6 made up 90% of the fish captured.  Approximately 12 percent of the largemouth bass sampled were 15 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 8/13/ 06 shoreline seining showed reproduction for yelow perch, largemouth bass, and bluegill in 2006.  Three minnow species were also represented in the shoreline seining. <br> \n <br> \nOther species netted in 2006 that are of interest to anglers were yelow bullhead and black crappie.  Yellow bulhead were present in good numbers and fish averaged 12.1\" and weighed over a pound per fish.  Black crappie were not abundant in the netting with only 9 fish netted.  However, black crappie up to 13.5 in length were sampled.     <br> \n <br> \nLake Minnie-Belle has good fishable populations of northern pike, walleye, bluegill and largemouth bass.  Although bluegill larger than 8 inches are hard to locate, fishing can be good when the right combination of water depth and vegetation is found.  A fishing pier is present at the Aquatic Management Area on the north side of the lake.</p>",

Eurasian watermilfoil was discovered in Minnie-Belle Lake in 2010.  Water clarity was excellent with a secchi disk reading of 13.7 feet during netting week.  The lake was well oxygenated with at least 2 mg/l down to 41 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 87 walleye for a catch rate of 9.7/net, which was above the normal range.  The 2006 catch rate was 5.7/net.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2010 (n=12) were variable ranging from 2.5 to 16.2/net with an average of 8.1.  Walleye were 7.9 to 22.4 inches long with an average of 16.7, in 2010.  Approximately 56% of the gill net sample was 17 inches long or longer.  Trap nets sampled walleye up to 27.7 inches in length.  Aged walleye were 2 to 14 years old with 11 year-classes present.  Approximately 47% of the aged fish corresponded with years when fingerlings were not stocked, indicating that natural reproduction was significant.  Natural reproduction, during non-stocked years, was also significant in 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2006, producing 41, 46, 48, and 69% of gill net catch, respectively.  The average contribution from natural reproduction, during non-stocked years, for the latest five assessments was 50.2%.  The latest fingerling stocking regime (1 pound/littoral acre every-other-year) was initiated in 1992.  Catch rates from 1999 to 2010 (n=5) ranged from 4.1 to 11.6 with an average of 7.6.  Catch rates from 1957 to 1995 (n=7), under various stocking regimes, ranged from 2.5 to 16.2/net with an average of 8.4.  Growth rates were slightly above average.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 121 northern pike for a catch rate of 13.4/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 8.9/net.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2010 (n=12) were variable, but generally high ranging from 0.0 to 27.1/net with an average of 10.6.  A special regulation (24.0 to 36.0 inch protected slot limit) on northern pike was initiated in 2003.  Catch rates from 1995 to 2003 (n=4) ranged from 5.6 to 27.1/net with an average of 13.8 and were somewhat similar to catches from 2006 to 2010 (n=2) ranging from 8.9 to 13.4/net with an average of 11.2.  In 2010, northern pike were 13.4 to 35.4 inches long with an average of 23.1.  The regulation's original goal was to double the historical (1995-2001) average number of northern pike over 24 inches, measured by gill netting.  The number of fish that were 24 inches or longer, from the 1995 to 2001 assessments (n=3), ranged from 6 to 9 with an average of 8.  The number of fish that were 24 inches or longer, from 2003 to 2010 (n=3) ranged from 8 to 43 with an average of 29.7.  The average, during the regulation, was actually 3.7 times higher, thus surpassing the original goal.  The average number of fish, for the same two time periods, that were 30 inches or longer increased from 0.7 to 7.0/assessment, a 10 fold increase.  Northern pike were 1 to 7 years old with 7 year-classes present.  Ages 2 through 6 were well represented, indicating fairly consistent recruitment.  Growth rates for northern pike were similar to slightly faster than past assessments.  Preliminary data suggests that angler compliance with the regulation may be producing larger northern pike at Minnie-Belle Lake, but more time and data is needed before a proper evaluation can be conducted. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 54 yellow perch for a catch rate of 6.0/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The catch rate in 2006 was 3.2/net.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2010 (n=12) were generally low ranging from 0.0 to 34.1/net with an average of 5.1.  Yellow perch were 5.6 to 9.1 inches long with an average of 7.1.  Yellow perch were 1 to 4 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate.    <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 88 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 66.0/hr.  The catch rate in 2006 was 32.3/hr. Catch rates from 1993 to 2010 (n=8) were somewhat variable ranging from 12.8 to 69.8/hr with an average of 42.6.   In 2010, largemouth bass were 5.6 to 16.4 inches long with an average of 10.8.  Only 1 fish exceeded 14 inches in length.  Largemouth bass were 2 to 9 years old with 8 year-classes present.  Age 2 through age 6 fish were well represented indicating consistent recruitment.  Growth was slow.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 5 black crappie for a catch rate of 0.6/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 1.0/net.  Catch rates from 1947 to 2010 (n=12) were low ranging from 0.0 to 5.5/net with an average of 1.1.  Gill netted black crappie were 9.0 to 13.9 inches long with an average of 12.3.  Black crappie were 3 to 11 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate.  The trap net catch rate (0.1/net) was below the lake-class first quartile (0.4).  The 2006 trap net catch rate was 0.0/net.  Catch rates from 1947 to 2010 (n=12) were generally low ranging from 0.0 to 19.3/net with an average of 3.4.  The trap netted black crappie was 10.0 inches long.  High numbers of black crappie have only been trap netted two times (1957 & 1999) since netting began at Minnie-Belle Lake.  Seining and backpack electrofishin failed to sample any young-of-the-year black crappie in early to mid July, 2010, possibly indicating poor reproduction for that year.       <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 476 bluegill for a catch rate of 52.9/net, which was above the normal range for this lake class.  The 2006 catch rate was 29.9/net.  Catch rates from 1947 to 2010 (n=12) were variable ranging from 3.2 to 65.0/net with an average of 25.4.  In 2010, bluegill were 2.6 to 8.3 inches long with an average of 4.9.  Approximately 8% of the trap net sample was 7 inches or longer.  Bluegill were 3 to 11 years old with 9 year-classes present.  Most (56%) of the trap netted bluegill were 4 or 5 years old.  Ages 3 through 8 were well represented, showing consistent recruitment.  Growth was slow.  Minnie-Belle continues to be one of the few lakes in the Hutchinson Management Area where 8 inch long bluegill are routinely sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 6 carp for a catch rate of 0.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was also low (0.2/net).  Catch rates from 1947 to 2010 (n=12) were low ranging from 0.0 to 0.7/net with an average of 0.3.  Gill nets sampled 0 carp, in 2010.  Carp were 24.1 to 29.7 inches long with an average of 26.4.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 160 yellow bullhead for a catch rate of 17.8/net, which was above the normal range for this lake type.  The 2006 catch rate was similar at 18.3/net.  Approximately 83% of the historic catch rates (n=12) have been above the normal range.  Yellow bullhead were 8.4 to 15.7 inches long with an average of 12.8.  Yellow bullhead are an indicator of good water quality, while black bullhead are not.  The yellow bullhead to black bullhead ratio was 160:1. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnie-Belle is a moderated sized Lake (596 acres) located near Litchfield, in Meeker County.  A large state owned access, with a double cement boat ramp, is present on the north shore.  Shore fishing is available at the state owned Aquatic Management Area (AMA) on the north side of the lake.  The fishing pier was removed from the AMA in 2020 due to maintenance issues.   Additional shore fishing is available, at a church property, on the lake's south lagoon.  Minnie-Belle has 4.86 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 49 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Minnie-Belle is a class 27 lake and there are no similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area.  Minnie-Belle Lake is known as having some of the best water clarity in all of Meeker County.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike anglers know that Minnie-Belle typically offers good fishing.  A 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit (all fish from 24 to 36 inches in length must be released immediately) was put in place in 2003 to shift the size structure to more medium and large sized pike and it worked.  Historic gill netting assessments indicated that good numbers of Northern Pike are typically present in Minnie-Belle.  .  In 2020 many nice Northern Pike were sampled, including two fish over 35 inches in length, which is a very rare catch for lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area.  High numbers of Walleye were netted in 2020, with much of the catch being over 15 inches in length.  Walleye anglers may have better luck if they concentrate their effort on low light times (night, dawn, dusk, and overcast days) because of the lakes very clear water.  Black Crappie net catches were low again in 2020, but the one fish that was sampled was impressive, at 16 inches in length.  Historic summer net catches for crappie have almost all been low, but sometimes these gears don't work well on lakes with high clarity.  Crappie anglers may want to try nearby Ripley or Willie Lakes for some possibly better fishing.  Anglers should expect decent Bluegill action at Minnie-Belle, but will need to do some sorting if they are after larger fish.  Historic net catches show that Bluegill typically good numbers in Minnie-Belle. Only 1 Bluegill was over 8 inches in length in 2020.  Minnie-Belle is being proposed for a special Bluegill regulation (bag limit of 5 fish) to increase the number of larger sized fish in the lake.  Public input will likely be gathered in the fall of 2021.  Largemouth Bass anglers should find that there are typically good numbers of small and medium sized fish present at Minnie-Belle.  There are also a few trophies hiding in the lake's plentiful submergent vegetation.  Yellow Bullhead anglers should have good success at this lake, with high numbers of large sized fish being sampled in 2020. <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter include Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.      <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussel are both present in Minnie-Belle Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.  Thanks and good fishing. <br> \n</p>",

A total of 28 YOY were sampled for a catch rate of 28.0/hour, which was the second highest catch rate ever recorded at Minnie-Belle and was within the lake's historical fourth quartile (> 22.2). The 2022 year class appears moderate or strong in abundance. In 2022, the mean length for YOY was 6.0 inches, which was within Minnie-Belle's historical third quartile (5.6 to 6.3), indicating moderate growth (within the inter-quartile range) for this lake. In 2022, 12 YRL were sampled, for a catch rate of 12.0/hour, which was the highest yearling catch rate on record for Minnie-Belle. However, yearlings have only been collected three times during Walleye fall electrofishing at Minnie-Belle Lake. The mean length for the 2022 yearling was 10.5 inches, which was the longest mean on record for this lake where most fish species grow slowly, but was on the short side when compared to most other lakes sampled in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Minnie-Belle Lake the week of June 5, 2017 to monitor the fish population, evaluate the Walleye fingerling stocking regime, and to evaluate the 2003 Northern Pike 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit regulation (all fish in this size range were required to be immediately released).  The 2011 lake management plan lists Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass as primary management species while Walleye are listed as secondary species.  In 2017, a total of 11 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets, trap nets, and by electrofishing.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch were aged this assessment.  Catch rates were compared to other similar lakes across the state.  The water clarity was excellent with a secchi disk reading of 15.0 feet.  Minnie-Belle remained as one of the clearest lakes in Meeker County.  A fishing pier is available at the state owned Aquatic Management Area on the north side of the lake.  Minnie-Belle is listed as being infested with Eurasian Watermilfoil, an invasive aquatic plant species.  Other aquatic invasive species present were Curlyleaf Pondweed and Banded Mystery Snails.       <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (98) of Northern Pike for a catch rate of 10.9/net, which was above what might be expected for this type of lake.  The catch rate indicated that reproduction was strong (>10/net) this survey.  The 2014 catch rate was similar at 12.6/net.  Historical catch rates from 1957 to 2017 (n=14) were mostly high, ranging from 0.0 to 27.1/net with an average of 10.8.  In 2017, gill netted Northern Pike were 18.5 to 34.7 inches long with an average of 24.3.  Approximately 43% of the gill net sample was 24 inches or longer and 18% was 28 inches or longer, indicating a high quality population.  Northern Pike were age-1 to age-8 with eight year classes present, a sign of steady recruitment.  Minnie-Belle had a long history of having high numbers of small \"hammer handle\" Northern Pike.  A regulation (24 to 36 inch protected slot limit) was put into effect in 2003 to remedy that situation.  The 2003 regulation's goal was to double the historical (1995 to 2001) average number of Northern Pike/gill net over 24 inches (0.9/net).  In 2017 there were 4.7 fish/net that were 24 inches or longer.  This not only doubled the historical average, but was actually 5 times higher, thus meeting the goal.  The number of fish greater than 30 inches/gill net also increased during the regulation years.  A positive size structure shift, towards larger Northern Pike, occurred at Minnie-Belle Lake beginning in 2006 and has continued through 2017.  This positive size structure shift did not occur at a similar lake (Ripley), which had no protected slot limit regulation.  A Northern Pike population estimate was also calculated at Minnie-Belle in 2017.  Population size was estimated to be 2,678 fish (4.5 fish/acre).  Northern Pike anglers should expect plenty of action from nice sized fish, and should still be able to get some keepers (fish less than 24 inches in length).   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets did not sample any Black Crappie in 2017, for a catch rate of 0.0/net, which was below what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was similar at 0.1/net.  Historic catch rates from 1957 to 2017 (n=12) were mostly low ranging from 0.0 to 19.3/net with an average of 3.4.  Gill nets sampled low numbers (1) of Black Crappie in 2017, for a catch rate of 0.1/net, which was also below what might be expected for this lake type.  The 2014 gill net catch rate was also low (0.1/net).  Historic gill net catch rates (n=14) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 5.5/net with an average of 0.9.  The gill netted fish was 13.5 inches long and was age-9.  Size distributions indicated inconsistent recruitment, but standard net sets may not be doing a good job of sampling Black Crappie at this time of year (early June).  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (48) of Walleye for a catch rate of 5.3/net, which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2014 catch rate was similar at 6.1/net.  Historic catch rates from 1957 to 2017 (n=14) were variable, ranging from 2.5 to 16.2/net with an average of 7.7.  Different stocking strategies and years of no stocking occurred during these 60 years.  In 2017, the gill netted Walleye were 8.0 to 25.4 inches long with an average of 16.5.  Approximately 63% of the gill net sample was 15 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  The current stocking regime (170 pounds of fingerlings every other year) was initiated in 1988.  Gill net catch rates (n=9) during this stocking regime, from 1993 to 2017, ranged from 4.1 to 11.7/net with an average of 7.5.  Walleye, from both gears, were age-1 to age-21 with fourteen year classes present.  Non-stocked year classes accounted for 48% of the gill net aged fish, indicating that natural reproduction was significant at Minnie-Belle.  In 2017, growth was average to fast, for age-1 to age-4 fish, when compared to statewide averages.  Due to Minnie-Belles clear water, anglers may have better luck targeting Walleye during low light conditions.    <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers (241) of Bluegill for a catch rate of 26.8/net which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was 52.9/net.  Historic catch rates from 1957 to 2017 (n=12) were generally moderate, ranging from 3.2 to 65.0/net, with an average of 26.7.  In 2017, trap netted Bluegill were 2.5 to 8.9 inches long with an average of 6.2.  Approximately 21% of the catch was 7 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Bluegill were age-2 to age-10 with nine year classes present, indicating that recruitment was consistent most years.  Anglers were encouraged to release some of those larger (8 inch) fish, because those fish were slow growing (around 9 years old), and replacing them takes a considerable amount of time. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers (99) of Hybrid Sunfish (various crosses between Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Green Sunfish) for a catch rate of 11.0/net.  Hybrid Sunfish were 3.1 to 9.9 inches long with an average of 7.2.  Approximately 19% of the trap net sample was 8 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled high numbers (112) of Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 56.0/hour.  The 2010 catch rate was 66.0/hour.  Historic catch rates, from 1993 to 2017 (n=9) were variable, ranging from 12.8 to 69.8/hour with an average of 44.0.  In 2017, electrofished Largemouth Bass were 5.4 to 19.7 inches long with an average of 11.8.  Approximately 54% of the electrofishing sample was 12 inches or longer, while 12% were 15 inches or longer, indicating a moderate size structure.  A few large (17\"+) fish were also present.  Largemouth Bass were age-2 to age-10 with eight year classes present, indicating fairly consistent recruitment most years.  Bass anglers could expect plenty of action from small and medium sized fish, with an outside chance at a trophy.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (21) of Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 2.3/net, which was below what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2014 catch rate was also low at 0.9/net.  Historic catch rates from 1957 to 2017 (n=14) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 6.0/net with an average of 2.4.  Yellow Perch were 5.8 to 8.1 inches long with an average of 6.4.  In 2017, only 2 fish were 8 inches or longer.  Yellow Perch were age-3 and age-4.  Age-3 fish accounted for 86% of the gill net aged fish.  The low catch rate indicated inconsistent recruitment.  Yellow Perch were likely an important forage species for other predatory fish at Minnie-Belle. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were not gill netted in Minnie-Belle Lake in 2017.  Historic catch rates (n=14) from 1957 to 2017 were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0/net with an average of 0.0.  Trap nets did not sample any Common Carp in 2017.  Historic trap net catch rates were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 0.7/net with an average of 0.3.     <br> \nGill nets did not sample any Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.0/net.  Historic gill net catch rates from 1957 to 2017 (n=14) were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 6.8/net with an average of 0.7.  Trap nets did not sample Black Bullhead either, for a catch rate of 0.0/net.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (164) of Yellow Bullhead for a catch rate of 18.2/net, which was above what might be expected for this lake type.  Historic catch rates from 1957 to 2017 ranged from 0.4 to 49.0/net with an average 23.6.  Gill netted Yellow Bullhead were 9.7 to 15.8 inches long with an average of 12.8.  Approximately 70% of the gill net catch was 12 inches or longer, indicating a quality population.  High numbers of Yellow Bullhead are an indicator of good water quality.  Anglers seeking big Yellow Bullhead should experience good action at Minnie-Belle.  <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

The population assessment used gill nets, trap nets, and spring night-time electrofishing techniques to assess the status of the fishery.  The lake is primarily managed for walleye and bluegill.Gill nets produced 105 walleye (11.7 per net).  Walleye ranged in length from 6.9 to 23.4 inches and had an average length of 17.7 inches.Gill nets produced 108 northern pike (12.0 per net).  Northern pike ranged between 13.8 and 27.8 inches and had an average length of 20.7 inches.Trap nets sampled 539 bluegill, for a catch rate of 59.9 fish per net.  Bluegill ranged in length from 2.8 to 9.7 inches and had an average length of 5.1 inches.  Only 28% of the sampled bluegill were six inches or larger.Trap nets sampled 174 black crappie, for a catch rate of 19.3 per net.  Fish ranged in length from 6.0 to 10.1 inches and had an average length of 7.9 inches.Electrofishing for largemouth bass produced 32 fish for a catch rate of 24.0 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass averaged out at 11.0 inches.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Lake Minnie-Belle was conducted on July 7th, 2017 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations with one site sampled from the boat.  Soft sediments with abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at one sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 11 native species of fish including Johnny Darter, Iowa Darter, Least Darter Banded Killifish, and White Sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in June 2017 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Lake Minnie-Belle based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minniebelle is a moderate sized lake (545 acres) in Meeker County that has a diverse aquatic plant community.  This lake maintains a water clarity of 7+ feet during midsummer.  Shoal substrates are predominately sand and gravel, with some areas of rubble.  These physical characteristics make Lake Minniebelle a consistent producer of bluegill, northern pike and largemouth bass.       During the summer of 1993, DNR fisheries personnel used trapnets, gillnets, seines and an electrofishing boat to sample the fish population in Lake Minniebelle.  Species sampled included bluegill, black crappie, black bullhead, brown bullhead, common carp, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, white sucker, yellow bullhead and yellow perch.  Brook silverside, johnny darters and spottail shiners were also collected in shoreline seining.      Catch rate of northern pike (10.2/gillnet) increased since the last survey in 1988 (6.0/gillnet).  The catch rate observed during this years survey was above average for lakes of this type.  The average size of northern pike was 17.9 inches and ranged from 8.7 to 34.8 inches.  Age frequency data showed that the 1991 and 1992 year classes were the dominant age groups in the population.  Only 5 of the 90 northern pike aged were older than age 3.  The abundance of age 1 and age 2 northern pike indicates that natural reproduction has improved significantly since the drought years in the late 1980's.  Three young-of-year northern pike were also sampled during the survey.  Growth rates of northern pike were average, with age 2 fish being 15 inches.  Northern pike were last stocked in 1981 (into a spawning area for fingerling production).  Since that time there has been no stocking, and catch rates have remained in the normal range for lakes of this type.     Walleye catch rate in gillnets (9.4/net) was well above average for lakes similar to Minniebelle.  The average size of walleye was large at 17.9 inches.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.4 to 26.3 inches.  Seven consecutive year classes were represented in the aged subsample.  Walleye have been stocked on an every other year rotation since 1984.  These stockings were often of mixed ages, making interpretation of natural reproduction impossible.  However, during fall electrofishing in 1993, fourteen young-of-year walleye were sampled.  These fish were most likely the result of natural reproduction.       Bluegill catch rate in trapnets has ranged from about 15 to 28 per net over the last four surveys (1978 to present).  The catch rate in this years survey (10.2/trapnet) was well below the lake class average of 30.4/trapnet.  The timing of survey trapnetting may be influencing catch rates of bluegill.  Lake Minniebelle has historically been surveyed in early September.  Submergent vegetation typically does not grow in the shoal areas, and generally begins at the 8' contour and extends out to a depth of 20 feet.  The use of alternative gears and sampling times has been investigated and is contained in a separate report.     Growth rates of bluegill in Lake Minniebelle appear to be slower than most Area lakes, but may be consistent with lakes of similar physical characteristics.  Age V bluegill averaged 5.2 inches during this years survey.  In previous surveys (1983 and 1988) age V bluegill were 5.7 and 6.2 inches, respectively.       Black crappie and yellow perch are also present in Lake Minniebelle, but in relatively low numbers.  The abundance of these species has shown very little change in the last 15 years.  Habitat characteristics and relationships with other fish species likely limit the abundance of these species.  Catch rates of yellow bullhead have been consistently above average for both gillnets and trapnets.  The average length of yellow bullhead was just over 12 inches and should be acceptable size to anglers.     Largemouth bass are also present in Lake Minniebelle.  A catch rate of 13.2 largemouth bass per hour was recorded during spring electrofishing.   Only 6 largemouth bass per hour were collected during fall electrofishing.  Reports from local anglers indicate that Lake Minniebelle is a good bass lake, both for catch rates and average size of largemouth bass.  The clear water and lack of vegetation in shoal areas reduced the effectiveness of the electrofishing boat. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minniebelle is a 545 acre lake with a maximum depth of 49 feet.  Lake Minniebelle has better water quality than many area lakes and maintains a secchi disc reading in midsummer of more than 7 feet.  This allows the lake to maintain a diverse aquatic plant community.  Shoal substrates are predominantly sand and gravel with some rubble.  These factors combine to make Lake Minniebelle a consistent producer of bluegill, largemouth bass and northern pike.  During the summer of 1995 DNR Fisheries personnel conducted a fisheries population assessment on Lake Minniebelle.  Fourteen species of fish were sampled during the survey.  Black crappie are present, but not abundant in Lake Minniebelle and surveys have never shown high catch rates of black crappie.  Bluegill are common and provide much of the attraction to anglers.  The lake is known as a producer of large bluegill.  Bluegill sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 2 to 9 inches and the average length was nearly 7 inches.  Largemouth bass are present and can provide good angling.  The average length of bass sampled by electrofishing was 14 inches.  One 14 inch smallmouth  bass was also sampled.  The presence of smallmouth bass has been documented in previous surveys.    Lake Minniebelle is known as a consistent producer of northern pike.  This years survey documented high northern pike catches.  The gillnet catch rate of 27 per net was above the normal range for this lake class.  Previous surveys have also shown northern pike to be abundant.  Northern pike captured in gillnets ranged in length from 11 to 34 inches and average length was 17 inches.  Many of the northern pike were young fish (age two through four), resulting in the small average size.       At times Lake Minniebelle can provide good walleye angling, but clear water can make angling difficult.  The best success may be experienced at night.  The walleye gillnet catch rate (8.8 per net) was above the lake class median, but within the normal range.  Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 6 to 27 inches and average length was 15 inches.  Yellow bullhead are abundant and reach a good size.  Average length of yellow bullhead sampled this year was over 12 inches.  Yellow bullhead this size should be acceptable to most anglers and are usually willing biters.  Similar to previous surveys, catch rates of black bullhead were low. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnie-Belle is a medium sized lake (596 acres) located south of the City of Litchfield in Meeker County. Minnie-Belle has five miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 49 feet. A state-owned public access with two cement boat ramps and a moderate amount of parking is present on the north-northeast shore. Water clarity is good and submergent vegetation is plentiful at Minnie-Belle. Shore fishing is allowed at the state-owned Minnie-Belle Lake Aquatic Management Area on the north end of the lake. A spring trap netting survey was conducted on Minnie-Belle during May 2022. Trap nets were used to target Bluegill and Black crappie. Spring trap netting catches should not be compared to historical summer trap net catches as summer nets do a poor job of representatively sampling Bluegill. A new Sunfish regulation (five fish bag limit) went into effect on March 1, 2022. Size structure of Bluegill is believed to have declined over the decades at Minnie-Belle Lake and the new regulation should limit harvest enough to improve sunfish sizes over time.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Bluegill were collected and fish were 3 to 9 inches long, averaging almost 7 inches. Approximately 48% of the sample was 7 inches or longer, indicating that fair numbers of keeper-sized fish were present.  <br> \nLower numbers of Black Crappie were collected, but average size was impressive at 11 inches. The longest crappie collected was almost 15 inches in length. Crappie can be tough to find at Minnie-Belle, but when you do locate them, it can lead to memorable fishing. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Minnie-Belle Lake has Eurasian watermilfoil and Zebra mussels present. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY: <br> \n <br> \nFISHES PRESENT: <br> \nCommon sucker, carp, spottail shiner, bluntnose minnow, yellow bullhead, northern pike, western banded killifish, perch, walleye, iowa darter, johnny darter, largemouth bass, bluegill, green sunfish, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nFISH SIZES (AVERAGE LENGTH IN INCHES): <br> \nYellow bullhead (11.05), perch (7.7), largemouth bass (11.2), bluegill (5.1 - max. of 11.1), pumpkinseed (5.6), and green sunfish (5.3).  The sizes of yellow bullhead, bluegill, and green sunfish are large for that species.  Perch and pumpkinseeds are average while bass appear to be small.   <br> \n <br> \nMANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS: <br> \nManagement Policy: From the results of netting and creel census reports of past years, it appears that the lake has been best suited for bass and panfishes.  A management plan for these species is recommended.  Walleyes are not common but if local sentiment necessitates such a measure, the lake may be managed secondarily for walleyes to provide some walleye fishing. <br> \n <br> \nPhysical Improvements: None feasible.  <br> \n <br> \nControl of Fish Population: There do not appear to be any over-abundant species of fish in the lake.  However, yellow bullheads and carp are present and may become abundant. <br> \n <br> \nStocking Recommendations: Planting of sunfishes and crappies is unnecessary and should be discontinued here.  Only bass or walleyed pike fingerlings are recommended when they are available.   <br> \n <br> \nFishing Procedures and Regulations: Continued closure to winter spearing is urged, but winter crappie angling might be continued.  Liberalized regulations on panfishes could be inaugurated with no harm.</p>",

There is a good distribution of length groups between 12\" and 25\".  The northern pike population is also down from 1978, but is still quite large at 12.4 per lift.  The perch population though historically low (2 per lift) seems to have supported both walleye and northern populations.  Bluegill (27 per lift) fishing on Minniebelle is very good.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Minniebelle Lake in Meeker County begining on 5/27/03 to evaluate the fish populations.  Spring night-time electrofishing, targeting largemouth bass, was conducted on 5/21/03.  Yellow bullhead dominated the gill net catch while bluegill were the most abundant fish sampled in trap nets.  Minniebelle is primarily managed for northern pike and bluegill.  The lake is 545 acres and has a maximum depth of 49 feet.  The water is fairly clear most of the time and moderate amounts of aquatic vegetation ring the lake.  Development is high on the lake.  A state owned aquatic management area, with shore fishing, is located on the north side of the lake.Net catches in 2003 indicated that there were high numbers of northern pike (10.3/net) at Minniebelle Lake, but relatively few of them were large.  Pike sampled in gill nets were 13.7-29.7 inches long averaging 21.3\".  Only 8 of the 93 fish sampled were 24\" or longer.  A 24-36\" protected slot limit was implemented on the 2003 fishing opener with hopes of producing more large northern pike.  A total of 92 (10.2/net) bluegill were sampled, which was near the lakes historical average (12.6/net).  Bluegill were 3.5-9.3 inches long averaging 6.7 inches.  Approximately 29% of the bluegill sampled were 7\" or longer.  Minniebelle has a reputation for producing large bluegills, but they can be tough to locate.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers (1.3/net), but the 2003 catch rate matched the lakes historical average (1.3/net).  Black crappie were 6.4-11.6 inches long, averaging 9.5 inches.  Spring anglers target black crappie immediately after ice-out.  Fair numbers of walleye (6.7/net) were netted during the assessement.  The 2003 catch rate showed a slight increase from the 2001 netting (4.1/net), and was just below the historical average (7.8/net).  Fall electrofishing has documented natural reproduction of walleye at Minniebelle multiple times.  Walleye sampled in 2003 were 8.5-25.3 inches long, averaging 16.7 inches.  A total of 92 largemouth bass were sampled in 2003 (69.0/hour), indicating good numbers of fish when compared to other lakes in the Meeker and McLeod County area.  Bass were 5.9-18.5 inches long averaging 10.5 inches.  The historical average catch rate for largemouth bass was 38.7/hour.  The lake even has big bullheads.  Yellow bullhead averaged 12.1 inches and there were lots of them (31.6/net).  The present fish population looks good.  Fair to good numbers along with quality sized fish should provide plenty of angling opportunity at Minniebelle Lake.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnie-Belle is a medium sized lake (596 acres) located south of the City of Litchfield in Meeker County. Minnie-Belle has five miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 49 feet. A state owned public access, with two cement boat ramps, and a moderate amount of parking is present on the north shore. Water clarity is good and submergent vegetation is plentiful at Minnie-Belle. Shore fishing is allowed at the state owned Minnie-Belle Lake Aquatic Management Area on the north end of the lake. Spring trap net and electrofishing surveys were conducted on Minnie-Belle Lake during May 2021. Trap nets were used to target Bluegill and Black Crappie. Electrofishing was used to target Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nA new reduced bag limit (5 fish) regulation went into effect on March 1, 2022. Size structure of Bluegill is thought to have declined over the decades at Minnie-Belle Lake and the new regulation should limit harvest enough to improve sunfish sizes over time. Good numbers of Bluegill were collected and fish were 3 to 9 inches long, averaging 6 inches. Approximately 23% of the sample was 7 inches or longer, indicating that fair numbers of keeper-sized fish were present. Bluegill anglers can find the sunnies throughout Minnie-Belle's submergent vegetation beds. Bigger Bluegill are often found off the deep weed edge. Trying dragging a waxworm under a sinker in 10 to 14 feet of water in mid-summer if you cannot find the big sunfish up shallow. <br> \n <br> \nLower numbers of Black Crappie were collected, but average size was impressive at 12 inches. The longest crappie collected was almost 15 inches in length. Crappie can be tough to find at Minnie-Belle, but when you do locate them, it can lead to some memorable fishing. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of Largemouth Bass were collected during the electrofishing survey, with fish averaging 12 inches in length. Minnie-Belle is known for its action oriented bass fishing, with anglers typically catching many medium and smaller sized fish. The longest bass sampled in this 2021 assessment was 17 inches, but bass anglers know that bigger fish are occasionally encountered. Bass recruitment appeared to be consistent most years. Twitching crankbaits, slow-rolling spinner baits, buzz baits and a jig-and-a-pig will all take Minnie-Belle bass. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Minnie-Belle Lake has Eurasian watermilfoil and Zebra mussels present. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

It has a maximum depth of 47 feet, a median depth of 23 feet, and 36 percent is shallower than 15 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake, as indicated by the 1957 test netting, contains an above average population of bluegills; about average for walleyes, largemouth bass, pumpkinseeds, black crappies, carp, and bullheads; and low for northern pike and perch.  The growth rate is about average for all species except bluegills, which are somewhat slow growing.  All fish except walleyes and northern pike have good reproduction each year.  There appears to be some correlation between walleye stocking and year-classes present. <br> \n <br> \nThe above information indicates the lake is a bass-panfish-walleye lake.  Primary management considerations should be given to the northern pike with walleyes a secondary consideration.</p>",
