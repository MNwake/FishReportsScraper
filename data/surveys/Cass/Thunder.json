                "narrative": "<p>Little Thunder Lake is a 270 acre lake located about 6 miles south of Remer in Cass County.  There is a public access on the southwest corner of the lake.  As of 1988 when the last survey was completed, there were 26 homes/cabins along 6 miles of shoreline.  The maximum depth is 72' and about 30% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist of sand, gravel, marl, and muck.  Aquatic plants are relatively abundant in the shallow water areas adjacent to the shoreline.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.Northern pike were caught in below average numbers in 2002 at 1.5/gill net, which is similar to past catches.  The 1997 and 1998 year classes each contributed 27% of the catch with most of these fish measuring 19.5\" to 25.5\".  Average length and weight were 26.0\" and 6.5lbs.  The bluegill catch of 9.8/trap net was similar to past catches and average when compared to other lakes.  Growth was slow after the first year and 19% of trap netted bluegills measured 7\" or larger, compared to 6.5% in 1988.  Black crappie abundance was average in 2002 at 0.9/trap net.  Average weight was 0.3lbs and 75% of the fish sampled were 8\" or larger.Yellow perch abundance was below average at 0.8/gill net.  However, this is the first time perch have been sampled in gill nets and likely reflects fish stocked as adults the previous winter.  Small perch were occasionally caught in 2002 during August shoreline sampling.Walleye, largemouth bass, and tullibee have all been caught in past nettings, but none were sampled in 2002.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Thunder is a 270 acre lake located 6 miles southeast of Remer in Cass County.  The lake reaches depths of 72', with 30% shallower than 15'.  A public access is located on the southwest shore.  Development is moderate on the western basin, with the remainder of the lake having light development.  A 2009 vegetation survey found a diverse plant community.  Emergent plant beds are located around much of the shoreline.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was low at 0.3/gillnet.  Although the northern population is low some nice fish are present.  Northern pike up to 32\" were captured. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie trapnet catch was low at 0.7/net.  The average length was 7.9\", with crappies 10\" or greater accounting for 60% of the catch.  The bluegill trapnet catch of 3.7/net was also low.  Average length was 5.9\", with 23% measuring at least 7\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nTulibee (cisco) were captured in average numbers at 1.3/gillnet.  Average length was 16.4\".  Tulibee (cisco) are a great forage fish for larger predator fish such as northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Little Thunder Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect their equipment and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
