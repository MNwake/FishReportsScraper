                "narrative": "<p>     Wimar Lake is a 275 acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north central Otter Tail County, approximately four miles northeast of Vergas, MN.  The maximum depth is 58 feet, and 39% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disc reading, a measure of water clarity, was 9.5 feet.  Previous readings have ranged from 6.0 to 10.0 feet.  There is a state owned dam at the outlet on the south end of the lake,   and the outlet flows into the Otter Tail River. There is no public access to the lake. <br> \n     Most of the shoreline is developed, with the exceptions of the south shore and a portion of the east shore.  Shoalwater substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel. Hardstem bulrush exists at several locations around the lake. These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.  <br> \n     Wimar Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish lake, and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  Suitable spawning habitat for these species exists throughout the lake.   <br> \n     Walleye are present in Wimar Lake; however, abundance is low. <br> \n     Northern pike are not abundant in the lake, but the size structure is good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 20.9 to 35.6 inches, with a mean length and weight of 27.3 inches and 4.8 pounds.  Northern pike growth rates are good with an average length of 23.1 inches at age four. <br> \n     Bluegill are abundant, with a trap net catch rate of 127.4 per net, well above that expected for similar lakes.  Average length of bluegill from trap nets was 6.6 inches, and they attain a length of 4.8 inches at age four.   <br> \n     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Yellow perch and bluegill numbers exceeded both sets of net medians. Bluegill numbers have increased with the average weight per fish declining. There has been three surveys since 1969, with the walleye per net catch remaining below 2.0 per net. The yellow perch population appears to be strong enough to support a healthy predator population.</p>",

Other area lakes in this class include:  Middle Leaf, Pebble, Silver, Walker and Wall. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance has increased slightly since the 1986 survey; although, the number per gill net lift (1.8) is below the normal range for this lake class.  The average individual weight of pike has increased from 2.1 pounds in 1986 to 2.6 pounds. <br> \n      Bluegill population dynamics appear to be quite stable.  The number per trap net lift decreased slightly from 46.8 in 1986 to 43.1, remaining in the normal range.  Bluegill recruitment appears consistent as seven consecutive year classes were present in the sample.  Six percent of the bluegills measured were greater than seven inches in length compared to 1% in 1986.  <br> \n     Black crappie abundance has also remained stable (1.8 per trap net lift in 1986 compared to 1.7 in 1991) and remains within the normal range.  Expanded age data for crappie indicates consistent reproduction as three consecutive year classes were present in the sample as well as a strong 1989 year class (age-II), which composed 76% of the sample.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance decreased slightly from 28.3 per gill net lift in 1986 to 26.5, which is within the normal range.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance increased from 1.3 per gill net lift in 1986 to 2.3, remaining within the normal range.  Mean weight of individual walleye increased from 1.8 pounds in 1986 to 2.5 pounds.  It appears walleye reproduction is limited and that the population is supported through stocking.  While age-II walleye were present in the sample, it is unknown whether those fish are the result of reproduction or the 1990 fingerling stocking which contained yearling fish.  No walleyes were sampled from the 1987 stocking. <br> \n</p>",
