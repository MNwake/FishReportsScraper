THIS CPUE WAS ABOUT ONE-THIRD LESS THAN THAT FROM 1989.  MEAN WEIGHT OF WALLEYES CAPTURED IN 1990 DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE CAPTURED IN 1989 (P=0.05).  GROWTH, PARTICULARLY OF AGE ONE THROUGH THREE FISH, WAS LESS IN 1990 THAN THAT RECORDED IN 1989.  ALL AGE CLASSES WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLING.  FRY STOCKINGS IN 1986 AND 1989 SEEM TO HAVE BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL.  THERE APPEARS TO BE A FAIR AMOUNT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION OCCURRING IN TALCOTT LAKE, AS SHOWN BY THE AGE DISTRIBUTION.  THE YELLOW PERCH CPUE OF 1.40 FISH PER GILL NET WAS SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 18.50. YELLOW PERCH CATCH RATES HAVE DECLINED IN THE LAST TWO SURVEYS,  FROM A CPUE OF 16.5 IN 1985. YELLOW PERCH GROWTH WAS SLIGHTLY BETTER IN 1990 THAN IN 1989 AND CONSIDERABLY BETTER THAN THOSE FISH COLLECTED IN THE 1985 SURVEY.  THIS MAY BE DUE TO A LOWERED POPULATION DENSITY AND THE RESULTING LACK OF COMPETITION FOR FOOD. THE BLACK CRAPPIE TRAP NET CATCHES ALSO DECLIN- ED FROM 1989 AND 1985 LEVELS.  CPUE IS NOW FOUR TIMES LESS THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN, A NINETY PERCENT DECLINE FROM 1985.  GROWTH OF BLACK CRAPPIES REMAIN HIGH, PARTICULARY OF AGE ONE AND THREE FISH. TALCOTT LAKE HAS A HIGH ABUNDANCE OF COMMERICALLY VALUABLE FISH, CATCH RATES OF COMMON CARP, QUILLBACK, WHITE SUCKERS AND BIGMOUTH BUFFALO ALL EXCEEDED LOCAL MEDIANS.  BLACK BULL- HEAD TRAP NET CATCHES AVERAGED 47.4 FISH PER NET, ABOUT HALF THE LOCAL MEDIAN. NO NORTHERN PIKE WERE COLLECTED IN GILL NETS, HOWEVER, EIGHT WERE CAUGHT IN TRAP NETS.  THIS RESULTS IN A CPUE OF 1.0, JUST ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 0.60.  THE MEAN WEIGHT PER SET WAS TWICE THE LOCAL MEDIAN HOWEVER.  ALL FISH COLLECT- ED WERE 16 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH OR GREATER, PROBABLY AGE THREE FISH OR OLDER.  THE LARGE CATTAIL MARSH SURROUNDING THE NORTH SHORE OF TALCOTT LAKE MAY REPRESENT SOME OF THE BEST NORTHERN PIKE SPAWNING HABITAT IN THE AREA, HOWEVER, LOW WATER LEVELS IN RECENT YEARS MAY HAVE PREVENTED SPAWNING IN THIS AREA.  NO YOUNG- OF-THE-YEAR OR AGE ONE FISH WERE COLLECTED IN 1989 OR 1990.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Talcot Lake is part of a state-owned wildlife refuge and management area.  The lake covers 678-acres and is approximately 2 miles long.  The Des Moines River enters and exits the lake though a large marsh area on the north side.  The bottom substrate is predominantly sand and submerged vegetation is limited.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye.Walleye numbers remain high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Walleye sampled in our gillnets ranged in length from 9 to 26 inches with an average of 16 ? inches.  Walleye were last stocked in 1989.Northern pike numbers are considered low compared to other area lakes.  Northern pike collected in trapnets ranged in length from 18 to 25 ? inches with an average of approximately 21 inches.  Although numbers are low, the pike population appears healthy and self-supporting.  Northern pike were last stocked in 1983.Black crappie continue to fare well in Talcot Lake.  Crappie numbers remain normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  Crappie collected in our trapnets ranged in length from 5 to 13 ? inches.  A good number of crappie should be in the 12 inch range for the 1996 summer fishing season.  Black crappie were last stocked in 1982.Yellow perch numbers remain relatively low since our last survey in 1991.  The low perch population may be associated with the relatively high walleye population.  In theory, walleye predation on perch may limit yellow perch population growth.  Yellow perch collected in gillnets ranged in length from 6 to 10 ? inches with an average of almost 9 inches.  Although low in abundance, yellow perch appear healthy and self-supporting.  Good numbers of young of the year yellow perch were present during our survey in 1995.  Yellow perch were last stocked in 1988.   Bullhead numbers have declined since our last survey in 1991 and are currently considered low compared to other area lakes.  The population decline may be in part attributed to poor natural reproduction probably during 1992 and 1993 when relatively cool weather patterns predominated.  Additionally, commercial fishermen removed more than 11,500 lbs. of black bullhead between 1992-94.  Bullhead sampled in our trapnets ranged in length from 7 to 12 inches.Talcot lake also supports normal numbers of carp and bigmouth buffalo.  Commercial fishermen removed more than 200,000 lbs. of carp and buffalo in the past five years.Other species observed in our nets during the 1995 lake survey include white crappie, quillback, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Talcot Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Talcot Lake is an 873-acre shallow southern Minnesota lake located near the town of Dundee in Cottowood County. The lake has a maximum depth of 6 feet and a large watershed, meaning that Talcot Lake receives high amounts of runoff from its watershed. Water quality in Talcot Lake is typically poor with less than 0.5 foot of clarity in July 2016.  The West Fork of the Des Moines River runs through Talcot Lake, providing a diversity of habitats for fish. Talcot Lake occasionally experiences partial fish kills; however, they typically are not severe. A fish kill occurred during the winter of 2013-2014, but was not severe. Talcot Lake is managed for walleye, black crappie, yellow perch, and northern pike. The walleye population in Talcot Lake is self-sustaining and has not been stocked since 1989.  Populations of black crappie, yellow perch, and northern pike mostly sustain themselves; however, northern pike fingerlings were stocked in 2011 to supplement the population. A fish netting survey was conducted during the week of July 11, 2016 using 3 gill nets and 11 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were caught at a rate of 20.7 per gill net and 2.4 per trap net in 2016.  The gill net catch rate was above the normal range for Talcot and the trap net catch rate was within the normal range.  The gill net catch rate was the second highest on record after an all-time high of 21.4 per gill net in 1989.  Gill nets are more effective at sampling Walleye.  Walleye in the gill net sample ranged in length from 11 to just under 23 inches with a mean length near 15.5 inches, a perfect size for anglers.  Most Walleye were in the 12 to 17 inch range.  The overall condition of the Walleye in the gill net and trap nets was good, indicating fish are finding adequate food.  Overall the Walleye population is healthy with decent sized fish present.  Excellent angling should be present when the bite is hot, target this lake right after Walleye opener in the spring and in the fall for best success.  Target nearshore points and flowing water in the spring and shallow flats in the fall.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are a part of the fish community in Talcot Lake, but not at levels that will lead to anglers catching their limits.  Black crappie catch rates have been low since the 2006 survey.  The catch rates were no different in 2016 with a gill net catch rate of 1 per net and a trap net catch rate of 1.6 per net.  Black Crappie in the trap nets ranged from 5 to 9 inches with a mean length of 7 inches.  Two size groups were present, 4.5 to 6.5 inches and 8.5 to 9.5 inches, showing 2 ages present in the lake.  Overall the body condition and plumpness of each fish was excellent indicating good health with fish finding abundant food.  While the Black Crappie population is down, the few remaining are of good condition and should add to the fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are abundant in Talcot Lake.  The Yellow perch gill net catch rate in 2016 was the highest on record since sampling began in 1985.  To further verify those abundances, the trap net catch rate was the second highest on record.  While numbers are high, more small fish than large fish should be expected by anglers.  Fish in the sample ranged in length from 5 to 10 inches in the gill nets with a mean length of just over 6.5 inches, but most fish were in the 5 to 7 inch range.  Several years of good growth and survival of the Yellow Perch could result in some excellent angling in Talcot Lake.  Fishing for Yellow Perch is usually best through the ice in southwest Minnesota and targeting these perch during the 2017-2018 winter period could yield excellent results.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were not abundant in the 2016 sample.  Only 8 Northern Pike were caught.  Lake temperature during the July survey was 75.7 degrees Fahrenheit which is fairly high for Northern Pike to be actively moving and susceptible to nets.  However, the catch rates were not the lowest observed on Talcot Lake.  Regardless, the catch rate was low, indicating a potentially reduced population of Northern Pike or a non-active population during sampling.  On the positive side, sizes of Northern Pike were good with fish ranging in length from 23 to 32 inches.  The 2016 precipitation year was high which will likely provide increased spawning habitat for northern pike in the spring of 2017.  Additionally, the overall condition of the fish in the sample was decent indicating fish are finding food, most likely the abundant White Sucker in the lake.  Angling for a large Northern Pike in Talcot Lake could be good.  Don't expect them to be too hungry tough, the White Sucker catch rate was the highest ever observed in the lake.     <br> \n   <br> \nOther species caught in the gill nets and trap nets was Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Channel Catfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, Quillback Carpsucker, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  Species to make particular note about are Black Bullhead, Channel Catfish, and White Sucker.  Black Bullhead up to 11 inches can be found in Talcot Lake and should be a bonus for anglers looking to target Black Bullhead.  In the same way, Channel Catfish provide a unique angling experience and fish from up to 25 inches were found in the lake.  Surprisingly, White Sucker were very abundant in 2016 with a gill net catch rate over 130 per net.  White Sucker ranged in length from 6 to 17 inches with a mean length of 12 inches.  White Sucker should provide a good forage base for Walleye and Northern Pike in Talcot Lake.  In turn, growth of Walleye and Northern Pike should be excellent and create potential trophy Walleye and Northern Pike over the next several years.     <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the status of species in Talcot Lake is good with greater than average abundances of Walleye and Yellow Perch.  In addition, Black Crappie and Northern Pike add to anglers catches at times and can be seasonally abundant when conditions are right.  Non-managed species including Black Bullhead and Channel Catfish will add to the fishery and White Sucker add a solid forage base for the Walleye and Northern Pike.  Conditions in water quality and clarity should be a long-term goal in Talcot Lake.  Buffers on ditches and streams upstream of Talcot Lake on the West Fork of the Des Moines River as well as use of cover crops would help improve conditions over time and reduce unnecessary nutrient loading.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Talcot Lake is a 678-acre, class 43 lake located near the Town of Dundee in Cottonwood County.  The West Fork of the Des Moines River runs through the lake.  Lake systems with some connectivity to rivers create unique and often dynamic fish populations due to the diversity of habitat created by the river's flow.  Talcot Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Black Crappie.  Talcot Lake has a self-sustaining Walleye population and therefore has not been stocked with Walleye since 1989; however, some Walleye do drift to Talcot Lake from Lake Shetek especially during higher precipitation years.  Genetic analysis of Walleye tissue samples collected in 2017 showed that many of the fish sampled came downstream from Shetek, but some natural reproduction also occurred.  Walleye natural reproduction checks using an electrofishing boat have been conducted periodically since 1995.  A nighttime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 10, 2021 to determine if a year-class was produced either by natural reproduction or drift from Shetek.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 60.0 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that Walleye naturally reproduced or moved down the river from Lake Shetek.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 6.3 to 8.9 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  Genetic analysis of those fin clips of the young-of-the-year Walleye tells us no Walleye drifted from Lake Shetek this year or very little did.  Additionally the young-of-the-year Walleye were naturally reproduced and over half the fish were \"Lake Sarah\" strain genetically.   If they survive the winter, the 2021 year class should be a strong year class in the Talcot Lake Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",

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

                "narrative": "<p>Talcot is a 678-acre lake located near the town of Dundee in Cottonwood County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 8.5 feet and is a class 43 lake.  The west fork of the Des Moines River runs through the lake.  Lake systems with some connectivity to rivers create unique and often dynamic fish populations due to the ever changing availability of habitat created by the river\u0019s flow.  Talcot is managed primarily for walleye while northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie are managed secondarily.  Talcot has a self-sustaining walleye population and therefore has not been stocked with walleye since 1990. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population looks good when compared to other lakes similar to Talcot.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 12 to 20.5 inches with an average length of almost 16 inches.  Four year classes from 2001 to 2004 were observed during the survey indicating good recruitment. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers are down a bit compared to the assessments in 1999 and 2002. Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets averaged just under 9 inches.  Age 2 and age 3 yellow perch were caught during the survey. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were down some from previous years also.  Lengths of northern pike caught in our trap nets ranged from 15 to 28 inches and averaged about 21.5 inches.  Four different ages of northern pike from 2002 to 2005 were observed during the assessment. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie population looks good and is similar to crappies in other lakes with similar characteristics as Talcot.  Lengths of black crappie caught in our trap nets ranged from 4.7 to 11.7 inches and averaged 7.2 inches.  Five different ages of black crappie were observed during the assessment.  Most of the fish caught were age 1 and 2. <br> \n <br> \nThe channel catfish population is quite high compared to other lakes like Talcot.  Lengths of channel catfish caught in our gill nets ranged from 5.7 to 26 inches with an average length of 11.3 inches.  Six ages of channel catfish were observed during the assessment.  The population was comprised of 2 year old fish and fish 6 to 10 years old. <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead population is low compared to other lakes like Talcot.  Lengths of black bullhead sampled in trap nets ranged from 4.5 to 12.2 inches with an average length of 8.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during the assessment included common carp, orangespotted sunfish, quillback carpsucker, white crappie, white sucker, bigmouth buffalo, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Talcot Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Talcot Lake is a 678-acre lake located near the town of Dundee in Cottonwood County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 8.5 feet.  The West Fork of the Des Moines River runs through the lake.  The watershed-to-lake ratio for Talcot Lake is 183 to 1 and includes Kinbrae Lake, Lime Lake, and Lake Shetek.  This basically means that 183 upland acres contribute directly to 1 surface area acre of Lake Talcot and means that whatever nutrients and pollutants run off of those 183 acres accumulates in 1 acre of Talcot Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nLake systems with some connectivity to rivers and lakes create unique and often dynamic fish populations due to the ever changing availability of habitat.  Talcot is managed primarily for walleye while northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie are managed secondarily.  Talcot Lake has a self-sustaining walleye population and therefore hasn\u0019t been stocked since 1989.  Talcot Lake has been aerated in the winter months every year since 1990, during the winter of 2010-2011 no aeration was conducted. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate in Talcot Lake was 16.7 fish/gill net, which was within the expected catch range for lake class 43 (2.3 to 18.1 fish/gill net) but greater than the long-term average of 15.1 fish/gill net since 1995.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.7 to 23.1 inches with a mean length of 14.2 inches.  The walleye management goal was exceeded on Talcot Lake.  The condition of the walleye was as expected, which indicates the walleye population is foraging successfully.  The walleye population in Talcot Lake is currently exhibiting an above average size structure at an abundance that surpasses the management goal. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate was 0.2 fish/trap net (n=2) with no northern pike caught in the gill nets.  The two northern pike that were caught were between 8 and 10 inches and were age 0 fish.  Adult northern pike have been reported by anglers and the lack of adult northern pike in the nets was most likely due to the time of sampling.  It appears that there is adequate reproduction in Talcot Lake for northern pike to sustain a population.  Commercial fishing reports indicates a relatively consistent population of northern pike that is upstream of Talcot, which move throughout the system.  Fishing for northern pike on Talcot Lake should be good in the upcoming years. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate was 5.3 fish/gill net, which was within the expected catch range for lake class 43 (2.7 to 25.0 fish/gill net) and equal to the long-term average catch rate of 5.4 fish/net since 1995.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 8 to 12 inches with a mean length of 10 inches.  The yellow perch size structure indicated a population of yellow perch was dominated by fish greater than 8 inches, possibly showing a population that has experienced decreased natural reproduction in recent years or increased mortality of smaller fish in recent years.  The overall condition of the yellow perch was good and indicated a population that is foraging successfully.  The outlook for yellow perch fishing in the next couple years looks great. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate in 2010 was 5.9 fish/trap net, which was within the expected catch range for lake class 43 (1.2 to 20.5 fish/trap net) but less than the long-term average catch rate of 13.5 fish/trap net since 1995.  Black crappie total lengths ranged from 5 to 12 inches with a mean length of 8 inches.  The black crappie population size structure was good and indicated a balanced number of smaller to larger fish.  The overall condition of black crappie was excellent and indicated a population of fish that is foraging successfully.  The outlook for black crappie fishing is good, black crappie larger than 12 inches could become more common in the next few years. <br> \n <br> \nDue to the connection with the West Fork of the Des Moines River, Talcot Lake is home to many fish species.  In addition to walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie, 9 more species were collected in nets for a total of 13 species.  The 9 other species sampled were bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, brown bullhead, channel catfish, common carp, orangespotted sunfish, quillback carpsucker, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Talcot Lake has an abundant and diverse fish community made up of unique non-game fish and popular game fish over a range of sizes.  Talcot Lake has much to offer in addition to fishing, including camping and picnicking, with a county park on the south shore of the lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Talcot Lake is an 873-acre lake, located near the town of Dundee in Cottonwood County. The lake has a maximum depth of 6.0 feet and a watershed-to-lake ratio of 183-to-1, meaning that Talcot Lake receives high amounts of runoff from its watershed. Water quality in Talcot Lake is poor, likely attributable to large amounts of nutrient input and sediment runoff from its large upstream watershed. The Des Moines River runs through Talcot Lake, providing a diversity of habitats for fish. Because of its shallowness and high biological oxygen demand Talcot Lake occasionally experiences partial fish kills, with the last one occurring during the winter of 2013-2014.  Talcot Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike. The Walleye population in Talcot Lake is self-sustaining as stocking has not occurred since 1989.  Populations of Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike mostly sustain themselves; however, Northern Pike fingerlings were stocked in 2011 to supplement the population. A survey was conducted during the week of July 20, 2020 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 Walleye catch rate was 25.0 per gill net, the second highest catch rate observed at Talcot Lake and exceeded the expected catch rate for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Seven year classes of Walleye were sampled, including fish from 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.  Fifty-five percent of the sampled Walleye were age-2 (2018), and 24 percent of the sampled Walleye were age-3 (2017).  Walleye have not been stocked since 1989, as it is sustained through a combination of natural reproduction and downstream drift from Lake Shetek stockings (documented through genetic analysis in 2017); however, Shetek was not stocked in 2018, which indicates that the 2018 year class is from natural reproduction.  Lengths of Walleye in Talcot Lake ranged from 9.8 inches to 27.2 inches and averaged 15.7 inches.  Walleye growth was very fast as mean length age-2 was 14.4 inches and mean length at age-3 was 18.9 inches.  The abundant Walleye population should provide a great angling opportunity at Talcot Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nSince 1985, Black Crappie catch rates have varied from 1.6 per trap net to 21.5 in 2002 and have averaged 10.2 per trap net over the long term.  In 2020, Black Crappie were captured at a rate of 5.5 per trap net, an increase from the 2016 catch rate of 1.6 per trap net, and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  Average length of Black Crappie was small (7.1 inches, ranging from 5.1 to 12.8 inches.  Based on the length frequency histogram, it appears that there are at least four year classes of Black Crappie, indicating that natural reproduction is maintaining the population.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow perch catch rate decreased from 24.0 per gill net in 2016 to 1.7 per gill net in 2020, the second lowest catch rate in survey history, and below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  The high Walleye abundance may be affecting Yellow Perch abundance because Yellow Perch are an important forage species for Walleye.  Yellow Perch lengths from gill nets and trap nets ranged from 5.0 to 10.1 inches and averaged 8.3 inches.  Only one Yellow Perch less than 7.0 inches was sampled indicating that natural reproduction has been limited in recent years.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates in Talcot Lake have historically been 1.0 or less per gill net, except in 2002 when the catch rate was 4.0 per gill net.  In 2020, the catch rate was 0.7 per gill net, which is less than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 17.4 to 22.2 inches and averaged 20.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 5.3 per trap net, the first time that Bluegills have been sampled in Talcot Lake.  Lengths of Bluegill ranged from 3.4 to 8.6 inches and averaged 7.5 inches.  The Black Bullhead catch rate was 123.0 per gill net, the third highest catch rate observed and above the long term average of 74.6 per gill net.  Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 5.2 to 10.6 inches and averaged 7.7 inches.  Channel catfish were captured at a rate of 3.3 per gill net, which is the lowest catch rate in two decades.  Channel Catfish lengths ranged from 16.7 to 27.3 inches and averaged 22.3 inches.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, Largemouth Bass, Orangespotted Sunfish, Quillback, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

THE 1989 CPUE IS ALSO APPROXIMATELY TWICE THAT FOUND IN 1985. THE MEAN WEIGHT OF THE WALLEYE CAPTURED DURING THE 1989 SURVEY WAS 1.81 POUNDS. THE PRESENT WALLEYE STOCK IS COMPRISED OF SEVEN DIFFERENT COHORTS WITH AGE TWO AND THREE DOMINATING. THE AGE TWO FISH APPAR- ENTLY AROSE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION OCCURRING IN THE TALCOTT LAKE WATERSHED. THE AGE THREE FISH MAY HAVE ARISEN FROM 1,000,000 FRY STOCKED IN THE SPRING OF 1986. THE WALLEYE LENGTH-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION REFLECTS THE LARGE NUMBER OF AGES PRESENT IN THE STOCK. WALLEYE LENGTHS RANGE FROM 11.0 TO 26.0 INCHES THE STATE AVERAGE FOR FISH LESS THAN 20.0 INCHES. THE NORTHERN PIKE CPUE APPROXIMATES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AS WELL AS THE CPUE RECORDED IN 1985. THE NORTHERN PIKE CAPTURED IN THE GILL NETS AVERAGED 1.77 PDS. THE PRESENT NORTHERN PIKE STOCK, AS DEPICTED BY THE GILLNET CATCH, IS COMPRISED OF AGE ONE AND TWO FISH. FALL NORTHERN PIKE SAMPLED DURING THE SURVEY APPEAR TO BE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. GROWTH FOR ALL LENGTHS SAMPLED EXCEEDS THE STATE AVERAGE. THE BLACK CRAPPIE CPUE OF 8.14 FISH PER TRAP NET, ALTHOUGH SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN, IS 56% OF THAT RECORDED DURING THE 1985 SURVEY. THE MEAN WEIGHT OF THE BLACK CRAPPIE CAPTURED IN 1989 WAS 0.55 POUNDS AND IN 1985 IT WAS 0.47 PDS. THE PRESENT STOCK IS COMPRISED OF AGE ONE THROUGH SIX FISH WITH AGE THREE FISH DOMINATING. GROWTH RATES FOR TALCOTT LAKE BLACK CRAPPIE EXCEED THE STATE AVERAGE FOR FISH LESS THAN 8.0 INCHES. FROM EIGHT INCHES ON, GROWTH APPROXIMATES THE STATE AVERAGE. ALL FISH CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY APPEAR TO BE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. THE YELLOW PERCH CPUE OF 5.20 FISH PER GILL NET FALLS WITHIN THE FIRST QUARTILE OF ALL WINDOM AREA LAKES THAT CONTAIN PERCH. THE CPUE ALSO IS APPROXIMATELY 33% OF THAT RECORDED DURING THE 1985 SURVEY. THE AVERAGE WEIGHT OF THE YELLOW PERCH CAPTURED IN 1989 WAS 0.28 PDS AND IN 1985 IT WAS 0.14 PDS. THE PRESENT POPULATION IS COMPOS- ED OF AGE ONE THROUGH THREE FISH, HOWEVER, AGES TWO AND THREE MAKE UP 92.3% OF THE STOCK. YELLOW PERCH GROWTH EXCEEDS THE STATE AVERAGE FOR ALL LENGTHS SAMPLED DURING THE SURVEY. AGE ONE FISH APPEAR TO BE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. ALTHOUGH THREE YOY CHANNEL CATFISH WERE CAPTURED DURING THE 1989 NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECK ONLY ONE SEVEN INCH FISH WAS CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY. NO ADULT BLUEGILL WERE CAPTURED DURING THIS SURVEY HOWEVER, 151 YOY BLUEGILL WERE COLLECTED DURING THE NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECK. NO PREVIOUS REPRO- DUCTION CHECK HAS REPORTED THE PRESENCE OF BLUE- GILL. THE CARP, QUILLBACK CARPSUCKER AND BLACK BULLHEAD CPUE VALUES ALL FALL WITHIN THE FOURTH QUARTILE FOR WINDOM AREA LAKES THAT CONTAIN THOSE SURVEYS. IN FACT, THE QUILLBACK CPUE OF 3.57 FISH PER TRAP NET IS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED IN THE WINDOM AREA. THE WHITE SUCKER CPUE OF 6.00 IS THREE TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN BUT ONLY 43% OF THE CPUE RECORDED IN 1985.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nearshore fish community sampling (hereafter IBI sampling; seine, backpack electrofishing) was conducted July 15, 2016 to assess the reproductive capacity of the fish community and the overall health of the nearshore community in Talcot Lake.  The 2016 survey was in response to a previous survey in 2014 that resulted in a score that was just below the impairment threshold.  The 2016 survey will be used to verify if the score remains below or may be above the impairment threshold.   <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing and seining at 14, 100ft. long stations around the perimeter of Talcot Lake.  The seine hauls captured 18 species of fish (n=number of fish, YOY = young of year), including Bigmouth buffalo (n=7, 7 YOY), Black Bullhead (n=162, 158 YOY), Blackside Darter (n=4), Bluntnose Minnow (n=1), Brook Stickleback (n=6), Common Carp (n=24, 22 YOY), Fathead Minnow (n=470), Green Sunfish (n=5, 5 YOY), Iowa Darter (n=15), Johnny Darter (N=91), Orangespotted Sunfish (n=142), Quillback (n=21, 21 YOY), Sand Shiner (n=5), Tadpole Madtom (n=2), Walleye (n=21), White Sucker (n=24, 14 YOY), Yellow Bullhead (n=3, 3 YOY), and Yellow Perch (n=149, 133 YOY).  Species not sampled in 2016 that were sampled in 2014 in the seine samples were Spotfin Shiner and Black Crappie.  Backpack electrofishing captured 14 species of fish in 2016, including Iowa Darter (n=4), Johnny Darter (n=68), Bigmouth Buffalo (n=4), Black Bullhead (n=1), Blackside Darter (n=5), Common Carp (n=15), Fathead Minnow (n=166), Green Sunfish (n=4), Largemouth Bass (n=1), Orangespotted Sunfish (n=7), Quillback (n=4), Sand Shiner (n=3), Walleye (n=13), and White Sucker (n=5).  Species sampled in 2016 that were not sampled in the 2014 electrofishing sample were Black Bullhead and Orangespotted Sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \nOverall, Talcot Lake has remained relatively stable from 2014 to 2016 with little change in species composition in the lake.  The IBI score during 2014 was 35 (just below the threshold for impairment) and the IBI score during 2016 was 29.  Both scores remained below the threshold and indicate that the lake is under some environmental stress.  Most likely improvements in the fish community will be in the way of improving water quality and in lake and in river habitats.  Changes in the fish community should focus on increasing species that are not generalists, but specialists, such as darters and shiners.  Increases in those species types will create a unique and high quality forage base for other top predators, thus increasing or stabilizing their abundance as well.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Talcot Lake is a 678-acre lake located near the town of Dundee in Cottonwood County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 8.5 feet and is a class 43 lake.  The West Fork of the Des Moines River runs through the lake.  Lake systems with some connectivity to rivers create unique and often dynamic fish populations due to the ever changing availability of habitat created by the river's flow.  Talcot Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Black Crappie.  Talcot Lake has a self-sustaining Walleye population and therefore has not been stocked with Walleye since 1989; however, some Walleye do drift to Talcot Lake from Lake Shetek especially during higher precipitation years. Walleye natural reproduction checks using an electrofishing boat have been conducted periodically since 1995.  Because Talcot Lake is thought to be one of the only naturally reproducing Walleye lakes in the Windom area, some interest has been expressed in figuring out where Walleye are spawning in Talcot Lake, particularly if reproduction is occurring in the lake or in the river.  <br> \nThe catch rate of age-0 Walleye in 2016 was 189.3 fish per hour of electrofishing.  It is considered good natural reproduction when catch rates are 50 fish per hour or higher.  Catch rates have varied from a low of 1.0 fish per hour in 2003 to a high of 302.9 fish per hour in 2008 (see the historical catch rate table on next page).  Lengths of Walleye caught electrofishing in 2016 ranged from 7.7 to 10.0 inches and averaged 8.9 inches, which is considered excellent growth for an age-0 Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nHistorical Catch Rates for age-0 Walleye in Talcot Lake including total catch and mean length. <br> \n     Date\tTotal N\tMean Length\tCatch Rate (n/hour) <br> \n10/12/2016\t142\t8.9\t\t189.3 <br> \n10/7/2015\t46\t9.6\t\t 61.3 <br> \n10/29/2014\t149\t7.1\t\t197.1 <br> \n 10/7/2013\t152\t6.3\t\t150.2 <br> \n10/20/2011\t  18\t6.2\t  \t  14.0 <br> \n10/18/2010\t  69\t8.6\t\t  70.2 <br> \n  10/8/2008\t414\t8.1\t\t419.0 <br> \n10/11/2007\t  10\t7.2\t\t  10.0 <br> \n  10/4/2006\t  61\t6.3\t\t  81.3 <br> \n10/11/2004\t   7\t8.1\t  \t    9.3 <br> \n  10/7/2003\t   2\t7.0\t    \t    1.0 <br> \n  10/7/2002\t   3\t7.4\t \t    3.0 <br> \n  9/13/2001\t  77\t5.9\t\t 102.7 <br> \n  9/12/2000\t   8\t7.8\t \t    5.3 <br> \n  9/14/1999\t  19\t6.3\t  \t  12.7 <br> \n  9/21/1998\t  78\t6.8\t   \t  52.0 <br> \n  9/24/1997\t133\t5.7\t   \t  88.7 <br> \n  9/24/1996\t  77\t6.2\t   \t  54.4 <br> \n  9/27/1995\t  77\t6.1\t   \t  61.6 <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye is the primary species for management in Talcot Lake.  The walleye population appears to be quite healthy compared to other walleye populations in our area.  Walleye have not been stocked since 1989 which means most, if not all, of the walleye caught by anglers are naturally reproduced in the lake or river.  Walleye natural reproduction in Talcot Lake has been more consistent than in other area lakes which was probably the reason that eight year classes of walleye were recorded.  The average length of walleye sampled in gill nets was 14.5 inches.  There appears to be a strong year class of walleye in the 13 to 14 inch range that will be moving through the population for anglers to catch.  Average gill net catches were nearly 18.0 per net which means the long range goal and objectives for this lake were obtained.Northern pike numbers remain low which may be a result of poor aquatic vegetation habitat available.  Total lengths from northern pike sampled in trap nets ranged between 15.0 and 24.0 inches, with an average of 18.8.  Northern pike were last stocked in 1983.   The northern pike population appears to be self-supporting but at a low density.Black crappie appear to be the species to pursue in Talcot Lake this year.  The average length of black crappies from trap nets was 9.0 inches.  The average number of black crappie per trap net was 8.75 fish/net set which was fairly high for this type of lake.  Black crappies have not been stocked since 1982 which means the population is self-perpetuating.Yellow perch numbers have rebounded since the previous surveys.  Yellow perch gill net CPUE was 9.75 fish/net set which was considerably higher than previous surveys done in 1995 (1.75 fish/net set) and 1991 (2.00 fish/net set).  Total lengths of yellow perch ranged between 6.5 and 12.0 inches, with an average of 9.8.  Shoreline seineing found young of the year yellow perch present but in small numbers.  This information suggests that a sizable population of catchable yellow perch are ready be caught in Talcot Lake.The black bullhead population appear to be present but in low numbers compared to other area lakes.  Total lengths of black bullheads ranged between 8.0 and 12.0 inches in gill nets.  However, common carp appear to be present in high numbers compared to previous surveys.  Common carp numbers are not only present in high numbers but also the size structure of the population is large.  Great opportunities for kids to catch large fish.    To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Talcot Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Talcot Lake, near the town of Dundee in Cottonwood County, is a 678 acre lake that is managed primarily for walleye.  The west fork of the Des Moines River flows through Talcot Lake, thus providing opportunities for emigration and immigration of most fish.  Lake systems with some connectivity to rivers create unique and often dynamic fish populations due to the ever changing availability of habitat created by the river's changing flow.  Walleye fry or fingerlings have not been stocked in Lake Talcot since 1989 because of the consistent successful natural reproduction.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of July 29, 2002 using 3 gill nets and 8 trap nets.      The walleye gill net catch rate was within the expected range, with walleyes averaging 14.2 inches in length.  A majority of the fish captured in nets came from 2001 (Age 1).  Growth was adequate as an 18 inch fish would be 3 years old.  The average weight of walleyes was within the expected range.  Natural reproduction checks in fall of 2002 indicated some natural reproduction occurred.  The walleye population in Talcot Lake has been relatively consistent and appears to have a sufficient brood stock, but monitoring will continue for natural reproduction.  The bottom line or take home message is that Talcot Lake always seems to be a good destination for catching some nice eaters and the chances of catching trophy fish always exists.The northern pike catch rate was 4/set which was the highest ever recorded in Talcot Lake.  Northern pike averaged 19.1 inches which would be Age 2.  The increased abundance of the 2000 year class of northern pike was observed in other Windom Area lakes, which probably indicated spawning habitat was more available during that spring.  If you have been waiting to fish Lake Talcot until the northern pike numbers rebound, now is the time. In addition to the northern pike abundance being the highest ever recorded, the black crappie numbers are also the highest.  Total lengths averaged 9.5 inches which is a \"keeper\" for many anglers out there.  Six year classes of black crappie were captured with Age 1 (67%) dominating the catch.  As mentioned previously, more black crappies were seen in 2002 than ever before in Talcot Lake.  This cycle in abundance often happens with panfish populations in the pothole prairie region.  So, now is the time for fishing Lake Talcot. The yellow perch catch rate was 8.00/set which was average for this type of lake.  The fish averaged 7.0 inches in length.  The take home message is that there are other perch fisheries in the Windom Area that may be a better destination if you are targeting perch.    The black bullhead catch rate in gill nets was 188/set which was the second highest catch rate ever recorded on Talcot Lake.  Most of the fish are averaging just over 6 inches, so Talcot likely would not be the lake of choice for bullheads.The channel catfish catch rate was 5.33/set, which was also the highest ever recorded.  Channel catfish averaged 20.1 inches which could provide some excellent night time fishing expeditions, as most of the fish were relatively plump and healthy.  Other species captured during the survey were bimouth buffalo, brown bullhead, common carp, quillback carpsucker, white sucker, orangespotted sunfish, yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Talcot Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Ryan Doorenbos</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Talcot Lake is a 678-acre lake located near the town of Dundee in Cottonwood County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 8.5 feet and is a class 43 lake.  The West Fork of the Des Moines River runs through the lake.  Lake systems with some connectivity to rivers create unique and often dynamic fish populations due to the ever changing availability of habitat created by the river's flow.  Talcot Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Black Crappie.  Talcot Lake has a self-sustaining Walleye population and therefore has not been stocked with Walleye since 1989; however, some Walleye do drift to Talcot Lake from Lake Shetek especially during higher precipitation years. Walleye natural reproduction checks using an electrofishing boat have been conducted periodically since 1995.  Because Talcot Lake is thought to be one of the only naturally reproducing Walleye lakes in the Windom area, some interest has been expressed in figuring out where Walleye are spawning in Talcot Lake, particularly if reproduction is occurring in the lake or in the river.  A nighttime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 12, 2017 to determine if natural reproduction occurred in Talcot Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 61.9 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that Walleye naturally reproduced or fry drifted down the river from Lake Shetek.  Fin clip samples were collected from 50 Age 0 walleye and sent in for genetic analysis.  The results of those genetic tests revealed that nearly 90% of those fish were a byproduct of stocking.  This definitively proves that we see drift of walleye fry from upstream to Talcot.  Logically it would imply that most of these fish drifted from Lake Shetek which was stocked in 2017.   To further that point, Lake Shetek was electrofished in the fall of 2017 and had a catch rate of nearly 385 age-0 walleye/hr.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 6.1 to 8.4 inches and averaged 7.5 inches.  If they survive the winter, the 2017 year class should be a strong year class in the Talcot Lake Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",

LENGTH- FREQUENCY AND AGE DISTRIBUTION, COMBINED WITH SHORELINE SEINING SUGGEST THAT RECRUITMENT IS FAIRLY HIGH.  THE RECRUITMENT MAY BE NATURAL REPRODUCTION, OR COULD REPRESENT STOCKED FRY THAT WASHED DOWN FROM LAKE SHETEK DURING HIGH WATER. THE AGE STRUCTURE TABLE SHOWS STRONG YEAR CLASSES CORRESPONDING WITH FRY STOCKING.  COMPARISON OF YEAR CLASS STRENGTHS IN YEARS WITH STOCKING TO THOSE WITHOUT INDICATE THAT FRY STOCKING ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT HALF OF THE TOTAL CATCH.  IN OTHER WORDS, WITHOUT STOCKING, CPUE FOR WAE MIGHT BE CLOSE TO 15 PER GILLNET.  GROWTH RATES ARE CLOSE TO STATE AVERAGES.  ONLY TWO YEAR CLASSES OF YEP WERE REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLES AT A CATCH RATE O0 2.0/GILLNET.  THIS IS WELL BELOW STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS, AND SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE SINCE 1985 WHEN CATCH RATES WERE 16.5/GILLNET.  ADULT PERCH WERE STOCKED AT ABOUT 0.7 LB/ACRE IN 1987 AND 1988, BUT REPRODUCTION CONTINUES TO BE LOW, WITH YOY PERCH SCARCE IN 1991 SHORELINE SEINES. THE LACK OF OLDER YEAR CLASSES SUGGEST OVEREXPLOITATION, PERHAPS BY THE ABUNDANT WAE POPULATION.  TRAPNET CATCHES OF BLC WERE 4 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  ALTHOUGH FEW YOY CRAPPIE WERE FOUND IN SHORELINE SEINES, THE STRENGTH OF YOUNGER YEAR CLASSES SUGGEST GOOD RECRUITMENT.  FAIR NUMBERS OF LARGE CRAPPIE (OVER 11 INCHES) WERE COLLECTED IN TRAPNETS, AND ANGLERS REPORTED GOOD CATCHES OF LARGE CRAPPIE.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE HIGH GROWTH RATES REPORTED IN EARLIER SURVEYS. LARGE NUMBERS OF SMALL BLC MAY REPRESENT RECRUITMENT THAT WAS MISSED DUE TO SAMPLING ERROR, OR MAY INCLUDE FISH THAT MOVED INTO TALCOTT DURING PERIODS OF HIGH FLOW.  NO NOP WERE FOUND IN THIS SURVEY, ALTHOUGH PIKE ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN IN TALCOTT LAKE FROM PREVIOUS SURVEYS AND ANGLING REPORTS.  PIKE NUMBERS MAY BE DOWN BECAUSE OF POOR RECRUITMENT DURING THE DRY YEARS OR PIKE MAY HAVE DISPERSED UP THE DES MOINES RIVER.  NO YOY PIKE WERE FOUND IN SHORE LINE SEINES FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS.  BLB WERE ABUNDANT BUT BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS IN BOTH GILL NETS AND TRAP NETS.  CARP, WTS, AND QBS ALL EXCEEDED LOCAL MEDIANS.  BIB NUMBERS ARE DOWN FROM PREVIOUS SURVEYS AT LEVELS CLOSE TO LOCAL MEDIANS.  THE DROP IN BIB MAY BE PARTLY DUE TO PREDATION BY WAES.  ALMOST EVERY WAE WITH IDENTIFIABLE FISH REMAINS CONTAINED SMALL BUFFALO.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nTalcot Lake is a 678-acre lake located near the City of Dundee in Cottowood County. The lake has a maximum depth of 6.0 feet and a watershed to lake ratio of 183 to 1, meaning that Talcot Lake receives high amounts of runoff from its watershed. Water quality in Talcot Lake is poor (2014 secchi depth =0.5 ft), likely attributable to large amounts of nutrient input and sediment runoff from its large watershed. The Des Moines River runs through Talcot Lake, providing a diversity of habitats for fish. Because of its shallowness and high biological oxygen demand (BOD) Talcot Lake occasionally experiences partial fish kills; however, they typically are not severe. A fish kill occurred during the winter of 2013-2014, but was not severe, as several species of fish were sampled in ice out trap netting in the spring of 2014. Talcot Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black crappie, yellow perch, and northern pike. The walleye population in Talcot Lake is self-sustaining; therefore, stocking has not occurred since 1989. Populations of black crappie, yellow perch, and northern pike mostly sustain themselves; however, northern pike fingerlings were stocked in 2011 to supplement the population. A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 28, 2014 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 11 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nTalcot Lake has maintained one of the most stable walleye populations in southwest Minnesota, as catch rates have consistently been near the upper end of expected catch rates for similar lakes (18.1 per gill net). In 2014, the catch rate was 3.7 per gill net, which is the lowest walleye catch rate that has been observed on Talcot Lake, but is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net). The low catch rate is likely a result of the partial winterkill that occurred during the winter of 2013-2014. Despite the low abundance, it appears that the remaining walleye were able to produce a strong year class in 2014, as young-of-the-year walleye were captured at a rate of 197.1 per hour during fall electrofishing, which is the second highest catch of YOY walleye during a natural reproduction check. Walleyes ranged in length from 10.8 to 19.6 inches and averaged 15.1 inches. Four year classes of walleye were sampled including fish from 2013 (age-1), 2012 (age-2), 2011 (age-3), and 2010 (age-4). Back calculated lengths at age were 9.1 inches at age-1, 11.6 inches at age-2, 13.7 inches at age-3, 14.5 inches at age-4, which is relatively slow growth when compared to other similar lakes. Walleye were plump, indicating that they are foraging successfully. Natural reproduction checks will be conducted on an annual basis to monitor the recovery of the walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has historically been below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net), except in 2002 when they were captured at a rate of 4.0 per gill net. The trend continued in 2014, as pike were captured at a rate of 1.0 per gill net, below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes, and about average for Talcot Lake. Northern pike were relatively small, ranging in length from 17.6 to 23.5 inches and averaging 21.4 inches. Northern pike were plump, indicating that northern pike are foraging successfully. Given the abundant spawning habitat in Talcot Lake, natural reproduction should occur to maintain the northern pike population.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \nThe black crappie population has steadily declined in the last decade, decreasing from 21.5 per trap net in 2002, to 17.0 per trap net in 2006, to 5.9 per tap net in 2010, to 4.1 per trap net in 2014. The 2014 catch rate is the lowest observed catch rate of black crappies on Talcot Lake, but is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net). Black crappie were small, ranging in length from 5.0 to 11.3 inches and averaging 6.1 inches. One strong year class (5.0 to 6.9 inches) comprised nearly the entire sample (98 percent), and should help stabilize the population in the coming years. Black crappie recruitment tends to be highly variable and is often characterized as cyclic, with strong year classes reoccurring every three to five years. Populations are often comprised of one or two strong year classes because of this cyclic recruitment. Variable and cyclic recruitment often results in a \"boom-or-bust\" crappie fishery, where years of increased angler catch rates are followed by years of decreased angler catch rates.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nThe yellow perch population appears to be on the upswing in Talcot Lake, as yellow perch were captured at a rate of 17.3 per gill net, which is the highest yellow perch catch rate observed on Talcot Lake. The 2014 catch rate was over two-times greater than the long term average of catch rates (7.4 per gill net), and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net). Yellow perch were relatively small, ranging in length from 5.0 to 8.2 inches and averaging 7.0 inches. Yellow perch were plump, indicating that they are foraging successfully. Successful foraging should translate into fast growth which would make these yellow perch available to anglers in a year or two.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nWhite sucker were extremely abundant in the 2014 survey, being captured at rates of 73.0 per gill net and 16.8 per trap net. The 2014 catch rates greatly exceed expected ranges of catch rates for similar lakes (0.8 to 6.5 per gill net and 0.3 to 2.6 per trap net). Lengths of white sucker ranged from 6.1 to 17.9 inches and averaged 9.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe channel catfish population was nearly unchanged from 2010. In 2010, channel catfish were captured at a rate of 10.7 per gill net and in 2014 channel catfish were captured at a rate of 12.0 per gill net, which is slightly above Talcot Lake's long term average of 8.5 per gill net. Multiple year classes of channel catfish were present, as sizes ranged from 10.2 to 25.7 inches and averaged 16.0 inches. Talcot Lake's connection to the Des Moines River helps maintain the channel catfish population. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance remained low at 21.7 per gill net, which is below the long term average of 46.2 per gill net, and below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net). Lengths of black bullheads ranged from 5.4 to 11.8 inches and averaged 8.2 inches. Populations of walleye and channel catfish appear to be effective at controlling the black bullhead population in Talcot Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include bigmouth buffalo, common carp, quillback, green sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",
