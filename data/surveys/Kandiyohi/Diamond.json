                "narrative": "<p>A repeat Index of Biotic Integrity \"IBI\" survey was conducted from June 29-30, 2016 on Diamond Lake. One measure of a lake's health is the community of fish, plants and aquatic life it sustains. Certain species can't survive without clean water and a healthy habitat while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions. Examples of fish that require clean water are Tullibee, Rock Bass, and Bluegill.  Species that are tolerant to degraded habitat are Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish.  The more intolerant fish to degraded habitat you have in the sample, the higher the score will be.  An index of biological integrity (IBI) is a score that compares the types and numbers of fish or plants observed in a lake to what is expected for a healthy lake. <br> \n <br> \nDiamond is a moderately large (1,607 acres), productive, and moderately deep (27 feet maximum) lake with moderate submergent and emergent vegetation located in Kandiyohi County. Seine hauls were conducted at 11 IBI stations with a bag seine of 50 foot width and 1/8 inch bar mesh in depths of 3.5 feet or less. A 15 foot wide and 1/8 inch bar mesh bag seine was used at 2 IBI stations. Dense aquatic vegetation or soft sediments prohibited seining at 5 other IBI stations. Near shore electrofishing was conducted at all 18 IBI Stations with a back-pack unit in water depths generally less than 2 feet deep. The 18 IBI Stations were spaced equally apart around the entire shoreline of the lake in a variety of near shore habitats. Each station was approximately 100 feet long. Two back-pack electrofishing runs were conducted at 13 stations with the initial run of 100 feet near the shore-water interface in depths of < 1 foot and the second run of 100 feet long about 10-20 feet from shore in depths up to 2 feet. Five stations were back-pack electrofished each at a distance of 400 feet from a boat due to increased water depth, vegetation and a muck bottom. <br> \n <br> \nThere were 19 different fish species (16 species from back-pack electrofishing, 13 species from seining) were captured from electrofishing and seining combined in the repeat IBI survey. Approximately 20 different fish species (17 species from back-pack electrofishing, and 14 species from seining) were captured from electrofishing and seining combined in the initial IBI survey a week earlier. <br> \n <br> \nFish species captured during the repeat IBI survey included gamefish (i.e. Largemouth Bass), panfish (Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, and Hybrid Sunfish), large non-gamefish (Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Black Bullhead and Yellow Bullhead) and small non-gamefish (Tadpole Madtom, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Banded Killifish, Brook Silverside, Bluntnose Minnow and Fathead Minnow). Young of year species captured included Yellow Perch and Largemouth Bass in the seine hauls. Adult fish species captured only in seine hauls included Tadpole Madtom, Brook Silverside and Banded Killifish. Fish species captured only from electrofishing included Iowa Darter, Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp and Hybrid Sunfish. Northern Pike and Central Mudminnow were only captured in the initial IBI survey. Black bullhead were only captured in the repeat IBI survey. The various species captured in Diamond are indicative of species present in most Spicer Area lakes. <br> \n</p>",

WAE SHOWED AVERAGE GROWTH RATES, HAD ALL SIZE CLASSES REPRESENTED, AND APPEAR TO HAVE A STRONG 1989 YEAR CLASS WHICH COULD PROVIDE GOOD ANGLING IN 1992.  DIAMOND LAKE REGULARLY PRODUCES YEP CATCH INDICES THAT ARE HIGHER THAN MOST OTHER CLASS 27 LAKES (57.00 PER GN IN 1991).  THIS PROVIDES A LARGE FORAGE BASE FOR PREDATORS (GROWTH RATES FOR ALL PISCIVORES WERE EITHER AVERAGE OR ABOVE AVERAGE).  YEP GROWTH RATES WERE AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-3 AND ABOVE AVERAGE FOR AGE 4 (KEEPABLE SIZE YEP ARE HARVESTED).  THE NOP CATCH INDEX (2.67 PER GN) WAS LOWER THAN THE MAJORITY OF CLASS 27 LAKES, HOWEVER, THE CATCH INDEX (PARTICULARY LBS PER GN) APPEARS TO HAVE IMPROVED SLIGHTLY COMPARED TO THE 1987 SURVEY.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A STRONG 1989, 1990 YEAR CLASS BEING RECRUITED TO THE FISHERY.  THE BLC CATCH INDEX (6.00 PER GN) APPEARS TO HAVE IMPROVED COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS 3 SURVEYS AND WAS HIGHER IN 1991 THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 27 LAKES.  REPORTEDLY, THE FISHING SUCCESS HAS ALSO IMPROVED WITH CRAPPIE IN THE 2-3 LB.  CLASS BEING TAKEN (THESE SIZES WERE NOT SEEN IN THE SURVEY).  GROWTH RATES WERE ABOVE AVERAGE AFTER AGE 1.  THE BLG AND LMB STATISTICS SHOWED AVERAGE CATCH INDICES WITH AVERAGE TO ABOVE AVERAGE GROWTH RATES.  BLB AND YEB HAVE MEDIAN TO ABOVE MEDIAN CATCH INDICES FOR CLASS 27 LAKES AND A SIZE DISTRIBUTION SKEWED TO LARGE-SIZE INDIVIDUALS (12.0 INCHES AND GREATER). CAP TRAPNET CATCH INDICES (NUMBER AND PARTICULARLY LBS PER SET) WERE THE HIGHEST RECORDED FOR DIAMOND LAKE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Diamond is a moderate sized lake (1,565 acres) with a maximum depth of 27 feet. Waterclarity is fair. Nutrient levels are moderate compared to other local lakes. Agriculturalrunoff contributes most of the nutrient inputs via four inlets and several dairy/cattle farmslocated along the northwest, west, south shores. Other sources of nutrient inputs includeresidential lawn runoff and perhaps a few inadequate\\outdated septic systems. The outlet(northeast side) connects to the Middle Fork of the Crow River. Submergent vegetation speciesand densities are greatest along the north bay, east shore, and \"Dogfish Bay in the southeastportion of the lake. Curled pondweed (exotic species) often becomes overabundant and anuisance in the north portion of the lake. Blue-green algae blooms have been occurring morefrequently and with greater severity within recent years. Filamentous algae can also be aproblem especially within the \"Dogfish Bay\" Area and areas adjacent to the livestock farms.Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail) occurs mainly along the north shorepoint, east shoreline, and \"Dogfish Bay\". The shoalwater substrates are composed of sand andgravel throughout most of the lake. The southeast portion of the lake \"Dogfish Bay\" is mostlysilt, muck, and marl. The surrounding watershed area is composed mostly of agricultural rowcrops with small areas of mixed hardwoods, residential development, and marsh areas. Theshoreline is primarily a mixed hardwood fringe on flat to gradual slopes with lake lotsaround the majority of the lake with the exception of \"Dogfish Bay\". Several marsh areasexist adjacent to the lake (northwest, west, south, east shorelines).  Residentialdevelopment includes 355 homes/cabins, 1 resort (south shore), and Kandiyohi County Park #3(west shore).  Diamond Lake is a popular walleye, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, andlargemouth bass angling lake. It is also a popular recreational lake (swimming, boating,skiing, etc.). Past management activities have included the operation of a northern pikespawning area (Tait's Lake inlet) along the southwest shore, biennial walleye fingerlingstocking (about 1,200 lbs per stocking), monitoring of fish populations through lake surveysand specialized sampling, monitoring of harvest by anglers through a creel survey, monitoringof aquatic vegetation and water quality, and issuance of Commercial B permits for bullheadand carp removal. The Diamond Lake Association has taken an active role (i.e. enrolling inthe PCA Lake Assessment Program) in habitat and water quality protection.     Walleye abundance in 1994 (6.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.3 - 8.8fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (21.5 fish/gillnet). Thelargest walleye caught in the 1994 survey was 27.2 inches. The 1994 average size (16.4 inchesfrom gillnets and trapnets combined) was above the historical average (15.4 inches). However,there were no fish captured between 10 - 15 inch size range in 1994. There was poor naturalreproduction and survival of stocked year classes of walleye from 1990-92. Excellent naturalreproduction was documented in 1993 (88.0 fingerlings/hour, average size=6.9 inches),however, no yearlings (1992 year class) were captured. In 1994, natural reproduction was alsogood (54.4 YOY/hour, average size=6.4 inches). It appears there was good survival of the 1993year class as indicated by fall electrofishing in 1994 (48.8 yearlings/hour, averagesize=10.6 inches). Growth rates appear good for walleye compared to other local lakes.Angling success for walleye should improve beginning in the summer/fall of 1995 due tomoderate yellow perch forage abundance (less competition for anglers) and fish starting toreach catchable size (13 - 15 inches). Quality angling should probably peak in 1996-97.      Northern pike abundance in 1994 (5.8 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (2.8 -9.0 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but slightly above the historical average (5.1fish/gillnet). The 1994 average size (21.6 inches, 2.8 lbs from gillnets and trapnetscombined) was slightly above the historical average (21.0 inches, 2.5 lbs). The largestnorthern pike captured in 1994 survey was 33.5 inches. There appears to be good 1993 and 1992year classes of northern pike present. The northern pike spawning area production estimatesfor 1993 and 1992 could not be determined due to high water flows. There were no fishcaptured from 1989 and 1987 year classes when the northern pike spawning area produced goodnumbers of fish. Intense fishing pressure for northern pike within the lake probably resultsin few fish reaching greater than five years of age. Growth rates appear good compared toother local lakes.     Yellow perch abundance in 1994 (28.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (7.0 -46.3 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, but below the historical average (50.2 fish/gillnet).The 1994 average size (5.9 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was below thehistorical average (6.6 inches). There appears to be a relatively abundant 1992 year classpresent. Growth rates appear average.     Bluegill abundance in 1994 (3.2 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (4.4 - 49.0fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (15.6 fish/trapnet).However, the 1994 average size (7.4 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was thehighest recorded value (historical average 5.5 inches). The largest bluegill captured was10.1 inches. Abundance of preferred (>8.0 inches) size bluegill was the highest recordedvalue (1.2 fish/net, gillnets and trapnets combined). Growth rates appear excellent. Therewere reports of good angling success for 1/2 - 3/4 lbs bluegill during the 1994 summer.     Black crappie abundance in 1994 (6.3 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (0.4 - 2.3fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (4.0 fish/trapnet). The 1994average size (4.9 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was below the historicalaverage (7.0 inches). The largest black crappie caught was 13.7 inches. There appears to bea strong 1993 year class present. About 94% of the black crappie captured were from the 1993year class. Perhaps in two-three years this year class will be of catchable size (> 9inches). Growth rates appear good compared to other local lakes.     Largemouth bass abundance was low-moderate (9.3 fish/hour) and was slightly below the1991 spring electrofishing survey (14.4 fish/hour). The 1994 average size (14.4 inches, 2.0lbs) was above the 1991 survey (13.8 inches, 1.6 lbs). The largest fish captured in 1994survey was 18.3 inches. Growth rates appear good compared to other local lakes.     Black bullhead catch rates in 1994 (0.5 fish/gillnet, 0.5 fish/trapnet) were below thehistorical averages (21.2 fish/gillnet, 2.7 fish/trapnet). The 1994 average weight of blackbullhead caught was 1.3 lbs (gillnets and trapnets combined). Yellow bullhead catch rates in1994 (0.2 fish/gillnet, 1.6 fish/trapnet) were below the historical averages (1.8fish/gillnet, 1.8 fish/ trapnet). The 1994 average weight of yellow bullhead was 1.8 lbs(gillnets and trapnets combined).     Bowfin \"dogfish\" abundance in 1994 (2.42 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range ( 0.3- 1.1 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and the highest recorded value (historical average=1.3fish/trapnet). The average weight was 4.8 lbs.      Carp abundance in 1994 (0.8 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (0.2 - 1.0fish/trapnet) and similar to the historical average (0.7 fish/trapnet). The 1994 averageweight was 6.0 lbs (trapnets).     Diamond has an excellent reputation as a good fishing lake (walleye, northern pike,bluegill, black crappie). The moderate productivity of this lake is conducive for good growthof various species. However, increasing nutrient inputs will likely result in degradation ofspawning areas and other habitat. The loss of important fish habitat (bulrush stands) willresult in lower abundance of many gamefish species. Furthermore, increasing algae blooms andfilamentous algae growth as a result of increased nutrient levels will make Diamond lesspleasing to recreational activities. Reducing nutrient inputs requires the cooperation ofboth lakeshore owners and farmers/livestock producers within the watershed. Lakeshore ownerscan reduce nutrient runoff by using no/low phosphorous fertilizers on their lawns, plantingtrees and native grass buffer strips along their shoreline, and not disposing of grass/leaflitter within the lake. Also, lakeshore owners can maintain or increase important fishhabitat by transplanting bulrush, protecting remaining bulrush stands, and reducing the areafor mechanical/chemical control of native submergent vegetation. Exotic submergent species(curled pondweed) may be controlled by harvesting prior to bud formation in the spring,however this is still an experimental technique with limited knowledge about potentialsuccesses and failures. Area farmers need to practice more economical and conservationalfarming practices such as mulch till, minimum till, ridge till, or no till. For example,farmers leaving at least 30% crop residue on the fields after harvest can significantlyreduce both nutrient runoff and soil erosion. The long term benefits to farmers practicingconservational tillage techniques include lower operational costs (fuel, fertilizer inputs),reduced soil erosion, increased net profits, maintaining more current or similar yields, andsafer drinking water. Other important land management practices include planting adequatefenced natural grass buffer strips along feedlots and inlets within the immediate watershed.Also, landowners, the lake association, and the DNR need to work together on reducingexcessive feedlot runoff from several known sources. Fisheries management priorities shouldinclude continuing the operation of the northern pike spawning area, transplanting andprotecting of hardstem bulrush, protecting the fisheries/wildlife habitat within \"DogfishBay\", educating and informing landowners within the watershed about best land managementpractices, stocking walleye fingerlings more efficiently and effectively on a as needed basis(after two successive years of poor natural reproduction) rather than a systematic approach(every other year), monitoring the fish populations and directed angling pressure todetermine if harvest restrictions are necessary.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Diamond Lake during September 20, 2017. Diamond is a moderately large (1,607 acres), productive, and moderately deep (27 feet maximum) lake with moderate submergent vegetation located in Kandiyohi County. Abundant numbers of small Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Shiner species were observed during 2014-2017 fall electrofishing surveys. Abundant Northern Pike numbers (9.3 fish/gillnet) were noted in the 2013 summer survey and recent ice out nettings. Walleye eggs were collected for the first time in 2014 on Diamond. Approximately, 60-70 quarts of Walleye eggs were collected for statewide and local quotas during 2014 and 2015. Approximately 191 quarts were collected during the early spring of 2016. We collected 90 quarts in 2017. Hatching success was good in 2014, but poor (<40%) during 2015-2017 due in part to early ice out and spring hatching. Walleye fry (800,000 fish per year) were marked with oxytetracycline \"OTC\" from the Spicer strain (Diamond, Koronis, and Rice) and stocked into Diamond during the springs of 2014 and 2015 as part of a 10% return for egg take. Diamond was stocked with 1.3 million OTC marked fry in 2016. Both OTC marked (475,396 fish) and unmarked (606,540 fish) fry were stocked in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nThe YOY Walleye catch rates were low in 2017 (4.00 YOY/hour, 6.24 inches average), 2016 (2.40 YOY/hour, 6.89 inches), 2015 (13.33 YOY/hour, 7.13 inches average), 2014 (8.00 YOY/hour), 2013 (6.00 YOY/hour) and 2012 (6.00 YOY/hour) fall electrofishing surveys. The 2011 YOY Walleye catch rate was high (104.52 YOY/hour, 6.94 inches). No fall electrofishing survey was conducted in the fall of 2009, but abundant yearling Walleye numbers (102.58 fish/hour, 6.21 inches) were sampled in a 2010 spring electrofishing survey. The Diamond Lake historical average YOY Walleye catch rate is 98.16 YOY/hour. OTC marked Walleye accounted for 100% and 14% respectively of the 2014 and 2015 fall electrofishing YOY Walleye catches. OTC analysis was not done on the few YOY Walleye captured in 2016 or 2017. <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2012, consistent and excellent Walleye natural reproduction had occurred in Diamond based on fall electrofishing surveys, OTC markings and historical data review. In recent years Walleye recruitment from natural reproduction or fry stocking has been poor due to poor early spring survival conditions and an abundance of predators in Diamond. Walleye natural reproduction and fry stocking success were generally poor in most area lakes during 2015-2017. A record early ice out date occurred on March 8, 2017 for Diamond. Typical walleye spawning occurs during mid-late April with hatching around mid-May. Generally, early ice out years are not conducive for good walleye fry survival in rearing ponds or lakes due to normal late April extended cold/cloudy weather periods that may negatively reduce plant plankton production and in turn reduce walleye food prey like zooplankton and aquatic insects.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerling or yearling stockings have occurred in response to consecutive low YOY Walleye numbers. The recent stockings occurred in 2004 (19,354 fingerlings, 925 pounds; 276 yearlings, 46 pounds; 487 adults, 348 pounds), 2013 (33,889 fingerlings, 1,405 pounds), 2014 (3,454 yearlings, 359 pounds; 1,314 fingerlings, 146 pounds), 2015 (47,091 fingerlings, 1,917 pounds) and 2017 spring (20,784 yearlings, 1,261 pounds; 207 adults, 84 pounds). The Walleye fingerlings/yearlings stocked into Diamond during 2015 and 2017 were from the local Spicer strain (Diamond, Koronis, and Rice) whereas previous fingerling or yearling stockings were from the Pike River Strain. Abundant yearling Walleye numbers were caught in the 2014 (54.00 fish/hour, 8.66 inches average) and 2017 (24.00 fish/hour, 9.24 inches average) fall electrofishing surveys, but these fish were likely from previous fall or spring fingerling/yearling stockings.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Diamond include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, conducting Walleye egg take operations when needed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. A fall night electrofishing survey is scheduled to assess Walleye natural reproduction in 2018. A resurvey of the Diamond Lake fish population is currently scheduled for 2018. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Diamond (1,565 acres) is moderately productive with a maximum depth of 27 feet. It isa popular fishing (walleye, northern pike, bluegill, largemouth bass) and recreational(skiing, boating, swimming) lake located about 4 miles northeast of Atwater, MN in KandiyohiCounty. A public boat access and campground is located along the west shore in KandiyohiCounty Park #3. Walleye numbers in Diamond (8.0 fish/gillnet) are currently low compared tothe historical average (19.6 fish/gillnet). Fall electrofishing surveys have been conductedsince 1993 to determine walleye fingerling abundance due to natural reproduction. Walleyenatural reproduction in Diamond was excellent to good from 1993-1997. However, walleyefingerling survival to adult size has been poor, thus resulting in poor fishing success for14-18 inch walleye during recent years. Walleye growth rates were good due to the abundantyellow perch forage base (31.0 fish/gillnet) present in Diamond. Poor walleye survival offingerlings to adult size is probably due to predation by various fish species (i.e.,northern pike, bowfin \"dogfish\", largemouth bass) and perhaps fish eating birds such as thedouble-crested cormorant. A potential option to increase adult walleye numbers in Diamondwould be to stock walleye yearlings instead of fingerlings in order to reduce predation byfish eating birds and predator fish species. The double-crested cormorant is a federallyprotected bird under the jurisdiction of the United States Fish & Wildlife Service,Department of Interior. Large numbers of double-crested cormorants have been observed feedingon Diamond by local residents in recent summers. Recently, the federal government has relaxedregulations concerning the killing of double-crested cormorants, however these only apply toprivate and state fish hatchery facilities. Private aquaculturalists and state hatcheryoperators may kill double-crested cormorants doing damage on their respective fish rearingponds. Local reports of angling success for walleye have been limited to catches of largewalleye (> 19 inches) usually during the fall, early ice conditions, or the first month ofthe summer opener.      Northern pike were moderate in numbers (5.8 fish/gillnet) during 1997 for Diamond withan average size of 3 lbs. A 1997 spring electrofishing survey indicated good numbers (18.3fish/hour) and sizes (average size= 2.2 lbs.) of largemouth bass present in Diamond. Onelargemouth bass captured and released was 20 inches and weighed 5.3 lbs. Bluegill numberswere below average in 1997. However, local anglers have reported success at catching largebluegill (> 8 inches) in the past. The Diamond Lake Association is actively involved forimproving water quality of Diamond Lake. The MNDNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Diamondfor walleye and northern pike as the primary species with bluegill, black crappie, andlargemouth bass as secondary species. Management priorities for Diamond Lake includeprotecting important fisheries habitat (hardstem bulrush stands), working with the localresidents to improve the lake water quality, encouraging local landowners to implement bestmanagement practices within the watershed (i.e., planting buffer strips, conservationtillage, using low/no phosphorus fertilizers, updating non conforming septic systems, propermanure/feedlot management, wetland restoration), maintaining adequate gamefish populationsthrough stocking as justified.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted on Diamond Lake during Mid-July of 2013. Diamond is a moderately large (1,565 acres), productive, and moderately deep (27 feet maximum) lake located in Kandiyohi County. There are numerous small inlets and one large inlet that drain primarily agricultural row crops via tile systems and wetlands into Diamond. A new perforated multi-culvert barrier was installed in 2012 at the largest inlet in order to prevent adult carp from Diamond entering into three shallow upstream lakes (Hubbard, Wheeler, and Schultz) to spawn and degrade water quality. Submergent vegetation species are varied and densities moderate in Diamond. Curly-leaf pondweed has been a nuisance especially along the north portions of the lake in the past, but has been less bothersome in recent years. Emergent vegetation present includes mostly hardstem bulrush (north point, east shoreline area) and cattail species (southeast bay). Shoalwater substrates of the main basin are mostly sand, rubble, and gravel. Silt and muck compose the majority of substrates in a shallow southeast bay. Mid-summer dissolved oxygen levels (>7.0 ppm) were good down to 21 feet deep during 2013. Water clarity was fair on July 22, 2013 (5.0 feet). Walleye natural reproduction is usually frequent and significant in Diamond compared to other Spicer Area lakes. Diamond is a popular lake for a variety of fish species which include walleye, northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, yellow perch and largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2013 (19.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the Diamond Lake historical average (6.01 fish/gillnet). The black crappie average size was moderate (0.47 pounds, 8.65 inches) in the 2013 gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of larger (>10 inches) black crappie was high (10.67 fish/gillnet). Black crappie growth rates were near or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 2-7. The 2012 and 2009 year classes comprised 78% and 15% respectively of the 2013 black crappie gillnet and trapnet catch. Anglers had good success catching moderate to large size black crappie (2009 year class) in the 2013-14 winter. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2013 (36.83 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (12.99 fish/trapnet). The 2013 bluegill average size was small (0.09 pounds and 4.88 inches) from trapnets. However, we did observe local anglers catching moderate numbers of large sized (>0.5 pound) bluegill during the 2013 summer survey in Diamond.  <br> \n <br> \nA spring electrofishing survey, which best samples adult largemouth bass, was not conducted due to time constraints in 2013. We did sample low numbers of largemouth bass in the trapnets (0.25 fish/trapnet, 1.23 pounds average weight) during 2013 summer survey. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2013 (9.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the Diamond Lake historical average (4.68 fish/gillnet). The 2013 northern pike average size was small (2.63 pounds and 21.68 inches). The northern pike historical average weight is 2.73 pounds from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of larger (>28 inches) northern pike was low (0.33 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3 and above the normal ranges for ages 4-7. The 2010 year class comprised 69% of the 2013 gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were abundant in 2013 (89.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the Diamond Lake historical average (45.44 fish/gillnet). The 2013 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.16 pounds and 7.10 inches) from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of moderate sized (>8 inches) yellow perch was high (12.38 fish/gillnet).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were abundant in 2013 (15.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but comparable to the historical average (16.73 fish/gillnet) for Diamond. Walleye sampled in gillnets during the 2013 survey were large (2.67 pounds and 18.22 inches). The walleye historical average weight is 1.82 pounds from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of larger walleye (>20 inches) was high (6.00 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The four prominent walleye year classes present in the 2013 gillnet and trapnet catch were from 2011 (27%), 2009 (25%), 2006 (20%) and 2005 (18%). Abundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" walleye due to natural reproduction (>100 YOY/hour) were noted in fall electrofishing surveys of 2005-2006 and 2011 and yearlings in spring electrofishing survey of 2010. The YOY walleye catch rates were low (6.00 YOY/hour) in both the 2012 and 2013 fall electrofishing surveys. Recent walleye stockings included 2004 (19,354 fingerlings, 925 pounds; 276 yearlings, 46 pounds; 487 adults, 348 pounds) and 2013 (33,889 fingerlings, 1,405 pounds). Local anglers were reporting good catches of smaller walleye (12-14 inches) during the 2013 summer. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were moderate in 2013 (15.00 fish/gillnet) compared the normal ranges of similar lakes, but below the Diamond Lake historical average (34.65 fish/gillnet). The 2013 black bullhead average size was large (1.10 pounds) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Diamond include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. A fall electrofishing survey is scheduled to assess walleye natural reproduction in 2014. A resurvey of the Diamond Lake fish population is currently scheduled for 2018. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Diamond Lake during September 29, 2015. Diamond is a moderately large (1,607 acres), productive, and moderately deep (27 feet maximum) lake with moderate submergent vegetation located in Kandiyohi County. Abundant numbers of small black crappie, yellow perch and shiner species were observed during both 2014 and 2015 fall electrofishing surveys. Walleye eggs were collected for the first time in 2014 on Diamond. Approximately, 60-70 quarts were collected for statewide and local quotas during 2014 and 2015. Walleye fry (800,000 fish per year) marked with oxytetracycline \"OTC\" from the Spicer strain (Diamond, Koronis, and Rice) were stocked into Diamond during the springs of 2014 and 2015 as part of a 10% return for egg take. <br> \n <br> \nThe YOY Walleye catch rates were low in 2015 (13.33 YOY/hour, 7.13 inches average), 2014 (8.00 YOY/hour), 2013 (6.00 YOY/hour) and 2012 (6.00 YOY/hour) fall electrofishing surveys. The Diamond Lake historical average YOY Walleye catch rate is 106.79 YOY/hour. OTC marked walleye accounted for 100% and 14% respectively of the 2014 and 2015 fall electrofishing YOY Walleye catches. Walleye natural reproduction and fry stocking success were generally poor in most area lakes during 2015. A rapid warmup (>50 F water temperature) during the spawning season probably caused poor fertilization of Walleye eggs. In addition a long term cold spell after the hatch probably reduced zooplankton production resulting in poor Walleye fry survival during 2015. The 2011 YOY Walleye catch rate was 104.52 YOY/hour (6.94 inches). No fall electrofishing survey was conducted in the fall of 2009, but abundant numbers of yearling Walleye (102.58 fish/hour, 6.21 inches) were sampled in a 2010 spring electrofishing survey. Recent Walleye fingerling or yearling stockings included 2004 (19,354 fingerlings, 925 pounds; 276 yearlings, 46 pounds; 487 adults, 348 pounds), 2013 (33,889 fingerlings, 1,405 pounds), 2014 (3,454 yearlings, 359 pounds; 1,314 fingerlings, 146 pounds) and 2015 (47,091 fingerlings, 1,917 pounds). The Walleye fingerlings stocked into Diamond during 2015 were from the local Spicer strain (Diamond, Koronis, and Rice) whereas previous fingerling or yearling stockings were from the Pike River Strain. Abundant numbers of yearlings (54.00 fish/hour, 8.66 inches average length) were caught in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey, but these fish were likely from recent fingerling/yearling stockings in the fall of 2013 and spring of 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Diamond include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, conducting Walleye egg take operations when needed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. A fall night electrofishing survey is scheduled to assess Walleye natural reproduction in 2016. A resurvey of the Diamond Lake fish population is currently scheduled for 2018. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Diamond Lake during September 26, 2016. The survey was done with a boat set up with electrofishing equipment to evaluate fry stocking success in 2016. The electrofishing equipment puts electricity into the water and fish are attracted to the positive charge in the front of the boat. We then net the fish and take lengths and weights to determine what condition the fish are in (etc.). Diamond is a moderately large (1,607 acres), productive, and moderately deep (27 feet maximum) lake with moderate submergent vegetation located in Kandiyohi County. Abundant numbers of small Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and shiner species were observed during 2014-2016 fall electrofishing surveys. Abundant Northern Pike numbers (9.3 fish/gillnet) were noted in the 2013 summer survey and recent ice out nettings. Walleye eggs were collected for the first time in 2014 on Diamond. Approximately, 60-70 quarts of Walleye eggs were collected for statewide and local quotas during 2014 and 2015. Approximately 191 quarts were collected during the early spring of 2016. Hatching success was good in 2014, but poor in 2015 and 2016 due in part to early ice out and spring hatching. Walleye fry (800,000 fish per year) were marked with oxytetracycline \"OTC\" from the Spicer strain (Diamond, Koronis, and Rice) and stocked into Diamond during the springs of 2014 and 2015 as part of a 10% return for egg take. Diamond was stocked with 1.3 million OTC marked fry in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nThe YOY Walleye catch rates were low in 2016 (2.4 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches), 2015 (13.3 YOY/hour, 7.1 inches average), 2014 (8.0 YOY/hour), 2013 (6.0 YOY/hour) and 2012 (6.0 YOY/hour) fall electrofishing surveys. The 2011 YOY Walleye catch rate was high (104.5 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches). No fall electrofishing survey was conducted in the fall of 2009, but abundant yearling Walleye numbers (102.6 fish/hour, 6.2 inches) were sampled in a 2010 spring electrofishing survey. The Diamond Lake historical average YOY Walleye catch rate is 102.3 YOY/hour. OTC marked Walleye accounted for 100% and 14% respectively of the 2014 and 2015 fall electrofishing YOY Walleye catches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction and fry stocking success were generally poor in most area lakes during 2015 and 2016. A record early ice out date occurred in mid-March of 2016. Typical walleye spawning occurs during mid-late April with hatching around mid-May. Generally, early ice out years are not conducive for good walleye fry survival in rearing ponds or lakes due to normal late April extended cold/cloudy weather periods that may negatively reduce plant plankton production and in turn reduce walleye food prey like zooplankton and aquatic insects.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerling or yearling stockings have occurred in response to consecutive low YOY Walleye numbers. The recent stockings occurred in 2004 (19,354 fingerlings, 925 pounds; 276 yearlings, 46 pounds; 487 adults, 348 pounds), 2013 (33,889 fingerlings, 1,405 pounds), 2014 (3,454 yearlings, 359 pounds; 1,314 fingerlings, 146 pounds) and 2015 (47,091 fingerlings, 1,917 pounds). The Walleye fingerlings stocked into Diamond during 2015 were from the local Spicer strain (Diamond, Koronis, and Rice) whereas previous fingerling or yearling stockings were from the Pike River Strain. Abundant yearling Walleye numbers (54.0 fish/hour, 8.7 inches average length) were caught in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey, but these fish were likely from recent fingerling/yearling stockings in the fall of 2013 and spring of 2014.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Diamond Lake during October 6, 2020. Previous fall electrofishing surveys were conducted at three stations for a total of 30 minutes. The 2020 survey was conducted as part of a larger statewide research study to evaluate fall electrofishing catch effectiveness for different total shocking times. Six stations were sampled for a total of 120 minutes in 2020. The water temperature was 57 F. Submergent vegetation was varied at different stations. We observed abundant numbers of adult Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie and Yellow Perch in the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nDiamond is a moderately large (1,607 acres), productive, and moderately deep (27 feet maximum) lake with moderate submergent vegetation located in Kandiyohi County. Abundant numbers of small Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Shiner species were observed during 2014-2020 fall electrofishing surveys. Abundant Northern Pike numbers were noted in the 2013 and 2018 summer surveys (9.00+ fish/gillnet), recent ice out trapnets and the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye eggs were collected for the first time in 2014 on Diamond. Approximately, 60-70 quarts of Walleye eggs were collected for statewide and local quotas during 2014 and 2015. Approximately 191 quarts were collected during the early spring of 2016; 90 quarts in 2017; 25 quarts in 2018; and 113 quarts in 2019. No Walleye eggs were taken in 2020.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (800,000 fish per year) were marked with oxytetracycline \"OTC\" from the Spicer strain (Diamond, Koronis, and Rice) and stocked into Diamond during the springs of 2014 and 2015 as part of a 10% return for egg take. Diamond was stocked with 1.3 million OTC marked fry in 2016. Both OTC marked (475,396 fish) and unmarked (606,540 fish) fry were stocked in 2017. Unmarked Spicer Strain Walleye fry were stocked on May 18, 2018 (930,788 fish) and May 14, 2019 (751,366 fish). No Walleye fry were stocked in 2020. <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye numbers were low in 2020 fall electrofishing survey (0.50 YOY/hour, 7.09 inches) which suggest poor natural reproduction success in Diamond. Low yearling Walleye numbers (1.50 fish/hour, 11.13 inches) were caught in 2020. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant in 2019 fall electrofishing survey (110.00 YOY/hour, 7.03 inches). The YOY Walleye catch rates were low in 2018 (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.68 inches), 2017 (4.00 YOY/hour, 6.24 inches average), 2016 (2.40 YOY/hour, 6.89 inches), 2015 (13.33 YOY/hour, 7.13 inches average), 2014 (8.00 YOY/hour), 2013 (6.00 YOY/hour) and 2012 (6.00 YOY/hour) fall electrofishing surveys. The 2011 YOY Walleye catch rate was high (104.52 YOY/hour, 6.94 inches). The Diamond Lake historical average YOY Walleye catch rate is 91.49 YOY/hour. OTC marked Walleye accounted for 100% and 14% respectively of the 2014 and 2015 fall electrofishing YOY Walleye catches. OTC analysis was not done on the few YOY Walleye captured in 2016 or 2017 fall surveys. <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2012, consistent and excellent Walleye natural reproduction had occurred in Diamond based on fall electrofishing surveys, OTC markings. In recent years Walleye recruitment from natural reproduction or fry stocking has been poor due to poor early spring survival conditions and an abundance of predators in Diamond. Walleye natural reproduction and fry stocking success were generally poor in most area lakes during 2015-2017. A record early ice out date occurred on March 8, 2017 for Diamond. The most recent ice out was on April 7, 2020. Late ice out dates recently occurred on April 30, 2018 and April 20, 2019. Typical walleye spawning occurs during mid-late April with hatching around mid-May. Generally, early ice out years are not conducive for good walleye fry survival in rearing ponds or lakes if stocked in mid/late April. This is often due to extended cold/cloudy weather periods that may negatively reduce plant plankton production and in turn reduce walleye food prey like zooplankton and aquatic insects.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerling or yearling stockings have occurred in response to consecutive low YOY Walleye numbers. The recent stockings occurred in 2004 (19,354 fingerlings, 925 pounds; 276 yearlings, 46 pounds; 487 adults, 348 pounds), 2013 (33,889 fingerlings, 1,405 pounds), 2014 (3,454 yearlings, 359 pounds; 1,314 fingerlings, 146 pounds), 2015 (47,091 fingerlings, 1,917 pounds) and 2017 spring (20,784 yearlings, 1,261 pounds; 207 adults, 84 pounds). The Walleye fingerlings/yearlings stocked into Diamond during 2015 and 2017 were from the local Spicer strain (Diamond, Koronis, and Rice) whereas previous fingerling or yearling stockings were from the Pike River Strain. Abundant yearling Walleye numbers were caught in the 2014 (54.00 fish/hour, 8.66 inches average) and 2017 (24.00 fish/hour, 9.24 inches average) fall electrofishing surveys, but these fish were likely from previous fall or spring fingerling/yearling stockings.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in the most recent 2018 summer survey (27.50 fish/gillnet) was above the normal ranges for Diamond and similar lakes. The 2018 Walleye average weight and length were 1.72 pounds and 15.60 inches from gillnets. The three prominent Walleye year classes present in the 2018 gillnet and trapnet catch were from 2016 (33%), 2015 (22%) and 2014 (15%). <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Diamond include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, conducting Walleye egg take operations when needed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. Special regulations have been proposed for Bluegill (reduced bag limit) for 2021. A targeted trapnet survey of Bluegill will occur in May of 2021. A fall night electrofishing survey is scheduled to assess Walleye natural reproduction in 2021. A standard survey of the Diamond Lake fish population is currently scheduled for 2023. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted on Diamond Lake during July of 2008.  Diamond is a moderately large (1,565 acres), productive, and moderately deep (27 feet maximum) lake located in Kandiyohi County. There are numerous small inlets and one large inlet that drain primarily agricultural row crops via tile systems into Diamond. The outlet connects to the Middle Fork of the Crow River via a ditch system. The immediate watershed is primarily agriculture with residential, hardwoods, and wetlands composing the remainder. Diamond Lake is highly developed with 352 homes/cabins, one resort, and one county park/campground. The southeast bay \"Dogfish\" bay is the least developed portion of the lake. Submergent vegetation species are varied and densities moderate in Diamond. Curly-leaf pondweed has been a nuisance especially along the north portions of the lake in the past, but has been less bothersome in recent years. Pondweeds (narrow-leaf, sago, clasping leaf, etc.) were moderately abundant in 2008. The most common submergent species present during 2008 were muskgrass, narrow-leaf pondweed, water moss, northern milfoil, and clasping-leaf pondweed. Emergent vegetation present included mostly hardstem bulrush (north point, east shoreline area) and cattail species (Dogfish Bay). Shoalwater substrates of the main basin were mostly sand, rubble, and gravel. Silt and muck compose the majority of substrates in Dogfish Bay. Mid summer dissolved oxygen levels (>7.0 ppm) were good down to 25 feet deep during 2008. Total phosphorus levels were moderate (0.033 ppm) in June of 2008. Chlorophyll-a levels were low (2.30 ppb) in June of 2008. Water clarity was moderate to good during the 2008 summer (6.0 - 14.5 feet). Walleye natural reproduction is frequent and significant in Diamond compared to other Spicer Area lakes. Diamond is managed primarily for walleye, with northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, yellow perch, and largemouth bass managed as secondary species. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2008 (15.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Diamond (25th=0.08, 50th=2.83, 75th=7.65 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The 2008 black crappie abundance in trapnets (10.67 fish/trapnet) was also above the normal ranges for Diamond (25th=1.29, 50th=3.08, 75th=5.88 fish/trapnet) and similar lakes. The black crappie historical catch rates are 4.99 fish/gillnet and 3.92 fish/trapnet. The black crappie average sizes were similar for both gillnets and trapnets (0.44 pounds and about 9.14 inches) in mid-July of 2008. The historical average weights were 0.23 and 0.38 pounds for gillnets and trapnets respectively. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was high (14.25 fish/gillnet). Black crappie growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. The 2005 year class comprised 96% of the 2008 black crappie gillnet and trapnet catch. There were low numbers of young of year \"YOY\" black crappie (2.67 fish/haul, 1.93 inches average length) captured in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls.  <br> \n <br> \nLocal anglers had excellent success catching black crappie (8-10 inches average size) throughout the 2007-08 winter. Conservation Officers reported that limits of black crappie were common occurrence for anglers during this time period. There were 184 fish houses counted on Diamond during mid January of 2008 by DNR personnel. One local angler reported over 800 ice-fishing shelters on the ice during one weekend in late January of 2008 during the peak fishing success. In the 2008-09 winter, anglers reported moderate success for catching black crappie (10-12 inches average size). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2008 (5.25 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for Diamond (25th=2.99, 50th=4.50, 75th=6.87 fish/trapnet), but low compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 10.61 fish/trapnet. The 2008 bluegill average size was large to moderate (0.28 pounds and 6.30 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.23 pounds from trapnets. Local anglers reported catching low numbers, but large sized bluegill during the 2007-08 winter. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was moderate (3.42 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2005 year class comprised 64% of the 2008 gillnet and trapnet catch. There were abundant numbers of YOY bluegill (114.17 fish/haul, 1.47 inches average length) captured in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nA spring electrofishing survey for largemouth bass was not conducted due to time constraints in 2008. Largemouth bass abundance was high in the 2003 spring electrofishing survey (27.00 fish/hour, 1.84 pounds average weight) compared to the Diamond historical average (17.24 fish/hour, 1.92 pounds average weight). There were moderate numbers of YOY largemouth bass (22.67 fish/haul, 2.20 inches average length) captured in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate in 2008 (3.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Diamond (25th=1.67, 50th=3.75, 75th=4.92 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 4.20 fish/gillnet. The 2008 northern pike average size was moderate to large (4.73 pounds and 26.80 inches) for Diamond. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.71 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger northern pike was moderate (1.50 fish/gillnet) in 2008. Northern pike growth rates were above or within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2005 year class comprised 32% of the 2008 gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were moderate to abundant in 2008 (54.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Diamond (25th=19.43, 50th=31.00, 75th=60.13 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 43.07 fish/gillnet. The 2008 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.19 pounds and 7.31 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was 10.80 fish/gillnet. Yellow perch growth rates were near or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. The 2006 and 2005 year classes comprised 50% and 45% respectively of the 2008 gillnet and trapnet catch. There were abundant numbers of YOY yellow perch (115.33 fish/haul, 2.52 inches average length) captured in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low to moderate in 2008 (8.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Diamond (25th=8.00, 50th=14.00, 75th=19.79 fish/gillnet), but high compared to the normal ranges for similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 16.64 fish/gillnet for Diamond. The 2008 walleye average size was moderate (1.47 pounds and 14.63 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.71 pounds from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was low (2.25 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3, but within or above the normal ranges for ages 4-8. The two prominent walleye year classes present in the 2008 gillnet and trapnet catch were from 2006 (31%) and 2005 (40%). Abundant numbers of YOY walleye due to natural reproduction were noted in fall electrofishing surveys of 2005 and 2006. <br> \n <br> \nThe YOY walleye catch rate was low (22.00 YOY/hour) in the 2008 fall electrofishing survey compared to the Spicer Area historical average (76.32 YOY/hour). The 2007 YOY walleye numbers were also low (22.00 YOY/hour). The Diamond Lake historical average YOY walleye catch rate is 138.03 YOY/hour. The 2008 walleye YOY average size (6.57 inches) was slightly larger than the Spicer Area (6.34 inches) and Diamond (6.46 inches) historical average sizes respectively. The 2006 YOY walleye catch rate was the second highest (528.00 YOY/hour, 5.43 inches) for Diamond. The highest recorded Diamond catch rate was 604.00 YOY/hour in 1996. There were abundant numbers (190.00 fish/hour, 10.15 inches average length) of yearling walleye (2006 year class) captured in the 2007 fall electrofishing survey. We also observed abundant numbers (140.00 fish/hour) of adult fish (probably from the 2006 year class) in the 2008 fall electrofishing survey. Recent walleye stockings included 1998 (37,274 fingerlings, 2,261 pounds) and 2004 (19,354 fingerlings, 925 pounds; 276 yearlings, 46 pounds; 487 adults, 348 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2008 (1.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Diamond (25th=1.35, 50th=9.50, 75th=24.38 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 35.22 fish/gillnet. Black bullhead abundance was also low in the 2008 trapnets (0.50 fish/trapnet). Black bullhead abundance was high (221.00 fish/gillnet) during the previous 2003 assessment. The 2008 black bullhead average weights were large (1.11 and 1.87 pounds from gillnets and trapnet respectively). The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.80 pounds for both gillnets and trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp numbers were moderate to high in 2008 (1.25 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Diamond (25th=0.47, 50th=0.91, 75th=1.44 fish/trapnet) and similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 1.50 fish/trapnet. The 2008 carp average size was large (10.26 pounds and 26.99 inches) from trapnets. The carp historical average weight is 6.73 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Diamond include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. A fall electrofishing survey is scheduled to assess walleye natural reproduction in 2009. A fish population assessment is scheduled for 2013. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on Diamond Lake during 2023. Prior Diamond Lake standard surveys were conducted in mid-July. Gillnets were set in mid-August as part of a statewide Zebra Mussel-Walleye study. Standard trapnets were set in mid-July. A near shore FIBI survey was also conducted in mid-July. A fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Diamond Lake during late September. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nDiamond is a moderately large (1,565 acres), productive, and moderately deep (27 feet maximum) lake located in Kandiyohi County. Diamond Lake is highly developed with 352 homes/cabins, one resort, and one County Park/campground (2008 resurvey). The Diamond Lake County Park (55 camping sites) and main public access is located along the northwest side of the lake. A small public access is located on the east shore. Two Northern Pike Spawning Areas \"NPSA\" (NW corner and SW corner of the lake) had been operated adjacent to Diamond Lake in the past but are no longer used for rearing Northern Pike. Kandiyohi County Road #4 was rerouted around to the west side of the Diamond Lake County Park in 2018. The NPSA water control structure and fish barrier were removed due to the new culvert placement and road upgrades. There are numerous small inlets and one large inlet that drain primarily agricultural row crops via tile systems and wetlands into Diamond. A new perforated multi-culvert barrier was installed in 2012 at the largest inlet in order to prevent adult Common Carp from Diamond entering into three shallow upstream lakes (Hubbard, Wheeler, and Schultz) to spawn and degrade water quality. The outlet connects to the Middle Fork Crow River via a ditch system. The immediate watershed is primarily agriculture with residential homes, hardwoods, and wetlands comprising the remainder. The southeast bay \"Dogfish\" bay is the least developed portion of the lake. Submergent vegetation species (i.e., coontail, clasping-leaf pondweed, water celery, sago pondweed and northern milfoil) are varied and densities moderate in Diamond. Filamentous algae and water moss were also commonly occurring in Diamond. Curly-leaf pondweed has been a nuisance especially along the north portions of the lake in the past but has been less bothersome in recent years. Free floating vegetation species seen included star duckweed and lesser duckweed. Emergent vegetation present includes mostly hardstem bulrush (north point, east shoreline area) and cattail species (Dogfish Bay). Shoalwater substrates of the main basin are mostly sand, rubble, boulder, and gravel. Silt and muck compose most substrates in Dogfish Bay. Water levels were below average in recent years. Mid-summer dissolved oxygen levels (>7.0 ppm) were good down to 21 feet deep during 2023. Total phosphorus levels were moderate (0.033 ppm) in June of 2008. Water clarity was poor on July 27, 2023 (3.0 feet). Intense blue-green algae blooms were noted in Diamond during the 2023 summer. Diamond has been used as a Walleye egg take site for Spicer \"Crow River\" strain fish since 2014. Other local Spicer strain Walleye egg take lakes include Koronis, Rice and Elizabeth. Walleye natural reproduction was usually frequent and significant in Diamond prior to 2012 compared to other Spicer Area lakes. Zebra Mussels were documented in Diamond during 2018. Water clarity may increase in the future due to Zebra Mussel presence during the early summer months, but intense blue-green algae blooms will likely occur during mid/late summer months. Diamond is a popular lake for a variety of fish species which include Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Yellow Perch and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was conducted on Diamond in mid-May of 2022 as part of the ongoing statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  Twelve standard lake survey trapnets were set at historical stations to target Bluegill and Black Crappie. Special regulations for several area lakes (Nest, Long (Hawick, Minnesota), Diamond, George and Florida) currently entail reduced bag limits (i.e., 5 or 10 fish) for Sunfish or Crappie. The Diamond Lake special regulation for Sunfish is a daily bag limit of 5 fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were abundant in 2023 gillnets (23.33 fish/gillnet). The 2023 Black Crappie numbers were low in trapnets (2.83 fish/trapnet) The Black Crappie historical catch rates are 8.63 fish/gillnet and 6.66 fish/trapnet. The Black Crappie average weights and lengths were moderate for gillnets (0.47 pounds, 9.08 inches) and trapnets (0.64 pounds, 10.30 inches) in 2023. The historical average weights were 0.28 and 0.36 pounds for gillnets and trapnets respectively. The 2023 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches plus) Black Crappie was high (15.33 fish/gillnet). The 2023 catch rate of preferred size (10.00 inches plus) Black Crappie was also high (11.00 fish/gillnet). Black Crappie growth rates were moderate to excellent in Diamond. The 2019 year class comprised 51% of the 2023 Black Crappie gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2023 (1.42 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 11.58 fish/trapnet. The 2023 Bluegill average size was large (0.31 pounds and 6.81 inches) from trapnets. Low numbers of large Bluegill (3.67 fish/gillnet, 7.03 inches and 0.32 pounds) were captured in the 2023 gillnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.22 pounds and 0.36 pounds respectively from trapnets and gillnets. The 2023 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches plus) Bluegill was low (0.75 fish/trapnet).  <br> \n <br> \nA spring boat electrofishing survey for Largemouth Bass was not conducted due to time constraints in 2023. Largemouth Bass were not captured in gillnets or low trapnets, but abundant small/YOY fish were captured by seining and back-pack electrofishing during 2023. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were moderate in 2023 (6.00 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 5.15 fish/gillnet. The 2023 Northern Pike average size was moderate (2.80 pounds and 23.34 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.75 pounds from gillnets. The 2023 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches plus) Northern Pike was low (0.33 fish/gillnet). Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Diamond in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26.0 inches; and all from 22.0 to 26.0 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22.0 and 26.0 inches or two larger than 26.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2023 (13.00 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 46.88 fish/gillnet. The 2023 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.12 pounds and 6.37 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2023 (30.33 fish/gillnet). The Walleye historical average catch rate is 18.73 fish/gillnet for Diamond. The 2023 Walleye average size was moderate (1.53 pounds and 14.70 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.78 pounds from gillnets. The 2023 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches plus) Walleye was high (10.00 fish/gillnet). The 2018 catch rate of preferred size (20.00 inches plus) Walleye was moderate (5.00 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were fair. The two prominent Walleye year classes present in the 2023 gillnet catch were from 2022 (41%) and 2021 (29%). Older Walleye (ages 7-17) were also captured in the 2023 survey.   <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers (4.00 fish/hour, 7.15 inches) were caught in the 2023 fall night electrofishing survey. Abundant Walleye yearling numbers (20.50 fish/hour, 10.53 inches) were caught in 2023 fall night electrofishing survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (70.80 YOY/hour, 6.37 inches) were caught in the 2022 fall night electrofishing survey (fry stocked). Walleye hatch or fry stocking survival was good in many local lakes during 2022. Moderate Walleye yearling or age 2 fish numbers (8.40 fish/hour) were caught in 2022. YOY Walleye numbers were low in the 2021 fall electrofishing survey (4.50 YOY/hour, 6.26 inches). Moderate yearling and adult Walleye numbers (21.00 fish/hour) were caught in 2021. YOY Walleye numbers were also low in the 2020 fall electrofishing survey (0.50 YOY/hour, 7.09 inches). Low yearling Walleye numbers (1.50 fish/hour, 11.13 inches) were caught in 2020. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey (110.00 YOY/hour, 7.03 inches). The YOY Walleye catch rate was low (4.00 YOY/hour) in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY catch rates (< 15 YOY/hour) were documented from 2012-2018. The 2018 Walleye YOY average size (7.68 inches) was large. The 2015 YOY catch rate was 13.33 YOY/hour with 14% coming from an Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fry stocking and the remaining from natural reproduction. The 2014 YOY catch rate (8.00 YOY/hour) was a 100% from an OTC marked fry stocking. The Diamond Lake historical average YOY Walleye catch rate is 94.38 YOY/hour. The 2011 YOY Walleye catch rate was 104.52 YOY/hour (6.94 inches). Abundant numbers of yearling Walleye were sampled in a 2014 (54.00 fish/hour, 8.66 inches) and 2017 (24.00 fish/hour, 9.24 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. OTC returns from fry stockings were low in the 2018 gillnet catches (0%, 2017; 7.7%, 2016; 22.2%, 2015; 0%, 2014). Recent Walleye stockings included 2013 (33,889 fingerlings, 1,405 pounds Pike River strain), 2014 (825,505 Spicer strain fry; 1,314 Pike River strain fingerlings, 146 pounds; 3,454 Pike River strain yearlings, 359 pounds), 2015 (804,992 Spicer strain fry; 47,091 Spicer strain fingerlings, 1,917 pounds), 2016 (1,290,613 Spicer strain fry), 2017 (1,081,936 Spicer strain fry; 20,784 Spicer strain yearlings, 1,392 pounds stocked in 2017 spring; 207 adults, 84 pounds) and 2018 (930,788 Spicer strain fry) and 2019 (751,366 fish). No Walleye fry were stocked in 2020. Spicer Strain Walleye fry were stocked in 2021 (761,438 fish), 2022 (636,132 fish) and 2023 (1,010,477 fish) in Diamond. Walleye fingerlings (4,591 Spicer Strain fish, 935 lbs.) were stocked in Diamond during late October of 2021 due to consecutive low YOY Walleye catches in 2020 and 2021. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2023 (1.33 fish/gillnet). The Black Bullhead historical average catch rates are 29.66 fish/gillnet and 14.01 fish/trapnet. Black Bullhead were absent in the 2023 trapnets. Black Bullhead abundance was the highest (221.00 fish/gillnet) during the 2003 survey. The 2023 Black Bullhead average weight was large (1.16 pounds) from gillnets. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.95 pounds for gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead numbers were abundant in 2023 (13.67 fish/gillnet). The 2023 Yellow Bullhead average size was large (0.93 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers were moderate in 2023 (1.00 fish/gillnet) and slightly above the historical average catch rate of 0.72 fish/gillnet. Low numbers of Common Carp (0.25 fish/trapnet) were captured in the 2023 trapnets. The 2023 Common Carp average weights were 8.27 pounds and 11.94 pounds respectively from gillnets and trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nA nearshore fish survey was also conducted in the 2023 summer. Seine hauls were conducted at 16 Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity \"FIBI\" stations. One seining station was sampled with a bag seine of 50 foot width and 1/8 inch bar mesh in depths of 3.5 feet or less. Fifteen seining stations were sampled with a bag sein of 15 foot width and 1/8 inch bar mesh at stations because of dense submergent vegetation. Near shore electrofishing was conducted at all 15 FIBI Stations with a back-pack unit in water depths generally less than 2 feet deep. The 16 FIBI Stations were spaced equally apart around the entire shoreline of the lake in a variety of near shore habitats. Each station was approximately 100 feet long. Two back-pack electrofishing runs were conducted with the initial run of 100 feet near the shore-water interface in depths of < 1 foot and the second run of 100 feet long about 10-20 feet from shore in depths up to 2 feet. Twenty fish species were captured in the near shore sampling gear. Low species numbers of intolerant habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter) were captured in Diamond Lake. Tolerant fish species captured included Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish. The nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. FIBI tool 2 was used for scoring and resulted in an FIBI score of 18 which is below the impairment threshold (45). <br> \n <br> \nThe FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Diamond include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. A fall electrofishing survey is scheduled to assess Walleye natural reproduction or fry stocking annually. A survey of the Diamond Lake fish population is currently scheduled for 2025. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of nearshore fish species was conducted on June 22, 2016 by IBI Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 18 sampling stations, but 3 stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 13 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 3 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 2 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including 2 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter) and 3 that are tolerant of disturbance (Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2013 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for Diamond Lake is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Diamond Lake is located in the North Fork Crow River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on Diamond Lake during Mid-July of 2018. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nDiamond is a moderately large (1,565 acres), productive, and moderately deep (27 feet maximum) lake located in Kandiyohi County. Diamond Lake is highly developed with 352 homes/cabins, one resort, and one County Park/campground (2008 resurvey). The Diamond Lake County Park (55 camping sites) and main public access is located along the northwest side of the lake. A small public access is located on the east shore. Two Northern Pike Spawning Areas \"NPSA\" (NW corner and SW corner of the lake) had been operated adjacent to Diamond Lake in the past but are no longer used for rearing Northern Pike. Kandiyohi County Road #4 was rerouted around to the west side of the Diamond Lake County Park in 2018. The NPSA water control structure and fish barrier were removed due to the new culvert placement and road upgrades. There are numerous small inlets and one large inlet that drain primarily agricultural row crops via tile systems and wetlands into Diamond. A new perforated multi-culvert barrier was installed in 2012 at the largest inlet in order to prevent adult Common Carp from Diamond entering into three shallow upstream lakes (Hubbard, Wheeler, and Schultz) to spawn and degrade water quality. The outlet connects to the Middle Fork Crow River via a ditch system. The immediate watershed is primarily agriculture with residential homes, hardwoods, and wetlands comprising the remainder. The southeast bay \"Dogfish\" bay is the least developed portion of the lake. Submergent vegetation species are varied and densities moderate in Diamond. Curly-leaf pondweed has been a nuisance especially in the north portions of the lake in the past, but has been less bothersome in recent years. Emergent vegetation present includes mostly hardstem bulrush (north point, east shoreline area) and cattail species (Dogfish Bay). Shoalwater substrates of the main basin are mostly sand, rubble, and gravel. Silt and muck compose the majority of substrates in Dogfish Bay. Water levels were above average in 2018. Mid-summer dissolved oxygen levels (>3.0 ppm) were good down to 18 feet deep during 2018. Water clarity was fair on July 17, 2018 (6.0 feet). Zebra Mussels were documented in Diamond during 2018. Water clarity may increase in the near future due to Zebra Mussel presence.  <br> \n <br> \nDiamond has been used as a Walleye egg take site for Spicer \"Crow River\" strain fish since 2014. Other local Spicer strain Walleye egg take lakes include Koronis, Rice and Elizabeth. Walleye natural reproduction was usually frequent and significant in Diamond prior to 2012 compared to other Spicer Area lakes. Diamond is a popular lake for a variety of fish species which include Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Yellow Perch and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were abundant in both 2018 gillnets (24.50 fish/gillnet) and trapnets (20.83 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes and the historical averages. Although the Black Crappie average size was moderate (0.33 pounds, 7.1 inches gillnets; 0.41 pounds, 8.7 inches trapnets), larger fish (> 11.0 inches) were also captured in the 2018 survey nets. Black Crappie growth rates are moderate to fast in Diamond. The 2015 year class comprised 48% of the 2018 Black Crappie gillnet and trapnet catch. Anglers had good success catching moderate to large sized Black Crappie in the 2018-19 winter. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was low in 2018 (6.25 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes and the historical average. The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 12.43 fish/trapnet. The 2018 Bluegill average size (0.18 pounds and 6.0 inches) was moderate in the trapnets. Abundant numbers large Bluegill (9.50 fish/gillnet, 7.2 inches and 0.32 pounds) were captured in the 2018 gillnets. Bluegill growth rates are above average in Diamond. Local anglers reported catching moderate numbers of large sized (>0.5 pound) Bluegill during the 2018 summer survey.  <br> \n <br> \nA spring electrofishing survey for Largemouth Bass was not conducted due to time constraints in 2018. Largemouth Bass numbers were low in the trapnets (0.08 fish/trapnet, 1.89 pounds average weight) during 2018. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were abundant in 2018 (9.50 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes and the historical average catch rate (5.08 fish/gillnet). The 2018 Northern Pike average size was moderate (2.98 pounds and 23.5 inches). Northern Pike growth rates were moderate. The largest Northern Pike captured was 33.1 inches in the 2018 survey. Diamond is a popular winter spearing lake. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Diamond Lake in the North-central Zone are as follows: 10 (Not more than 2 over 26\". All from 22-26\" must be immediately released.) by angling; 10 (only 1 Northern Pike between 22-26\" and 1 over 26\"; or 2 over 26\") by dark house spearing. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were abundant in 2018 (96.50 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes and the historical average (49.70 fish/gillnet). The 2018 Yellow Perch average size was small to moderate (0.13 pounds and 6.5 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2018 (27.50 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes and the historical average catch rate (17.73 fish/gillnet). The 2018 Walleye average weight and length were 1.72 pounds and 15.6 inches from gillnets. The 2018 catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches and larger) Walleye was 12.50 fish/gillnet. The 2018 catch rate of preferred size (20.0 inches and larger) Walleye was 5.50 fish/gillnet. Walleye growth rates were moderate. The four prominent Walleye year classes present in the 2018 survey catch were from 2016 (33%), 2015 (22%) and 2014 (15%). Older Walleye (ages 10-18) were also captured in the 2018 survey. The 2016 and 2015 year classes were primarily from Walleye fingerling or yearling stockings. <br> \n <br> \nThe YOY Walleye catch rate was low (4.00 YOY/hour) in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY catch rates (< 15 YOY/hour) have been documented since 2012. The Diamond Lake YOY Walleye historical average catch rate is 94.38 YOY/hour. Abundant numbers of yearling Walleye were sampled in a 2014 (54.00 fish/hour, 8.7 inches) and 2017 (24.00 fish/hour, 9.2 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. Recent Walleye stockings included 2013 (33,889 Pike River strain fingerlings, 1,405 pounds), 2014 (825,505 Spicer strain fry; 1,314 Pike River strain fingerlings, 146 pounds; 3,454 Pike River strain yearlings, 359 pounds), 2015 (804,992 Spicer strain fry; 47,091 Spicer strain fingerlings, 1,917 pounds), 2016 (1,290,613 Spicer strain fry), 2017 (1,081,936 Spicer strain fry; 20,784 Spicer strain yearlings, 1,392 pounds stocked in 2017 spring; 207 adults, 84 pounds) and 2018 (930,788 Spicer strain fry). <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2018 (3.00 fish/gillnet, 0.33 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes and the historical averages (32.02 fish/gillnet and 15.17 fish/trapnet). Black Bullhead abundance was the highest (221.00 fish/gillnet) during the 2003 population assessment. The 2018 Black Bullhead average weights were large from gillnets (1.57 pounds) and trapnets (1.67 pounds).  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead numbers were moderate in 2018 (3.50 fish/gillnet). The 2018 Yellow Bullhead average size was large at 1.24 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance in 2018 (0.50 fish/gillnet) was slightly below the historical average catch rate of 0.72 fish/gillnet. Low numbers of Common Carp (0.75 fish/trapnet) were also captured in the 2018 trapnets. The 2018 Common Carp average weight and length were 5.33 pounds and 22.2 inches from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Diamond include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. A fall electrofishing survey is scheduled to assess Walleye natural reproduction or fry stocking annually. A resurvey of the Diamond Lake fish population is currently scheduled for 2023. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Diamond Lake during October 5, 2021. Fall electrofishing surveys prior to 2020 were conducted at three stations for a total of 30 minutes. A 2020 survey was conducted as part of a larger statewide research study to evaluate fall electrofishing catch effectiveness for different total shocking times. Six stations were sampled for a total of 120 minutes in both 2020 and 2021 surveys. The water temperature was 70 F. during the 2021 fall electrofishing survey. Submergent vegetation was varied at different stations in 2021. Water clarity was between 0.5-1.5 feet. We observed abundant numbers of adult Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, shiner species and Yellow Perch in the 2021 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nDiamond is a moderately large (1,607 acres), productive, and moderately deep (27 feet maximum) lake with moderate submergent vegetation located in Kandiyohi County. Abundant numbers of small Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and shiner species were observed during previous 2014-2020 fall electrofishing surveys. Abundant Northern Pike numbers were noted in the 2013 and 2018 summer surveys (9.00+ fish/gillnet), recent ice out trapnets and the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye eggs were collected for the first time in 2014 on Diamond. Approximately, 60-70 quarts of Walleye eggs were collected for statewide and local quotas during 2014 and 2015. Approximately 191 quarts were collected during the early spring of 2016; 90 quarts in 2017; 25 quarts in 2018; and 113 quarts in 2019. No Walleye eggs were taken in 2020 or 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (800,000 fish per year) were marked with oxytetracycline \"OTC\" from the Spicer strain (Diamond, Koronis, and Rice) and stocked into Diamond during the springs of 2014 and 2015 as part of a 10% return for egg take. Diamond was stocked with 1.3 million OTC marked fry in 2016. Both OTC marked (475,396 fish) and unmarked (606,540 fish) fry were stocked in 2017. Unmarked Spicer Strain Walleye fry were stocked on May 18, 2018 (930,788 fish) and May 14, 2019 (751,366 fish). No Walleye fry were stocked in 2020. In 2021, 761,438 Spicer Strain Walleye fry were stocked in Diamond. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings (4,591 Spicer Strain fish, 935 lbs.) were stocked in Diamond during late October of 2021 due to consecutive low YOY Walleye catches in 2020 and 2021. Other recent Walleye fingerling or yearling stockings occurred in 2013 (33,889 fingerlings, 1,405 pounds), 2014 (3,454 yearlings, 359 pounds; 1,314 fingerlings, 146 pounds), 2015 (47,091 fingerlings, 1,917 pounds) and 2017 spring (20,784 yearlings, 1,261 pounds; 207 adults, 84 pounds). The Walleye fingerlings/yearlings stocked into Diamond during 2015 and 2017 were from the local Spicer strain (Diamond, Koronis, and Rice) whereas previous fingerling or yearling stockings were from the Pike River Strain. <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye numbers were low in 2021 fall electrofishing survey (4.50 YOY/hour, 6.26 inches). Moderate yearling and adult Walleye numbers (21.00 fish/hour) were caught in 2021 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were also low in 2020 fall electrofishing survey (0.50 YOY/hour, 7.09 inches) which suggest poor natural reproduction success in Diamond. Low yearling Walleye numbers (1.50 fish/hour, 11.13 inches) were caught in 2020. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant in 2019 fall electrofishing survey (110.00 YOY/hour, 7.03 inches). The YOY Walleye catch rates were low in 2018 (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.68 inches), 2017 (4.00 YOY/hour, 6.24 inches average), 2016 (2.40 YOY/hour, 6.89 inches), 2015 (13.33 YOY/hour, 7.13 inches average), 2014 (8.00 YOY/hour), 2013 (6.00 YOY/hour) and 2012 (6.00 YOY/hour) fall electrofishing surveys. The 2011 YOY Walleye catch rate was high (104.52 YOY/hour, 6.94 inches). The Diamond Lake historical average YOY Walleye catch rate is 88.39 YOY/hour. OTC marked Walleye accounted for 100% and 14% respectively of the 2014 and 2015 fall electrofishing YOY Walleye catches. OTC analysis was not done on the few YOY Walleye captured in 2016 and 2017 fall surveys. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in the most recent 2018 standard summer survey (27.50 fish/gillnet) was above the normal ranges for Diamond and similar lakes. The 2018 Walleye average weight and length were 1.72 pounds and 15.60 inches from gillnets. The three prominent Walleye year classes present in the 2018 gillnet and trapnet catch were from 2016 (33%), 2015 (22%) and 2014 (15%). <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2012, consistent and excellent Walleye natural reproduction had occurred in Diamond based on fall electrofishing surveys, OTC markings. In recent years Walleye recruitment from natural reproduction or fry stocking has been poor due to poor early spring survival conditions and an abundance of predators in Diamond. Walleye natural reproduction and fry stocking success were generally poor in most area lakes during 2015-2017. A record early ice out date occurred on March 8, 2017 for Diamond. The most recent ice out dates occurred on April 7, 2020 and on March 29, 2021. Late ice out dates recently occurred on April 30, 2018 and April 20, 2019. Typical walleye spawning occurs during mid-late April with hatching around mid-May. Generally, early ice out years are not conducive for good walleye fry survival in rearing ponds or lakes if stocked in mid/late April. This is often due to extended cold/cloudy weather periods during April that may deter plant plankton production which in turn limits the emergence of early walleye food prey like zooplankton and aquatic insects.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Diamond include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing, and educating about the spread of invasive species, conducting Walleye egg take operations when needed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. Special regulations were enacted for Bluegill (10 fish bag limit) in 2021. A targeted trapnet survey of Bluegill was conducted in May of 2021. A creel survey was conducted during the 2020-21 winter and 2021 open water season. A fall night electrofishing survey is scheduled to assess Walleye natural reproduction and/or fry stocking in 2022. A standard summer survey of the Diamond Lake fish population is currently scheduled for 2023. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Diamond Lake was conducted in July of 2003. Diamond is a large (1,565 acres) and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 27 feet. Residential development has occurred throughout the entire shoreline area with the exception of the southeast portion of Dogfish Bay. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles from various locations throughout the lake. The outlet dam drains into the Middle Fork of the Crow River via a drainage ditch. Public access sites include a county park access along the west shore and a small access along the east shore. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) is present along the north shore point, east shoreline area, and Dogfish bay area. Submergent vegetation densities within the lake are moderate with high densities of curly-leaf pondweed possible during some years especially in the north bay area. Water quality and clarity are moderate, but algae blooms can occur during the late summer months. Long term water quality and clarity trends of Diamond indicate an increasingly degraded system. Local anglers had good fishing success for walleye during the last several years, especially during the early winter months.Largemouth bass numbers were low to moderate in the 2003 spring electrofishing survey (27.0 fish/hour) compared to the normal range (25th=14.0, 50th=29.6, 75th=66.6 fish/hour) for area lakes, but above the Diamond Lake historical average (17.2 fish/hour). The 2003 largemouth bass average size was moderate (1.84 pounds and 13.1 inches) from spring electrofishing. The 2003 catch rate of preferred size (15.0 inches) and larger largemouth bass was moderate (10.0 fish/hour) in the spring electrofishing survey. Largemouth bass growth rates in Diamond Lake were above the normal ranges for ages 1-7 compared to area lakes. The 2001 year class comprised 58% of the 2003 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch in Diamond Lake. The largest largemouth bass captured was 20.1 inches in the Diamond 2003 spring electrofishing survey.Black crappie numbers were high in 2003 (6.8 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie gillnet historical average catch rate is 4.0 fish/gillnet for Diamond. The 2003 black crappie average size was small (0.16 pounds and 5.3 inches) from gillnets. Black crappie growth rates in Diamond were generally above the normal ranges for ages 1-4 compared to area lakes. The 2002 year class comprised 59% of the Diamond 2003 total black crappie assessment catch.Northern pike numbers were low in 2003 (1.4 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 4.2 fish/gillnet for Diamond. The 2003 northern pike average size was moderate (2.79 pounds and 22.4 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.94 pounds from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates in Diamond were generally above or near the top end of the normal ranges for ages 1-5 compared to area lakes. Approximately 61% of the northern pike captured in the Diamond 2003 summer assessment were from the 2001 year class. The largest northern pike capture was 33.2 inches in the Diamond 2003 assessment nets.Yellow perch numbers were low to moderate in 2003 (15.2 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 42.0 fish/gillnet for Diamond. The 2003 yellow perch average length was small (6.1 inches) from gillnets, and slightly below the historical average (6.3 inches). The 2001 year class comprised 72% of the yellow perch captured in the Diamond 2003 gillnets and trapnets.Walleye numbers were low in 2003 (7.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the Diamond Lake historical average (17.4 fish/gillnet), but within the normal range for similar lakes. The 2003 walleye average size was moderate (2.14 pounds and 17.0 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 2.16 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates in Diamond were within the normal ranges for ages 1-3 and above the normal ranges for ages 4-7 compared to area lakes. The largest walleye captured was 24.2 inches in the Diamond 2003 assessment. Three walleye year classes (1999, 2000, 2001) comprised near equal percentages (25% each) of the 2003 total walleye assessment catch in Diamond. The walleye population is due primarily to natural reproduction in Diamond Lake. Young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers due to natural reproduction were low with a small average size in 2003 (28.0 YOY/hour, 5.3 inches average size) compared to the normal range for Diamond Lake (25th=44.3, 50th=54.4, 75th=134.0 YOY/hour). Yearling walleye numbers were low (8.0 yearling/hour) with a small average size (8.4 inches) in the Diamond 2003 fall electrofishing survey. Diamond Lake was last stocked with walleye fingerlings in 1998 (37,274 fish).Bluegill numbers were low in 2003 (0.9 fish/trapnet) compared to the Diamond Lake historical average (11.2 fish/trapnet) and the normal range for similar lakes. The 2003 bluegill average size was large (0.37 pounds. and 7.2 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.26 pounds from trapnets. Bluegill growth rates in Diamond Lake were above the normal ranges for ages 1-3 compared to area lakes. The 2000 year class comprised 82% of the total bluegill catch in the Diamond 2003 nets. Black bullhead numbers were high in 2003 (221.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the highest historical recorded value for gillnets from Diamond Lake. The 2003 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.28 pounds and 7.5 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.77 pounds from gillnets.Other fish species of special interest captured in the Diamond 2003 nets included high numbers of carp (4.6 fish/gillnet). The carp historical average catch rate is 0.81 fish/gillnet for Diamond. The 2003 average carp weight was 1.72 pounds from gillnets.Current fish management activities on Diamond Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Diamond Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2004 fall for YOY walleye and resurveyed in the 2007 spring and summer for all fish species. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted on Diamond in mid-May of 2022 as part of the ongoing statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  Twelve standard lake survey trapnets were set at historical stations to target Bluegill and Black Crappie. Special regulations for several area lakes (Nest, Long (Hawick, Minnesota), Diamond, George and Florida) currently entail reduced bag limits (i.e., 5 or 10 fish) for Bluegill or Black Crappie. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Trapnet sampling pre-spawn Bluegill during early/mid-May or September is preferred to summer (June-August) netting for regulation evaluation.  <br> \n <br> \nDiamond is a moderately large (1,607 acres), productive, and moderately deep (27 feet maximum) lake. It is in Kandiyohi County. Diamond Lake is highly developed with 352 homes/cabins, one resort, and one County Park/campground (2008 resurvey). The Diamond Lake County Park (55 camping sites) and main public access is located along the northwest side of the lake. The immediate watershed is primarily agriculture with residential homes, hardwoods, and wetlands comprising the remainder. The southeast bay \"Dogfish\" bay is the least developed portion of the lake. There are numerous small inlets and one large inlet that drain primarily agricultural row crops via tile systems and wetlands into Diamond. The outlet connects to the Middle Fork Crow River via a ditch system. Water levels have been below average since 2020. Submergent vegetation species are varied and densities moderate in Diamond. Curly-leaf pondweed has been a nuisance especially along the north portions of the lake in the past but has been less bothersome in recent years. Emergent vegetation present includes mostly hardstem bulrush (north point, east shoreline area) and cattail species (Dogfish Bay). Shoalwater substrates of the main basin are mostly sand, rubble, and gravel. Silt and muck compose the majority of substrates in Dogfish Bay. Zebra Mussels were first documented in Diamond during 2018. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was high (20.08 fish/trapnet) in mid-May of 2022. The summer (mid-July) historical average catch rate is 6.98 fish/trapnet for Diamond Lake. The Black Crappie average size was small (0.23 pounds and 7.5 inches) from 2022 mid-May trapnets. The summer historical average weights are 0.36 pounds for trapnets. The 2022 mid-May catch rate of preferred size (10.0 inches plus) Black Crappie was low (0.42 fish/trapnet). Black Crappie growth rates were slow for age 1, fair for ages 2-3, and excellent for ages 4-8. The 2019 year class comprised 94% of the 2022 Black Crappie catch. Local anglers reported fair success catching large Black Crappie during the 2022-2023 winter.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was low (7.50 fish/trapnet) in mid-May of 2022. The summer (late June) historical average catch rate is 12.43 fish/trapnet for Diamond Lake. The 2022 mid-May Bluegill average size was large (0.27 pounds and 6.8 inches from trapnets. The summer (mid-July) historical Bluegill average weight is 0.21 pounds from trapnets. The 2022 mid-May catch rate of preferred size (8.0 inches plus) Bluegill was low (1.33 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were good for ages 1-2, and excellent for ages 3-8. The 2019 year class comprised 39% of the 2022 Bluegill catch. The 2017 year class comprised approximately 23% of the 2022 Bluegill catch. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured in the 2022 mid-May trapnets included abundant numbers of Common Carp (1.33 fish/trapnet) and Walleye (3.17 fish/trapnet). Moderate numbers of Yellow Bullhead (3.33 fish/trapnet) were caught in 2022. Low numbers of Black Bullhead (0.08 fish/trapnet), Largemouth Bass (0.17 fish/trapnet), Golden Shiner (0.08 fish/trapnet), Hybrid Sunfish (0.08 fish/trapnet), Pumpkinseed Sunfish (0.58 fish/trapnet), White Sucker (0.50 fish/trapnet), Yellow Perch (0.17 fish/trapnet) and Northern Pike (0.33 fish/trapnet) were also captured in the 2022 mid-May trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Diamond include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing, and educating about the spread of invasive species, conducting Walleye egg take operations when needed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. Walleye fry will be stocked during years of egg take. Special regulations were enacted for Bluegill (5 fish bag limit) in 2021. A creel survey was conducted during the 2020-21 winter and 2021 open water season. A fall night electrofishing survey is scheduled to assess Walleye natural reproduction and/or fry stocking in 2023. A standard summer survey of the Diamond Lake fish population is currently scheduled for 2023. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Diamond Lake during September 23, 2019.  <br> \n <br> \nDiamond is a moderately large (1,607 acres), productive, and moderately deep (27 feet maximum) lake with moderate submergent vegetation located in Kandiyohi County. Abundant numbers of small Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Shiner species were observed during 2014-2019 fall electrofishing surveys. Abundant Northern Pike numbers were noted in the 2013 and 2018 summer surveys (9.00+ fish/gillnet) and recent ice out trapnets. Walleye eggs were collected for the first time in 2014 on Diamond. Approximately, 60-70 quarts of Walleye eggs were collected for statewide and local quotas during 2014 and 2015. Approximately 191 quarts were collected during the early spring of 2016; 90 quarts in 2017; 25 quarts in 2018; and 113 quarts in 2019. It was common to catch numerous females between 6-10 pounds each, but males were few during spawn take.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (800,000 fish per year) were marked with oxytetracycline \"OTC\" from the Spicer strain (Diamond, Koronis, and Rice) and stocked into Diamond during the springs of 2014 and 2015 as part of a 10% return for egg take. Diamond was stocked with 1.3 million OTC marked fry in 2016. Both OTC marked (475,396 fish) and unmarked (606,540 fish) fry were stocked in 2017. Unmarked Spicer Strain Walleye fry were stocked on May 18, 2018 (930,788 fish) and May 14, 2019 (751,366 fish). <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye numbers were abundant in 2019 fall electrofishing survey (110.00 YOY/hour, 7.03 inches). The YOY Walleye catch rates were low in 2018 (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.68 inches), 2017 (4.00 YOY/hour, 6.24 inches average), 2016 (2.40 YOY/hour, 6.89 inches), 2015 (13.33 YOY/hour, 7.13 inches average), 2014 (8.00 YOY/hour), 2013 (6.00 YOY/hour) and 2012 (6.00 YOY/hour) fall electrofishing surveys. The 2011 YOY Walleye catch rate was high (104.52 YOY/hour, 6.94 inches) due to natural reproduction.  The Diamond Lake historical average YOY Walleye catch rate is 94.99 YOY/hour. OTC marked Walleye accounted for 100% and 14% respectively of the 2014 and 2015 fall electrofishing YOY Walleye catches. OTC analysis was not done on the few YOY Walleye captured in 2016 or 2017 fall surveys. <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2012, consistent and excellent Walleye natural reproduction had occurred in Diamond based on fall electrofishing surveys and OTC markings. In recent years Walleye recruitment from natural reproduction or fry stocking has been poor due to poor early spring survival conditions and an abundance of predators in Diamond. Walleye natural reproduction and fry stocking success were generally poor in most area lakes during 2015-2017. A record early ice out date occurred on March 8, 2017 for Diamond. Late ice out dates recently occurred on April 30, 2018 and April 20, 2019. Typical walleye spawning occurs during mid-late April with hatching around mid-May. Generally, early ice out years are not conducive for good walleye fry survival in rearing ponds or lakes if stocked in mid/late April. This is often due to extended cold/cloudy weather periods that may negatively reduce plant plankton production and in turn reduce walleye food prey like zooplankton and aquatic insects.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerling or yearling stockings have occurred in response to consecutive low YOY Walleye numbers. The recent stockings occurred in 2013 (33,889 fingerlings, 1,405 pounds), 2014 (3,454 yearlings, 359 pounds; 1,314 fingerlings, 146 pounds), 2015 (47,091 fingerlings, 1,917 pounds) and 2017 spring (20,784 yearlings, 1,261 pounds; 207 adults, 84 pounds). The Walleye fingerlings/yearlings stocked into Diamond during 2015 and 2017 were from the local Spicer strain (Diamond, Koronis, and Rice), whereas previous fingerling or yearling stockings were from the Pike River Strain. Abundant yearling Walleye numbers were caught in the 2014 (54.00 fish/hour, 8.66 inches average) and 2017 (24.00 fish/hour, 9.24 inches average) fall electrofishing surveys, but these fish were likely from previous fall or spring fingerling/yearling stockings.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in the most recent 2018 summer survey (27.50 fish/gillnet) was above the normal ranges for Diamond and similar lakes. The 2018 Walleye average weight and length were 1.72 pounds and 15.60 inches from gillnets. The three prominent Walleye year classes present in the 2018 gillnet and trapnet catch were from 2016 (33%), 2015 (22%) and 2014 (15%). <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Diamond include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, conducting Walleye egg take operations when needed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. A fall night electrofishing survey is scheduled to assess Walleye natural reproduction in 2020. A standard survey of the Diamond Lake fish population is currently scheduled for 2023. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Diamond Lake during November 3, 2022. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Fall electrofishing surveys prior to 2020 were conducted at three stations for a total of 30 minutes. A 2020 survey was conducted as part of a larger statewide research study to evaluate fall electrofishing catch effectiveness for different total shocking times. Six stations were sampled for a total of 120 minutes in both 2020 and 2021 surveys. Five stations were sampled for a total of 100 minutes in 2022. The water temperature was 50 F. during the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. Submergent vegetation was varied at different stations in 2022. Water clarity was moderate. We observed abundant to moderate numbers of adult Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, shiner species and Yellow Perch in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nDiamond is a moderately large (1,607 acres), productive, and moderately deep (27 feet maximum) lake with moderate submergent vegetation densities. It is in Kandiyohi County. Zebra Mussels were first documented in Diamond during 2018. Abundant numbers of small Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and shiner species were observed during previous 2014-2020 fall electrofishing surveys. Abundant Northern Pike numbers were noted in the 2013 and 2018 summer surveys (9.00+ fish/gillnet), recent ice out trapnets and the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye eggs were collected for the first time in 2014 on Diamond. Approximately, 60-70 quarts of Walleye eggs were collected for statewide and local quotas during 2014 and 2015. Approximately 191 quarts were collected during the early spring of 2016; 90 quarts in 2017; 25 quarts in 2018; 113 quarts in 2019 and 78.75 quarts in 2022. Walleye egg take operations were not conducted in 2020 and 2021 on Diamond Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2012, consistent and excellent Walleye natural reproduction had occurred in Diamond based on fall electrofishing surveys, OTC markings and analysis. In recent years Walleye recruitment from natural reproduction or fry stocking has been reduced due to frequent poor early spring survival conditions and an overabundance of predators in Diamond. A record early ice out date occurred on March 8, 2017 for Diamond. The most recent ice out dates occurred on April 7, 2020, March 29, 2021, and April 16, 2022. Water temperatures were colder (40-42 F.) than normal during most of the 2022 spawn take. Northern Pike were more numerous than Walleye in nets shortly after ice out during 2022. <br> \n <br> \nSpicer Strain (Diamond, Koronis, and Rice) Walleye fry (800,000 fish per year) were marked with oxytetracycline \"OTC\" and stocked into Diamond during the springs of 2014 and 2015 as part of a 10% return for egg take. Diamond was stocked with 1.3 million OTC marked fry in 2016. Both OTC marked (475,396 fish) and unmarked (606,540 fish) fry were stocked in 2017. Unmarked Spicer Strain Walleye fry were stocked on May 18, 2018 (930,788 fish) and May 14, 2019 (751,366 fish). No Walleye fry were stocked in 2020. Spicer Strain Walleye fry were stocked in 2021 (761,438 fish) and 2022 (636,132 fish) in Diamond. Walleye fingerlings (4,591 Spicer Strain fish, 935 lbs.) were stocked in Diamond during late October of 2021 due to consecutive low YOY Walleye catches in 2020 and 2021. Other recent Walleye fingerling or yearling stockings occurred in 2013 (33,889 fingerlings, 1,405 pounds), 2014 (3,454 yearlings, 359 pounds; 1,314 fingerlings, 146 pounds), 2015 (47,091 fingerlings, 1,917 pounds) and 2017 spring (20,784 yearlings, 1,261 pounds; 207 adults, 84 pounds). Walleye fingerlings/yearlings stocked into Diamond during 2015 and 2017 were from the local Spicer strain (Diamond, Koronis, and Rice) whereas previous fingerling or yearling stockings were from the Pike River Strain. <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers (70.80 YOY/hour, 6.4 inches) were caught in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey (fry stocked). Walleye hatch or fry stocking survival was good in many local lakes during 2022. Late May and June air and water temperatures were above normal in 2022 which is more conducive to plankton production. Typical walleye spawning occurs during mid-late April with hatching around mid-May. Generally, early ice out years are not conducive for good walleye fry survival in rearing ponds or lakes if stocked in mid/late April. This is often due to extended cold/cloudy weather periods during April that may deter phytoplankton production which in turn limits the emergence of early walleye food prey like zooplankton and aquatic insects.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate Walleye yearling or age 2 fish numbers (8.40 fish/hour) were caught in 2022. YOY Walleye numbers were low in the 2021 fall electrofishing survey (4.50 YOY/hour, 6.3 inches). Moderate yearling and adult Walleye numbers (21.00 fish/hour) were caught in 2021. YOY Walleye numbers were also low in the 2020 fall electrofishing survey (0.50 YOY/hour, 7.1 inches). Low yearling Walleye numbers (1.50 fish/hour, 11.1 inches) were caught in 2020. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey (110.00 YOY/hour, 7.0 inches). The YOY Walleye catch rates were low in 2018 (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.7 inches), 2017 (4.00 YOY/hour, 6.2 inches), 2016 (2.40 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches), 2015 (13.33 YOY/hour, 7.1 inches), 2014 (8.00 YOY/hour), 2013 (6.00 YOY/hour) and 2012 (6.00 YOY/hour) fall electrofishing surveys. The 2011 YOY Walleye catch rate was high (104.52 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches). The Diamond Lake historical average YOY Walleye catch rate is 87.78 YOY/hour. OTC marked Walleye accounted for 100% and 14% respectively of the 2014 and 2015 fall electrofishing YOY Walleye catches. OTC analysis was not done on the few YOY Walleye that were captured in 2016 and 2017 fall surveys. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in the most recent 2018 standard summer survey (27.50 fish/gillnet) was above the normal ranges for Diamond and Lake Class 27 lakes. The 2018 Walleye average weight and length were 1.72 pounds and 15.6 inches from gillnets. The 2018 catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches and larger) Walleye was high (12.50 fish/gillnet). The 2018 catch rate of preferred size (20.0 inches and larger) Walleye was also high (5.50 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were fair to good. The three prominent Walleye year classes present in the 2018 gillnet and trapnet catch were from 2016 (33%), 2015 (22%) and 2014 (15%). <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Diamond include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing, and educating about the spread of invasive species, conducting Walleye egg take operations when needed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. Walleye fry will be stocked during years of egg take. Special regulations were enacted for Bluegill (5 fish bag limit) in 2021. A targeted trapnet survey of Bluegill occurred in May of 2021. A creel survey was conducted during the 2020-21 winter and 2021 open water season. A fall night electrofishing survey is scheduled to assess Walleye natural reproduction and/or fry stocking in 2023. A standard summer survey of the Diamond Lake fish population is currently scheduled for 2023. <br> \n</p>",
