                "narrative": "<p>South Sunrise Pool is an impoundment of the Sunrise River managed by the Section of Wildlife for waterfowl production.  Water levels are managed to promote aquatic vegetation benefical to waterfowl.  To enhance plant growth, carp abundance is controlled by winter draw downs.  Low dissolved oxygen levels in winter, while limiting carp abundance, has likely led to the dominance of rough fish in the fishery.During the 1998 survey, 9 trapnet sets were made.  Based on both numbers and weights, pumpkinseeds and black bullheads dominated the catch.  Both species ran small with 80% of the black bullheads between 4.5 and 7.0 inches and a 6.2 inch maximum for pumpkinseeds.  The 21 northern pike sampled in the trapnets ranged in length from 12.1 to 26.5 inches and averaged 1.5 pounds.  Compared to quartile ranges for the lake class the trapnet catches were low for black crappie, bowfin, common carp, largemouth bass, and white sucker, high for pumpkinseed and normal for all other species.  Mean weights were normal for all species except black bullhead, bluegill, and largemouth bass which were low.  Three gillnet sets were made during the survey.  Yellow, black, and brown bullheads combined accounted for 24% of the catch by weight and 78% by number.  Northern pike contributed only 9% of the catch by number but 36% by weight.  The 18 northern pike sampled in the gillnets ranged from 14.6 to 27.5 inches in length and averaged 2.3 pounds.  Compared to the lake class quartile ranges gillnet catches were low for walleye and yellow perch, high for brown and yellow bullhead, and normal for the remaining species.  Mean weights were low for walleye, high for yellow perch, and normal for the remaining species.Angling pressure is moderate with a mix of boat and shore angling.  Northern pike and panfish are the targeted species.</p>",
