The average length of these fish was 21.7\" with fish up to 32\" sampled.  Only 19% of the fish were in the 22-26\" protected slot, leaving ample opportunity for harvest. <br> \n <br> \nWhile both Bluegills (6.8/trap net) and Black Crappies (1.4/trap net) were caught in average numbers, some nice size fish are present and could offer the opportunity for a meal.  For Bluegills, 46% of the fish were 7\" or larger.  Black Crappies showed 50% of the fish measured 8\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present but were not sampled by night electrofishing this survey.  Some bass were sampled in the survey nets, with sizes ranging from 7.2\" to 17.9\". <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Camp Lake is about 530 acres with a maximum depth of 42 feet; about 40% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Residential development is evident along much of the shoreline but natural vegetation remains in areas.  Substantial sections of shoreline have stands of dense bulrush, wild rice, water lilies, and other aquatic vegetation.  There are also areas with woody habitat along the shoreline.  A survey targeting the near shore fish community was conducted on Camp Lake on 7 July, 2014.  Sampling sites were 100 feet long and 14 stations were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.   <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing with a backpack unit was conducted at all 14 stations, but some sampling took place from the boat at sites where depth and emergent vegetation prevented wading.  Seining was conducted at 10 sites as emergent vegetation, soft sediments, and deep water prevented seining at 4 sites.  Nearshore IBI sampling captured the following species of fish: (in alphabetical order) Banded Killifish, Black Crappie, Blacknose Shiner, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Fathead Minnow, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Mottled Sculpin, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Spottail Shiner, Tadpole Madtom, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nThe survey captured several species that are intolerant of poor water quality and/or shoreline disturbance including: Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass.  Only two tolerant species (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish) were sampled in nearshore sampling.   <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish sampling data is combined with gillnet and trapnet data to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.   The fish IBI score calculated from this survey suggests that Camp Lake's fish community has not been degraded by excess watershed or shoreline stress to an extent such that it is below an impairment threshold identified for similar lakes in the state.   <br> \n <br> \nThis sampling protocol is part of a watershed assessment tool in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   Camp Lake is located in the Rum River Watershed. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Camp Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 19-20 July 2023.  Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with 4 sites sampled from the boat.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample four sites, a 15-foot seine was used at six sites, and dense vegetation or deep soft sediments prevented seining at 4 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 20 native species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass) and one species (Green Sunfish) that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  An additional survey was completed on Camp Lake in July 2020 resulting in a similar FIBI score.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates the fish community in Camp Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Camp Lake is fully supporting for aquatic life use. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to Rum River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike is the primary management species, which were sampled at a rate of 5.0 per gill net.  This is average for lakes that are similar to Camp.  The average length of these fish was 22.3\" with fish up to 34.3\" sampled.  About 22% of the northern pike were 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie is a secondary management species of Camp Lake.  Their catch rate was 1.6 per gill net, with an average size of 8\".  When combined with trap nets, 50 percent were 8\" or larger.  The largest black crappie sampled was 11.4\". <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass is also a secondary management species for this lake.  Because largemouth bass do not net well, electrofishing was conducted to sample the largemouth bass population.  The average length of these fish was 14.4\" and the largest individual was 18.5\".  More than 85% were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nAnother species that may be of interest to anglers are bluegill.  Although the bluegill numbers may be down from past surveys, their size has increased.  The average length from trap nets was 6.8\" with the largest individual being 8.4\".  When combined with gill nets, 58% were 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey include black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), rock bass, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

Average size was 23.0\" and 2.9 lbs., with 30% measuring 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured at the rate of 24.8/hr run time during spring electrofishing.  Average length was 10.1\" and 33% were 12\" or larger.  Largemouth bass were captured in average numbers in both gill nets and trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate was above average in gill nets (3.6/gill net), with an average length of 7.2\".  The catch rate was average in trap nets (2.0/trap net), with an average length of 7.9\".  When both net types were combined, 46% of the fish were 8\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate was average (21.9/trap net).  Average length was 5.8\" and 18% of the fish were 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate was average (2.8/gill net).  Average length was 5.8\" and none of the fish were 8\" or larger.  These small perch make great forage for fish such as northern pike and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured included black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

White sucker, rock bass and largemouth bass indicated low populations. The northern pike length-frequency ranged from 12 to 28 inches, with 60% in the 16 to 18 inch size class. Age groups from 3 to 5 were represented with 23 of 31 fish aged 3 and 4 year old fish. Growth rates were slow compared to regional medians. Bluegills ranged in age from 3 to 7. All ages indicated slow growth. Black crappies appeared to have average to slow growth rates with ages 2, 3, 4 and 7 year age classes represented. The 4 year age class represented over half of the fish aged. The yellow perch population appears to have dropped significantly from 34/lift in 1982 to 1.0/ lift in 1987. All were in the 5 to 6 inch size class and 11 of 13 were 3 years old and the other 2 and 4 year old. The length-frequency of the walleyes ranged from 18 to 24 inches with half in the 19 inch size class. There were no fish in the first five age classes. The seven year age class was strongest with 8 of 12 fish aged. Average growth rates were indicated when compared to regional medians. Bullheads were present with most in the 8 to 10 inch size classes. Carp were also present in the lake.</p>",
