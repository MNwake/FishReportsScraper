Northern pike fishing is good to excellent with small size being the major complaint. Bluegill fishing is excellent, but fish are also small in size. Black crappie fishing is seasonally excellent, with 0.5-2.0 lb. fish being caught. With no developed public access available to Leon Lake, it has limited fishing pressure. </p>",
