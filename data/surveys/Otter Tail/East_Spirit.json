Aging data indicates that stocking may have a major impact on walleye abundance.  Walleye natural reproduction appears to be very limited.  No walleyes were captured from the year class in which the lake was not stocked.  A strong year class of age-4+ fish corresponded to a year fry were stocked.  Also, fingerlings produced strong year classes in 1979 and 1983 (fingerlings were large). <br> \n     Northern pike have decreased slightly in abundance since 1975 while average size has increased from 1.5 lbs. to 2.2 lbs.  Bluegills are very abundant and very small.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   East Spirit Lake is a 544 acre, moderately fertile lake located in north-central Otter Tail County, approximately three miles southwest of Vergas, MN.  The maximum depth is 38 feet and 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during this survey was 13.5 feet, which indicates good water clarity.  Secchi disk readings since 1975 have ranged from 11.0 - 15.0 feet.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of gravel, sand and muck.  The majority of the north and south shorelines are developed.  A state owned public access is located on County Road 4 along the NW shore of the lake.   <br> \n     Along with the many shoreline points that contain bulrush, there are 2 distinct bulrush humps on the northern main portion of the lake.  Another unique area is the eastern bay located on the central portion of the lake that is rimmed with a floating cattail bog.  Common cattail and hardstem bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  These emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can actually absorb and break down pollutants.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.  <br> \n    East Spirit Lake can be ecologically classified as a Bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present.   <br> \n   Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  Walleye abundance was low in 2013 (1.1 per net). Walleye from gill nets ranged in length from 11.7 - 22.1 inches, with an average length and weight of 18.2 inches and 2.2 pounds. Walleye attain an average length of 14.7 inches at four years of age.    <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has remained at a moderate density and age data indicates that natural reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.9 - 34.3 inches with an average length and weight of 18.7 inches and 1.5 pounds.   Eleven percent of the Northern Pike in the gill net sample measured greater than 24.0 inches in length.  Pike growth is slow with an average length of 19.7 inches at four years of age.  The slow growth rates for pike may be attributed to the low abundance of Yellow Perch, a preferred forage fish. <br> \n    Bluegill abundance has historically fluctuated and is now on the high end.  Fifty-six percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 5.4 inches at five years of age. <br> \n    The Black Crappie population appears to be rebounding.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 5.8 - 11.6 inches with an average length of 9.3 inches.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 9.3 inches at five years of age. <br> \n   Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 3.5 - 16.7 inches with an average length of 11.1 inches.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 12.6 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     East Spirit Lake is a 544 acre, moderately fertile lake located in north-central Otter Tail County, approximately three miles southwest of Vergas, MN.  The maximum depth is 38 feet, and 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during this survey was 12.5 feet, which indicates good water clarity.  Secchi disk readings since 1975 have ranged from 11.0 - 15.0 feet.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of gravel, sand and muck.  The majority of the north and south shorelines are developed.  A state owned public access is located on County Road 4 along the NW shore of the lake.  Anglers can expect to catch walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill and bullhead. <br> \n     The only marsh area on the lake is located in the northern bay on the central portion of the lake, and represents critical spawning habitat.  Emergent plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattails provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can actually absorb and break down pollutants.  Because of their ecological importance, bulrush and cattails may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     The walleye gill net catch rate was 3.8 per net, which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye from gill nets ranged in length from 8.4 - 23.7 inches, with a mean length and weight of 17.5 inches and 2.0 pounds.  The walleye population is maintained through every other year fry stocking, which supplements limited natural reproduction.   <br> \n     The northern pike gill net catch rate increased from 4.4 per net in 2001 to 12.8 per net, which is well above the expected range for similar lakes.  This population increase is likely in response to high water levels in recent years, which have provided excellent spawning conditions in the form of flooded vegetation. Northern pike from gill nets ranged in length from 12.9 - 32.4 inches, with a mean length and weight of 18.5 inches and 1.4 pounds.   <br> \n     A total of 21 largemouth bass were captured in gill nets for a catch rate of 2.2 per net.  None were sampled in gill nets in 1995 or 2001.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 8.1 - 15.3 inches, with a mean length and weight of 11.0 inches and 0.8 pounds. <br> \n     A total of three black crappie were sampled in trap nets for a catch rate of 0.1 per net, comparable to 2001. Black crappie trap net catch rates have declined in each successive survey since 1951.  A spring trap net assessment was conducted in 2001, and no black crappie were sampled.  Spring trap net assessments are the most useful method to evaluate black crappie populations.   <br> \n     The bluegill trap net catch rate was 22.8 per net, which is within the expected range for similar lakes. The average length of bluegill from trap nets was 6.4 inches, and seven consecutive age classes were represented in the sample.  <br> \n     The black bullhead trap net catch rate decreased from 131.3 per net in 2001 to 50.6 per net, but remains well above the expected range for similar lakes. The black bullhead trap net catch rate ranged from 0.0 - 0.2 per net in all surveys prior to 2001. The reasons for this large increase are unknown, however, it is possible that high water levels have led to an increase in fish movement from West Spirit Lake into East Spirit Lake via the culvert under County Road 4.  <br> \n     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

Average weight of northern pike decreased from 2.2 pounds in 1984 to 1.9 pounds.  Pike reproduction appears good as fish ages I+ through IV+ were represented in the sample.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance declined from an extremely high 196.4 per trap net lift in 1984 to 58.2 per net.  Bluegill size distribution appears to have improved as the percentage of bluegill measured greater than 7.0 inches in length increased from 2% in 1984 to 16%.  <br> \n     Largemouth bass and black crappie reproduction appears good as their samples consisted of several age-classes for each species; however, black crappie abundance declined from 12.8 per trap net in 1978 to 1.9 per net.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance declined from 20.7 per gill net lift in 1984 to 3.3 per net.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance was 4.8 per gill net lift, similar to 4.5 per net in 1984. Walleye growth rates appear to have declined as the average back-calculated length of an age IV+ walleye was 17.4 inches in 1984 compared to 15.5 inches in this survey.  While there appears to be evidence of walleye natural reproduction, no conclusions can be reached due to recent fingerling stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Spirit Lake is located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately three miles southwest of Vergas, MN.  East Spirit Lake is a 544-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is within the Otter Tail River watershed.  The maximum depth of East Spirit Lake is 38 feet; however, 45% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2001 lake survey was 12.4 feet, which indicates excellent water clarity.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  East Spirit Lake is included in Lake class 25 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.  East Spirit Lake is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.     East Spirit Lake is ecologically classified as a centrarchid (bass-panfish) lake and is managed as a walleye-centrarchid lake.  The majority of the north and south shorelines of East Spirit Lake are developed.  The 1984 resurvey identified 30 homes and cottages on the lake.  A state owned public water access is located off of County Road 4 along the northwest shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist of gravel, sand, and muck.  The only marsh area on the lake is located in the northern bay in the central portion of the lake and represents critical spawning habitat.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattails provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling within this lake it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     Northern pike abundance decreased since the 1995 survey, but remains within the expected range for lake class 25.  Northern pike reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 14.6 to 29.1 inches with an average length of 17.6 inches.  Pike attain an average length of 20.2 inches at four years of age.  Growth rates are below average for class 25 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     The populations of black and brown bullheads in East Spirit Lake have substantially increased since the 1995 survey.  The catch rates for both species are well above the normal range for class 25 lakes.  The average length of black bullhead in the sample was 7.1 inches.   A dramatic increase in black bullhead abundance sometimes indicates a degradation of water quality; however, no such evidence was observed during this population assessment.  The abundance of yellow bullhead also increased slightly from the 1995 survey and exceeds the normal range for lake class 25.       Bluegill abundance decreased since 1995 but is still within the normal range for class 25 lakes.  Data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Twenty-two percent of the bluegills in the trap net sample were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age.     A spring trap netting assessment was completed during this survey but no black crappies were sampled.  Only one crappie was sampled during the summer trapnet assessment.  The black crappie catch rate has declined in each successive survey since the 1951 initial survey.  The recent decline in the black crappie population may be linked to the significant increase in the bullhead populations.     Walleye abundance also decreased but is within the normal range for lakes of this type.   The strongest year class (1997) corresponded to a year of walleye fry stocking.  Age data indicate that natural reproduction is limited.  The average length of walleye was 16.4 inches.  Walleye reach an average length of 10.9 inches at three years of age, which is below average for class 25 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.  The DNR will initiate a biennial fry stocking sequence in 2003.         Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in East Spirit Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",
