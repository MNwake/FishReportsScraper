                "narrative": "<p>Saint Anthony Falls Pool stretches for 12.3 miles upstream of Lower Saint Anthony Falls Dam in downtown Minneapolis to the Coon Rapids Dam, covering 459 acres.  A portion of this section of Pool #1 is included in the US Army Corps of Engineers' 9-foot channel maintenance project.  Commercial navigation extends 3.6 miles upstream of Upper Saint Anthony Falls Lock and Dam.  The remaining stretch of river resembles more natural conditions.  Construction of Upper and Lower Saint Anthony Falls Lock and Dam was completed in 1963 to allow for navigation north of Saint Anthony Falls. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing during the 2009 population assessment resulted in the sampling of eight gamefish species.  Smallmouth bass were the only gamefish sampled at every site.  Smallmouth bass in Saint Anthony Falls Pool averaged 9.5 inches and 0.76 pounds.  Individuals over 19 inches were sampled.  Larger fish were sampled more often in the area just downstream of Coon Rapids Dam.  Channel catfish were the second most sampled species.  Five walleye were sampled, four of which were young-of-the-year.  Three pike were sampled, two were young-of-the-year fish.   Flathead catfish, bluegill, black crappie and green sunfish were also sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nTen species of rough fish were sampled: bigmouth buffalo, common carp, freshwater drum, highfin carpsucker, quillback, northern hogsucker, river redhorse, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse and white sucker.  Common carp were the most abundant, followed by freshwater drum and shorthead redhorse. <br> \n <br> \nCompared to the previous population assessment conducted in 1995, smallmouth bass abundance has increased significantly.  Walleye abundance has also increased in Saint Anthony Falls Pool.  Small schools of young-of-the-year walleye were shocked, but most fish were too small to be captured.  Special sampling is needed to better quantify walleye abundance in Saint Anthony Falls Pool. <br> \n</p>",
