Only white sucker, green sunfish, and yellow perch were collected in survey gill nets, and only green sunfish and yellow perch were taken in 1/4-in-mesh wire minnow traps.  Because of the connection with Little Saganaga Lake, it seems likely that Ecstasy Lake supoorts a small number of northern pike, even though none were taken in 1998.</p>",
