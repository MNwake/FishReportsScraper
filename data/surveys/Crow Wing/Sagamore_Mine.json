Other species were present in average abundance for the lake class. Brook trout were caught at a rate of 8.25/gillnet.  Size ranged from 6.0-9.9 inches (median=8.08) 4 were not aged but most likely were all from the spring 1992 stocking of yearlings.  Average size was only 0.19 lb.  Northern pike (2.0/gillnet) had low abundance but ages 2-8 were present.  Each year class was represented by one or two individuals.  Average size was 6.24 lbs, large for the lake class.  Largemouth bass (0.75/trapnet) were caught in average numbers.  Size (0.37 lb.) was also average for the lake class.  Only ages 1 and 4 were sampled.  Bluegills (108.75/trapnet) were abundant.  Ages 1-6 were sampled.  Growth was somewhat variable, but was slow for most age classes.  The 1988 and 1987 year classes were strongest, comprising about 52% and 27% of the sample.  Average size (0.08 lb.) was small, and only about 2% of measured bluegills were at least 7.0 long.  Pumpkinseed (4.5/trapnet) were taken in average numbers and averaged 0.13 lb., equal to the first quartile value.  Green sunfish (0.25/trapnet) were present in low numbers.  Yellow perch abundance (17.75/gillnet) was high.  Ages 3-8 and 10 were sampled, with ages 3 (42%) and 5 (24%) being most abundant.  Growth bordered on, or was slow, through age 6 and was good for ages 7-8.  Average size was 0.19 lb.  White suckers (0.25/gillnet) had low abundance.  Yellow bullhead abundance (1.25/trapnet) was average, but average size (0.44 lb.) was small for the lake class.</p>",

Rainbow Trout are stocked annual as yearlings (2,000/year) into Sagamore.  Temperature and oxygen conditions suitable for trout occurred from a depth of about 15' down to around 60' in July 2023.  Rainbow Trout provide for a popular fishery, especially early in the season.  Rainbow Trout were sampled at 2.0/gill net, with an average length of 13.0\". <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout were first stocked in 2019, with 635 yearlings being stocked biennially.  One 11.7\" Lake Trout was sampled in this survey.  The management goal is to have a self-sustaining Lake Trout population by 2031.  Sagamore has a special regulation for Lake Trout: All less than 20\" must be released with a possession limit of one. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in low numbers at 1.1/gill net.  Average length was 24.5\", with 50% in the protected 22-26\" slot.  Northern Pike measuring at least 26\" in length made up 25% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) were first stocked into Sagamore in 2019 as adults.  They were introduced to provide forage for the Lake Trout population.  The gill net catch of 0.3/net was below average for similar lakes.  All Tullibee (Cisco) sampled were adults from past stocking efforts, with an average length of 15.8\". <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Sagamore, but they are in the area.   Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers, as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sagamore Mine Pit Lake is a former open pit iron mine located east of Riverton, between Crosby and Brainerd, that has filled with water.  Sagamore is a Designated stream trout lake.  Designated stream trout lakes have additional angling regulations.  Be sure to consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations book for regulations, seasons, and possession limits before fishing trout streams or lakes.  Some of the additional regulations include:  A trout stamp is required of anglers ages 16-64 to possess trout and is required while fishing in a Designated lake or stream.  Fishing for any species in a Designated Trout Water when trout season is closed is prohibited.  Fishing for stream trout is allowed from one hour before sunrise until 11pm.  Using or possessing live minnows is prohibited.  Live leeches and worms are legal to use.  Sagamore Lake and all other Designated stream trout lakes in Crow Wing and Cass counties are closed to winter fishing.   <br> \n <br> \nSagamore Lake is deep with a maximum depth of 210 ft.  The water is very clear with visibility to a depth of around 30 ft.  Most of the shoreline has steep slopes to deep water.  Aquatic vegetation is common in the narrow band of shallow water close to shore.  A boat ramp is located on the southeast shore of the lake.  Sagamore is stocked with about 2,000 yearling rainbow trout each spring.  The best trout fishing opportunities are probably during the first month after the trout season opens in May.   <br> \n <br> \nAn assessment of the fish community in Sagamore Mine Pit Lake was conducted in late-June and early-July 2008.  Twelve rainbow trout were caught in the seven gill net sets.  The rainbow trout were about 12 to 13 inches long and were all from the May 2008 stocking.  The northern pike were generally large with most of the pike from 20 to 37 inches long.  Bluegills and other sunfish were common in the trap nets that were set in shallow water near shore.  Most bluegills were around 5 to 7 inches long with the longest about 8 inches long.  Other species that could provide some angling opportunity include largemouth bass, yellow perch, and yellow bullhead.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sagamore mine pit is a 314 acre designated stream trout lake, located just east ofthe town of Riverton.  A county access is maintained on the SE corner of the lake.  Brook trout have been stocked every year since 1991.  The original trout stocking was in 1984.  The lake is the result of iron ore mining.  No development exists, except structure relics of the mining era.  Maximum depth is 210 feet.Brook trout were sampled in moderate numbers in the gill nets.  They ranged from 9.2 to 12.1 inches.  The average size was 10.7 inches.  All trout observed in the nets was from a stocking done in May of 2002.  Speculation is that northern pike predation on brook trout is significant, causing very few fish to last thru the summer.Northern pike abundance of 3.1/gill net is average for this lake type.  Seven age classes were present and growth rate was good.  They ranged in size from 13.0 to 30.2 inches.  The average size was 23.6 inches.  Bluegill abundance is very high at 113/trap net.  The problem is their size is very small, with the average length being 5.2 inches.  Growth rate is slow due to over abundance of bluegills, with the already limited food supply available, that is characteristic of many mine pits.Yellow perch were in good abundance and should help maintain a quality northern pike fishery.                               The future of the trout program is uncertain, due to the presence of a moderate population of northern pike and their history of predation on trout populations in waters where both are present.</p>",
