THE INDICES FOR BOWFIN AND YELLOW BULLHEAD ARE ABOVE THE REGIONAL AND AREA THIRD QUARTILE. THE INDEX FOR BLACK BULLHEAD IS BELOW BOTH THE REGIONAL AND AREA FIRST QUARTILE NORTHERN PIKE RANGED FROM TWO TO SEVEN YEARS OF AGE. AGE TWO AND AGE FOUR WERE THE MOST COMMON AGES SAMPLED.  GROWTH FOR THE FIRST INCREMENT IS EIGHTEEN PERCENT SLOWER THAN NORMAL AND THE SECOND INCREMENT IS TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT SLOWER THAN NORMAL. GROWTH FOR THE THIRD, FOURTH AND FIFTH INCREMENTS IS NORMAL. PUMPKINSEED RANGED FROM THREE TO SEVEN YEARS OF AGE. AGES FIVE AND SIX FISH DOMINATED THE SAMPLE AGED. GROWTH FOR THE FIRST, FIFTH, SIXTH AND SEVENTH INCREMENTS WAS NORMAL. GROWTH FOR THE SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH INCREMENTS RANGED FROM EIGHTEEN TO FORTY THREE PERCENT SLOWER THAN NORMAL. BLUEGILL RANGED FROM TWO TO EIGHT YEARS OF AGE. THE SAMPLE AGED WAS DOMINATED BY AGE THREE AGE FIVE AND AGE SEVEN. REPRODUCTION FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A BOOM OR BUST SITUATION. WHETHER THIS IS BEING CAUSED BY SUPP- RESSION OF A YEAR CLASS BY THE STRONG YEAR CLASS PPECEDING IT OR BY SOME OTHER PHENOMENON IS UN- KNOWN AT THIS TIME. THE GROWTH RATE FOR THE SECOND THROUGH THE FIFTH INCREMENTS RANGE FROM TWENTY PERCENT TO FORTY ONE PERCENT SLOWER THAN NORMAL. LARGEMOUTH BASS RANGED FROM THREE TO EIGHT YEARS OF AGE. WITH THIS SMALL SAMPLE THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF YEAR CLASSES CAN NOT BE DETERMINED. GROWTH FOR THE FIRST AND SECOND INCREMENTS ARE THIRTY AND SIXTEEN PERCENT SLOWER THAN NORMAL RESPECTIVELY. GROWTH FROM THE THIRD THROUGH EIGHTH INCREMENTS EXHIBIT IS NORMAL. BLACK CRAPPIE RANGED FROM TWO TO FIVE YEARS OF AGE. FORTY TWO PERCENT OF THE SAMPLE WERE AGE THREE, TWENTY NINE PERCENT AGE FOUR AND TWENTY THREE PERCENT AGE FIVE. THE AGE TWO FISH WERE EITHER JUST GETTING LARGE ENOUGH TO BE CAPTURED IN THE SAMPLING GEAR OR WERE A WEAK YEAR CLASS. THE GROWTH RATES FOR THE BLACK CRAPPIE ALSO SHOWED THE SAME PATTERN AS DID THE OTHER CENTRAR- CHIDS. GROWTH THE FIRST YEAR WAS NORMAL. THE SE- COND AND THIRD INCREMENTS RANGED FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY NINE PERCENT SLOWER THAN NORMAL, THEN NORMAL GROWTH RESUMED. THE ABUNDANCE OF NORTHERN PIKE DECREASED SIGNIFI- CANTLY FROM 15.33 IN 1975 TO 3.3 IN 1986. THE AVG\\ 19.8 INCREASED FROM 18.2 INCHES IN 1975 TO 19.8 INCHES IN 1986. EXCEPT FOR ONE LARGE INDIVIDUAL IN 1986 THE RANGE OF LENGTH FREQUENCIES DID NOT CHANGE FROM 75 TO0 86.THE INCREASE IN AVG SIZE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NORTHERN PIKE LESS THAN TWENTY INCHES IN LENGTH SEEN IN 1986. EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE NORTHERN PIKE CAUGHT IN 1975 WERE LESS THAN TWENTY INCHES IN LENGTH. IN 1986 NORTHERN PIKE LESS THAN TWENTY INCHES IN LENGTH MADE UP FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF THE CATCH. THE PUMPKINSEED AND BLUEGILL POPULATION HAVE BOTH TAKE SHARP DECLINES IN ABUNDANCE FROM 1975 TO 1986. PUMPKINSEEDS DECREASED FROM 9.25 TO 3.83 PER  TRAPNET, A DECREASE OF SIXTY THREE PERCENT. THE MEAN LENGTH OF PUMPKINSEED IN 1975 WAS 3.0 TO 7.4 INCHES WITH TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF THE SAMPLE BETWEEN 6.0 AND 6.4 INCHES. IN 1986 THE RANGE OF LENGTH FREQUENCIES WAS 4.0 TO 7.4 INCHES WITH THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE SAMPLE BETWEEN 6.0 AND 6.4 INCHES. THE BLUEGILL TRAPNET INDEX DECREASED FROM 40.0 TO 22.3 A DECREASED OF FORTY FOUR PERCENT. THE MEAN LENGTH OF A BLUEGILL INCREASED FROM 5.6 INCHES TO 6.1 INCHES. IN 1975  THE LENGTH FREQUENCIES RANGED FROM 3.5 TO 8.4 INCHES WITH THREE PEAKS. IN 1986 THE LENGTH FREQUENCIES RANGED FROM 3.0 TO 7.9 INCHES WITH FORTY NINE PER- CENT OF THE FISH SAMPLED FROM 6.0 TO 6.9 INCHES. THE INDEX OF ABUNDANCE OF BLACK CRAPPIE INCREASED FROM 1.0 PER TRAPNET IN 1975 TO 3.9 PER TRAPNET IN 1986. THE RANGE OF LENGTH FREQUENCIES IN 1975 WAS FROM 5.0 TO 9.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH RANGE OF 6.0 TO 6.4 INCHES. IN 1986 THE RANGE OF LENGTH FREQUENCIES WAS FROM 4.0 TO 9.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH RANGE OF 7.0 TO 7.4  INCHES. THE MEAN LENGTH INCREASED FROM 6.9 TO 7.3 INCHES.

Growth rates for the third, sixth and seventh annual increments were slower than normal.  Bluegill (51 of 110 aged) ranged from three to nine years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1984, 1985 and 1986.  Growth rates for the second and third annual increments were slower than normal.  Black crappie (49 of 82 aged) ranged from two to eight years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1986. Growth rates for the second and third annual increments were slower than normal.  Northern pike gill net catch increased from the 1986 assessment to the 1991 assessment (Wilcoxon's signed rank test, p= 0.0935, n=6).

                "narrative": "<p>A special assessment targeting near shore fish species was conducted on June 28, 2016. The near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish IBI for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but eight sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing. A 50-foot seine was not used, a 15-foot seine was used at 3 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 7 sites. Nearshore sampling captured several fish species, none of which were intolerant. <br> \n <br> \nHansen lake falls within lake class 32 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 4 lakes for evaluating IBI data. IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 38 (CI 30-46) and the potential exceptional quality level is set at 59. The IBI score, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2016 standard assessment, calculated from this survey was 41.4 and above the impairment threshold. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Hanson Lake is located in the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but 3 stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 4 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 1 station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 5 stations. Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including 2 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blackchin Shiner and Iowa Darter) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in June 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Hanson Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hansen Lake is located adjacent to state highway 47, four miles east of Aitkin, Minnesota. The lake has two basins that have similar aquatic plants, substrates and fish species. Cattails and sedges grow on most of the lake's shoreline, white waterlily and water shield also can be found near most of the shoreline. Canada waterweed, large-leaf pondweed and flat-stem pondweed grow in a majority of the shallow water regions of the lake. Muck covers most of the near-shore lake bottom. Loons regularly nest and raise young on the lake and shoreline development has been minimal. The fishery continues to be predominately anglers seeking black crappie, bluegill, northern pike and largemouth bass. Although none of these populations of fish exhibit above-average size structure, Hansen Lake does have a nice fishery for both northern pike and largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance in Hansen Lake has remained above average for its lake class for many years. Growth rates were somewhat slower than the state-wide averages, but were comparable to the average rates for the county. Average size was approximately 7.inches, and 10 inches was the largest. Anglers can expect to see adequate catch rates of smaller crappies and more over 10 inches should be available within a couple years as two stronger year classes continue to grow. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catches were somewhat below average at 13.1/net when compared to the long term average of 25.7/net, but were still within the normal range for this lake class. Growth rates were slower than the state-wide averages, but were normal compared to the county averages. Average size was 6.2 inches, and 8.5 inches was the largest. If bluegill densities remain lower, we may see an improvement in growth rates.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill net catch rates were similar to the previous survey at 5.7/net, which is typical for this type of lake.  The size structure was favorable with 26% of pike being longer than 24 inches and with individuals up to 28 inches present in 2016.  Larger pike offer benefits to the aquatic community as well as in the fishery and the best way to maximize these benefits of this quality pike fishery is for anglers to recycle these fish. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass catch rates were average for the lake class. The mean length of largemouth bass was 14 inches with individuals observed up to 18.4 inches in the electrofishing assessment. Largemouth bass reproduction is sporadic in the lake, yet yields an average abundance of bass that can reach memorable size. Continued catch and release by anglers is encouraged and will help to maintain and improve fish populations that are desirable by anglers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hansen Lake is located adjacent to state highway 47 within four miles of Aitkin, Minnesota. The lake has two basins that have similar aquatic plants, substrates and fish species. Cattails and sedges grow on most of the lake's shoreline, white waterlily and watershield also can be found near most of the shoreline. Canada waterweed, largeleaf pondweed and flatstem pondweed grow in a majority of the shallow water regions of the lake. Muck covers most of the near-shore lake bottom. Loons regularly nest and raise young on the lake and shoreline development has been minimal. The fishery continues to be predominately anglers seeking northern pike, black crappies, bluegills and largemouth bass. Although none of these populations of fish exhibit above-average size structure, Hanson Lake does have a nice fishery for both northern pike and largemouth bass. While neither species is over abundant, one-fourth of the northern pike are greater than 25 inches in length and four largemouth bass between 14 and 18 inches in length were sampled in this survey. Bluegills averaged just under 6 inches and reached lengths of 8.8 inches in this survey. Consistent bluegill production will tend to maintain the present fishing success. Black crappies are small, slow growing and abundant. The mean length from surveyed fish was slightly over 7 inches and the largest crappie was 9.9 inches long. Anglers can expect to see adequate catch rates of smaller crappies. Largemouth bass tend to be underrepresented in DNR fisheries surveys. Largemouth bass reproduction is sporadic in the lake, which yields a lower abundance of bass, which can reach memorable size. Continued catch and release by anglers is encouraged and will help to maintain and improve fish populations that are desirable by anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hansen Lake is conveniently located adjacent to a state highway within four miles of Aitkin, Minnesota.  The lake has two basins which have similar aquatic plants, substrates and fish species. Cattails and sedges grow on most of the lake's shoreline, white waterlily and watershield grow near most of the lake's shoreline and canada waterweed, largeleaf pondweed and flatstem pondweed grow in much of the shallow water regions of the lake. Muck covers most of the near-shore lake bottom. Loons regularly nest and raise young on the lake and shoreline development has been minimal.The fish community in Hansen Lake has changed little since the previous survey in 1991. The fishery continues to be dominated by anglers seeking northern pike, black crappies, bluegills and largemouth bass.  Although none of the populations of these fishes exhibits above-average size structure, the lake does provide adequate fishing for anglers.Abundance and size structure of northern pike were very similar in 1991 and 1996. Northerns grow slowly from age 4 thorough age 9, as reflected by the small mean length of 18.5 inches for northerns caught in this survey.  Continued catch and release efforts by anglers should help to maintain the few fish that reach larger sizes in the lake.Bluegills averaged a respectable 6.4 inches and reached lengths of 8.4 inches in this survey. Growth is slow, particularly for younger fish, due both to relatively high numbers of bluegills and low lake fertility. Slow growth restricts maximum size, yet fishing is good for medium-sized fish. Consistent production of new bluegills will tend to maintain the present fishing success.Black crappies are small, slow-growing and relatively abundant. The mean length from surveyed fish was only 7.9 inches and the largest crappie was only 9.4 inches long. Anglers can expect a continued adequate catch rate of smaller crappies. Largemouth bass tend to be underrepresented in fisheries surveys. Largemouth bass production is sporadic in the lake, which yields lower catches of bass that can reach memorable size. </p>",
