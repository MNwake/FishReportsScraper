                "narrative": "<p>Dry Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 4, which consists of 47 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, deep, bowl-shaped, and have clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Dry Lake was thermally stratified on 6/6/2005 with a surface temperature of 66 F and a bottom temperature of 41 F.  Good oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) was retained to a depth of 22 ft, where the temperature was 45 F.  Surface temperatures in midsummer are warmer and 5 ppm oxygen is retained to a depth of about 20 ft, where the temperature is in the mid 50's F.The inlet to Dry Lake is from High Lake.  There is an old rock crib filter barrier, built to limit fish movement, at the outlet of High Lake.  Brook trout were observed spawning in the inlet from High Lake in the mid 1980's.  The outlet, to Bass Lake, has a waterfall that prevents upstream fish movement from Bass Lake.  There is also a filter barrier in the outlet to Bass Lake to limit fish movement out of Dry Lake.  Dry Lake is connected to adjacent Little Dry Lake by a channel four feet deep, through which fish can move.  Recent trout stocking in Dry Lake consisted of brown trout yearlings in 1989, 1990, 1992, and every third year beginning in 1994.  Splake were stocked in 1993 and two of every three years beginning in 1995.This trout population assessment was done early in the summer while surface temperatures were still cool, and like thirteen previous trout assessments done on Dry Lake since 1973, consisted of low numbers of gillnets.  The trout catch in 2005 consisted of four brown trout and three splake.  The brown trout consisted of three 13-14\" fish that had probably been stocked as yearlings in 2003, and one 18\" fish that may have been stocked as a yearling in 2000.  If true, this represents fairly slow growth for brown trout.  Two of the splake were 16\" and one was 26.5\".  The larger splake was alive and was not weighed before it was released.  The stomachs of three brown trout and two splake that were examined were empty.The trout catch by weight of 7.7 lb/gillnet in 2005 was higher than the median trout catch of 1.6 lb/gillnet in all trout assessments on this lake and was higher than the median catch of 3.9 lb/gillnet in recent assessments of 25 stream trout lakes (excluding mine pit lakes) in the Tower Fisheries Management Area. Also captured in the 2005 assessment were high numbers of white sucker (16.0/gillnet) and cisco (13.5/gillnet).  The sucker averaged 10\" and the largest was 17\", while the cisco averaged 12\" and the largest was 13\".</p>",

Like most Tower area designated trout lakes, Dry is deep and clear with excellent coldwater habitat.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo portages and a winter trail connect to Dry Lake. A short portage connects Dry to Bass Lake, a 1/4 mile portage enters from High Lake, and the winter trail bypasses Dry Falls farther East down to Bass Lake. Bass Lake is accessible by portaging a motorboat from Low Lake, but Dry is more suitable for canoe travel. The USFS maintains a campsite on the northeast shore. The Dry Lake hiking trail loops around Little Dry and the north shore of Dry. There are no improved sites for shorefishing, but the lake is quite accessible from the trail in several areas. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 survey consisted of two standardized gillnet sets. Ten brown Trout and ten splake were captured for a combined catch of 10 trout/net. Bluegill, cisco, and white sucker were also sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nBrown trout abundance (5/net) was the highest on record for Dry Lake. Lengths ranged from 13 to nearly 23 inches. Fish from three years appeared to be present. Splake abundance (5/net) was tied for the highest on record. Lengths ranged from 9 to over 20 inches. Fish from three years appeared to be present as well, with larger fish dominating the catch. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dry Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 4, which consists of 47 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, deep, bowl-shaped, and have very clear and soft water. Dry Lake has softer (less mineralized) water than most of the lakes in this lake class.  Dry Lake stratifies thermally in midsummer and has good oxygen (more than 5 ppm) to a depth of about 20 ft, at which depth the water temperature is about 53 F.  Under-ice oxygen in the winter has been very good.Dry Lake has an inlet from High Lake up which trout may migrate despite the presence of an old rock and crib filter barrier.  Brook trout spawning has been observed in this stream.  The outlet, to Bass Lake, has a waterfall which prevents upstream fish movement, and a filter barrier to limit downstream fish movement.  Dry Lake is connected to adjacent Little Dry Lake by a channel several feet deep, through which fish can easily move.  Recently, Dry Lake was stocked with brown trout in 1989, 1990, 1992, and every third year beginning in 1994.  Splake were stocked in 1993, and two of every three years beginning in 1995.This special assessment, like many of the previous assessments, consisted of low numbers of gillnets set in early spring.  Trapnets were not set due to the difficult portage access to this lake. The purpose of the assessment was to evaluate stream trout populations without undue mortality, and to examine populations of other fish species.The standard gillnets caught one 17\" brown trout and two splake (10\" and 14\").  The trout stomachs contained minnows, midges, and crayfish.  White sucker numbers (4.0/gillnet) and cisco numbers (8.0/gillnet) were much lower than the long term average for this lake.  No bluegill were caught, although they are fairly abundant in this lake.  The total catch of trout (all species combined) in 2001 of 1.8 lb/gillnet was similar to the long term average trout catch in this lake of 2.1 lb/gillnet, but was much lower than the median catch of 5.0 lb/gillnet in recent assessments of 25 stream trout lakes (excluding mine pit lakes) in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.   </p>",

This remote lake is stocked by float plane with yearling brown trout every three years and splake fingerlings the two years in between. Access is by portage from Bass Lake or High Lake. Anglers can also hike a loop north off the Bass Lake Trail system to fish from shore. Dry Lake is scenic with high pine covered ridges and large ledgerock outcrops on the west shore. <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling during the 2013 population assessment was completed using 2 gill nets. Splake (5.0/gill net) and brown trout (2.5/gill net) were sampled. Splake lengths ranged from 8.0 inches to 27.6 inches which is the largest splake sampled since their introduction. Brown trout lengths ranged from 11.5 inches to 19.5 inches. Crayfish and small bluegill were identified in the stomach samples of trout. <br> \n <br> \nCisco (5.5/gill net) averaged 13.7 inches long and white sucker (2.5/gill net) averaged 11.2 inches long. Numerous small bluegill were oberved near the outlet and several other locations near shore. No other fish species were sampled or observed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dry Lake is an 82 acre designated stream trout lake located four miles north of Ely.  There are two ways to access the lake.  The most common access is a short portage from Bass Lake to the east corner of Dry, or a 1/4 mile portage from High Lake which comes in on the middle of the north side of Dry Lake.  There are three inlets, the most substantial coming from High Lake.  The lone outlet cascades over a fairly substantial falls (Bass Lake Falls) down to Bass Lake.  The surrounding landscape of Dry is largely rolling forest land with a maximum depth of 44 feet and clear water.   <br> \n <br> \nDry Lake is connected through a fairly substantial water connection on its south shore to Little Dry Lake.  Little Dry was surveyed as a separate lake at the same time Dry was.  Information on the Little Dry survey can be found in its lake file.   <br> \n <br> \nTypical mid-summer dissolved oxygen levels are generally adequate to moderate depths for trout.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline were dominated by boulder and rubble with some areas of sand and gravel.  The lake is completely undeveloped and is surrounded by US Forest Service land.  One Forest Service maintained campsite exists on the small point on the northeast shore.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 1966 a reclamation project was done on Dry Lake however it appeared cisco and white suckers were not completely removed.  Brook trout were stocked soon after and were the only species added until 1980 when splake were stocked for the first time.  Since 1989, Dry Lake was stocked on a generally rotating schedule of splake and brown trout.   <br> \n <br> \nThe gillnet catch of all trout by weight for this assessment was 5.6 pounds/net which was above average when compared to previous surveys and compared to other trout lakes in the area.  Note that trout abundance is expressed in terms of pounds/net rather than number/net to reduce the influence of occasional high catches of just-stocked fingerlings.  Of the 14 trout sampled, six fish (43%) were greater than 15 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTwelve brown trout were sampled in this survey for a catch rate of 4.8 pounds/gill net.  Lengths ranged from 10 to 21 inches with an average of nearly 15 inches.  Sizes were similar to brown trout caught in past surveys.  Comparing sizes to stocked year classes, it's likely the three largest browns were seven years old and the remaining fish were one or three years old.   <br> \n <br> \nTwo splake were sampled in this survey for a catch rate of 0.8 pounds/net.  Lengths were 16 and 17 inches.  These fish were similar to the average sizes of splake from past surveys and were likely products of the 2013 or 2014 stocked year classes. <br> \n <br> \nSeventeen cisco were caught in gill nets for a catch rate of 4.3 fish/net.  This was the second lowest catch rate on record for the lake with this species continuing to show a declining population trend.  Sizes were 13 to 15 inches with an average of 14.5 inches.  The average size in 2019 was the largest on record for Dry Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe white sucker catch was 11.3 fish/net which was average for the lake.  Sizes were slightly smaller than fish sampled in past surveys.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dry Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 4, which consists of 47 lakes in northeastern Minnesota that are small, deep, bowl-shaped, and have very clear and soft water.  Dry Lake is smaller, shallower, and has softer water than average for this lake class.  The water column in Dry Lake stratifies thermally in midsummer and has less than 5 ppm oxygen below about 20 ft, at which depth the temperature is about 53 F.  Trout need cold water with at least 5 ppm oxygen.  Under-ice oxygen in the winter is very good.  Dry lake has an inlet from High Lake through which trout may migrate despite the presence of an old rock and crib filter barrier.  Brook trout spawning has been observed in this stream.  The outlet, to Bass Lake, has a waterfall which prevents upstream fish movement, and a filter barrier to limit downstream fish movement.  Dry Lake is connected to adjacent Little Dry Lake by a channel several feet deep, through which fish can easily move.  Dry Lake was stocked with brown trout in 1989, 1990, 1992, and 1994, and with splake in 1993, 1995, and 1996.  This assessment consisted of one standard gillnet and one special monofilament gillnet.  The standard gillnet captured only one brown trout, two cisco, and six white sucker.  Numbers of all these species was lower than normal.  The total catch of trout in the standard net of 0.9 lb was lower than the long term average catch in Dry Lake of 2.1 lb/net and much lower than the average of 10.6 lb/net for 24 stream trout lakes (excluding mine pit lakes) in the Ely Fisheries Management Area.The monofilament gillnet captured many more fish than the standard gillnet.  Six brown trout were caught, averaging 14.6 in (1.1 lb), and ranging from 13.7 in to 16.5 in.  These brown trout were probably survivors of yearlings stocked in the spring of 1994 at the average size of 9 in (0.3 lb) and had grown to their size at capture in 25 months, which is not especially good growth.Nine splake were caught in the monofilament gillnet, in two size groups.  Two splake, 6.3 in and 7.0 in, were survivors of fingerlings stocked the previous fall at the average size of 5 in.  Seven splake, averaging 15.4 in (1.2 lb) and ranging from 14.1 in to 16.6 in were survivors of fingerlings stocked in the fall of 1993 at the average size of 5 in and had grown to their size at capture in 31 months, which is also not very good growth.The total catch by weight of trout (both species) in the monofilament net was 15.5 lb, much higher than in the standard net.  Both species of trout were in good condition and had flying ants, water boatmen, and Hexagenia nymphs in their stomachs.  Splake stomachs also contained crayfish and chironomids.Also caught in the monofilament gillnet were 38 white sucker and 21 cisco, showing they were more abundant than indicated by the standard gillnet in this assessment, and may have been similar to the high populations of these species observed in previous assessments.  Only one bluegill was captured, but others were observed in the shallows, especially in the horsetail near the outlet.  </p>",
