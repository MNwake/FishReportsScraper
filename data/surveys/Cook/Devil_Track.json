                "narrative": "<p>Walleye abundance in Devil Track Lake in 2006 appeared to have been about average for this lake, compared to catches seen since 1970.  Walleye average size, while low compared to similar lakes, was actually similar to (if not slightly higher than) average sizes seen in this lake in the last 30 years.  Walleye growth rates were very slow, probably due to a lack of yellow perch, and perhaps due to competition for invertebrate forage from smallmouth bass and white sucker.  All the walleye taken in 2006 had been produced naturally, with strong year classes in 2001 and 2002.     <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in 2006 appeared to have been about average for this type of lake, and for this lake historically.  Some larger fish were present, but there were some missing year classes, and northern pike growth rates had been slow.  Smallmouth bass catches in all sampling gears used in 2006 were relatively low; however, the average size of smallmouth bass collected in 2006 was similar to sizes observed in the past in this lake.  Smallmouth bass are recent arrivals in this lake, and have been through their period of rapid expansion.  It is likely that their numbers have begun to stabilize at a level that can be supported by the forage base in the lake.  Yellow perch abundance was low in 2006, and few of the perch taken would have been large enough to interest anglers.  Low yellow perch abundance, coupled with competition for invertebrate forage from lake whitefish, smallmouth bass, and white sucker, probably accounts for the slow walleye growth typically seen in this lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2009 walleye catch was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1990, and walleye abundance appeared to have been average for a lake of this type.  Walleye collected in 2009 were smaller than usually seen in this lake, due to the presence of large numbers of small (7-9 inch) two-year-old fish.  Most, if not all, of the walleye collected in 2009 had been produced naturally.  Fingerling stocking done in 2006 did not produce a strong year class, but the results of this assessment, and special assessments using quarter-inch trap nets in 2008 and 2009 suggest that strong natural year classes may have been produced in 2007, 2008, and 2009.  Walleye growth had been slow, probably because yellow perch abundance was low.  Five-year-old walleye reached an average length of just 13.6 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to an average of 16.9 inches for similar lakes in Cook County. <br> \n <br> \nDevil Track Lake continued to support a high-quality smallmouth bass population.  The number and size of smallmouth bass collected in 2009 were above average for a lake of this type.  Smallmouth bass growth had been fast, compared to other lakes in this area, with fish reaching an average length of 12.8 inches by the end of their fifth year.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were present in average numbers, but fish collected in 2009 were larger than usually seen in this lake.  Northern pike growth had been relatively fast.  With cool-water habitat and small lake whitefish forage available, this lake has the potential to produce some large fish. <br> \n <br> \nDevil Track Lake was reopened to sport netting for lake whitefish in 2008, and some high catches have been reported.  Despite this harvest, the 2009 assessment lake whitefish catch was the highest ever seen in this lake.  From the length frequency distribution it appeared that at least three year classes contributed to that catch.  Lake whitefish in Devil Track Lake also support a popular summer fishery, with flyfishers taking fish on the surface during mayfly hatches. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This was the first of three standard surveys scheduled in the 2014 lake management plan to determine whether long range goals for walleye and northern pike had been met, and to determine the contribution of stocking to the walleye population.  The long range goal for walleye in this lake, in place since 1991, is a minimum gill net catch of 5.0 fish/set.  It was last met in 2006.  The goal for northern pike is a minimum gill net catch of 0.7 fish/set, with some fish over 30 inches present.  It was first established in 1997, and has rarely been fully met since. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015 walleye numbers were low for this lake, and most of the fish present were small.  Although some walleye had been produced naturally, only one moderately strong natural year class was sampled (2012).   Stocked 2011 and 2013 year classes together accounted for 48 of the 70 walleye taken in this survey (69% of the total catch).   Walleye growth had been quite slow; fish reached a mean length of just 9.8 inches by the end of their fourth year, compared to an area average of 14.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers also appeared to have been low in 2015, and no fish over 30 inches were taken.  No northern pike older than four years were seen.  Growth rates had been a little slower than average; four-year-old fish reached a mean length of 22.6 inches by the end of their fourth year.  At that rate, fish would have to survive for at least six years to reach a length of 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass appeared to have been abundant and large in Devil Track Lake in 2015.  The gill net catch and the mean weight for smallmouth bass taken in gill nets were similar to values observed in most surveys of this lake done since 1996.  Smallmouth bass abundance in this lake surged after the late 1980s.  Since that time the lake has maintained fairly high smallmouth bass numbers, and a fairly high-quality population.  in 2015 over two-thirds of the smallmouth bass collected were over 12 inches in length - a fairly high number for a lake in this area. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch have been an important part of the forage base for walleye and northern pike in this lake; however, the 2015 yellow perch gill net catch was the lowest seen since 1952 (when none were taken).  Although no yellow perch were aged, their lengths suggested at least three year classes (all weak) contributed to the 2015 catch. <br> \n <br> \nLake whitefish in Devil Track Lake support fall sport-netting and summer fly-fishing fisheries, and provide some high-quality coldwater forage for northern pike.  Although the 2015 gill net catch fell below the normal range for a lake of this type, it was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1987.  The mean weight for whitefish taken in gill nets was high, both for a lake of this type, and for this lake historically. <br> \n <br> \nNo fish species new to Devil Track Lake were collected in the 2015 survey.  The lake does not support any panfish, other than a few green sunfish.  Devil Track Lake is infested with spiny waterflea. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n    </p>",

The 1992 year class was weak, but strong year classes had been produced in 1993, 1994, and 1995.  Walleye growth was slow, and because of the slow growth, and the strength of the 1993-1995 year classes, most of the walleye collected were small.Smallmouth bass were abundant, and many fish over 12 in were present.  Northern pike were fairly abundant; although most were under 20 inches, there were some large fish present.  Forage for walleye and northern pike was provided by yellow perch, some of which were large enough to interest anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye catch in 2003 was within the normal range for lakes of this class, but it was the lowest catch observed in this lake since 1982.  The average size of the walleye collected was about normal for this lake, but was below the normal range for lakes of this class.  Small size is partly due to a lack of older fish in the catch.  Slow growth was also a factor, despite the presence of fair numbers of yellow perch.  Devil Track Lake has had a reputation for producing mainly small walleye, and that continued to be the case in 2003.  Walleye reproductive success appeared to have been good in recent years.The smallmouth bass catch per gill net in 2003 was the highest ever recorded for this lake.  Smallmouth bass abundance has been building in this lake since the late 1980s.  The lake supported a good smallmouth bass population, with many year classes present.The 2003 northern pike catch was low for this lake historically, but it was within the normal range for lakes of this class.  Northern pike growth rates appeared to have been about average.  Although the lake still has the potential for producing some very large northern pike, most of the fish collected in 2003 were under 24 inches in length.The lake whitefish population in the lake continues to be variable, perhaps because of recent summer kills.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This survey was conducted to evaluate walleye natural reproduction in 2023. Since 1972, 0.25-inch-mesh trap nets (TQU) have been used to determine whether the production of young-of-year (YOY) walleye is sufficient to sustain the walleye population in Devil Track Lake or if stocking is needed. If two consecutive surveys show less than 2.2 YOY walleye per trap net set it becomes on the list for potential stocking of fall walleye fingerlings.   <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey showed below average catch rates of YOY walleye in 2023. When coupled with last years below average results this lake became eligible for walleye stocking. However, walleye fingerling production issues and changes in stocking protocols led to no stocking events in 2023. Future walleye fingerling stocking in Devil Track Lake is under review to better support the current walleye fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 catch of YOY yellow perch was very low for Devil Track Lake and lower than other similar lakes. Catches of YOY yellow perch have been lower in this lake since the smallmouth bass population began a rapid expansion in the late 1980s. With lower production of YOY yellow perch now common, and with a lack of minnows, walleye could be more reliant on an invertebrate forage base. YOY smallmouth bass are sometimes captured in this gear but are not a good indicator of recruitment as many could be too small to be captured in July.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye catch in 1999 was within the normal range for lakes of this class, and it was similar to catches observed in this lake since 1980.  The average size of the walleye collected was one of the lowest seen in this lake, mainly due to a lack of older fish in the catch.  Slow growth was also a factor, despite the presence of fair numbers of yellow perch.  Devil Track Lake has had a reputation for producing mainly small walleye, and that continued to be the case in 1999.  Walleye reproductive success appeared to have been good in recent years.The smallmouth bass catch in 1999 was lower that the catch observed in the last assessment, and showed the first indication that smallmouth bass abundance may have peaked, following their expansion through the 1990's.  Smallmouth bass growth rates may also have slowed, as might be expected after the initial expansion period.  The lake still supported a good smallmouth bass population, with most of the fish collected in gill nets in 1999 exceeding 12 inches in length.The 1999 northern pike catch was low for this lake historically, and it appeared that reproductive success may have been poor in recent years.  Northern pike growth rates also appeared to have been slow.  Although the lake still has the potential for producing some very large northern pike, most of the fish collected in 1999 were under 24 inches in length.The lake whitefish population in the lake continues to recover, despite some recent summer kills.  Several year classes were found in the 1999 catch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Devil Track Lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, and is one of the most heavily developed, heavily used, and heavily fished lakes in Cook County.  The long range goal for walleye is to maintain a population with a minimum gill net catch of 5.0 fish/set.  The goal for northern pike is to maintain a self-sustained population with a minimum gill net catch of 0.7 fish/set, with some fish over 30 inches in length present.  This was the third of three assessments scheduled in the 2005 lake management plan to evaluate walleye stocking and monitor attainment of long range goals for the lake.  The current plan will be reviewed and revised in March 2014. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2012, Clean Water Legacy funding allowed areas across the state to do some nearshore fish community sampling to improve our ability to use a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) to identify disturbed aquatic ecosystems.  Scoring criteria for IBIs in northeastern Minnesota lakes have not yet been developed.  Devil Track Lake was selected for nearshore sampling because its accessibility allowed for use of the sampling gears required, it was a relatively large lake, and it was heavily developed. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were fairly abundant, but small, in Devil Track Lake in 2012.  The 2012 walleye gill net catch was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1993, and fell within the normal range for the lake class.  The mean weight for walleye taken in gill nets was well below the normal range, and was one of the lower values seen in this lake historically.  Several year classes contributed to the 2012 catch.  Fingerling stocking may have contributed to a strong 2011 year class, and a weaker 2006 year class.  Fairly strong natural year classes had been produced in 2010, 2008, and 2007.  Walleye growth had been slow.  Four-year-old fish reached an average length of just 10.8 inches at the end of their fourth year, compared to an area mean of 14.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were abundant in 2012, although their average size was down from past years.  The gill net catch exceeded the normal range for this type of lake, and was the highest seen in this lake since 1999.  On the other hand, the mean weight for northern pike taken in gill nets declined compared to 2006 and 2009, and was one of the lower values observed in this lake to date.  Most of the fish taken were less than four years of age.  Growth had been somewhat slower than average among those younger fish.  Three-year-old northern pike reached a mean length of 18.4 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an average of 20.2 inches in similar lakes in this area. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough no special effort has been made to manage smallmouth bass in this lake, it continues to support a high quality bass population.  Bass were abundant and large in 2012.  The gill net catch, and the mean weight for smallmouth bass taken in gill nets, were the highest seen to date in this lake, and both exceeded normal ranges for the lake class.  Several older year classes contributed strongly to the population, with fish as old as 13 years taken, while continued reproductive success was demonstrated by the presence of a strong 2010 year class.   Growth of young bass had been relatively fast; three-year-old fish reached a mean length of 8.3 inches at the end of their third year, compared to a mean of 7.0 inches in similar area lakes.  Growth slowed for older fish. <br> \n <br> \nDevil Track Lake has been open to fall netting for lake whitefish for several years.  The lake whitefish gill net catch was below the normal range for the lake class, but was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1990.  Although the catch had dropped since 2009, similar declines have occurred in the past and have been temporary.  The trend in this lake since the early 1980s has been towards increasing assessment catches, and to date we have no evidence suggesting fall gill net harvests have been excessive. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill net catch was within the normal range for the lake class, and similar to catches seen in this lake since 1986.  Yellow perch are the primary forage for walleye in this lake, but they also provide some angling opportunity.  Thirty-seven percent of the yellow perch taken in gill nets in this assessment were 8 inches or more in length, an acceptable size for many anglers.  As has usually been the case since the smallmouth bass population in this lake exploded (in the early 1990s), production of young-of-the-year yellow perch was relatively low in 2012.  The catch in quarter-inch-mesh trap nets (27.1 fish/set) was one of the lower catches seen in this lake historically. <br> \n <br> \nSampling of the nearshore fish community was done using quarter-in-mesh trap nets, a 15-ft beach seine, and backpack electrofishing gear.  Prior to sampling done in 2012, Devil Track Lake was known to support yellow perch, white sucker, walleye, smallmouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish, lake whitefish, slimy sculpin, and common shiner.  Nearshore sampling in 2012 added only central mudminnow to that list.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Devil Track lake lies in the Lake Superior North watershed, and is currently managed for walleye and northern pike.  This was the second of three standard surveys scheduled in the 2014 lake management plan to determine whether long range goals for walleye and northern pike had been met, and to determine the contribution of stocking to the walleye population.  The first of these surveys was completed in 2015; the last is scheduled for 2023.  The long range goal for walleye in this lake, in place since 1991, is a minimum gill net catch of 5.0 fish/set.  It was last met in 2006.  The goal for northern pike is a minimum gill net catch of 0.7 fish/set, with some fish over 30 inches present.  It was first established in 1997, and has rarely been fully met.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were present in fair numbers in 2019, although most were small.  The 2019 gill net catch, although higher than the catch seen in 2015, still fell short of the goal for this lake.  Ten year classes, including several that had been produced naturally, contributed to the 2019 catch.  Stocked year classes (2013, 2011, and 2006) together accounted for 24% of walleye taken in gill nets and trap nets; however, it was likely that some fish from those years classes had been produced naturally.  It appeared that moderately strong natural year classes produced in 2015 and 2016 together accounted for 50% of the catch, with several other years contributed a few fish each.  Walleye growth had been quite slow; on average, fish reached a length of 10.7 inches at the end of their fourth year, compared to an area mean of 14.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSurveys using 0.25-in-mesh trap nets have been done annually in this lake to assess the need for walleye fingerling stocking; such a survey was completed on 22 July 2019.  Natural production of young-of-year (YOY) walleye appeared to have been below average (for this lake) in 2019.  The current (2014) lake management plan states that a fall fingerling stocking should be done whenever YOY walleye catches fall below the threshold for two consecutive years.  The low catch seen in 2019, combined with a low catch seen in 2018, triggered fingerling stocking in this lake in the fall of 2019.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers appeared to have been low in 2019, and the fish that were seen were small.  Long range catch and size goals for northern pike were not met in 2019.  The gill net catch was the lowest ever seen in this lake, and no fish over 30 inches were taken.  No northern pike older than four years were collected, and growth rates for young fish had been somewhat slower than average.  With the growth seen in 2019, fish would have to survive to seven or eight years of age to reach a length of 30 inches in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers, and their average size, remained high in 2019.  Ten year classes contributed to the 2019 smallmouth bass catch, including fish as old as twelve years.  No year class or classes stood out as exceptionally strong or weak.  Smallmouth bass growth rates had been close to average for this area; fish reached a mean length of 10.0 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to an area mean of 10.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch have been an important part of the forage base for walleye and northern pike in this lake; however, the 2015 yellow perch gill net catch was the lowest seen since 1952 (when none were taken), and the 2019 catch was lower still.  Although no yellow perch were aged, their length frequency distribution suggested at least three year classes (all weak) contributed to the 2019 catch. <br> \n <br> \nLake whitefish in Devil Track Lake support fall sport-netting and summer fly-fishing fisheries, and provide some high-quality coldwater forage for northern pike.  Although the 2019 gill net catch fell below the normal range for the lake class, it was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1987.  The mean weight for whitefish taken in gill nets in 2019 was the lowest seen to date in this lake; however, that mean was based on a sample size of just six fish. <br> \n <br> \nDevil Track Lake is infested with spiny waterflea.  Anglers and other users should be diligent about cleaning and thoroughly drying any gear used in this lake before they move to another. <br> \n</p>",
