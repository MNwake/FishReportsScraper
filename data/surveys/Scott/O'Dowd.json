                "narrative": "<p>O'Dowd Lake is a 300-acre lake with a maximum depth typically measured at under 25 feet, located south of Shakopee, in northern Scott County. O'Dowd is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike, but includes catchable populations of Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. Walleye numbers are maintained through a plan of annual fall fingerling stocking. A standard survey (trap nets and gill nets) was conducted on O'Dowd Lake during the week of 7/31/2017. During the survey, water clarity was 4.5 feet, with low oxygen below 10 feet. Eurasian Watermilfoil also remains present in O'Dowd. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were captured at a high rate (5.0/net) compared to similar lakes throughout the metro. Walleye averaged 14.4 inches, with the largest measured at 28.2 inches. Walleye grow fast in O'Dowd Lake, reaching 15.7 inches by age-3. Annual Walleye stocking combined with moderate Northern Pike numbers allow stocked fish to thrive, providing both ice and open water angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers in O'Dowd Lake were moderate, with 5.0/net. Average size of Northern Pike in gill nets was 25.3 inches, with the largest measured at 33.6 inches. Growth was fast compared to similar lakes across the state. The Northern Pike population in O'Dowd Lake is healthy, with many year classes of fish. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in O'Dowd Lake, although were not sampled with boat electrofishing during the 2017 survey. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught 14 Largemouth Bass, with an average length of 14.2 inches and the largest measured at 19.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers have been on a decline during the previous 25 years, reaching the lowest value sampled--26/net-- during this (2017) survey. Bluegill averaged 5.5 inches, with the largest measured at 7.4 inches. Approximately 9% of sampled fish were greater than 7.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets (6.3/net) and trap nets (6.7/net) -- near the expected catch rate of similar lakes. Black Crappie averaged 7.2 inches, with the largest measured at 10.8 inches. Approximately 12% of sampled fish were greater than 9.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>O'Dowd is a 300-acre (235 littoral acres) lake with a maximum depth of 22 feet. O'Dowd is located in the City of Shakopee, in northern Scott County. O'Dowd is actively managed for Walleye and Northern Pike, with secondary emphasis on Largemouth Bass. O'Dowd also supports catchable populations of Bluegill and Black Crappie. Walleye numbers are maintained through annual fall fingerling stocking of 1 pound per littoral acre (235 pounds). Public water access is provided by DNR Parks and Trails on the northwest side of the lake off county road 79 (up to 13 vehicle/trailer parking spaces). <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was completed on O'Dowd Lake during the week of 8/1/2022 to monitor water characteristics and fish populations. Water color was brown/green, with low water clarity, measured at 3.0 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen fell to zero parts per million (ppm) below 16 feet. Eurasian Watermilfoil has also been found in O'Dowd, and remains present. One interesting note, O'Dowd is one of a few lakes in the metro where Common Carp have never been sampled. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Walleye were sampled with gill nets (8/net), above the expected catch rate of similar lakes in the metro. Average length of Walleye sampled in gill nets was 16.5 inches with the largest measured at 25.4 inches. Annual stocking has maintained a balanced Walleye population (an intermediate between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish). Walleye growth in Lake O'Dowd was fast compared to similar lakes across the metro, indicated by an average length of 15.2 inches by age 3. Results from the 2022 O'Dowd Lake survey show Walleye meeting or exceeding the long-range management goals for both numbers and sizes providing excellent angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets (8/net), above the expected catch rate of similar lakes. There were 48 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets during the 2022 survey, the highest catch in the previous 25 years. Average size of Northern Pike in the 2022 survey was 22.9 inches with the largest measured at 36.8 inches. Northern Pike size indices describes a balanced population with consistent recruitment. Growth was average compared to similar lakes across the metro, with an average length of 18.0 inches by age 3. Results from the 2022 O'Dowd Lake survey show Northern Pike meeting or exceeding the long-range management goals for both numbers and sizes providing excellent angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during spring 2022 with nighttime boat electrofishing, the second time such a survey was completed here. Catch rates were high, with 54.5 fish/hour. A total of 109 bass were sampled, with an average length of 10.7 inches and the largest measured at 17.5 inches. The majority of bass sampled were small, with 33% greater than 12 inches and 3% greater than 15 inches. High numbers of bass may be causing increased competition among individuals, decreasing growth and size potential. Despite high numbers, the presence of fish greater than 15 inches shows the potential for these fish to reach desirable sizes. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (22.4/net). Bluegill catch rates in O'Dowd have been on a decline over the previous 25 years, reaching their lowest point - 22.4/net - during this (2022) survey. There were 202 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2022 survey, with an average length of 5.9 inches, and the largest measured at 8.2 inches. Following the reduction of Bluegill numbers, we would expect to see an increase in growth and overall size in future surveys. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (10.0/net) and trap nets (7.0/net). The Black Crappie population remains stable, with little variation in historic catch rates over the previous 25 years. There were 123 Black Crappie sampled during the 2022 survey, with an average length of 6.8 inches, and the largest measured at 10.7 inches. Despite a small average size, the presence of fish greater than 10 inches is an encouraging sign for the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

Water quality is considered poor in this shallow lake with water clarity measured at only 1.8 feet during the summer of 2001.  O'Dowd Lake supports a variety of large predator species including walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  Average size for walleye was 20.0 inches in length and 2.7 pounds.  The largest walleye sampled was 24.6 inches long and weighed 3.1 pounds.  Walleye fingerlings continue to be stocked on an annual basis in the lake.  Largemouth bass reach a quality size in this lake.  Mean largemouth bass weight was 3.1 pounds and average length was 16.8 inches.  Northern pike average length was calculated to be a respectable 23.4 inches while average weight was found to be 3.0 pounds.  Forty percent of all northern pike sampled were over 25 inches in length and the largest northern pike sampled was 28.4 inches.  Although predator species tend to be above average in size, they are not present in high abundance, with the exception of northern pike.  As a result, angler catch rates may be low for anglers interested in targeting these species.Bluegill sunfish are the most dominant panfish species in the lake.  Although bluegill are present in large numbers, average size (5.5 inches and 0.11 pounds) was found to be very small.  Less than 1% of the bluegill sampled were over 7.0 inches in length.  Black crappie population also exhibited high abundance in O'Dowd Lake.   Average crappie size was relatively small at 6.8 inches.  Ninety eight percent of the BLC sampled fell within the 6.0-8.0 length range and 45% were over 7.0 inches in length.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were also sampled in the lake with low abundance and weight for this lake class.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish averaged 5.4 and 4.6 inches in length, respectively.  Low growth rates coupled with low abundance and small size for the panfish community on O'Dowd Lake indicate poor fishing conditions for bluegill and only fair fishing conditions for black crappie in the coming years.Few yellow perch were captured during the survey.  Black bullhead are prevalent in the lake but their numbers and size continue to decline in the seasonal sample.  White suckers were also sampled with low abundance but with above average size (2.6 pounds).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>O'Dowd is a highly productive Class 42 lake located just south of Shakopee.  It is 300 acres, with a maximum depth of 22 feet.  The lake's shoreline is complex, with numerous islands scattered throughout the lake, and bottom substrates varying between muck and large rocks.  A good portion of the lake shore is developed with single-family homes and there is an 18-hole golf course on the north shore. Because of a combination of a fertile watershed, shallow depth, and development, Lake O'Dowd is a very nutrient-rich lake; a winter aeration system has been operated since the mid-1980s to help sustain fish populations.  (In winter 2010-11, a partial winterkill was noted in spite of an operating aerator.) <br> \n <br> \nDespite issues associated with a shallow, eutrophic lake, O'Dowd remains an important fishery and recreational resource in the local area.  It is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked annually.  In 2013, a population assessment was conducted, consisting of spring trap netting and night-time electrofishing, followed by summer gill netting.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are abundant in Lake O'Dowd, and of quality size.  The catch rate in 2013, 8.2 fish per gill net, was slightly higher than the previous survey (2007; catch of 7.8 fish per gill net). Prior to 2007, catch rates of walleye had been noticeably lower, ranging from 1.3 fish per net in 1996, to 4.3 fish per net in 1991. The average size of Walleye in 2013 was 16.8 inches and 2 pounds.  Thirty-six percent of fish were longer than 16 inches, and 28% were longer than 20 inches.  Ages two through nine were represented in the sample, with the majority of fish age 2. Walleye growth appears fast in O'Dowd, relative to statewide average.  Fish reach 16 inches by age 3.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile Northern Pike are only moderately abundant, they are of good size.  The catch rate in 2013, 3.5 fish per gill net was lower than the previous survey value (5/3 fish per gill net in 2007).  Historically, Northern Pike abundance has been high, but has been gradually decreasing since it peaked at 8.8 fish per net in 1996. Average size of Northern Pike has increased since the previous survey, from 3.0 pounds in 2007 to 3.6 pounds in 2013. Average length of Northern Pike in 2013 was 24.6 inches, with fish as large as 37 inches sampled.  Ninety percent of the sampled fish were longer than 21 inches, and 24% of the sample was longer than 28 inches. Ages two through six appeared consistently in the sample, with one age eight. Northern Pike growth appears fast relative to statewide averages of length at age.  Fish reach 24 inches by age 4.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were abundant in the night-time electrofishing sample (102.3 per hour on-time), relative to other lakes in the West Metro area; however, few large fish were sampled. Thirty-two percent of the sample was longer than 12 inches, and 5% were longer than 16 inches. The largest Bass sampled was 19.9 inches.  The average weight of Largemouth Bass was 0.8 pounds.  Fish ages 2 through 10 were present in the sample.  The fish reached 12 inches by age 4, and 20 inches by age 10.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough only moderately abundant, Black Crappie sampled in the spring trap nets were of quality size.  The catch rate of 4.1 per trap net falls below the median for this type of lake, and the fish average 8.7 inches and 0.4 pounds.  Forty-seven percent of the fish caught were longer than 8 inches, and 39% were longer than 10 inches.  The largest Black Crappie measured 12.0 inches.  Ages two through seven were represented in the trap net sample.  Black Crappie grow fast in Lake O'Dowd, reaching 10 inches by age four.   <br> \n <br> \nLake O'Dowd has historically had a highly abundant population of small-sized Bluegill.  While this continues to be the case from this survey's results, abundance-average size balance appears to be more favorable.  Trap net catch rates have decreased from 85 fish per trap net in 2007 to 35 fish per trap net in 2013 (still high for this type of lake).  Size has also improved, from an average length of 5.1 inches in 2007 to an average length of 6.1 inches in 2013.  Sixty-six percent of the Bluegill sampled in 2013 were larger than 6 inches, and only two percent were larger than 8 inches.  Not surprisingly, these fish are slower growing relative to statewide averages of length at age.  Lake O'Dowd Bluegill attain a length of 6 inches by age 5.   <br> \n</p>",

BOTH BLB AND BRBS ARE PRESENT ABOVE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS FOR BOTH TYPES OF GEAR.  BLCS WERE SAMPLED WELL ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL AND TRAP NETS, HOWEVER THE CONDITION FACTOR FOR THESE FISH WAS QUITE POOR INDICATING INADEQUATE FORAGE FOR THE NUMBERS PRESENT (6.5-7.0 8.1 FISH PER LB.)  BLGS ARE ALSO ABUNDANT AND WERE SAMPLED ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR BOTH TYPES OF GEAR.  PSD FOR TRAP NETS WAS 29.4% (COMBINED GEAR= 26.5%).  PMK AND HSF WERE ALSO SAMPLED ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS.  NOP WERE SAMPLED ABOVE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS.  TRAP NET SAMPLING WAS AT MEDIAN LEVELS FOR NUMBER, BUT WELL ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR SIZE.  SAMPLED NOP INDICATE AN OLDER POPULATION OF ABOVE AVERAGE SIZE FISH (RSD=87.5%).  WAE ALSO EXHIBITED AN OLDER POPULATION OF ABOVE AVERAGE SIZE FISH (RSD=85.7%), BUT RELATIVELY FEW IN NUMBER.  NO FIS UNDER AGE IV WERE SAMPLED, THUS INDICATING THAT FRY STOCKINGS ARE NOT SUCCESSFULLY RECRUITING WAE INTO THE POPULATION.  WAE FINGERLINGS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR FUTURE STOCKINGS.  THREE CCF FROM THE 1987 YEARLING STOCKING WERE SAMPLED AND ALL WERE RELEASED ALIVE.  THEY APPEARED UNIFORM IN SIZE AND AVERAGED 4.0 POUNDS EACH WHILE EXHIBITING GOOD OVERALL CONDITION.  LOCAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT A LMB FISHERY EXISTS THAT IS BETTER THAN WHAT WAS REPRESENTED BY OUR NET SAMPLES.  SEINING DID YIELD SEVERAL YOY LMB THUS INDICATING THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS PRESENT.  ELECTROFISHING IS WARRANTED TO FURTHER ASSESS THE BASS POPULATION PRESENT.  WTS, GOS, AND YEP WERE ALSO SAMPLED BUT, AT BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS IN NUMBER.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>O\u0019Dowd is a highly productive, 300-acre lake located just south of Shakopee.  A good portion of the lake is developed with single-family homes and there is an 18-hole golf course on the north shore.  O\u0019Dowd lake has historically had water quality issues due to nutrients discharged from adjacent agricultural property and an abundance of non-native aquatic vegetation.  Despite poor water quality, O\u0019Dowd is an important fishery in the immediate area and is primarily managed for walleye and secondarily for bluegill and largemouth bass.   <br> \n <br> \nIn the 2007 population assessment, walleye catch in gill nets was at an all-time high.  Forty-nine walleye were sampled at a rate of 7.83 per gill net.  Walleye averaged 18.2 inches and 2.2 pounds with the largest fish measuring 26.9 inches and weighing 7.7 pounds. Average length and weight appear to be down from 2001 but still remain moderately high.  Approximately 98% of walleye were 15 inches or longer and 18% were 20 inches or longer.  Walleye ages ranged from 1 to 13 with most (78%) coming from the stocked 2004 year class.  Walleye growth was similar to other lakes in the West Metro Area.  Lake O\u0019Dowd will continue to be stocked yearly with walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nIn the 2001 assessment, northern pike were the most abundant predator in the lake; however, it seems northern pike abundance has declined.  In 2007, northern pike were sampled at a rate of 5.3 per gill net and 0.2 per trap net, compared to 7.5 per gill net and 0.4 per trap net in 2001.  Current pike abundance is still considered moderately high compared to other similar lakes in the state.  Average length and weight of northern pike was 23.6 inches and 3.0 pounds with the largest measuring 33.8 inches and 7.5 pounds.  Approximately 79% were 21 inches or longer and 6 % were 28 inches or longer.  Northern pike from the 2000 through 2004 year class were present in the sample and growth was average until age 4 then it slowed for older fish. <br> \n <br> \nAs has historically been the case in Lake O\u0019Dowd, bluegill abundance is very high and the size structure is poor.  Average length and weight are 5.1 inches (range = 2.8 - 8.0 inches) and 0.10 pounds (range = 0.01 - 0.4 pounds).  Only one fish reaching 8 inches was sampled and only 31% were greater than 6 inches.  Except for age-1 fish, growth was poor for all age classes (ages 2 - 8).     <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie in Lake O\u0019Dowd are moderately abundant with net catches near the median for lakes in the state.  Average length was 7.7 inches (range = 4.5 - 9.6 inches) and average weight was 0.2 pounds (range = 0.04 - 0.5 pounds).  Approximately 44% of the black crappie were 8 inches or larger but only 3% were 9 inches or larger.  The 2002 and 2005 year classes appeared to be the strongest and ages ranged from 1 to 6.  Growth of black crappie was slower than average for all age classes relative to other lakes in the West Metro Area.   <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gear, such as trap nets and gill nets, is not an effective method for collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  However, 15 largemouth bass were collected during the assessment.  Average length and weight were 12.8 inches and 1.3 pounds and the largest bass collected was 18.8 inches and 4.4 pounds.  Approximately 60% of the largemouth bass sampled were 12 inches or longer and 27 % were 15 inches or longer.  <br> \n <br> \nOther panfish collected in low abundance during the assessment included yellow perch, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed.  Average length and weight of yellow perch were 6.3 inches (range = 5.8 - 7.2 inches) and 0.1 pounds (range = 0.07 - 0.14 pounds).  Hybrid sunfish averaged 6.0 inches in length and pumpkinseed averaged 5.0 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nThe abundance of black bullhead is moderately high compared to other similar lakes in the state.  White suckers were sampled in low numbers and golden shiners were more abundant than in previous assessments and should provide a suitable prey for the predators in the lake. <br> \n</p>",

Bluegill have shown a steady increase in abundance since 1991 and presently average 5.4 inches in length. Approximately 40% of bluegill collected in the 1996 survey were 6.0\" or longer, and only 2.4% were found to exceed 7.0 inches. Black crappie, while down in abundance since 1991, have shown little improvement in size. Average length observed for crappies was only 7.0 inches. Growth rate for both species was found to be below average.Northern pike abundance has shown a steady increase since 1991 and over 25% of the netted sample was over 25 inches in length. The largest northern pike captured was 34.6 inches. Walleye abundance remains relatively steady with some quality fish present. The largest walleye handled was 28.2 inches and 9.0 pounds, however, the average was 18.5 inches and 2.9 pounds. Largemouth bass appear to be present in good numbers with some quality fish present. Growth rates for all three main predator species were found to be average or better. No yellow perch were captured during this survey and black bullhead abundance continues to decline in the seasonal sample.</p>",
