                "narrative": "<p>Big Twin Lake covers 457 acres and has a shoreline length of 6 miles.  The surrounding shoreline is dominated by undeveloped woodland areas, and the majority of the surrounding watershed is cultivated.  The lake lacks a true inlet and outlet.  Shoalwater areas are dominated by sand and gravel areas.  According the a 1992 survey, aquatic vegetation is considered common.  Big Twin Lake is managed primarily for walleye while providing secondary populations of channel catfish and black crappie.  Walleye numbers are considered normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 14 ? to more than 24 inches with an average length of approximately 18 inches.  The population appears to be dominated by walleye in the 17 to 19 inch range.  Walleye natural reproduction appears limited in Big Twin Lake.  Consequently, the walleye population is supported mainly through stocking efforts.  Walleye fry were stocked in 1993, 1995 and 1996.Channel catfish fingerlings were stocked in 1994 to establish a fishery in Big Twin Lake.  The introduction was intended to provide an additional predator species which may contribute to bullhead population control.  Channel catfish were not observed during the 1996 survey.  Future assessments are necessary to fully evaluate channel catfish stocking efforts.  Black crappie and yellow perch numbers remain low.  Crappie sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 4.4 to 15.3 inches.  Only one yellow perch was sampled in trapnets during the 1996 survey.  This fish was 10.8 inches in length.  Black crappie and yellow perch populations appear to be self-supporting.  Historically, Big Twin Lake supported extremely high populations of black bullhead.  1996 was no exception as black bullhead numbers remain high.  Black bullhead collected in trapnets ranged in length from 6 to more than 12 inches with an average length of approximately 11 inches. Current management objectives are geared to reduce the overpopulation of black bullhead and promote gamefish populations.  In theory, good numbers of predatory fish species (walleye, channel catfish) may reduce the black bullhead population to more normal levels in time by preying on small black bullhead.  To improve the predator population, walleye fry are stocked two of every three years and channel catfish will most likely be stocked in the future.   Other species observed during the 1996 survey include northern pike, bluegill, largemouth bass, carp, and white sucker. To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Big Twin Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A nearshore index of biotic integrity (IBI) survey was completed on 1 July 2016 on Big Twin Lake with backpack electrofishing and seining at 10 stations.  Fish collected in the backpack electrofishing and seining were Black Crappie, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Golden Shiner, Spottail Shiner, and Yellow Perch.  Natural reproduction of Largemouth Bass and Yellow Perch was verified with presence of young-of-the-year (YOY) individuals in the sample.  Additionally, the Largemouth Bass (n=20, 2 YOY) and the Yellow Perch (n=473, 424 YOY) were the most abundant in the IBI sampling.  A previous IBI survey was conducted in 2012 with a score of 15.6 which is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life indicating a lake that is degraded.  The 2016 score has not yet been calculated, but results are similar to the 2012 survey.  Potential exists to improve the score and health of Big Twin Lake; however, cost to implement action may not be feasible given the amount of private land in the watershed.  A partnered approach including the Martin County Soil and Water Conservation District and local agriculture authorities could be sought to work toward development of better drainage practices and land conservation in the watershed.  Big Twin is a good Walleye, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch fishery and it could improve significantly with slight improvements to the watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Twin is a 457-acre lake located near the city of Trimont in Martin County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 18.0 feet.  The total watershed area for Big Twin Lake is small when compared to other lakes in the Windom Area.  The watershed-to-lake ratio for Big Twin is 2.5-to-1.  In most years, Big Twin has little or no run-out due to its position at the top of the watershed.  Big Twin is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black crappie.   Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year at a rate of 2 pounds per acre since 2017.  A survey was conducted the week of June 29, 2020 using 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets to monitor fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 Walleye catch rate was 3.0 per gill net, which is the lowest recorded catch rate at Big Twin Lake.  The low Walleye catch rate is likely the result of the high catch of Channel Catfish in gill nets (29.3 per gill net), which twist and tangle nets, thereby reducing the catchability of other species in the gill net.  The 2020 catch rate of 3.0 per gill net was still within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 12.0 to 27.1 inches and averaged 19.4 inches.  The average length at age-3 was 17.3 inches, indicating that Walleye growth is fast in Big Twin Lake.  Six year classes of Walleye were sampled, including Walleye from 2006, 2009, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019, all stocked years except for 2006.  Prior to 2017, Walleye fingerlings were stocked annually at a rate of 1 pound per littoral acre.  Beginning in 2017, Walleye were stocked every other year at a rate of 2 lbs. per littoral acre.  The change was made so that natural reproduction could be assessed in non-stocked years because Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) Walleye have been stocked since 2016.  LMS Walleye have shown the ability to naturally reproduce in southern Minnesota lakes.  Big Twin had a fairly strong year class of age-0 Walleye documented in 2020 which is encouraging for the population.  Despite the low catch rate observed in the survey, Big Twin has a robust Walleye population, as evidenced by its popularity among Walleye anglers and their success.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate decreased from 95.6 per trap net in 2016 to 1.0 per trap net in 2020, which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 7.6 to 11.0 inches and averaged 9.9 inches. While Black Crappie abundance may have decreased following a summer kill in 2016, the low catch rate may be a function of Black Crappie not being inshore or moving during the survey, as anglers have reported success when targeting crappie at Big Twin Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Yellow Perch have maintained a low abundance in Big Twin Lake with catch rates less than 10.0 per gill net since the late 1980's, except in 2016 when the catch rate was 182.3 per gill net.  In 2020, the Yellow Perch catch rate was 8.7 per gill net, a large decrease from the 2016 catch rate, but similar to historical catch rates.  The 2020 catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 5.8 to 10.6 inches and averaged 9.1 inches.      <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish catch rates have steadily increased since the early 2000's, going from 3.7 to 29.3 per gill net.  The 2020 catch rate of 29.3 per gill net was the highest recorded catch rate at Big Twin Lake.  Channel Catfish lengths ranged from 14.2 to 25.2 inches and averaged 19.1 inches.  The abundant Channel Catfish population could compete for prey resources with other gamefish populations, potentially negatively affecting other top level predators such as Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bluegill, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, White Sucker, Black Bullhead, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Twin Lake is located in Martin County, has a surface area of 457 acres, a maximum depth of 18 feet, and nearly 6 miles of shoreline.  The lake has a reputation of producing quality walleye fishing; however, the high density, low size structure black bullhead population has been a problem.  In recent years, a number of largemouth bass have been angled and the black crappie fishing has picked up.  Big Twin Lake is currently managed for walleye, with secondary efforts given to black crappie and channel catfish.  Channel catfish introduction and management has been added to provide a fishery and help reduce bullhead numbers.Walleye gill net catch rates were 4 fish/net, falling well short of the management plan goal of 15 fish/net, but within typical values of similar lakes in the state.  Walleye abundance in Big Twin Lake peaked at 29 fish/net in 1992, but subsequently declined to 6.67 fish/net in 1996.  The decline in walleye gill net catches may be misrepresented due to mid-summer use of near-shore habitats by walleye in 2000.  The walleye trap net catch rate was 5.63 fish/net, greatly exceeding most lakes in class 43.  The trap net catches indicated an increase in walleye numbers since 1996.  Even in 1992, when walleye gill net catches were at their highest, walleye trap net catches were only 1.25 fish/net.  Therefore, walleye abundance has likely been stable since 1996; however, the management goal of 15.0 fish/net has not been achieved.Walleye size structure was good during the 2000 survey and the mean weight for gill net captured walleye was 2.37 lbs./fish.  The walleye length range was 10 to 27 inches with a high proportion of those fish exceeding 20 inches and fair numbers surpassing 25 inches total length.  In 1996, walleye size structure was also good, but with fewer large fish.  Populations with high proportions of large fish are typically characterized by low-density and good growth, but are often frustrating to anglers.  The 2000 relative abundance could be considered moderate; however, growth rates have slowed substantially since the 1996 survey.  In 1996, the mean walleye length at age 3 was 17.4 inches, whereas in 2000, age-3 walleye were only 11.5 inches.  Currently, walleye are not attaining17-inches total length until reaching age 5.  Likewise, walleye body condition or plumpness dropped substantially between 1996 and 2000.  During the survey, staff recalled a vast difference in the condition between large and small walleyes.  Upon further investigation, walleye <19 inches were thin and in poor condition, whereas those >19 inches were plump and in good condition.  This trend suggests that walleye forage and environmental conditions are less favorable for smaller walleyes.Age-frequency distributions indicate that poor survival may have occurred for walleye fry stocked in 1998 and fingerlings stocked in 1999.  An electrofishing assessment completed in the fall of 2000 also indicated extremely low density of walleye <10 inches.  Only 1 walleye < age 3 was captured during the 2000 survey, including the seining assessment.  The single age-2 specimen was only 8.46 inches long.  Age-2 walleye captured in the 1996 survey exceeded 14 inches.  This single 2000 specimen stands out in staff comments about the Big Twin survey, as it was grossly underweight.  Walleye recruitment from fry stocking in 1992, 1993, 1995, and 1996, complimented by natural reproduction in 1991 and 1994, have resulted in a relatively stable age structure; however, recruitment, growth and mortality problems, many of which could be related to the high-density black bullhead population, have been predominant since 1998.The black bullhead gill net catch rate was 262.8 fish/net, greatly exceeding most lakes in class 43.  The black bullhead catches represent a substantial jump from 1996, but the value is comparable with observations in 1983, 1988, and 1992.  In 1996, the gill net CPUE was 37.7 fish/net; however, the trap net catches of 275.9 fish/net was more than double the trap net catches observed in 2000.  The greatest difference between the 1996 and 2000 bullhead populations was the decline in size structure.  In 1996, the black bullhead population included a large proportion of individuals exceeding 11 inches; however, only a few exceeded 10 inches in the 2000 survey. Body condition of black bullhead was poor in both 1996 and 2000.The black crappie catch rate from the trap net samples was 9.13 fish/net and was similar to abundances noted in other lake class 43 waters.  The relative abundance of black crappie has improved since 1996.  The 1996 trap net catch rate was 0.44 fish/net, a value that had held nearly steady in all surveys since 1983.  Several stockings of black crappie fingerlings have been completed by the Trimont Area Sportsmen's Club, which may have contributed to the improvement in crappie catches.  The black crappie size structure is typical of a young and improving population, with a few individuals now starting to surpass 8 inches.  A black crappie age and growth assessment revealed that crappies up to age 4 were present and growth was moderate.  Age-2 crappies attained lengths of 6-7 inches and surpassed the 9.5 inch mark during their fourth year of life.  In addition, crappies of all sizes were in good condition and some natural reproduction was documented.  The black crappie management goal has been met.Channel catfish are also managed in the lake as a secondary sportfish and predator.  Fingerling catfish were stocked in 1994 and 1998; however, none of these fish have been captured.  Staff have suggested that channel catfish absence from the samples is not uncommon during the first several years, as young catfish are rarely sampled in southwestern Minnesota lakes, even when stable recruitment has been verified.  The fingerling catfish stocked in 1994 continued to be absent from the 2000 survey gears - raising questions about the success of catfish fingerling stocking.The common carp gill net catch rate was 10.2 fish/net and the trap net catch rate was 2.63 fish/net.  Both of these catch rates are typical for lakes in class 43.  The common carp population was dominated by fish in the 16- to 21-inch range and no carp <16 inches were captured.  Carp were absent from Big Twin Lake surveys until 1996, when a substantive 14/gill net and 3/trap net were documented.  Relative abundance has slightly declined since 1996, but condition has remained good.Although largemouth bass have not been substantially managed in Big Twin Lake, the trap net catch rate was 0.75 fish/net, which exceeds most lakes in lake class 43.  Bass do not typically sample well with trap nets, therefore it is possible that relative abundance is quite good; however, water levels were lower than normal and a majority of the bass habitat was unavailable.  Therefore, the trap nets may have served as good structure, attracted bass, and artificially inflated catch rates.  Largemouth bass have not been sampled in any other gill net or trap net gear in Big Twin Lake.  Spring electrofishing assessments have revealed the presence of a reproducing largemouth bass population and 2 age-0 largemouth bass were captured in the 2000 natural reproduction seining assessment.  Considering the density of black bullheads in this lake, bass nesting success, similarly to crappies and perch, is likely poor.  Therefore, advanced bass (ages 1-3) could be stocked to help bolster this population.Other fishes captured in the 2000 survey included emerald shiners, fathead minnows, yellow perch, sunfish (bluegill and hybrids), golden shiners, and white suckers.  White sucker recruitment has been poor and the population appears to be dominated by adults.  All white suckers captured in 2000 exceeded 14 inches.  Although yellow perch are desired by local anglers, Big Twin Lake has not produced good perch densities since the 1983 survey.  Given the current improvement in the black crappie population, panfish management should continue to be geared toward crappies, with yellow perch subject to natural fluctuation.  Northern pike have been present in all surveys since 1983; however, none were observed in the 2000 assessment.Several indicators continue to support the likelihood of detrimental effects caused by the high-density low size-structure black bullhead population.  Benthic-feeding fishes, such as walleyes <17 inches, channel catfish fingerlings, yellow perch, and young white suckers, have not done well.  Survival of these fishes has been questionable and for those that do survive (i.e., small walleyes), food resources were likely scarce, causing substantial declines in condition and growth rates.  The average black bullhead total length in Big Twin Lake was approximately 5.5 inches.  Gape-limited feeding theory suggests that this bullhead resource would not be available to walleyes and channel catfish until these predators reach total lengths of at least 17 inches.  Therefore, heavy predator stockings of fry and juvenile fish may be futile and stocking adults could be more beneficial.  However, regulations and public involvement protecting these stocks would be required.The management plan goal to provide a secondary population of black crappie within the interquartile range has been realized; however, we have yet to achieve prescribed goals on gill net catches for walleye and channel catfish.  Walleye size structure was good; however, in this situation, the size and age structures may indicate poor survival and recruitment of smaller walleyes.  The poor condition of small walleyes has reduced growth and is hindering recruitment to the catchable population.  Given the success of largemouth bass in Big Twin Lake and the continued need for a greater predator density, largemouth bass stocking of advanced juveniles or adults should be encouraged.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Twin is a 457-acre lake located near the city of Trimont in Martin County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 18.0 feet and is a class 43 lake.  Big Twin is managed for walleye primarily while black crappie and channel catfish are managed secondarily.  The Section of Fisheries recently acquired the island on the lake and it is now an Aquatic Management Area (AMA) and can be used by the public for hunting purposes.    <br> \n <br> \nBig Twin has a good walleye population.  Several successful walleye fishing stories were reported to the Windom Area Fisheries Office during the winter of 2008-09.  Lengths of walleye caught in gill nets ranged from 9 to 22 inches with an average length of about 14 inches.  Five different ages of walleye were identified during the survey.  Strong year classes in 2006 and 2007 were probably the result of stocking.  The oldest fish we aged was eleven years old. <br> \n <br> \nBig Twin also has a good black crappie population.  It was reported that several \"slab\" black crappie were taken during the winter of 2008-09.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 3.5 to 11.4 inches and averaged just under 9 inches.  The lake has not been stocked with black crappie since 1992 meaning the population does a good job of reproducing.    <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish numbers are on the rise in Big Twin.  They were stocked in 1994, 1998, and 2001 in an attempt to control the high numbers of black bullhead.  Since being stocked, black bullhead catch rates have decreased from a high of 276 per trap net in 1996 to less than 1 per trap net in 2008.  Lengths of channel catfish caught in our trap nets ranged from 9 to 18 inches with an average length of just over 14 inches.  Lengths of black bullhead averaged around 7.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the assessment included northern pike, white crappie, largemouth bass, common carp, and orangespotted sunfish.    <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Big Twin Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nBig Twin is a 457-acre lake located near the city of Trimont in Martin County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 18.0 feet and belongs to lake class type 43.  The land surrounding Big Twin Lake that provides runoff to the lake is quite small when compared to other lakes in the Windom Area.  In fact the watershed-to-lake ratio for Big Twin is only 2.5 acres of upland area to 1 acre of surface water and indicates that the watershed is very small.  In fact Big Twin, for most years, has little or no run-out due to the fact that the location of the lake is towards the top of the watershed (a headwater lake).  Most of the water loss that occurs on Big Twin is a result of evaporation, which can be substantial depending on the time of year and conditions in each year.  Big Twin is managed for walleye, black crappie, and channel catfish.   Big Twin has been stocked with walleye fingerlings only for at least the last 10 years.  Typically walleye fry do very well in the Windom Area Lakes, but Big Twin is an example of a lake that has done well with fingerling per yearling stockings.  A population assessment was conducted in June of 2012 using 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE  <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch rate was 16.0 fish per net which was near the upper normal range.  Typically we don't see this high of a catch rate in a fingerling stocked lake.  That catch rate was the 3rd highest catch rate we have ever had on Big Twin Lake and it nearly matched the 2nd highest catch rate of 19 fish per net back in 1988.  The walleyes sampled averaged 16 inches but ranged from 8 to 20 inches.  Five different year class of walleye were sampled with the 2007 and 2009 fingerling stockings dominating the catch.  The overall message here is that Big Twin has a healthy population of walleye and fishing should be good if you can get them to bite.   <br> \n <br> \nCHANNEL CATFISH <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish numbers have never been higher in Big Twin Lake.  In fact, catch rates have doubled since the previous survey in 2008.  Channel catfish lengths ranged from 9 to 25 inches but averaged 17 inches.  The last stocking occurred back in 2001 which tell us the fish are self-sustaining and natural reproduction is happening consistently.  Five year classes of fish were sampled with the 2001, 2005, and 2007 year classes dominating the catch.  Try to target those catfish during the peak of the heat at night during the summer.  You will likely catch a few, and sizes should be good. <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nAnother big change from the 2008 survey is the dramatic increase in black crappie numbers.  Similar to channel catfish, black crappie numbers have also never been higher.  In fact, the catch rate in 2012 was nearly 3 times the catch rate in 2008.  Black crappie were last stocked in Big Twin Lake in 1992.  Total lengths of black crappie sampled in trap nets ranged from 4 to 12 inches and averaged 7 inches.  There is no doubt that if anglers want to catch some crappies they should target the trees lying in the water near shore.  Down trees in the water create excellent habitat for most species of fish, particularly crappie. <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance on Big Twin Lake used to be quite high.  Every year there used to be large pods of newly hatched bullheads on the surface throughout Big Twin Lake.  However, nowadays black bullhead numbers are getting quite low on Big Twin Lake.  The catch rate of black bullheads in gill nets was 12 fish per net, which was below the expected range (30.3 to 150.6 fish per set).  Additionally, it was the lowest catch rate ever recorded on Big Twin Lake.  The long term average is 173 fish per set, but we have seen catch rates in previous surveys ranging from 37 to 335 fish per set.   <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance appears to be improving slightly.  The catch rate of yellow perch in gill nets was 9 fish per set which was above the long term average of 5.1 fish per net.   Total lengths of yellow perch ranged from 4.5 to 9 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.  It is possible to catch yellow perch on Big Twin Lake but odds are higher that you will catch a black crappie of walleye before a yellow perch latches on to your bait.   <br> \n <br> \nCOMMON CARP <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp were first sampled in Big Twin in 1996.  The catch rate of common carp in gill nets was 5.7 fish per set and within the expected range (1.0 to 13.8 fish per set).  The long term average CPUE is 5.0 fish per set.  Currently, the common carp population in Big Twin Lake is within the expected abundance range and continues to be a negative presence in the lake.  Not much can be done to remove common carp from a lake because if all but 1 male and 1 female are removed the population can quickly recover as they reproduce very well.  Currently, the best plan to combat common carp in Big Twin Lake is to continue stocking game fish that will eat young common carp and hopefully suppress their population over time. <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2012 were bluegill, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, white crappie, and white sucker.  Twelve total species were sampled in 2012 which is very good and indicates a healthy fish community with a good diversity of predator and prey species.   <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Ryan Doorenbos <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Twin is a 457-acre lake located near the city of Trimont in Martin County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 18.0 feet and is a class 43 lake.  Big Twin is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black crappie.  Big Twin Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) Walleye in 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020 (to finish the 2019 quota) in an effort to get this strain established in additional waterbodies.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Big Twin Lake was stocked with LMS Walleye because it has traditionally supported a good Walleye population and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction and thus likely has habitat for spawning walleye providing environmental conditions are conducive to natural reproduction.  Due to safety issues surrounding COVID-19, Walleye eggs were not taken in Minnesota in 2020, thus no stocking of age-0 Walleye occurred in the Windom management area.  A natural reproduction check with the use of electrofishing was conducted on October 5, 2020 to determine if natural reproduction occurred in Big Twin Lake.  <br> \n  <br> \nYoung-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye were captured at a rate of 55.7 per hour, which indicates that natural reproduction occurred in Big Twin Lake in 2020.  Analysis of fall electrofishing data has indicated that a catch rate of less than 20.0 per hour often times does not produce a year class, and that a catch rate of more than 20.0 per hour may produce a strong year class.  Walleye fingerlings ranged from 8.7 to 10.7 inches in length and averaged 9.9 inches.  Fin clips were taken to verify the genetic strain of the 2020 year class, since the 2016 stocked LMS Walleye could be sexually mature.  LMS was the most persistent strain, accounting for 53 percent of sampled fingerlings. The remaining 47 percent were a combination of 6 additional strains of Walleye, with none of them exceeding 13 percent of the sample.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Twin is a 457-acre lake located near the city of Trimont in Martin County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 18.0 feet and is a class 43 lake.  Big Twin is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie and Yellow Perch.  Big Twin Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) Walleye fingerlings in 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020 (to finish the 2019 quota), and 2021 in an effort to get this strain established in additional waterbodies.  Big Twin Lake was stocked with LMS Walleye because it has traditionally supported a good Walleye population and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction and thus likely has habitat for spawning walleye providing environmental conditions are conducive to natural reproduction.  Big Twin was scheduled to be stocked with Walleye fingerlings in 2023, but prior to stocking a natural reproduction check was done on September 21, 2023, to determine if stocking was needed or in natural reproduction occurred at a sufficient level.   <br> \n    <br> \nYoung-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye were captured at a rate of 182.6 per hour, which indicates that natural reproduction occurred in Big Twin Lake in 2023.  Analysis of fall electrofishing data has indicated that a catch rate of less than 20.0 per hour often does not produce a year class, and that a catch rate of more than 20.0 per hour may produce a strong year class.  Walleye fingerlings ranged from 8.1 to 10.2 inches in length and averaged 9.3 inches.  Fin clips were taken to verify the genetic strain of the 2023 year class, since LMS Walleye from previous stockings could be sexually mature.  LMS was the most persistent strain, accounting for 66 percent of sampled fingerlings. The remaining 34 percent were a combination of other strains stocked in the past, with none of them exceeding 13 percent of the sample.     Walleye in Big Twin have produced natural year classes in non-stocked years in 2020 (55.7 per hour) and 2022 (161.3 per hour) and now in 2023.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Twin is a 457-acre lake located near the city of Trimont in Martin County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 18.0 feet and is a typical shallow southwest Minnesota Lake with low water clarity.  During many winters, the local sportsmen's group operates an aeration system on the lake.  The total watershed area for Big Twin Lake is small when compared to other lakes in the Windom Area.  Big Twin seldom has run out from the lake due to it being a Headwater Lake in a small watershed.  Big Twin is managed for walleye and black crappie.   Big Twin has been stocked annually with Walleye fingerlings or young adult Walleye since 2007.  A population assessment was conducted in June 2016 using 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in 2016 were 5.0 per gill net and 0.2 per trap net.  The gill net catch rate is more representative of the population and was within the normal range for Big Twin (2.28 to 18.06 per gill net).  The length of Walleye in the gill net sample ranged from just under 12\" to just over 25\" with an average length of nearly 16\" inches.  Most Walleye were in the 11\" to 16\" range.  The overall health of the Walleye in the gill net sample was typical for SW MN.  The 2016 catch rate was below the long-term average catch rate of 10 per gill net.  Since 2014, fish that were produced from a spawning operation on Lake Sarah have been stocked into Big Twin.  Those Walleye have proven in Lake Sarah to be able to spawn naturally and are genetically unique to SW MN!  The future of Walleye fishing on Big Twin Lake looks bright.       <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 survey resulted in the highest catch rate of Black Crappie ever observed in Big Twin Lake.  Black Crappie catch rates in 2016 were 1.0 per gill net and 95.6 per trap net.  The trap net catch rate is most representative of the population and was almost 5 times the upper normal catch range value of 20.5 per trap net.  Additionally, the 2016 catch rate was almost 4.5 times greater than the long-term catch rate average of 21.5 since 1983.  Black Crappie in the trap net sample ranged in length from 4\" to 11\" with most crappie in the 8.5\" to 9.5\" size.  Overall, the Black Crappie in the sample had excellent health across a wide range of sizes.  Overall, spring fishing should be excellent in April and May for 2 to 3 years for Black Crappie during their spawn on Big Twin Lake!     <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in trap net and gill nets were Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, Largemouth Bass, White Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  Of those 9 species, Channel Catfish and Yellow were the only species found in good numbers that will create good fishing opportunities.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Twin is a 457-acre lake located near the city of Trimont in Martin County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 18.0 feet and is a class 43 lake.  Big Twin is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black crappie and Yellow Perch.  Big Twin Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) Walleye in 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020 (to finish the 2019 quota), and 2021 in an effort to get this strain established in additional waterbodies.  Big Twin Lake was stocked with LMS Walleye because it has traditionally supported a good Walleye population and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction and thus likely has habitat for spawning walleye providing environmental conditions are conducive to natural reproduction.  Big Twin is stocked with LMS fingerlings every other year, with 2022 being a non-stocked year.  A natural reproduction check was conducted on October 5, 2022 to determine if natural reproduction occurred in Big Twin Lake.  <br> \n    <br> \nYoung-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye were captured at a rate of 161.3 per hour, which indicates that natural reproduction occurred in Big Twin Lake in 2022.  Analysis of fall electrofishing data has indicated that a catch rate of less than 20.0 per hour often times does not produce a year class, and that a catch rate of more than 20.0 per hour may produce a strong year class.  Walleye fingerlings ranged from 8.7 to 10.4 inches in length and averaged 9.4 inches.  Fin clips were taken to verify the genetic strain of the 2022 year class, since LMS Walleye from previous stockings could be sexually mature. No information on the status of the genetics of this population was available from the lab at the time of this writing.  Walleye in Big Twin have produced natural year classes in non-stocked years in 2020 (55.7 per hour) and 2022 (161.3 per hour).  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Twin Lake, in Martin County, is a 457 acre lake managed primarily for walleyes.  It is also managed for black crappie, channel catfish, and largemouth bass.  Walleye fry, fingerlings, yearlings, and adults as well as bluegill and black crappie have been stocked into Big Twin at various times since 1979.  Channel catfish stocking has taken place since 1994.  Following its current management plan, Big Twin is stocked with 3 to 5 pounds of adult walleye per acre annually when fish are available.  In addition, black crappies are stocked as needed as well as adult largemouth bass in an attempt to boost the amount of potential bass broodstock within the lake.  Adult channel catfish are stocked at a rate of 1 fish per 5 acres when available.  Channel catfish stocking and management has been added to provide an additional fishery and a predator upon the historically abundant black bullhead population.  Walleye gill net catch rates averaged 6 fish per net in the 2004 assessment.  This value is about average for lakes with characteristics similar to Big Twin.  Although well below the historical high of 29 walleyes per gill net seen back in 1992, the walleye population appears somewhat stable since then with nearly 7 fish per gill net captured in 1996 and 4 fish per gill net in 2000.  Trap net catch rates averaged just over 2 walleyes per net in 2004, which is above average for lakes like Big Twin.  Walleyes captured in both types of nets ranged in length from 8.5 to 24.9 inches, with nearly 60% of the fish being longer than 12 inches.  Aging of the fish revealed that they were a result of the 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2003 stockings.  The management goal of 18 fish per gill net has not been met as of this assessment.  Adult or yearling walleye stocking will continue on an annual basis in the future (as fish are available) in an effort to reach the management goal as well as drive black bullhead numbers down.    Black crappie trap net catch rates averaged over 20 fish per net in this assessment of Big Twin.  This is above average for lakes similar to Big Twin and is also a historical high for the lake, more than doubling the previous high (just over 9 fish per trap net in 2000).  Black crappies captured in trap nets averaged nearly 9 inches in length, ranging from 0.6 to 11.4 inches.  The crappie population of Big Twin is considered to be a result of natural reproduction as neither the state nor the Trimont Area Sportsmen's Club has stocked black crappies into the lake since 1992.  The management goal for black crappies has been met.  Black crappie numbers are very high compared to previous surveys and are of adequate size to entertain anglers. Channel catfish gill net catch rates averaged nearly 4 fish per net and only 1 individual was caught in the trap nets.  Channel catfish had not been caught in previous surveys although stockings of yearlings and fingerlings had occurred in 2001, 1998, and 1994.  Aging of the captured catfish revealed all fish sampled were products of the 1998 and 2001 stockings.  Previous surveys suggested that the 1994 fingerling stocking was unsuccessful and this assessment reinforced that belief.  Channel catfish sizes in this assessment averaged 16 inches long, ranging from just under 10 inches to just over 23 inches in length.  The management goal of 5 catfish per gill net has not been met.  Stocking of available channel catfish into Big Twin Lake may be continued in an attempt to maintain a fishery and provide a predator upon the abundant black bullhead population.Largemouth bass trap net catch rates averaged 0.3 fish per net in the 2004 assessment, about average for lakes with characteristics similar to those of Big Twin.  Only 3 bass were sampled, ranging in length from just over 15 inches to just over 18 inches.  Spring electrofishing efforts sampled 6 largemouth bass.  Natural reproduction of largemouth bass is considered sporadic within the lake as the species has not been stocked in Big Twin since 1987.  Lack of appropriate largemouth spawning habitat as well as high bullhead numbers within the lake are thought to be major causes of the inconsistent reproduction.  The management goal of establishing a self-sustaining largemouth bass population is not considered achieved.  Future largemouth bass stocking efforts could be reconsidered unless submerged vegetation makes a significant comeback within Big Twin Lake.  Black bullhead gill net catch rates averaged 101 fish per net in 2004.  This value is somewhat lower than most of the previous surveys of Big Twin, but still about average for similar lakes.  Trap net catch rates averaged 19.1 bullheads per net and were drastically lower than those captured with this gear in previous surveys, but still roughly average for lakes with similar characteristics.  Analyses of the size structure of the bullheads of Big Twin revealed a population dominated by small individuals.Average common carp gill net catch rates (6.7 fish per net) and trap net catch rates (0.6 fish per net) were the lowest they've been since carp first appeared in the 1996 assessment.  The introduction of common carp into Big Twin in 1996 may have been the result of an illegal or accidental stocking.  As a result, anglers are reminded not to dump left over bait into a lake after completion of a fishing trip.  Other species captured in the 2004 population assessment included bluegill, northern pike, white crappies, golden shiners, yellow perch, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and orangespotted sunfish.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Big Twin through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

The average lake wide habitat score was 74.2(+/- 2.6), indicating overall lakeshore habitat quality was moderate (66-84).  Sites with moderate habitat quality have a high percentage of unaltered habitat but at least one zone has lower habitat quality than a high scoring site.  Undeveloped sites may score moderate if they naturally lack a habitat component.  Developed sites that retain a high percentage of natural habitat areas may score in this range.  Approximately 52 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 60.3(+/- 2.7), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 89.3(+/- 1.4).  This habitat survey was designed to provide a means to quantify and compare lakeshore habitat between lakes.  The Big Twin Lake shoreline habitat score is higher than the statewide lake score average of 73.6.</p>",

THE WAE POPULATION CONSISTS OF SIX YEAR CLASSES OF WHICH TWO ARE MOST LIKELY FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  FIRST YEAR GROWTH RATES WERE FASTER FOR WAE WHICH REPRODUCED NATURALLY THAN FROM THOSE WHICH WERE STOCKED.  GILLNET CATCH INDICES WERE TWICE THE UPPER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43 INDICATING A HIGH POPULATION.  GILLNET INDICES FOR YEP INCREASED FROM THE 1988 POPULATION ASSESSMENT FROM 0.7 FISH PER NET TO 3.5 FISH PER NET IN 1992.  THIS CATCH INDEX IS BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE INDICATING A LOW POPULATION FOR THIS LAKE CLASS.  TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR BLB INCREASED FROM 251 FISH PER NET TO OVER A THOUSAND FISH PER NET IN 1992 WHICH IS OVER 10 TIMES THE UPPER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43 INDICATING A HIGH POPULATION. LENGTHS FROM BLB ALL RANGED FROM 5.0 TO 6.4 INCHES.  ONLY TWO NOP WERE CAPTURED DURING THE 1992 SURVEY.  THIS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO LOW WATER LEVELS IN 1989 AND 1990.  GILL AND TRAPNET CATCH INDICES WERE BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE INDICATING A LOW POPULATION.  CARP AND BLG WERE NOT CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY.</p>",
