                "narrative": "<p>Upper Twin (North Twin) is a 225 acre lake located in southern Hubbard County.  Upper Twin is a very shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 12 feet.  Due to it's shallow depth, Upper Twin has abundant growth of both submerged and emergent vegetation.  Upper Twin is connected to Lower Twin Lake (South Twin) and the Shell River flows through both these lakes.  There is a state-owned public access located on the Shell River between Upper and Lower Twin Lakes.  Upper Twin is a popular lake for bluegill and northern pike fishing.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Upper Twin is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include First Crow Wing, Fourth Crow Wing and Shallow Lake.Upper Twin supports a good population of northern pike.  Abundant northern pike spawning habitat of shallow submerged and flooded aquatic vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of pike in Upper Twin.  Sometimes lakes with high northern pike numbers will result in an abundance of small, \"hammer handle\" pike.  However, with the Shell River running through Upper Twin there is an abundant forage base of white sucker and shorthead redhorse resulting in good growth of northern pike.  The size of northern pike was better than most area lakes with a average length and weight of 23.8 inches and 3.9 pounds.  Northern pike up to 41.7 inches were sampled. Bluegill are a popular choice for anglers on Upper Twin.  Bluegill abundance on Upper Twin is not as high as other area lakes, but still within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Size of bluegill was better than most area lakes with good numbers of bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range.  Larger bluegill are present with fish measured up to 9.6 inches.  Black crappie abundance is low in Upper Twin. While not as popular of a fishing spot for walleye as Lower Twin, Upper Twin can provide some walleye fishing, especially early in the season.  Walleye abundance (3.0 walleye/gillnet) is within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and at the management goal for this lake.  Starting in 2000,  stocking in Upper Twin was switched from walleye fry to walleye fingerlings during even years.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Twin (North Twin) is a 225 acre lake located in southern Hubbard County.  Upper Twin is a very shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 12 feet.  Due to its shallow depth, Upper Twin has abundant growth of both submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation.  Upper Twin is connected to Lower Twin Lake (South Twin) and the Shell River flows through both of these lakes.  There is a state-owned public access located on the south end of Upper Twin, in the river channel connecting Upper and Lower Twin Lakes.  Upper Twin is a popular lake for panfish and northern pike fishing. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Upper Twin is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: First Crow Wing, Fourth Crow Wing, Ham, Hart, Hennepin, Hungryman, Minnie, Paine, Peysenski, Portage, Rice, Shallow, Stocking, and Wolf. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice for anglers year-around on Upper Twin.  Present and past surveys have shown the bluegill population in Upper Twin to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers, but within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Size of bluegill was better than most lakes, with good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  The bluegills in Upper Twin have good growth rates when compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Twin supports a good northern pike population.  Abundant northern pike spawning habitat of shallow submerged and flooded aquatic vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of pike in Upper Twin.  Northern pike abundance (5.5 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  With the Shell River running through Upper Twin there is an abundant forage base of white sucker and shorthead redhorse resulting in good growth rates for northern pike.  While small northern pike are common, anglers will find that Upper Twin is capable of producing larger pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.9 inches and 2.7 pounds, with pike measured up to 29.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Twin has both largemouth and smallmouth bass populations.  Largemouth bass are found in low to moderate numbers when compared to other area lakes.  Smallmouth bass were sampled in low numbers and seem to be limited to the inlet and outlet areas of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not know as a walleye lake, anglers will find that Upper Twin can provide some walleye fishing, especially early in the season.  Walleye abundance (1.0 walleye/gillnet) was down from past surveys and below the current management goal of 2.2 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye gillnet catch rates in past surveys have been at or above the current management goal.  Upper and Lower Twin Lakes are stocked with walleye fry each year. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker and shorthead redhorse are abundant in Upper Twin, and anglers looking to pursue these species will find high numbers in the inlet and outlet areas. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of yellow perch, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, rock bass, and bowfin (dogfish). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Twin Lake is located 2 miles south of Hubbard in southwestern Hubbard County. Upper Twin is separated from Lower Twin by a small segment of the Shell River, which runs through both lakes and is navigable by boat.  Upper Twin has a surface area of 212.5 acres and a maximum depth of 12 feet. Upper Twin Lake is very shallow, with an average depth of 6 feet.  A DNR public access is located on the Shell River, off County Road 21 which runs between Lower and Upper Twin.  Upper and Lower Twin Lakes are managed together, and they provide a multi species opportunities to the angler with walleye, northern pike, yellow perch and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Upper Twin is in Lake Class 39. Class 39 lakes generally are shallow, have a very high littoral area and a regularly shaped shoreline. Other class 39 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Ham, Hennepin, Loon, Minnie, Paine, Peysenski, Portage, Rice, Shallow, Wolf, Hungryman and Stocking. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of northern pike in Upper Twin. Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 18 inches and 1.3 pounds, with pike measured up to 22 inches.  Bluegill and black crappie populations appear low in abundance with some bluegills of acceptable size for anglers.  The larger bluegills were in the 6-9 inch range, while most black crappies were smaller than 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently faucet snails and curly leaf pondweed, both aquatic invasive species (AIS), have been identified in Upper Twin. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Twin Lake is a medium sized, shallow, hard-water lake.  The Shell River runs through the lake, and it therefore contains a typical river - lake fish population.  Northern redhorse, common suckers, bullheads, northern pike, and perch are all quite numerous in the lake.The lake's bottom is quite silty, as can be expected, since the river probably carries in silt which is deposited in the lake.During the summer months aquatic plant growth is profuse throughout the lake.  This prevents any motor-boating and discourages any attempts at swimming or fishing.Local residents indicate that Upper Twin probably serves as a large natural game fish spawning area for Lower Twin Lake.  This may be true for northern pike, but the spawning habitat for other game fishes in Upper Twin Lake is quite limited.Various game fish, as well as rough fish, can readily enter and leave the lake via the Shell River.Some fishing is done on the lake before the aquatic vegetation becomes too dense later in the summer.  At this time northern pike and largemouth bass are occasionally caught.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Twin (North Twin) is located in southern Hubbard County on the Hubbard-Wadena County line.  Upper Twin is a very shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 12 feet.  Due to its shallow depth, Upper Twin has abundant growth of both submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation.  Upper Twin is connected to Lower Twin (South Twin) by a small segment of the Shell River which flows through both of these lakes.  There is a state-owned public access located on the south end of Upper Twin, in the Shell River channel connecting Upper and Lower Twin Lakes.   Upper Twin is a popular lake for panfish and Northern Pike fishing. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Upper Twin is in lake class 39.  Class 39 lakes are generally very shallow and have a high littoral area (area of lake less than 15 feet deep).  Other class 39 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include: First Crow Wing, Fourth Crow Wing, Ham, Hennepin, Hungryman, Minnie, Paine, Peysenski, Portage, Shallow, Stocking, and Wolf. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice for anglers' year-around on Upper Twin.  Present and past surveys have shown the Bluegill population in Upper Twin to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers.  Anglers will find good numbers of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black Crappie are also present but have been sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Twin supports a good Northern Pike population.  Abundant Northern Pike spawning habitat of shallow submerged aquatic vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of Northern Pike in Upper Twin.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 23.5 inches and 3.9 pounds with fish measured up to 36.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not know as a Walleye Lake, anglers will find the Upper Twin can provide some good fishing especially early in the season.  The Walleye population in Upper Twin has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers for this lake class.  Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 18.1 to 24.4 inches.   <br> \nYellow Perch, an important forage species were sampled in good numbers.  Sampled Yellow Perch ran small in size with an average length of 6.4 inches and fish measured up to 8.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Twin supports both Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass populations.  Largemouth Bass are found in low to moderate numbers compared to other area lakes.  Smallmouth Bass are present in low numbers and seem to be limited to the inlet and outlet areas. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker and Redhorse are abundant in Upper Twin, and anglers pursuing those species will find high numbers in the inlet and outlet areas. <br> \n <br> \nFaucet snails and curly leaf pondweed, both aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Upper Twin.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Twin (North Twin) is a 225 acre lake located in southern Hubbard County.  Upper Twin is a very shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 12 feet.  Due to its shallow depth, Upper Twin has abundant growth of both submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation.  Upper Twin is connected to Lower Twin Lake (South Twin) and the Shell River flows through both of these lakes.  There is a state-owned public access located on the south end of Upper Twin, in the river channel connecting Upper and Lower Twin Lakes.  Upper Twin is a popular lake for panfish and northern pike fishing. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota\u0019s lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Upper Twin is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: First Crow Wing, Fourth Crow Wing, Ham, Hart, Hennepin, Hungryman, Minnie, Paine, Peysenski, Portage, Rice, Shallow, Stocking, and Wolf. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice for angler\u0019s year-around on Upper Twin.  Present and past surveys have shown the bluegill population in Upper Twin to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers, but within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Size of bluegill was better than most lakes, with good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  The bluegills in Upper Twin have good growth rates when compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Twin supports a good northern pike population.  Abundant northern pike spawning habitat of shallow submerged and flooded aquatic vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of pike in Upper Twin.  Northern pike abundance (5.5 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  With the Shell River running through Upper Twin there is an abundant forage base of white sucker and shorthead redhorse resulting in good growth rates for northern pike.  While small northern pike are common, anglers will find that Upper Twin is capable of producing larger pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.9 inches and 2.7 pounds, with pike measured up to 29.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Twin has both largemouth and smallmouth bass populations.  Largemouth bass are found in low to moderate numbers when compared to other area lakes.  Smallmouth bass were sampled in low numbers and seem to be limited to the inlet and outlet areas of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not know as a walleye lake, anglers will find that Upper Twin can provide some walleye fishing, especially early in the season.  Walleye abundance (1.0 walleye/gillnet) was down from past surveys and below the current management goal of 2.2 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye gillnet catch rates in past surveys have been at or above the current management goal.  Upper and Lower Twin Lakes are heavily stocked with walleye fry each year. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker and shorthead redhorse are abundant in Upper Twin, and anglers looking to pursue these species will find high numbers in the inlet and outlet areas. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of yellow perch, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, rock bass, and bowfin (dogfish). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Twin (North Twin) is located in southern Hubbard County, on the Hubbard-Wadena County line.  Upper Twin is a very shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 12 feet.  Due to its shallow depth, Upper Twin has abundant growth of both submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation.  Upper Twin is connected  to Lower  Twin (South Twin)  by a small  segment  of  the Shell  River which  flows  through  both of  these lakes.  There is a state-owned public access located on the south end of Upper Twin, in the Shell River channel connecting Upper and Lower Twin lakes.  Upper Twin is a popular lake for panfish and Northern Pike fishing. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.   Upper Twin is in lake class 39.  Class 39 lakes are generally very shallow and have a high littoral area (area of lake less than 15 feet deep).  Other  class  39 lakes in  the  Park Rapids  management  area include: First Crow Wing, Fourth Crow Wing, Ham,  Hennepin, Hungryman,  Minnie, Paine,  Peysenski,  Portage, Shallow, Stocking,  and Wolf. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice for anglers' year-around on Upper Twin.   Present and past surveys have shown the Bluegill population in Upper Twin to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers.   Anglers will find good numbers of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black Crappie are also present but have been sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Twin supports a good Northern Pike population.   Abundant Northern Pike spawning habitat of shallow submerged aquatic vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of Northern Pike in Upper Twin.   Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 22.5 inches and 2.9 pounds, with fish measured up to 37.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not known as a Walleye lake, anglers will find that Upper Twin can provide some good fishing, especially early in the season.  The Walleye population in Upper Twin has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers for this lake class.  Walleye ranged in length from 14.6 to 28.5 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye, were sampled in good numbers.  Yellow Perch were an average length of 6.8 inches with fish measured up to 10.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Twin has both Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass populations.  Largemouth Bass are found in low to moderate numbers compared to other area lakes.  Smallmouth Bass are present in low numbers and seem to be limited to the inlet and outlet areas. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker and Redhorse are abundant in Upper Twin, and anglers pursuing these species will find high numbers in the inlet and outlet areas. <br> \n  <br> \nFaucet snails and curly leaf pondweed, both aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Upper Twin.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",
