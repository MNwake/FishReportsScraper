                "narrative": "<p>Fish populations in the Lanesboro Mill Pond have improved considerably since the original survey in 1993.  Over 600 largemouth bass from 6 to 10 in TL were stocked in the pond in 1994.  These fish were introduced to control abundance of black bullheads and panfish.  In 1998, a total of 39 largemouth bass were collected.  Most were ages 1 through 3 with one 6-year-old individual collected.  Lengths ranged from 4 to 18 inches.       Abundance of black bullhead and hybrid sunfish greatly declined from 1993.  Black crappie numbers were approximately 50% of that in 1993 as well.  In 1993 the mean length of black crappie was 6.5 inches.  In 1998 black crappie averaged 7.6 inches-long.  Bluegill abundance declined to approximately one-third of that in 1993.  However mean length increased from 3.9 inches in 1993 to 5.9 inches in 1998.     Five northern pike up to 36 in long and a single sauger were also collected in 1998.  These fish were likely stocked by local anglers.  This practice should be discouraged because anglers can unknowingly introduce an undesirable species. For example, black crappie are a favorite species of many anglers.  However, they are unsuitable for stocking in ponds because they can quickly become overpopulated with high nubmers of stunted fish.     Overall, the fish population in the Lanesboro Mill Pond has greatly improved since 1993.  Largemouth bass have been reporducing successfully and further stocking is unnecessary.  However a regulation which protects largemouth bass from harvest may be needed to maintain balance in the fish populations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Lanesboro Mill Pond was sampled in 2004 with 5 trapnets set overnight in the traditional net set locations.  The entire shoreline was electrofished with a boom shocker to sample the largemouth bass population in early October.  The trapnets were set during the third week of August; a dissolved oxygen profile, temperature profile and secchi disc reading were also completed at his time.  The largemouth bass population has declined considerably since the last assessment in 1998.  Only 1 bass (18.6\" long and 3.3 pounds) was captured during the electrofishing assessment in 2004, it appears that the natural reproduction documented in 1998 has not continued and the adult bass population has suffered as a result.  A lone northern pike (26.5\" long and 4.7 pounds) were also sampled with the electrofishing gear in 2004.  Northern pike have been sampled in 2 previous assessments of the mill pond, although in limited numbers.  The northern pike that are sampled in the lake do tend to be quality size fish; during the last 2 assessments pike up to 32 inches long have been sampled.The 2004 assessment did document an increase in the number of bluegills however the size structure has gone downhill from what was seen in 1998.  The majority of the bluegills (90%) were between 3.5 and 5.0 inches long, with no fish captured exceeding 6 inches in length.  The black crappie abundance has hit an all time low for the lake.  The size structure of the crappie population resembles the ones from previous assessments; most fish were 6 to 8 inches in length with a few fish exceeding 12 inches.  The largest fish measured 13.9 inches long and weighed 1.25 pounds.  Walleyes and yellow perch were also present, but neither species were abundant enough to provide a fishable population.  The absence of black bullheads, hybrid sunfish and very low abundance of green sunfish are a good sign for the lake as all three of these species have provided problems for Lanesboro Mill Pond in the past.Numerous changes have taken place in and around the mill pond since the previous assessment.  Most notably would be the installation of a floating fishing pier installed by the State of Minnesota on the north end of the lake.  The entire north shore has also been turned into a parking lot along with a trail that connects it to an existing recreational trail that tranverses the area.  The fishing pressure has increased dramatically as a result of these 2 major changes.  Overall the fish populations in the Lanesboro Mill Pond have taken a downward turn in recent years with very few harvestable size fish being available to anglers.  With some proactive management (as described in the lake management plan) the lake has the potential to be a very good urban fishery located within the Lanesboro City Limits and adjacent to a high use recreational trail.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This was the initial fishery survey of the Lanesboro Millpond.  All species collected were likely introduced by fisherman as the Department of Natural Resources has not stocked fish in the pond.     Presently the fish population is dominated by black bullheads and black crappies.  Trappnetting catch of black bullheads was 30.2/net with and average size of 6.7 inches.  Average catch of black crappies was 28.7/net with a mean length of 6.5 inches.  Twenty black crappie over 10 inches were collected.  Black crappie from age 2 to age 6 occurred but none younger than 2-years-old were collected.  The bluegill population consisted of small fish with an average length of 5.3 inches.  Fair numbers were caught (14.3/net).  As with black crappies, no bluegill younger than age 2 were collected with age 3 fish most abundant.  One walleye 20.2 inches (3.4 lbs) and one smallmouth bass 13 inches (1.1 lbs) were collected trapnetting.     Four largemouth bass and two smallmouth bass were collected electrofishing.  Largemouth bass ranged from 13.6 to 17.9 inches and averaged 2.2 lbs.  Two each were age 2 and age 4.  The two smallmouth bass collected were 12.2 inches (age 5) and 12.5 inches (age 6).  These fish were obviously caught elsewhere and placed in the pond.     It is apparent from numerous small fish and lack of recent reproducton that the black crappie and bluegill populations are overcrowded.  This is often the case in small lakes and ponds where few predators occur.  Predation by largemouth bass and other species on small black crappie and bluegill is necessary to prevent overcrowding and stunting.  The number of black bullhead may increase over time, also due to a lack of predation.  Bullhead are generally not abundant in ponds and small lakes with a good population of largemouth bass.  It is very important that the few bass present in the pond be protected.  The future of good fishing in the pond depends largely on establishing a largemouth bass population in numbers sufficient to control bluegill, black crappie, and black bullhead abundance.      </p>",
