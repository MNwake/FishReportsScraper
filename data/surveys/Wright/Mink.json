The most abundant fish caught in trap nets were Black and Yellow Bullhead, Black Crappie and Bluegill. Black Bullhead numbers were almost seven times the local average. Average length was 7.5 inches. \n\nBlack Crappie numbers were higher than in 1980. Lengths ranged from 4.0-10.9 inches with the average length group at 6.0-6.4 inches. Growth was good. The Bluegill catch was about the same as in 1980. Bluegill ranged in size from 3.0-7.5 inches with an average length of 5.4 inches. Growth was good. Shoreline seining netted only one Largemouth Bass. Two Common Carp were captured during seining and both were over 23 inches long. Common Carp are known to be abundant in Mink Lake.</p>",

The lake area is 91 acres and the maximum depth is 36 feet. Water clarity is better than Buffalo Lake. The small watershed is mostly pasture, row crops, and forest. A public access is located at the outlet on Buffalo Lake, but the culvert under County Road 12 prevents most boats from accessing Mink Lake. The last lake survey was in 1988. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers declined from 1988 to 2013, but were still above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Mink Lake. Lengths ranged from 16.3 to 28.4 inches with an average length and weight of 22.7 inches and 2.6 pounds. Thirty two percent of Northern Pike were longer than 24 inches. Despite a connection to Buffalo Lake, no Walleye were captured. Largemouth Bass are present in the lake and are typically sampled by boat electrofishing in the spring, but lack of access prevented electrofishing in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers decreased from 1988, but the catch rate was still within the expected range for similar lakes. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 4.5 to 8.2 inches and the average size was small (6.3 inches, 0.13 pounds). The Bluegill catch increased greatly from 1988, but was still within the expected range for lakes similar to Mink. Bluegill were also small, ranging in length from 3.4 to 8.1 inches with an average length and weight of 4.9 inches and 0.1 pounds. Other species caught included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
