An undeveloped, road right-of-way access exists off of Bear Island Road which provides an option to carry-down small watercraft to the lake.  Parking is limited to the shoulder of Bear Island Road.  Maximum depth is 16 feet, with 99% of the lake less than 15 feet deep.  Apple was surveyed during the summer of 2018 to gather information about fish populations and aquatic habitat. <br> \n <br> \nThe best fishing opportunities within Apple Lake are currently for Walleye and Yellow Perch.  Walleye abundance of 3.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes, but average size was large at 20.7 inches.  Yellow Perch abundance of 47 per lift was well above average compared to other similar Minnesota Lakes.  Average size of perch was 7.6 inches and several large specimens were captured which approached 11 inches in length.     <br> \n <br> \nAngling opportunities also exist for Smallmouth Bass and Black Crappie.  Smallmouth Bass mean length was 14.0 inches but bass over 17 inches were sampled.  The Black Crappie population density was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes and mean length was 6.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are small and extremely abundant in Apple Lake and may be characterized as a nuisance for anglers searching for other quality angling opportunities in Apple Lake.      <br> \n <br> \nUnlike nearby Island Reservoir which has a heavy tannin stain, the water clarity in Apple is very clear with a secchi disk reading of 13 feet in 2018.  Results of laboratory water analyses indicate Apple is a moderately hard water lake with moderate fertility.</p>",
