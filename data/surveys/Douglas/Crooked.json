                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is a lightly developed 153-acre basin located about eight miles west of Alexandria in Douglas County.  The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Emergent vegetation is common along the west and south shorelines.  Submerged vegetation is common throughout shallow areas and can be dense in shallow bays along the south shore.  Water quality and clarity are relatively good.  Aquatic vegetation helps to maintain water quality by competing with nuisance algae for the available nutrients in the lake and protects the shoreline from wave-induced erosion.  Aquatic plants also provide critical spawning and nursery habitat for many fish species, especially bass and sunfish. The fish community in Crooked Lake is typical of small, densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and northern pike provide most of the angling opportunities.  Average size of bluegill and largemouth bass have improved in recent years and should provide some quality angling.  Northern pike are relatively abundant, but average size tends to be small.  Black crappie numbers were down in 2004.  Black crappie populations can be erratic in these small lakes, thus numbers are expected to rebound.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked (Horseshoe) Lake is a moderately productive, 183-acre basin located in western Douglas County.  Average depth is 11.0 feet with a maximum of 35.0 feet.  Aquatic vegetation is common and provides good fish habitat.  Water clarity was 10.0 feet at the time of the early July survey.  A concrete boat launch is located on the northern shoreline off Douglas County Road 27 SW.  \n\nCrooked Lake supports abundant Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  Electrofishing catch rates of bass were higher than the previous survey.  Average size was moderate (10.7 inches), but the largest individual exceeded 20.0 inches.  Northern Pike remain abundant (7.0/gill net).  Pike averaged 20.5 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to take advantage of the liberalized pike harvest regulation (anglers are able to keep up to 10 pike with no more than two fish longer than 26 inches; all fish from 22-26 inches must be released).  Reduced abundance would likely increase growth rates and size of pike.  Bluegill are common (10.4/trap net) in Crooked Lake.  Roughly 60% of all Bluegill were between 7.0 and 9.0 inches.  Growth rates were slow, but individuals can reach desirable lengths if they survive to age 9 or more.  The oldest individual was 12 years old.  Due to slow growth rates, anglers are encouraged to limit harvest on larger individuals to conserve the fishery.  Crooked Lake currently has good angling opportunities for Black Crappie (5.8/gill net).  Crappie averaged 11.0 inches in the gill nets.  One Walleye was collected in 2021. \n\nOther collected species include Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed and Yellow Bullhead.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2027.  \n\nCrooked Lake is not known to have any aquatic invasive species, but will only remain that way if the public is vigilant.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to other lakes.</p>",

Average weight has increased from 1.70 to 2.09 lbs/fish. Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing for the first time this spring. The electrofishing survey showed a relatively low population with many year-classes represented and good recruitment to larger sizes. Trapnet catches for bluegill were very high (75.63 fish/lift). Age and growth evaluations were not conducted; however, catch rate and size distribution is indicative of a stunted population. This stunted bluegill population  problem was identified in the 1983 survey. Black crappie continue to be abundant and small in size. Management efforts designed to bolster the largemouth bass population while increasing panfish harvest would seem prudent. Fish aggregation devices would be useful towards increasing sunfish angling success.</p>",

The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community which helps maintain good water quality and provides spawning and nursery habitat for many fish species, especially largemouth bass and other sunfishes.  Water clarity at time of the survey was 8.8 feet. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Crooked Lake is typical of small, densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie and northern pike support the majority of angling opportunities.  Northern pike remain abundant, but average size tends to be small.  Mean length of sampled fish was 19.0 inches.  Largemouth bass are present in good numbers.  Mean length of sampled bass was 12.8 inches.  Ten percent of electrofishing captures exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Bluegill abundance continues to decline.  Average length of captured fish was 6.8 inches.  Few fish exceeded 8.0 inches.  Black crappie are present in low numbers.  Average size of the sampled fish was 9.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similarchemical and physical characteristics is 2.3 - 9.2 fish/net.  Average weight of fish captured in 1994was 2.2 pounds.  Approximately 40% of the fish captured were 21 inches in total length or greater and5% exceeded 28 inches in total length. Largemouth bass abundance is limited.  Daytime, DCelectrofishing yielded only 4.3 fish per hour.  Electrofishing catches averaged 2.0 fish per hour and2.6 fish per hour in 1990 and 1991, respectively.  The five fish captured ranged from 10.0 to 16.0inches in total length.  Mean weight was 1.2 pounds.  Largemouth bass fingerlings were stocked at arate of approximately 10 per acre in the fall of 1994.  Bluegill trapnet catch rate decreased from 75.6fish/net in 1988 to 9.2 fish/net in 1994.  A trend of increasing bluegill catches was apparent inprevious surveys.  Trapnet catches averaged 20.0 fish/net in 1978, 59.0 fish/net in 1983 and 75.6fish/net in 1988.  Size structure of the bluegill population has not changed significantly since 1988. Approximately 38% of the fish captured were 6.0 inches in length or greater in 1994 compared to 29% in1988.  Black crappie abundance has also declined since 1988.  Trapnet catches averaged 1.8 fish/net in1994.  Trapnet catches averaged 15.0 and 15.4 fish/net in 1983 and 1988, respectively.  Mean weight offish captured in 1994 was 0.3 pounds.  Yellow perch catches averaged only 0.8 fish/gillnet.  Catcheshave been low in past surveys, ranging from 0.0 fish/net to 3.4 fish/net.  The normal of mean catchrates from similar lakes is 3.7 - 28.4 fish/net.</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Crooked Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nTen species were collected during this survey.  Two species (Blacknose Shiner and Iowa Darter) were considered \"intolerant\" and one species (Green Sunfish) was considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes. \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Crooked Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is a lightly developed, 183-acre basin located eight miles west of Alexandria in Douglas County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 35.0 feet and average depth of 11.0 feet.  The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community which helps maintain good water quality and provides spawning and nursery habitat for many fish species, especially Largemouth Bass, sunfishes, and Northern Pike.  Water clarity at time of the survey was 7.0 feet. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Crooked Lake is typical of small, densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota. Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Black Crappie and Northern Pike support the fishery.  Northern Pike are abundant.  Most pike captured in 2015 were small, averaging 18.8 inches, but the basin does support opportunities to catch 28.0-inch and larger pike.  The largest pike captured during the survey was 31.4 inches in length.  Largemouth Bass are moderately abundant.  Mean length of sampled bass was 10.4 inches. Sizes at capture ranged from 2.9 inches to 17.5 inches.  Bluegill abundance was lower than anticipated.  Trap net catches averaged 13.9-fish/net, which is much lower than catch rates recorded in early surveys.  Age distribution of Bluegill captured during the survey extended to age 8, but growth is below average.  Only 3% of Bluegill captures were 8.0 inches or larger.  Average length of captured Bluegill was 5.7 inches.  Crooked Lake currently supports a fair to good Black Crappie fishery.  Survey catches have been greater in prior surveys, but due to good reproductive success and recruitment in 2009 and 2010, 46% of trap net captures exceeded 10.0 inches.  Other fish species observed during the survey include Yellow Perch, Common Carp, Bowfin (Dogfish), and Black and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is located about three miles northwest of Holmes City.  This 153-acre lake is lightlydeveloped and does not receive a great deal of fishing pressure.  There is a nice concrete accesslocated near the northwest corner of the lake.  Crooked Lake supports a diverse and abundant aquaticplant community.  Hardstem bulrush and cattail are common along the south and west shorelines. Submergent vegetation is present along most of the shoreline and is dense in shallow bays.  Aquaticvegetation maintains good water quality by stabilizing the shoreline and competing with nuisance algaefor available nutrients.  Aquatic plants also provide critical spawning and nursery habitat for manygamefish.  Future residential development on Crooked Lake will likely threaten these valuable aquaticplants.  Protection of this vegetation should be given a high priority.Crooked Lake would be a great place to take the kids for consistent action or to just get out of thewind on days when larger lakes are rolling.  The lake supports a typical bass/panfish community.  Blackcrappie are relatively abundant.  Fish averaged about 8 inches in length and the largest fish capturedwas 11.1 inches.  Angling success has been reported to be good in the spring following ice-out. Largemouth bass and bluegill are also relatively abundant.  The average size of both species tends tobe small, however there are larger fish taken from the lake.  Northern pike are abundant, but averagesize also tends to be small.  Fish averaged about 18 inches in length and could provide quick actionnow and may provide quality angling opportunities in the near future.  </p>",
