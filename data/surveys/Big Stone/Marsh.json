The lake contains a fair amount of scattered rock, and can become quite thick with submerged vegetation during mid to late summer.     Marsh Lake is managed for northern pike.  Northern pike were abundant in 1997 at all sizes from 1-10 pounds.  There were also trophy class fish present weighing as much as 20 pounds.  Pike were present from seven consecutive year classes, all the result of natural reproduction.  The watershed surrounding Marsh Lake provides good pike spawning and nursery habitat in the form of seasonally flooded wetlands when spring runoff is sufficient.  The long term sustainability of the Marsh Lake northern pike population depends on the protection of such wetland habitats.     Walleye stocking at Marsh Lake was discontinued in 1989 because it was not conducive to northern pike management.  However, since then the walleye population has steadily increased, and presently exists at a high level.  Seven year classes of walleye were present in 1997, all the product of natural reproduction.  Walleye were common from 1-3 pounds.  Marsh Lake and its tributaries provide numerous areas of suitable walleye spawning habitat, and the lake boasts an abundant, naturally reproduced walleye population.     Yellow perch were also abundant in 1997, with most fish measuring 5-10 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marsh Lake is a large, shallow, nutrient rich lake near Correll in western Minnesota.  Scattered boulders along with dense beds of submerged vegetation can make boating difficult on Marsh Lake.     Marsh Lake is managed primarily for northern pike.  Seasonally flooded wetlands within the Marsh Lake watershed provide good northern pike spawning and rearing areas during springs with sufficient runoff.  The long term sustainability of northern pike depends on the protection of these wetland habitats.       Northern pike were moderately abundant in 2000.  Pike ranged from 12.6-33.4 inches long with the majority 19.0-24.0 inches, and six consecutive year classes were present.  Pike numbers were down considerably from the 1997 assessment.  This is likely due to below normal spring runoff the past couple years reducing northern pike reproduction.  A return to more normal spring runoff will create improved spawning and rearing conditions for pike, and will likely increase their numbers.     Walleye were in low abundance in 2000, and their numbers were down considerably from 1997.  Walleye fry stocking was discontinued in 1989 as it was not conducive to northern pike management.  However, gill net catches increased during the next three assessments and indicated that during suitable springs, adequate natural reproduction occurred.     Yellow perch were abundant in 2000.  The gill net catch of perch was the highest recorded for Marsh Lake.  The majority of perch ranged from 5.5-7.0 inches, but a fishable population of 9.0-13.0 inch fish was also present.       Common carp were abundant in 2000, and their gill net catch was the highest recorded for Marsh Lake.  Carp ranged widely in size from 4.0-31.0 inches.  Increased carp numbers may negatively impact game fish species by degrading habitat.      Management plans for Marsh Lake include continuing to support and assist efforts of local, state of federal agencies to improve water quality and maintain or improve fisheries habitat, annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and fishing pressure, and fish assessments every third year to evaluate fish populations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>SINCE THE LAST ASSESSMENT IN 1986, MARSH LAKE EXPERIENCED A WINTERKILL IN 1989 AND WAS OPENED TO LIBERALIZED FISHING IN 1991.  IN THE WINTER OF 1988-89 A DISSOLVED OXYGEN READING OF 1.9 PPM WAS RECORDED IN DECEMBER.  LAKE DEPTH WAS ONLY TWO FEET, OF WHICH ONE FOOT WAS ICE.  IN JANUARY THE LAKE FROZE TO THE BOTTOM.  DEAD CARP WERE FOUND LINING THE SHORELINE AFTER ICE-OUT IN APRIL.  NO DEAD GAME FISH WERE OBSERVED.  IN 1991, SIMILAR LAKE CONDITIONS TO 1989 WERE PRESENT WITH LOW WATER VOLUME AND THICK ICE COVER.  IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE LAKE MIGHT FREEZE TO THE BOTTOM AGAIN, SO THE LAKE WAS OPENED TO LIBERALIZED FISHING. THE LAKE NEVER DID FREEZE TO THE BOTTOM. DISSOLVED OXYGEN READINGS REMAINED EXCELLENT THROUGHOUT THE WINTER RANGING FROM 13.4 PPM IN JANUARY TO 20+ PPM IN MARCH EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS ONLY A FOOT OF WATER BENEATH THE ICE COVER.  NO DEAD FISH WERE FOUND IN THE SPRING.  EVIDENTLY NO WINTERKILL OCCURRED IN 1991.  THE LAST STOCKING OF THE LAKE WAS IN 1988, 632,000 WAE FRY.  29 SPECIES OF FISH WERE COLLECTED IN THIS SURVEY, INCLUDING EIGHT SPECIES OF MINNOWS AND THREE DARTER SPECIES.  RKB, PMK, BLG AND LMB WERE COLLECTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1991.  NOP HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY SPECIES SOUGHT BY ANGLERS IN MARSH LAKE.  MOST OF THIS PRESSURE HAS BEEN BY SPEARING.  SINCE 1986, THE MEAN NUMBER PER GILL NET SET INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM 6.5 TO 6.7.  MEAN POUNDS PER SET INCREASED FROM 15.3 TO 17.0.  THE MEAN NUMBER PER SET WAS 6.7 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  THE MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF NORTHERNS WERE 19.7 INCHES AND 2.6 POUNDS.  IN THIS SURVEY, AGE 0+  THROUGH 4+ PIKE WERE COLLECTED, REPRESENTING 1991 THROUGH 1987 YEAR CLASSES. NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND/OR MIGRATION FROM TRIBUTARIES ACCOUNT FOR THE PIKE PRESENT IN THE LAKE, AS THE LAST STOCKING OF PIKE WAS IN 1981. ALL AGE CLASSES EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH ACCORDING TO STATE GAME FISH GROWTH RATE TABLES.  AGE 0+ AND 2+ FISH, REPRESENTING 1991 AND 1989 YEAR CLASSES, COMPRISED 72% OF THE NOP CAUGHT.  THE 1991 YEAR CLASS, YOUNG OF YEAR (YOY) FISH, RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 11 TO 16 INCHES.  NO YEAR CLASSES SAMPLED IN THE 1986 ASSESSMENT WER FOUND IN THIS SURVEY. THIS IS MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE WINTERKILL IN 1989. ALSO, ANY PRE-1986 YEAR CLASS FISH THAT MIGRATED OUT OF THE LAKE BEFORE THE WINTERKILL AND BACK IN WOULDN'T BE PRESENT IN LARGE ENOUGH NUMBERS, DUE TO MORTALITY, TO BE EFFICIENTLY SAMPLED.  NOP NUMBERS IN THE LAKE APPEAR TO BE ADEQUATELY MAINTAINED BY NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND/OR MIGRATION INTO THE LAKE FROM TRIBUTARIES.  WHB NUMBERS INCREASED THREE TIMES SINCE 1986 FROM 0.5 TO 1.5 FISH PER GILL NET SET.  MEAN POUNDS PER SET DECREASED TWO TIMES FROM 0.6 TO 0.3.  THE MEAN NUMBER PER SET WAS 2.8 TIMES LESS THAN THE STATE MEDIAN.  ALL WHB SAMPLED WERE YOY FISH RANGING IN LENGTH FROM SIX TO EIGHT INCHES.  BLG WERE SAMPLED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1991.  TWO FISH, AGE 1+ AND 2+, WERE COLLECTED.  YOY FISH WERE ALSO SAMPLED IN QUARTER INCH MESH TRAP NETS. LMB WERE ALSO SAMPLED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1991. THE MEAN NUMBER PER TRAP NET SET WAS TWICE THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 0.3.  THREE AGE CLASSES, 0+ THROUGH 2+, REPRESENTING 1991 THROUGH 1989 YEAR CLASSES, WERE PRESENT.  TWO THIRDS OF COLLECTED FISH WERE AGE 1+ RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 9.2 TO 11.0 INCHES.  ALL AGE CLASSES EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  BLC MEAN NUMBER PER TRAP NET SET INCREASED APPROXIMATELY FOUR TIMES SINCE 1986, FROM 2.0 TO 8. 3.  THE MEAN NUMBER OF BLC WAS SLIGHTLY GREATER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 6.8.  THEIR MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT WERE 4.4 INCHES AND 0.09 POUNDS.  AGE CLASSES 0+ THROUGH 3+, REPRESENTING 1992 THROUGH 1988 YEAR CLASSES, WERE COLLECTED.  AGE 1+ AND 3+ FISH EXHIBITED AVERAGE GROWTH RATES.  AGE 2+ FISH GREW AT A FAST RATE.  89% OF THE BLC SAMPLED WERE YOY RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 3.4 TO 4.6 INCHES. YEP MEAN CATCH PER GILL NET SET DECREASED SINCE 1986, FROM 15.3 FISH AND 4.4 POUND TO 7.8 FISH AND 2.6 POUNDS.  THE MEAN NUMBER OF PERCH PER SET WAS 1.3 TIMES LESS THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  THE MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF PERCH WERE 8.7 INCHES AND 0.3 POUNDS.  ALL AGE CLASSES FROM 0+ TO 4+, REPRESENTING 1991 THROUGH 1987 YEAR CLASSES, WERE PRESENT.  79% OF YEP SAMPLED WERE FROM THE 1989 AND 1988 YEAR CLASSES WHICH WERE AGE 2+ AND 3+ FISH.  THOSE AGE CLASSES COMBINED WERE COMPRISED OF FISH RANGING FROM 7.4 TO 10.6 INCHES.  IT APPEARS THAT THE LAKE DIDN'T COMPLETELY WINTERKILL IN 1989 AS THE STRONGEST YEAR CLASS OF PERCH WAS FROM 1988.  THOSE FISH MAY ALSO HAVE MIGRATED INTO THE LAKE SINCE THE WINTERKILL.  ALL AGE CLASSES EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  WAE NUMBER AND POUNDS PER GILL NET SET DECREASED SINCE 1986, FROM 24 FISH AND 36.8 POUNDS TO 13 FISH AND 8.2 POUNDS.  THE MEAN NUMBER PER GILL NET SET WAS 4.6 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  THE MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF WAE FROM ALL GEARS DECREASED, FROM 15.7 INCHES AND 1.5 POUNDS TO 9.6 INCHES AND 0.5 POUNDS.  THIS DECREASE IN AVERAGE SIZE WAS DUE TO THE LARGER NUMBER OF FISH UNDER 12 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH CAUGHT IN 1991.  TOTAL NUMBERS OF WAE COLLECTED WERE SIMILAR IN 1986 AND 1991, BUT 85% OF THE WAE CAPTURED IN 1991 WERE LESS THAN 12 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH WHILE IN 1986 ONLY 4% OF SAMPLED FISH WERE LESS THAN 12 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH.  AGE 0+ THROUGH 6+ WAE WERE COLLECTED, REPRESENTING 1991 THROUGH 1985 YEAR CLASSES.  THE 1991 YEAR CLASS, YOY, COMPRISED 85% OF THE SAMPLE. THESE FISH ARE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION IN THE LAKE OR MIGRANTS FROM TRIBUTARIES.  NO YEAR CLASSES SAMPLED IN THE 1986 ASSESSMENT WERE SAMPLED IN THE 1991 NETTING.  ALL AGE CLASSES OF WAE EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  CARP WERE THE MOST NUMEROUS NON-GAME FISH COLLECTED.  A TOTAL OF 828,872 POUNDS WERE HARVESTED BY COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN IN THE 1980'S.  CARP MEAN CATCH RATES PER GILL NET SET INCREASED SINCE 1986, FROM 4.8 FISH AND 22.1 POUNDS TO 38.2 FISH AND 65.9 POUNDS. THE MEAN NUMBER PER GILL NET SET OF CARP WAS 16.6 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  CARP RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 3.5 TO 31.9 INCHES, WITH 69% OF THE SAMPLE COMPRISED OF YOY FISH 3.5 TO 7.4 INCHES LONG.  BLB MEAN CATCH RATES PER GILL NET SET DECREASED SINCE 1986, FROM 25.5 FISH AND 8.8 POUNDS TO 12.6 FISH AND 4.4 POUNDS.  MEAN SIZE OF BLH REMAINED APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AT 8.1 INCHES AND 0.4 POUNDS.  THIS HIGHLY DESIRABLE SIZE OF BLH IS NOT BEING UTILIZED BY EITHER COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN OR RECREATIONAL ANGLERS.  THIS MAY BE PARTLY DUE TO THE RELATIVELY LOW NUMBER OF BLH PRESENT, WHICH WERE 23% LESS THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR NUMBER PER GILL NET SET.  SINCE IT WINTERKILLED IN 1989, MARSH LAKE HAS APPARENTLY BEEN REPOPULATED BY FISH FROM ADJOINING WATER BODIES, NAMELY THE MINNESOTA RIVER.  THE LAKE HAS BEEN COLONIZED BY MODERATE NUMBERS OF ADULT FISH AND LARGE NUMBERS OF YOY FISH OF BOTH GAME AND NON GAME FISH SPECIES.  NOP, BLG, LMB, BLC, YEP AND WAE WERE COLLECTED FROM YEAR CLASSES PRODUCED IN THE SPRING OF 1989 OR EARLIER.  AFTER YEARS OF WINTERKILL, MIGRATION APPEARS TO BE THE KEY FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUBSTANTIAL FISH POPULATION IN MARSH LAKE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marsh Lake is an impoundment of the Minnesota River approximately three miles southwest of Appleton.  The lake was created in the late 1930's by construction of a dam on the Minnesota River near the outlet of the Pomme de Terre River.  Marsh Lake measures 4,500 acres and has a maximum depth of five feet.  It frequently suffers from high turbidity because wave action caused by wind sitrs up the sediment which contains a high percentage of silty materials. <br> \n <br> \nGood fishing for walleye and northern pike frequently occurs on Marsh Lake and just upstream in the Minnesota River and at culverts on the Louisburg grade road.  Angling on the lake has primarily been limited to ice-fishing because numerous boulders and shallow reefs make boating somewhat treacherous, and shallow depths restrict the size of boats that can be launched from the boat ramps.  Angling in the Minnesota River and along the grade road primarily occurs during the open water seaon, especially during spring.  The culverts and the bridge by the access are popular shore angling locations. <br> \n <br> \nNatural reproduction and walleye stocking contribute to the walleye population.  The strongest walleye year class observed occurred in 2001 and it was entirely produced by natural reproduction.  The northern pike population can be quite variable and it is largely dependent on suitable spring spawning conditions.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marsh Lake is an impoundment of the Minnesota River and is located approximately three miles southwest of Appleton in western Minnesota.  The lake was created in the 1930's by construction of a dam on the Minnesota River near the outlet of the Pomme de Terre River.  Marsh Lake measures 4,500 acres and has a maximum depth of 5 feet.  High winds frequently stir up the lake's silty bottom and the water is typically very turbid.  Although the lake is shallow and nutrient rich, it rarely experiences winterkill likely due to water that flows through it from the Minnesota and Pomme de Terre Rivers, and Five Mile Creek. <br> \n <br> \nGood fishing for Walleye and Northern Pike can occur.  Angling is generally limited to the ice because numerous boulders and shallow reefs make boating somewhat treacherous.  Shallow depths at the boat ramps limit the size of boats that can be launched.  A substantial amount of open water fishing occurs just upstream of the lake on the Minnesota River, at the culverts on the Louisburg Grade Road, and along the Marsh Lake Dam dike.  There is a boat access by the Minnesota River bridge on the Louisberg Grade Road.  The bridge and culverts are popular shore angling locations and fishing can be very good when flows are sufficient. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2017, 10 quarter-inch traps nets were set to evaluate natural reproduction by fish.  The sampling was conducted to collect additional baseline data prior to completion of the Marsh Lake Ecosystem Restoration Project. <br> \n <br> \nSix game and 15 nongame species were sampled.  Spottail Shiners, Freshwater Drum, Orangespotted Sunfish, Black Crappies and Shorthead Redhorse were most abundant by number, respectively.  Young-of-year and adult Black Crappies, Bluegills, Channel Catfish, Walleyes and White Crappies were caught.  Adult Northern pike were also caught.  Minnows included Brassy Minnows, Common Carp, Emerald Shiners, Fathead Minnows, Spotfin Shiners and Spottail Shiners.  Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullheads, Brown Bullheads, Freshwater Drum, Shorthead Redhorses, White Suckers, Yellow Bullheads, Green Sunfish and Orangespotted Sunfish were also caught. <br> \n <br> \nThe Marsh Lake Ecosystem Restoration project will be constructed during 2017-2018.  The project is the culmination of years of stakeholder meetings and planning.  Stakeholders included the general public, non-profit environmental organizations, area businesses and government agencies.  Project construction management will be handled by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.  The project goals are to improve fish and wildlife habitat throughout Marsh Lake and adjacent habitats.  Major project features include converting the dam to a rapids, a new control structure to allow for occasional drawdowns of Marsh Lake, and restoration of the Pomme de Terre River to its historic channel.  Anticipated outcomes of the project include improved water quality, increased abundances of desirable aquatic plants, increased fish and wildlife populations, and improved recreational use.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marsh Lake is an impoundment of the Minnesota River approximately three miles southwest of Appleton.  The lake was created in the 1930's by construction of a dam on the Minnesota River near the outlet of the Pomme de Terre River.  Marsh Lake is approximately 5,000 acres and it has a maximum depth of 5 feet at the normal summer pool level.  Although the lake is shallow and nutrient rich, it rarely winterkills likely because oxygenated water flows through it from the Minnesota River, Five Mile Creek and natural springs. <br> \n <br> \nMarsh Lake has provided good fishing for walleyes and northern pike.  Fishing has mainly been limited to ice and shore fishing because numerous boulders and shallow reefs make boating somewhat treacherous, and shallow depths at the boat ramps restrict boat size.  A substantial amount of open water fishing occurs just upstream of the lake on the Minnesota River and by the culverts on the Louisburg Grade Road.  There is a boat access along the Minnesota River bridge on the Grade Road.  The bridge and culverts are popular shore angling locations and fishing can be very good when adequate flows are present. <br> \n <br> \nThe Marsh Lake ecosystem project was completed in early 2020.  The project included converting the low-head outlet dam to a rock-arch rapids fishway, and construction of a separate draw-down outlet structure.  Drawdowns were conducted during 2020 and 2021 that resulted in substantial increases in emergent vegetation around the shoreline.  Water levels were returned to normal in 2022.  This survey was conducted to evaluate the response of the fishery.  These data can be compared to historical Standard and Targeted Survey data from Marsh Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSixteen species of fish were caught during this survey.  Adult and young-of-year fish were abundant including black crappies, channel catfish, freshwater drum, northern pike, walleye, white bass and yellow perch.  Forage fish were abundant including two species of shiners.  This will benefit the game fish populations in Marsh Lake, as well as those in Lac qui Parle Lake just downstream. <br> \n <br> \nMarsh Lake had adequate dissolved oxygen levels during the winter of 2022-23 and the fishery should continue to thrive during 2024. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marsh Lake is an impoundment of the Minnesota River approximately three miles southwest of Appleton.  The lake was created in the 1930's by construction of a dam on the Minnesota River near the outlet of the Pomme de Terre River.  Marsh Lake is approximately 5,000 acres and it has a maximum depth of 5 feet at the normal summer pool level.  Although the lake is shallow and nutrient rich, it rarely winterkills likely because oxygenated water flows through it from the Minnesota River, Five Mile Creek, and natural springs. <br> \n <br> \nMarsh Lake has provided good fishing for Walleyes and Northern Pike.  Fishing has mainly been limited to ice fishing because numerous boulders and shallow reefs make boating somewhat treacherous, and shallow depths at the boat ramps limit the size of boats that can be launched.  A substantial amount of open water fishing occurs just upstream of the lake on the Minnesota River and by the culverts on the Louisburg Grade Road.  There is a boat access along the Minnesota River bridge on the Grade Road.  The bridge and culverts are popular shore angling locations and fishing can be very good when adequate flows are present. <br> \n <br> \nThe Marsh Lake ecosystem project was completed in early 2020.  The project included converting the low-head outlet dam to a rock-arch rapids fishway, and construction of a separate draw-down outlet structure.  Drawdowns were conducted during 2020 and 2021 that resulted in substantial increases in emergent vegetation around the shoreline.  Water levels were returned to normal in 2022.  This survey was conducted to evaluate the response of the fishery.  These data can be compared to historical Standard and Targeted Survey data from Marsh Lake. <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-one species of fish were caught during this survey including Black Crappie, Northern Pike, Walleye, White Bass and Yellow Perch.  Most game fish were young-of-year or yearlings, and they were relatively small.  Their growth rates were good, and they are expected to attract anglers by the fall of 2023.  Young-of-year crappies and Northern Pike were especially abundant, and indication of good natural reproduction.  Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum and White Bass were present in adequate numbers and sizes to provide a fishery.  Forage fishes were abundant in this survey, including three species of shiners.  This will benefit the game fish populations in Marsh Lake, as well as those in Lac qui Parle Lake just downstream. <br> \n <br> \nMarsh Lake had good dissolved oxygen levels during the winter of 2022-23 and the fishery should continue to thrive during 2023. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marsh is a 4500 acre, shallow lake located near Appleton in west-central Minnesota.  Scattered boulders and dense beds of submergent vegetation can make boating difficult on Marsh Lake.     Marsh Lake is primarily managed for northern pike.  Seasonally flooded wetlands within the Marsh Lake watershed provide good northern pike spawning and rearing areas during springs with sufficient runoff.  The sustainability of northern pike depend upon the protection of these wetland habitats.     Northern pike were moderatly abundant in 2003.  Pike ranged from 14-34 inches and four year classes were represented.  The majority of sampled pike belonged to the 2001 year class, a spring with above normal spring runoff.  Recent years have had below normal spring runoff and have resulted in decreased northern pike reproduction.        Walleye were also moderately abundant in 2003.  The majority of walleye measured 13-16 inches and belonged to the 2001 year class.  Walleye growth was fair.  Considering recent growth, many walleye should measure 18-21 inches by the winter of 2004.     Yellow perch were moderately abundant in 2003, but were considerably less than sampled in 2000.  Most perch sampled in 2000 belonged to the 1999 and 1998 year classes.  Yellow perch appear to have high natural mortality in Marsh Lake and few survive beyond four years of age.  Therefore, few of the fish from the 1999 and 1998 year classes were around to be sampled in 2003.  Yellow perch grow fast in Marsh Lake, and most fish able to survive to age 3 average 10-11 inches.  Stong year classes can and do result in good numbers of quality fish.       Common carp were abundant.  Their numbers remained similar to the 2000 survey, when the gill net catch was the highest recorded for Marsh Lake.  Continued high abundance of carp will negatively impact gamefish populations by degrading habitat.      Twenty-five additional fish species, including low numbers of black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, white bass and white crappie, were sampled during the 2003 assessment.     Fisheries management activities for Marsh Lake include continuing to support and assist efforts of local, state or federal agencies to improve water quality or improve fisheries habitat, annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and fish pressure, annual assessment of young-of-year walleye abundance, stocking as needed, and assessments every third year to evaluate fish populations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Marsh Lake is an impoundment of the Minnesota River approximately three miles southwest of Appleton.  The lake was created in the 1930's by construction of a dam on the Minnesota River near the outlet of the Pomme de Terre River.  Marsh Lake measures 4,500 acres and has a maximum depth of 5 feet.  It frequently suffers from high turbidity due to wave action mixing up its silty bottom.  Although the lake is shallow and nutrient rich, it rarely experiences winterkill likely due to the \"fresh\" water that flows through it from the Minnesota and Pomme de Terre Rivers. <br> \n     Good fishing for walleye and northern pike frequently occurs on the lake, but it has primarily been limited to ice-fishing because numerous boulders and shallow reefs make boating somewhat treacherous, and shallow depths at the boat ramps limit the size of boats that can be launched.  A substantial amount of open water fishing occurs just upstream of the lake on the Minnesota River and at the culverts on the Louisburg grade road.  There is a boat access by the Minnesota River bridge on the grade road.  The bridge and culverts are popular shore angling locations and fishing can be very good when flows are sufficient. <br> \n     Moderate numbers of walleye were present in 2012 representing a wide range of sizes.  Natural reproduction and walleye stocking contribute to the walleye population.  The two strongest walleye year classes that have occurred (2001 and 2011) were produced by natural reproduction.  The northern pike population can be quite variable and it is largely dependent on suitable spring spawning conditions.  During 2012 pike numbers were low.  Additional species that may provide angling opportunities include channel catfish, black bullhead, bigmouth buffalo, common carp, and freshwater drum.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marsh Lake is an impoundment of the Minnesota River approximately three miles southwest of Appleton.  The lake was created in the 1930's by construction of a dam on the Minnesota River near the outlet of the Pomme de Terre River.  Marsh Lake measures 4,500 acres and has a maximum depth of 5 feet.  It frequently suffers from high turbidity due to wave action mixing up its silty bottom.  Although the lake is shallow and nutrient rich, it rarely experiences winterkill likely due to the \"fresh\" water that flows through it from the Minnesota and Pomme de Terre Rivers, and Five Mile Creek. <br> \n <br> \nGood fishing for Walleye and Northern Pike frequently occurs on the lake, but it has primarily been limited to ice fishing because numerous boulders and shallow reefs make boating somewhat treacherous, and shallow depths at the boat ramps limit the size of boats that can be launched.  A substantial amount of open water fishing occurs just upstream of the lake on the Minnesota River and at the culverts on the Louisburg grade road.  There is a boat access by the Minnesota River bridge on the grade road.  The bridge and culverts are popular shore angling locations and fishing can be very good when flows are sufficient. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Walleye were present in 2015.  While many were 15 inches or less, there were still larger fish present.   Natural reproduction and stocking contribute to the Walleye population.  The two strongest Walleye year classes that have occurred (2001 and 2011) were produced by natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population can be quite variable and is largely dependent on suitable spring spawning conditions.  In 2015, pike numbers were moderate.  Several pike over 30 inches were sampled, with the largest measuring 38 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species that may provide angling opportunities include Channel Catfish, Black Bullhead, Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, and White Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Marsh Lake Ecosystem Restoration project will be constructed during 2016 and 2017.  The project is the culmination of years of stakeholder meetings and planning.  Stakeholders included the general public, non-profit environmental organizations, area businesses and government agencies.  Project construction management will be handled by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.  The project goals are to improve fish and wildlife habitat throughout Marsh Lake and adjacent habitats.  Major project features include converting the dam to a rapids, a new control structure to allow for occasional drawdowns of Marsh Lake, and restoration of the Pomme de Terre River to its historic channel.  Anticipated outcomes of the project include improved water quality, increased abundances of desirable aquatic plants, increased fish and wildlife populations, and improved recreational use.   <br> \n</p>",

Primary management was switched to naturally reproducing northern pike in 1991.     Northern pike abundance more than doubled between 1991 and 1994, due mainly to a strong 1993 year class and what appears to be a strong 1994 year class.  Those fish are ranging up to 24 inches, but northerns up to 36 inches were collected.     Although walleye stockings were discontinued after 1988, they have maintained a good, naturally reproducing population.  Most of the walleyes sampled were young of the year fish, ranging from 7 to 9 inches, but 14 to 18 inch fish were also common and individuals up to 23 inches were collected.     Yellow perch abundance was over seven times the normal range for similar lakes, with particularly strong 1992 and 1993 year classes that ranged from 5 to 11 inches.  Over 30% of the perch sampled in gill nets were 8 inches or larger.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marsh Lake is an impoundment of the Minnesota River that was built in the late 1930\u0019s.  It has an area of 4500 acres, a mean depth of 3 feet, and a maximum depth of 5 feet.  Its large size and shallow water offer the lake to high winds and constant stirring of sediment into the water column.  Ultimately, the lake has turbid water with clarity less than one foot.  Several game fish species are present in the lake, but angling is largely limited to ice-fishing due to the shallow water and presence of boulders that make boating difficult. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike are moderately abundant in Marsh Lake, with abundance in 2006 similar to 2003.  This abundance is within the normal range for other similar lakes in Minnesota, but much below the Marsh Lake average of 14 pike per gill net.  The lack of suitable spawning habitat is probably a significant factor reducing pike production.  Northern pike averaged 22.9 inches long and 3 lbs., with the largest pike caught measuring 37.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2006 was slightly lower than the 2003 survey, but much higher than 2000 abundance estimates.  One and two-year-old (2004 and 2005 year-classes) fish made up the majority of the fish sampled, with average size being 14.1 inches long and 1.2 lbs.  Ice-fisherman reported decent fishing for walleye during the winter of 2006-2007.  In the spring of 2006, 1.5 million walleye fry were stocked into Marsh Lake.  A stocking study using oxytetracycline (OTC) indicated that 50% of the 2006 walleye year-class was due to stocking and 50% was due to natural reproduction.  Downstream migrations of stocked walleye fry from Big Stone Lake contribute substantially to the walleye population in Marsh Lake.  Therefore, whether or not these stocked walleye and naturally produced walleye are due to downstream migration from Big Stone Lake is not known.  Future assessments will evaluate the survival of these fish.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass abundance in 2006 was much higher than the 2003 survey.  However, the population is primarily age-1 fish and small in size.  Average size was approximately 9 inches and less than half-a-pound. <br> \n  <br> \nOther game fish that were sampled in low abundance were channel catfish, black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch.  Common carp abundance has fluctuated from year-to-year in Marsh Lake.  The abundance in 2006 was within the normal range for Marsh Lake, but much higher than other similar lakes.  Black bullhead abundance appears to have declined since 2003, with no young-of-year black bullheads sampled.  Ten other fish species were encountered in low abundance during sampling. <br> \n</p>",
