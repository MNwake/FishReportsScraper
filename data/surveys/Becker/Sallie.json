                "narrative": "<p>Factors affecting the fish community in Lake Sallie include water quality, weather, fishing pressure, stocking, and fishing regulations.  Improvements in water quality over the past couple of decades have likely been a major factor in the reestablishment of tullibee and the decline in numbers of black bullhead and black crappie.  Recent high water levels have made more northern pike spawning habitat available than would have been with lower water levels.Test net catches of walleye declined from the lake's historic high in 2000 of 26.3 per gill net to 4.3 per net in 2004.  This occurred despite annual stocking of both fry and fingerlings.  The 2004 catch rate is similar to those found in the 1960's through the 1980's when water quality was poorer than at present.  A strong 1997 year class was responsible for the majority of the walleye sampled in 2000.  This year class was also the most numerous in the catch in 2004.  It is possible that the current high abundance of relatively large northern pike may be at least partially responsible for the decline in Lake Sallie walleyes.Northern pike 24 inches or greater in length have been protected from harvest by an experimental regulation since 1996.  This regulation was intended to allow more pike to survive to larger sizes and to reduce the number of small pike.  Eight years after the beginning of the regulation, at least one of those expectations was met.  The number of pike larger than 24 inches was 15.0 per test net in 2004.  In six surveys before the regulation started, the average number of pike over 24 inches was 1.0 per net and the number never exceeded 2.0 per net.  Also, the average length of sampled pike before the regulation was 20.6 inches while the average length of pike sampled in 2004 was 25.4 inches.  Although current pike catches are high and the numbers of pike less than 24 inches per net were near the historical average, the portion of small pike in the catch has never been as low as it was in 2004, when just 28% of northern pike sampled were less than 24 inches long.  Before the regulation, small pike averaged 80% of population sample in Lake Sallie.Other fish species sampled in 2004 included tullibee (cisco) which are a biological indicator of improved water quality in the lake.  The yellow perch population appears to be sustaining itself despite high numbers of northern pike.  Bluegill net catches increased to the highest level ever recorded for Lake Sallie at 67.8 per trap net.  These sunfish tended to be small, however, with an average length of 5.3 inches.  Very few bluegills longer than seven inches were sampled.  Black crappies are present in modest numbers and they tend to be either very small (about five inches) or quite large (about 12 inches).  Good numbers of largemouth bass were found.Decisions will be made during the coming year whether to continue, modify, or drop the experimental northern pike regulation.  Public input will be an important part of this process and is invited through letters, phone calls, visits, or the public hearings that will be conducted during late summer, 2005.  The regulation appears to have been effective at providing larger pike and reducing smaller pike.  Dropping the regulation outright would likely lead to rapid harvest of the currently protected size pike and eventual return to large numbers of small pike typical of most area lakes.  Anglers must decide whether the ability to catch large pike and maintain a healthy fish community is worth the trade-off of harvesting only fish less than 24 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Factors affecting the fish community in Lake Sallie include water quality, weather, fishing pressure, stocking, and fishing regulations.  Improvements in water quality over the past few decades have likely been a major factor in the reestablishment of Tullibee and the decline in numbers of Black Bullhead and Black Crappie.  Recent high water levels have made more Northern Pike spawning habitat available than would have been with lower water levels. <br> \n <br> \nTest net catches of Walleye increased to the second highest in history at 20.9 Walleyes per net in 2014.  A couple of moderately strong year classes have recently entered the Walleye fishery and a couple of others are poised to recruit to the fishery in the next two to four years.  The average size of sampled Walleye was 15.2 inches in length and 1.3 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nMost Northern Pike 24 inches or greater in length have been protected from harvest by an experimental regulation since 1996.  Harvest of one pike over 36 inches has been allowed since 2011.  This regulation was intended to allow more pike to survive to larger sizes and to reduce the number of small pike.  Eighteen years after the beginning of the regulation, both of those expectations appear to have been met.  The number of pike larger than 24 inches was 6.3 per test net in 2014.  In six surveys before the regulation started, the average number of pike over 24 inches was 1.0 per net and the number never exceeded 2.0 per net.  Also, the average length of sampled pike before the regulation was 20.6 inches while the average length of pike sampled in 2014 was 26.7 inches. Northern Pike catch rates and the portions of small pike have remained below the lake's historical average during the past 10 years.  Before the regulation, small pike averaged 80% of the population sample in Lake Sallie. Following the regulation, small pike averaged just 26% of the population.  This may indicate that large pike have begun to act as a control on the numbers of small pike in the lake.  A single Muskellunge was sampled for the first time during the 2009 survey and there is evidence that a fishable population exists, thus the immigrant Muskellunge from upstream Detroit Lake may also be helping to keep the numbers of small pike lower. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in 2014 included Tullibee (Cisco) which are a biological indicator of improved water quality in the lake.  Lake Sallie was reported to be regularly targeted for Tullibee netting in the 1950's and earlier years.  No Tullibees were caught during four assessments from the 1960's through the mid 1980's.  Since 1989 however, Tullibees have been sampled in each of the six assessments. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population appears to be sustaining itself although catch rates were near the historic low in 2014.  Bluegill net catches increased to a level higher than the lakes historical average.  These sunfish averaged 5.9 inches, though fish over eight inches were present.  Black Crappies are present in modest numbers and they tend to be around 10 inches in length with a few up to 14 inches found.  Good numbers of Largemouth Bass were found. <br> \n <br> \nAfter much public input and fish data analysis, the experimental Northern Pike regulation was changed slightly in 2011.  The former experimental regulation required the release of all pike 24 inches or larger.  The current special regulation requires the release of all pike between 24 and 36 inches with the allowed harvest of one over 36 inches in the total bag limit of three pike.  The regulation appears to have been effective at providing larger pike and reducing smaller pike.  This regulation will continue to be evaluated during regular mid-summer lake surveys.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish populations in Lake Sallie are very dynamic and fluctuations have been magnified by several factors     including (1) weather patterns and water levels affecting natural spawning habitat, (2)improved water quality     due to changes in the Detroit Lakes sewage treatment facility, (3) commercial and state bullhead removal, (4)     annual walleye stocking and egg take operations, and (5) fishing pressure, especially during the early and mid     eighties.  It is well recognized by local anglers that black crappie, bluegill, and northern pike populations     are down considerably from levels during the 1980s.  However, it is also clear that walleye and tullibee     populations are up markedly from levels during that period.      Those fish population trends would tend to indicate improving water quality in Lake Sallie, but, there     are many more influences than just water quality.  Crappie are known to do well in relatively turbid water.      Statewide evidence indicates that abundant crappie may also suppress walleye numbers, as during the    seventies and eighties.  Theoretically, improving water quality in Lake Sallie may have favored both walleye and     tullibee populations while working against black crappie.      Walleye abundance has increased from the low end of the \"normal\" range for similar lakes to well above     the normal range. Numbers are currently higher than during any survey since 1954.  Average weight is a healthy     1.7 lbs.  All of the eight most recent year classes were represented in the sample, but, the 1989 year class     was exceptionally strong.  Growth rates are good for both walleye and northern pike due to the very strong     yellow perch population.      Northern pike abundance has probably been most affected by spawning conditions.  High water levels tend     to increase the amount of pike spawning habitat.  It is believed that is what occurred during the eighties,     causing an abnormal rise in Lake Sallie's northern pike population.  Pike abundance has now returned to the     low end of the \"normal\" range, as it was previous to the 1984 survey.  Large numbers of yearling pike were     captured at the walleye spawntaking site during spring 1995 and may indicate a future increase in the number     of catchable northerns.        Bluegill numbers are believed to be repressed by yellow perch and bullhead.  All three species of     bullhead as well as yellow perch are increasing in number while bluegill are decreasing.      Low bluegill abundance is just one more reason to protect even more vigorously the remaining bulrush     stands on the lake.  Bulrush are valuable not only for erosion protection, water quality improvement, and     waterfowl habitat, but also for fish habitat, i.e. spawning, rearing, feeding, and cover.      Another vegetation species of concern is the non-native flowering rush, which has now migrated downstream     from Detroit Lake into both Lakes Sallie and Melissa.  Cooperative efforts between the Pelican River Watershed     District and the DNR's Ecological Services Section to control flowering rush are underway.  Flowering rush has     been a nuisance in certain areas.  There are no documented impacts of flowering rush on fish communities.      However, if bulrushes or other beneficial plants are displaced by this non-native species, there is potential     for detrimental impacts on fish.  The tendency for flowering rush, as well as other exotics, is to move into     disturbed areas where native vegetation has already been removed rather than to invade healthy stands of     native plants.      In summary, Lake Sallie's fish populations are constantly changing even more dramatically than in many     area lakes and the changes have several causes.  During the past fifteen years, the fishery has shifted from a     northern pike/panfish fishery to a walleye fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in Lake Sallie has undergone significant changes over the past half century.  And yet, in some ways the fishery appears to be closer now to what it originally was than at any time in recent history.  Test netting in 1949 showed abundant walleye and yellow perch with relatively low to moderate numbers of northern pike, bullheads, and panfish.  During the 1960s through the 1980s, black bullheads, black crappies, and northern pike dominated the Lake Sallie fish community.While there have been many factors affecting fish populations in the lake, water quality is believed to be a major one in the fish species shifts.  Black bullhead and black crappie, in particular, are known to be favored by more fertile, turbid water conditions (like those in the 1970s).  Improvement in incoming water quality appears to have benefitted walleye and tullibee (cisco) populations.Test net catches of walleye were higher in 2000 (26.3 walleyes per net) than any time since test netting began in 1949.  With the increase in abundance, average walleye size was down, however.  Ten to thirteen inch walleyes were most numerous.  They reflected the strong three-year-old age group.  This bodes well for walleye angling in Sallie in the near future.Northern pike also increased in abundance since the 1994 survey.  Net catches in 2000 (11.8 pike per net) were above the historical average for the lake (9.0 per net) but not as high as catches during the 1980s.  Northern pike also increased in average size to 24.8 inches (3.8 pounds).This is evidence that the most recent northern pike experimental regulation in effect on Lakes Sallie and Melissa may be having an impact.  The regulation, which began in 1996, calls for the immediate release of all northern pike larger than 24 inches.  This regulation was intended to increase the portion of large pike (which had all but disappeared from the lake) and will continue through 2006.  At that time it will either coninue as a special regulation, or be modified or dropped altogether, depending on its success and public support.Despite increased northern pike and walleye populations, yellow perch (preferred forage for both of these species) numbers remained above average.  Largemouth bass catches also were higher than normal while black crappie and bluegill catches increased from very low abundances in 1994 to levels within the normal range for similarly classified lakes.In summary, popular gamefish populations appear to be reverting to early century status with continued improvements to incoming water quality.  Other stewardship efforts in which watershed dwellers, lake users, and lakeshore dwellers can participate include: (1) adhering to fishing regulations (in particular, the experimental northern pike regulation now in effect), (2) following practices outlined in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property, (3) not fertilizing or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4) leaving aquatic vegetation intact, especially bulrush and cattail stands which are so beneficial to the lake, (5) continuing active participation in the lake association, and (6) leaving as much \"natural\" as possible on your shoreland lot.  Buffer zones along the shore are particularly helpful in preventing erosion and sedimentation.  With efforts like these and voluntary catch and release fishing, good angling can continue into the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of near shore fish species was conducted on July 25 and 26, 2016 by IBI Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 18 sampling stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 16 stations and a 15-foot seine was used at 2 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured a diverse suite of species (22), including several that are intolerant of excessive shoreline disturbance and/or poor water quality and that rely on vegetated areas (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, and Weed Shiner) as well as several that are very tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from a 2014 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for Sallie Lake is near an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes.  Watershed and shoreline land use disturbances are at levels where we often see impacts to the fish community.  Sallie Lake has a large contributing watershed, including approximately 91 square miles.  About 41% of the contributing land use is disturbed (29% cultivated and 12% urban development).  A Score the Shore Shoreline habitat assessment was also completed in 2016 and resulted in an average site score of 66 out of 100. The average score for developed sites (56) was significantly lower than the average score for undeveloped sites (99). <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Sallie Lake is located in the Otter Tail River Watershed.   <br> \n</p>",

Abundance is lower than local average; predation and competition probably account for the inverse relationship between walleye and northern pike numbers caught.  Bluegill and black crappie populations are above average in abundance with good growth.  The yellow perch forage base remains high in number at over three times the local median.</p>",

There are also four other smaller inlets.Shoal water soils consist primarily of sand, with some gravel also present.Shoreline development is quite extensive, with all, except portions of the east and northwest shorelines being built up.Submerged aquatic vegetation was moderately abundant and filamentous algae was present in a thick dense mat in the shallows along most of the shoreline.  There was also a blue-green algal bloom which caused considerable turbidity of the lake water.  Bulrushes were present in dense stands along the east and northwest shorelines.As compared with the statewide figures, the test net catches of common suckers, northern pike, yellow perch, walleyes, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish and black crappies were all somewhat above average.  The catches of largemouth bass and bluegills were below average and the bullhead catch was extremely above average.Spawning conditions were evaluated as fair to poor for northern pike and fair for walleyes, largemouth bass and panfish.  The dense mat of filamentous algae covering the shoal bottom and considerable bullhead activity along the shoreline during the spawning period have been very deterimental to centrarchid spawning.  No young-of-the-year centrarchids were taken by the shoreline seining during the survey.Lake Sallie had a history as one of the best all around fishing lakes in northwest Minnesota.  Except for excellent winter crappie angling, fishing success has fallen off considerably in recent years.  This can be largely attributed to the weed and algae conditions.Lake Sallie is the site of a study now underway, to attempt to find a method of controlling aquatic plant growth in the lake by lowering the chemical nutrient through the removal of rooted aquatic vegetation.This study is being conducted under the auspices of the U.S. Water Quality Laboratory in Corvallis, Oregon.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Factors affecting the fish community in Lake Sallie include water quality, weather, fishing pressure, stocking, and fishing regulations.  Improvements in water quality over the past couple of decades have likely been a major factor in the reestablishment of tullibee and the decline in numbers of black bullhead and black crappie.  Recent high water levels have made more northern pike spawning habitat available than would have been with lower water levels. <br> \n <br> \nTest net catches of walleye increased from a relatively low level of 4.3 per net in 2004 to a more typical 9.3 walleyes per net in 2009.  A strong 2004 year class was found and all but one of the past 12 year classes were represented in the sample.  The average size of sampled walleye was 15.9 inches in length and 1.8 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike 24 inches or greater in length have been protected from harvest by an experimental regulation since 1996.  This regulation was intended to allow more pike to survive to larger sizes and to reduce the number of small pike.  Thirteen years after the beginning of the regulation, both of those expectations appear to have been met.  The number of pike larger than 24 inches was 5.4 per test net in 2009.  In six surveys before the regulation started, the average number of pike over 24 inches was 1.0 per net and the number never exceeded 2.0 per net.  Also, the average length of sampled pike before the regulation was 20.6 inches while the average length of pike sampled in 2009 was 29.5 inches. Northern pike catch rates have declined during the past five years and the portion of small pike in the catch has never been as low as it was in 2009, when just 6% of northern pike sampled were less than 24 inches long.  Before the regulation, small pike averaged 80% of the population sample in Lake Sallie.  This may indicate that large pike have begun to act as a control on the numbers of small pike in the lake.  A single muskellunge was sampled for the first time during the 2009 survey and there is evidence that a fishable population exists, thus the immigrant muskellunge may also be helping to keep the numbers of small pike lower. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in 2009 included tullibee (cisco) which are a biological indicator of improved water quality in the lake.  Lake Sallie was reported to be regularly targeted for tullibee netting in the 1950's and earlier years.  The attached catch rate tables show that no tullibees were caught during four assessments from the 1960's through the mid 1980's.  Since 1989 however, tullibees have been sampled in each of the five assessments. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population appears to be sustaining itself although catch rates were at the historic low in 2009.  Bluegill net catches declined from the highest level ever recorded for Lake Sallie in 2004 to a more typical level.  These sunfish were also somewhat larger with an average length of 6.5 inches.  Approximately half the bluegills sampled were between 7.0 and 8.5 inches in length.  Black crappies are present in modest numbers and they tend to be larger than 10 inches.  Good numbers of largemouth bass were found. <br> \n <br> \nDecisions will be made in 2010 whether to continue, modify, or drop the experimental northern pike regulation.  Public input will be an important part of this process and is invited through letters, phone calls, visits, or the public hearings that will be conducted during late summer. The regulation appears to have been effective at providing larger pike and reducing smaller pike.  Dropping the regulation outright would likely lead to rapid harvest of the currently protected size pike and eventual return to large numbers of small pike typical of most area lakes.  Anglers must decide whether the ability to catch large pike is worth the sacrifice inherent in any special regulation.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sallie is a 1,280 acre lake southwest of Detroit Lakes, Minnesota.  It is a popular fishing lake, especially known for Walleyes and Northern Pike.  A public access is on the northeast side of the lake, and a fishing pier and Aquatic Management Area provide public recreation opportunities.  A Special Regulation for Northern Pike is in place for Lake Sallie.  It requires that all pike from 24-36 inches be immediately released, a possession limit of three fish, and only one pike over 36 inches allowed.    Lake Sallie contains Zebra Mussels, Chinese Mystery Snails, and Flowering Rush - all recognized as Aquatic Invasive Species.  A standard survey using gill nets, trap nets, and electrofishing was completed in July 2019 to assess the fish population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were more abundant than past surveys and had a great size distribution.  The average length of Northern Pike sampled was 26 inches and had an average weight of nearly 4 pounds.  The Special Regulation for Northern Pike in place at Lake Sallie has increased the number of large Northern Pike, as over 73% of pike sampled in 2019 were longer than 24 inches.  The number of small pike has decreased over time due to the regulation as well.  In 2019, only 5% of pike sampled were less than 20 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was slightly lower in 2019 than the past survey completed in 2014, but still higher than average.  Walleyes had a mean length of 16.9 inches and a mean weight of 1.8 pounds.  Fortunately, fish from multiple age classes were found, as Lake Sallie is the source of Walleye eggs for the Detroit Lakes DNR fish hatchery.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2019, Bluegill abundance was higher than average.  Bluegill ranged in size from less than one inch to over eight inches in length, and had an overall average length of 3.2 inches.  Other sunfish species sampled included hybrid sunfish and Pumpkinseed.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Black Crappies are popular fishing targets in Lake Sallie, especially in the spring.  Bass up to 18.1 inches were sampled during this assessment, and crappies up to 13.3 inches were also captured. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are present in Lake Sallie, despite their decline in other area lakes.  Average length of Tullibees measured in 2019 was 12.5 inches.  Lake Sallie is open during the Tullibee netting season. <br> \n <br> \nYellow, Brown, and Black Bullheads are all present in Lake Sallie.  The mean length of all bullheads was near 11 inches.  Commercial harvest of bullheads once occurred in Lake Sallie, and the size may interest commercial operations in the future.    <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled included Bowfin, White Sucker, and Rock Bass.  No Muskellunge were sampled during this assessment, although they are known to inhabit Lake Sallie, as they have migrated downstream from Detroit Lake.  Lake Sturgeon are also present in Lake Sallie, as they have also migrated downstream from Lake Detroit, though none were sampled in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nThe data from this 2019 fish survey will be combined with other assessments, including a shoreline habitat evaluation and a near-shore fish community assessment, to contribute to an overall watershed health evaluation.</p>",
