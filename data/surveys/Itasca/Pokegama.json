                "narrative": "<p>According to the historical netting summary, walleye catch rates have increased since 1979, with the present catch rate (7.1 fish/gill net) at an all time high.  Walleye had a PSD value of 60.  Approximately 95% of the fish aged were from years when walleye fingerlings were stocked.  Growth rates for most ages were above statewide means.The northern pike abundance has remained relatively stable.  The current gillnet catch rate (5.3 fish/net) was within the historical range (4.1 to 6.9 fish/gillnet).  Northern pike had a PSD value of 51.  Growth rates for most year classes were above statewide averages.Smallmouth bass were sampled more frequently (1.3 fish/gillnet) in this assessment than previous study.  Smallmouth bass had a PSD value of 81.  Fish from age 2 to age 5 were sampled, with growth above statewide averages for most year classes. The yellow perch catch rate (13.2 fish/gillnet) was near the low end of the historical range (11.8 to 33.8 fish/gillnet).  Yellow perch had a PSD value of 13.This was the first summer test netting in which rainbow smelt were captured with 250 ft experimental gillnets.  Two gillnets were set below the thermocline and caught 10 smelt.  These nets also caught 36 tullibees and seven lake whitefish.  Although 15,600 lake trout were stocked in 1985 none were sampled.  However, lake trout have been reported to be caught by anglers in 1990.Bluegill growth was slightly below statewide averages while black crappie and largemouth age classes had mean back-calculated lengths that were similar or above statewide averages.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake has always supported healthy populations of walleye, northern pike and smallmouth bass.  Testnetting results from this assessment seem to indicate that abundance of these species is good.     The walleye gill net catch rate is the highest on record for Pokegama Lake but is still within the expected range for this type of lake.  The mean size of the fish was fairly large (19.1 inches; 2.8 pounds).  Growth of walleye appears to be good.  More walleye were sampled from stocked than from non-stocked years.       Northern pike were sampled at a rate within the expected range.  Northern pike were sampled ranging from 11.3 to 35.9 inces in length.  Growth rates appear to be good.     Smallmouth bass were sampled in gill nets at a rate within the expected range.  These bass were of good average size (15.0 inches; 1.3 pounds).  Smallmouth bass sampled electrofishing had a mean weight of 1.5 pounds.  Growth of smallmouth also appears good.       Largemouth bass were sampled at low rates.  However, the largemouth bass captured electrofishing were fairly large (12.2 - 18.7 inches).  Growth of largemouth bass appears good.     Bluegill were sampled in the trap nets at a rate considerably higher than past assessments.  There is no obvious explanation for this apparent increase in abundance.  These fish ranged from 3.9 to 8.4 inches in length.  Growth of bluegill in Pokegama Lake appears to be slow.     Yellow perch were sampled at a rate slightly above the expected range and at the highest rate yet observed.     Black crappie catch rates were low in both trap and gill nets but this has historically been the case.     Tullibee catch rates have been falling over the years and were lowest in this assessment.  Tullibee catch rates typically do vary a lot, but this apparent decline in abundance does raise the concern that competition with smelt could be harming the population.     Other species sampled in this assessment include; bowfin, brown and yellow bullhead, lake whitefish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker and smelt.     Pokegama Lake is one of the better fishing lakes and one of the more heavily used lakes in an area with a wealth of lakes.  Continued attempts by lakeshore owners and users to protect lakeshore habitat, in lake habitat and water quality through wise use practices can insure that Pokegama Lake will remain an outstanding resource.  Wise use of the resource can also be practiced by anglers by releasing some of the fish they catch. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake is a large (6,612 acre) lake located 5 miles southwest of Grand Rapids.  The lake has seven public accesses and is highly developed.  Primary fish species include walleye and northern pike as well as largemouth and smallmouth bass.  Pokegama Lake is connected to the Mississippi River and an Army Corps of Engineers dam controls water levels.Gill net catch rates for northern pike have been increasing in recent assessments, but appear to have leveled off.  The catch rate in 2005 was 7.6/net, which was similar to the last two assessments and the upper end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Fish varied from 10 to 28 inches and had a mean length of 20.5 inches.  Size structure was poor with few fish over 24 inches and no fish exceeding 30 inches.  Pokegama Lake has some key characteristics such as a good prey base and a cool water refuge to produce large northern pike.  However, size structure has been poor in recent assessments and may be a sign that larger northern pike are overharvested.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 25 inches by age six.Walleye gill net catch rate declined from previous assessments to 5.5/gill net.  Catch rates in 1995 and 2000 were 10.8 and 6.7/net, respectively.  Eight-year classes were determined from scale analysis with fish from one to nine years old.  The 2001-year class was especially strong representing 61% of the walleye sampled.  Size structure was excellent with many fish over 16 inches and fish up to 27 inches sampled.  Growth was fast with fish averaging 17 inches by age four.  Walleye stocking has recently increased from 0.5 lbs/littoral acre every other year to 1 lb/littoral acre annually.  Whether increased stocking will result in greater gill net catch rates will be determined in the next assessment.  Largemouth bass and smallmouth bass were sampled by electrofishing in the spring of 2005.  Largemouth bass catch rate was 55.6/hour, which was higher than two previous assessments and indicated an abundant population.  Size structure was moderate to poor for largemouth bass with few fish over 15 inches.  Size structure was good in previous assessments and the poor size structure in 2005 is likely due to the timing of the electrofishing assessment rather than an actual decline in size structure.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 14 inches by age six.  The smallmouth bass catch rate was 4.2/hour, which was lower than the 2000 assessment, but similar to the 1995 assessment.  High winds and waves likely reduced the smallmouth bass catch rate in 2005.  Smallmouth bass size structure was good with fish up to 18 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 15 inches by age four.Bluegill trap net catch rates have been increasing in recent assessments, but appear to have leveled off.  The catch rate in 2005 was 12.9/net, which was similar to the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with few fish reaching 8 inches.  Black crappie catch rates have generally been low in past assessments and were 0.3/gill net and 0.4/trap net in 2005.  Black crappie are likely concentrated in localized areas and are likely not sampled well in our assessment gears.  Size structure was good with fish up to 11 inches sampled.Other species sampled include black bullhead, bowfin, lake whitefish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rainbow smelt, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, tullibee, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by practicing selective harvest.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake is large, sprawling lake near Grand Rapids, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  Pokegama Lake has six small inlets, and outlets to the Mississippi River, where the US Army Corp controls water levels at the Pokegama Dam.  The lake has a surface area of 6,612 acres at normal pool, a littoral area of 1,978 acres and a maximum depth of 112 feet.  Pokegama is deep and clear.  The Secchi disk transparency during the June 2010 assessment was 15 feet in the main basin, indicating good water clarity.  Much of the lakeshore has been developed for residential housing.  Multiple public accesses can be found around the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nSeveral invasive species are present and may impact the fisheries.  Rusty crayfish were first documented in 1988 when they were observed by scuba divers.  The survey crews reported fair number of rusty crayfish in some gill nets in the past three assessments.  The impacts of rusty crayfish in Pokegama are not known.  Rainbow smelt were illegally introduced in the 1980s and appear to have impacted the fishery as total fish weight per net has increased substantially since smelt were discovered.  Rainbow smelt may benefit the fishery by providing an additional prey species but could also limit the fishery by disrupting food webs and competing with or preying on native species.  Anglers should be reminded that it is illegal and unwise to stock fish without a DNR permit.  Rainbow smelt are illegal to use as bait unless being purchase from a DNR approved vendor. <br> \n <br> \nFish stocking is part of the management of Pokegama Lake.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked annually at a rate of 1 pound per littoral acre.  Surplus lake trout are stocked when available to provide bonus angling opportunities.  Muskellunge were stocked in 2008 and 2010 to provide additional angling opportunities.  There are no special or experimental regulations on Pokegama Lake but statewide seasons and limits apply. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan (LMP) for Pokegama Lake was last revised in 2006.  Walleye and northern pike were the primary management species and largemouth and smallmouth bass were the secondary management species.  The long range goals of the plan were to improve the walleye gill-net catch to 11.0 per gill net and reduce the northern pike gill-net catch to 5.0/net.  Other goals included: improving the proportion of quality sized pike (> 21 inches) to over 65% and preferred sized pike (>28 inches) to over 20%, maintaining largemouth and smallmouth bass electrofishing rates at 35 and 15 per hour of electrofishing, maintaining memorable size of smallmouth bass with 15% of the sample exceeding 17 inches, and improving the largemouth bass size structure so 5% exceed the memorable size of 20 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAssessment Results <br> \n <br> \nA fisheries population assessment was conducted in 2010 on Pokegama Lake in Itasca County to assess the status of the fish community.  Electrofishing was conducted in early June to assess the bass populations.  Test netting included 15 gill net and 15 trap net sets and was conducted in June and July.   <br> \n <br> \nBoth largemouth and smallmouth bass were relatively abundant as a total of 53 largemouth bass and 39 smallmouth bass were sampled by electrofishing resulting in catch rates of 34 largemouth bass per hour and 25 smallmouth bass per hour.  The largemouth catch was near the 2006 LMP goal and the smallmouth catch exceeded the goal.  Both populations had quality size structures, but neither met the LMP goal for producing memorial sized bass.  Size structure can be highly variable and it is probable that larger fish were present but were not in shallow water during the electrofishing assessment.  Sampled largemouth bass averaged 12.5 inches and the largest individual exceeded 18 inches.  Growth was average with individuals exceeding 12 inches by age 5 and 15 inches by age 7.  Smallmouth bass were generally smaller, averaging 11.5 inches and the largest individual exceeded 15 inches.  Growth was somewhat slow, as individuals exceeded 12 inches in 5 years.  Given the relative abundance and size structure, good angling opportunities exist for these species. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were the most common species in the gill net catch.  The catch was within the expected range when compared to similar lakes and above average for Pokegama Lake.  Size structure was poor as few individuals achieved a desirable size for anglers.  Angler interest is likely low due to the poor size structure but yellow perch are an important prey species in Pokegama Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the second most common species captured in the gill net sample.  The catch rate and size structure goals from the 2006 LMP were not met as the catch rate was high compared to similar lakes and was the highest on record for Pokegama Lake.  Northern pike from the gill net catch averaged 20.3 inches and the largest individual exceeded 34 inches.  Few individuals exceeded the preferred size of 28 inches.  Most pike were relatively young, as the average age was 3.1 years.  Only 22% of the sampled pike were age-5 or older, suggesting high mortality of older, larger fish.  Growth was relatively fast, and individuals typically exceeded 21 inches in 3 years and 28 inches in 7 years.  The pike population appears to have increased in Pokegama Lake over time.  The increased catch rate could signal future declines in the production of large pike.  Average size is typically small and growth is poor when northern pike occur at high density.  Anglers should be encouraged to harvest small northern pike and release pike over 22 inches to help improve the size structure.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were captured at a rate of 8.2/gill net, which is within the expected range for the lake type and above average for Pokegama Lake.  The catch was below the 2006 LMP goal of 11/gill net but that goal was rather ambitious given the lakes historical catch rates and the fact that similar lakes rarely produce catches over 10/gill net.  The walleye population was dominated by relatively large fish as walleye averaged 19.4 inches and walleye up to 29 inches were sampled.  Size structure was favorable, indicating excellent angler opportunity to catch large walleye.  Age analysis identified 15 year classes.  The age distribution was well balanced as walleye average 5.8 years of age.  The oldest individual sampled was 19 years old.  Growth was near the statewide average with individuals typically exceeding 15 inches in 4 years and 20 inches in 7 years.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most common fish in the trap nets.  Bluegill catches have increased in recent years and the current catch rate was average compared to similar lakes and the highest trap net catch recorded for Pokegama Lake.  Size structure was modest as bluegill averaged 6.1 inches.  Some large bluegills were present, as individuals exceeding 9 inches were captured.  Age analysis identified 9 year classes (ages 2-10).  The age distribution was well balanced as bluegill averaged 5.4 years of age.  Growth was average compared to similar lakes, with individuals typically exceeding 6 inches in 6 years.  Given the abundance and size structure, moderate angling opportunities exist. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were captured at a low rate compared to similar lakes and below the historical mean for Pokegama Lake.  Tullibee catches have varied among assessments but have generally declined since the 1980s.  Above average temperatures during the last decade and the introduction of rainbow smelt are likely linked to the apparent decline.  It should be noted, however, that tullibee are difficult to sample due to their pelagic nature and summer gill net catches may not represent actual population trends.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included black crappie, bowfin, brown and yellow bullheads, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, silver redhorse, white sucker, green sunfish, and golden shiners. <br> \n <br> \nThe protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake has a naturalized population of rainbow smelt first documented in the mid 1980's.  An annual spawning run occurs in Sugar Brook at the west end of the lake.  Smelt assessments using small mesh gill-nets have been conducted several times since then to monitor relative abundance of the population.  Early assessments used a variety of small-mesh nets, but nets and locations have been standardized since 1995.  Catch rates for smelt should be viewed cautiously since their pelagic, schooling behavior leads to variable catches. <br> \nIn fall 2011, five smelt were captured for a catch rate of 0.4/net.  This is the lowest catch rate recorded in any assessment since netting was standardized in 1995.  Catch rates in the four previous assessments ranged from 17.2 to 99/net, with a catch of 31.4/net recorded in 2010.  A widespread smelt die-off in Pokegama Lake was reported to the area fisheries office in July 2011.  Samples of dead smelt were sent to the DNR fish pathology lab for testing, with no conclusive cause for the die-off discovered.  The large drop in net catches from 2010 to 2011 is likely representative of a true decline in the adult smelt population in Pokegama Lake.  Long-term effects of the die-off on the smelt population and the rest of the fish community remain to be seen.  The spring spawning run in Sugar Brook could be monitored in 2012 to gather additional information on the status of the smelt population.  The next lake population assessment/smelt assessment is scheduled for 2015. <br> \nAdditional species sampled included black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, mottled sculpin, northern pike, rock bass, smallmouth bass, spottail shiner, trout perch, walleye, yellow bullhead and yellow perch.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake is located next to Grand Rapids, Minnesota.   The lake has seven public accesses and is highly developed.  The 2011 lake management plan (LMP) indicates Walleye, Muskellunge and Northern Pike as the primary species of management with Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass as secondary species.  The LMP goals include maintaining the Walleye gill-net catch greater than 8.0/net; reduce the Northern Pike gill-net catch to 5.0/net with 50% of the fish exceeding 21 inches and having 34 plus inch fish present; maintain Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass electrofishing catch rates at 35 and 15 per hour; and provide Muskellunge fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in July of 2015 to assess the fish community.  A total of 15 gill nets and 15 trap nets were used in the survey as well as spring night electrofishing for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass.  Catch rates were likely lower than normal during the week of netting because of the extreme wind that even rolled some gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have fluctuated from 1.6 to 10.8 fish/gill net since 1949.  The Walleye gill-net catch declined from 8.2 fish/net in 2010 to 4.7 fish/net in 2015.  The catch fell short of the ambitious management goal of 8.0 fish/net but was within the normal range for the lake class.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.8 to 28.7 inches and averaged 17.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPast evaluations determined Walleye natural reproduction was sporadic in Pokegama Lake.  It appears that large, deep lakes do not warm fast enough to produce sufficient food for fry to survive.  Walleye fingerlings can often be an effective management tool in these types of lakes where fry and natural reproduction have not been successful.  The 2015 survey evaluated a period in which Walleye were stocked annually since 2004.  Twelve age-classes from age 1 to 12 were identified.  Walleye averaged 16.4 inches after four years of growth, which was similar to the statewide averages. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are not sampled well with standard summer surveys because they exist in very low numbers.  Spring surveys are used to evaluate adult Muskellunge populations because the fish concentrate in the shallows for spawning.  Spring surveys have not been used to sample Muskellunge on Pokegama Lake yet because the population is still developing.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catch rates have ranged from 4.1 to 10.6 fish/net since 1949.  The catch rates have been increasing and the last two were the highest on record.  The catch was 9.8 fish/gill net in 2015.  The catch did not meet the LMP goal but the size structure goals were minimally met.  Northern Pike ranged from 9.8 to 38.8 inches and averaged 21.6 inches.  Nine age-classes were identified with fish from age 1 to age 9 present.  Three and four year old fish represented 60% of the sample.  Growth was similar to or better than statewide averages for all ages.  Northern Pike averaged 23.7 inches after four years of growth.  The Northern Pike population shows some signs of quality overharvest because of the increasing catch rates and the low number of fish over 24 inches in the size distribution. <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled with spring night electrofishing for the fifth time since 1995.   Electrofishing catches have ranged from 3.7 to 55.6/hr.  In 2015, the catch was 32.4/hr which achieved the LMP goal.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.6 to 19.2 inches and averaged 12.0 inches.  Nine age-classes were identified from scales with fish from age 2 to 10 present.  Two to four year old fish represented 67% of the sample.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages.    <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass were also sampled with spring night electrofishing in 2015.  The LMP goal was achieved with a catch of 18.0 fish/hr on-time.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.3 to 18.7 inches and averaged 13.2 inches.  Five age-classes were identified with fish from age 3 to age 9 were present.  Growth was similar to the statewide average through age 4 and slower for older fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are often difficult to sample during summer surveys because they frequently suspend in areas where the nets do not fish.  Consequently, catch rates have always been low and likely do not reflect the population well.  The gill net and trap net sampled fish ranged from 4.2 to 14.2 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected during the summer survey. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates have been trending up since 1975 when only 0.5 fish/trap net were captured.  The highest catch (31.1 fish/trap net) occurred in 2010.  In 2015, the catch was 17.8 fish/trap net.  The sampled fish ranged from 3.0 to 8.4 inches and averaged 5.2 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected during the summer survey. <br> \n <br> \nTullibees are difficult to sample with our standard summer nets because they frequently school in the open water where our nets are not effective.   Catch rates on Pokegama Lake have ranged from 0 to 8.2 fish/gill net but have not been above 0.5/gill since 1984.  The lower catches in recent surveys correspond to the illegal introduction and expansion of Rainbow Smelt before 1984.  Rainbow Smelt have been documented to have a negative effect on Tullibee populations.  The catch of 0.1 in 2015 was low for lakes like Pokegama.  The two sampled fish were 19.3 and 20.0 inches.  Some Tullibee were noted in Walleye stomachs. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates have fluctuated from 4.8 to 43.7 fish/gill net since 1949.  The 2015 catch was the lowest on record.  The Rainbow Smelt die-off during the summer of 2011 likely shifted additional predation towards Yellow Perch.  It appears the additional predation reduced Yellow Perch recruitment, resulting in the lower catches.  Yellow Perch numbers may already be improving based on the fall small-mesh gill-net catches in 2015.  The Yellow Perch during the summer ranged from 5.2 to 10.9 inches and averaged 6.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the survey included Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rainbow Smelt, Rock Bass, Silver Redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

Fall, night electrofishing was conducted to sample young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye to evaluate natural reproduction and year-class strength.  A Smith-Root GPP 5.0 electrofishing boat equipped with a spider array anode using pulsed DC current operating at 5 amps and 200 volts was used for the survey.  Sampling occurred on 10/4/2010 with a water conductivity of 254 S/cm and a temperature of 54 degrees F.  Visibility was rated moderate to good among the stations sampled.  This was the third formal assessment using night electrofishing targeting age-0 walleye since 2005. <br> \n <br> \nFive of the seven established stations were sampled; windy conditions prevented the completion of the other two.  No age-0 walleye were sampled in this assessment, similar to the 2005 assessment.  The 2006 assessment sampled four (2.83/hr) age-0 walleye.  These results would suggest relatively limited natural reproduction occurs on Pokegama Lake; however summer test netting suggests moderate natural year classes at times. <br> \n <br> \nSmelt were observed at four of the five stations sampled, with significant numbers of age-0 smelt observed in Sherrys arm.  One large lake whitefish was also noted during the assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake is located south of Grand Rapids, MN and within the Mississippi River Watershed.  The 6,612 acre lake has 1,978 littoral acres (30%), a maximum depth of 112 feet and about 58 miles of shoreline.  The lake is connected to the Mississippi River through the Jay Gould chain on the north and Little Pokegama to the south, all of which is navigable.  There are numerous accesses located around the lake.  Rainbow Smelt were first discovered in the early 1980s and have since become a naturalized population.  An annual spawning run occurs in Sugar Brook located on the west end of the lake.  Early smelt assessments used non-standardized small mesh nets, however all smelt assessments since 1995 have been standardized. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for smelt should be viewed cautiously due to their open water, schooling nature which tends to have variable catches.  Small mesh gill net catches rates have ranged from 0.4/net in 2011 to 99.0/net in 2005 with an average catch of 41.8 in the past five assessments.  The catch rate of 0.4/net observed in 2011, occurred after a widespread die-off was reported to the fisheries office in July, 2011.  Rainbow Smelt were sampled at the second lowest observed rate of 14.1/net in 2015.  Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 7.1 inches with an average length of 5.3 inches.  Ageing structures were not collected during this assessment, however, past assessments have documented ages 1-3 present.  Comparable length frequencies between assessments suggest similar ages present in the 2015 sample. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch small mesh gill net catch rates from previous assessments have ranged from 15.3/net in 2000 to 159.4/net in 1995.  Yellow Perch were sampled a rate of 193.8/net in 2015.  Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 6.5 inches with an average length of 4.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include Black Crappie, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Spottail Shiner, Tullibee, Walleye, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake is located south of Grand Rapids, MN and within the Mississippi River Watershed.  The 6,612 acre lake has 1,978 littoral acres (30%), a maximum depth of 112 feet and about 58 miles of shoreline.  The lake is connected to the Mississippi River through the Jay Gould chain on the north and Little Pokegama to the south, all of which is navigable.  There are numerous accesses located around the lake.  This was the first targeted survey with the objective of sampling Bluegill and Black Crappie in the spring when most susceptible.  Catch rates from spring surveys tend to be variable due to spring weather patterns and should be viewed cautiously.  However, size structure and growth statistics collected during this period are valuable data. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets targeting panfish moving into the shallow water sampled Bluegill at a rate of 19.2/net.  Due to the size of the lake, the initial spring survey broke up sampling locations by geographic area, potentially identifying distinct areas that could be characterized by catch rates or size structure (Wendigo Arm, King's Bay, north basins, west bays, and Sherry's Arm).  The north basins included Tioga, Poole's and Meyer's, while the west bays included Salter's and Sugar.  Catch rates by geographic location varied from 12.0 to 27.1/net with similar effort.  The variability in catch rates is likely a function of specific netting locations, with some areas having more suitable habitat than others or connectivity to adjacent suitable habitat.  However, Bluegill were present within every area in numbers suitable for most anglers. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sampled in 2015 ranged from 3.4 to 9.7 inches with a mean length of 7.2 inches.  Size structure was favorable with little or no difference between geographic locations.  Fish exceeding seven inches comprised 65% of the sample.  Sex and maturity determination from the sample of 864 identified 358 as male (immature =15) and 447 as female (immature =16) with the remainder as unknown (13) or unknown immature (46).  Immature female Bluegill had a mean length of 5.3 inches, similar to immature males which had a mean length of 5.4 inches.  Interestingly, nine mature males were sampled less than the mean immature length with the smallest being 3.4 inches while 22 mature females were less than the mean immature length with the smallest being 4.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nScale analysis identified ages 3 to 10 present in the sample indicating relatively consistent recruitment.  Ages four through eight were well represented in an expanded age distribution, comprising 90% of the sample.  Back-calculated length-at-age for males (n=122) and females (n=167) was similar to Ecological Lake Class 22 average for all ages.  On average, both male and female Bluegill exceeded 7.5 inches by age 7. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 1.3/net.  The amount of netting effort and the spatial distribution of the nets suggests Black Crappie are not as widely distributed as Bluegill and likely key in on specific habitat.  While present in every geographic zone, certain habitat types held a higher proportion of Black Crappie.  This suggests a higher potential of the ability of angler harvest to impact the fishery.  The 2015 length frequency points towards a quality fishery with lengths from 5.6 to 12.5 inches and a mean length of 9.6 inches.  Scale analysis identified ages 2 to 7 present, with age 4 comprising 37% of the sample.  Strong individual year class strength in crappie populations suggests a boom fishery dependent upon a successful spawn.  However, ages 3 and 5 contributed 12% and 18%, respectively, to the sample.  This suggests relatively consistent recruitment, and the lack of older individuals may be a reflection of angler harvest.  Black Crappie growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages with fish averaging 10.5 inches by age 5. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake is a 6,612 acre lake located 5 miles southwest of Grand Rapids.  The lake has seven public accesses and is highly developed.  The lake management plan indicates northern pike and walleye as the primary species of management with largemouth bass and smallmouth bass as secondary species.     Catch rates for northern pike have increased from a low of 4.1 fish/net in 1975 to a high of 8.1 fish/net in 2000.  Fish ranged from 12.6 to 30.7 inches and had a average length of 22.6 inches.  Fish from one to seven years old were identified with age-2 to age-4 fish representing 81% of the sample.  Northern pike averaged 22.9 inches by age 4 which is above the statewide average of 20.5.  At this time, the population appears to be fairly healthy with good growth, perhaps a little too much reproduction, and decent size structure (although it could be better).  Many lakes that used to have these characteristics are now experiencing high recruitment, slow growth, high mortality, and poor size structure.  If the population continues to increase and growth or size structure become affected, further management may be necessary to maintain or improve the fishery.     The walleye catch rate (6.7 fish/net) attained the management goal for the lake in 2000.  Historically, walleye catch rates have ranged from a low of 1.6 to a high of 10.8 fish/net.  Fish ranged from 10.6 to 27.2 inches and averaged 18.1 inches.  Eleven year classes were identified from scale analysis with fish from one to 13 years old.  The strongest year class (1997) sampled corresponded to a year in which walleye were not stocked.  In the last 10 years, natural reproduction accounted for at least 56% of the fish sampled in this assessment.  Growth was excellent for the younger fish and average for fish older than age 5 compared to the statewide average.  In addition to the excellent prey base (smelt, yellow perch, tullibee), good growth would be expected since the last three years had been long growing seasons (due to the mild/short winters).     In the spring, largemouth bass were electrofished at night for the second time.  Although the catch rate increased from 3.7 fish/hour in 1995 to 36.7 fish/hour in 2000, the population probably did not increase by ten fold.  In addition to real changes in the population, the difference in catch rates were likely affected by the time of sampling.  The 1995 assessment was from three to four weeks later than the 2000 assessment.  The sample included fish from 3.7 to 19.5 inches with an average length of 9.6 inches.  Ten year classes were represented from age 2 to age 11.  The 1997 and 1998 year classes represented 43 and 52% of the sample.  Largemouth bass growth was similar to statewide averages (within 15%) with some ages above and some below the average.     Smallmouth bass were also electrofished at night for the second time.  Electrofishing catch rates increased from 4.4 fish/hour in 1995 to 18.5 fish/hour in 2000.  As with the largemouth bass, the increase in catch rates may be affected by the timing of the samples as well as real changes.  The minimum, maximum, and average length of fish sampled were 6.3, 19.4, and 13.1 inches, respectively.   Nine year classes were represented from age 2 to age 11, indicating consistent recruitment.  The 1997 year class contributed 42% to the sample.  Growth was decent with fish averaging nearly 14.0 inches after four years.     Bluegill catch rates (11.2/net) were the second highest on record, yet was below the lake class median of 15.3 fish/net.  Historical catch rates have ranged from 0.5 to 15.3/net since 1975.  Bluegill ranged from 3.3 to 8.4 inches with a mean length of 5.1 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected during the 2000 assessment.     Despite declining from 43.7 fish/net in 1995, yellow perch catch rates (29.9 fish/net) continued to be high compared to similar lakes.  Fish ranged from 5.3 to 11.0 inches and averaged 6.2 inches.  At this time, it appears the yellow perch population is more important in the fish community as a prey source than for anglers to target.  No age structures were collected in this assessment.     Tullibee are difficult to sample because they suspend in the open water during the time of our assessments.  Despite these challenges, it appears the catch rates have declined in the last 25 years.  In 1975 and 1979 the tullibee catch was 4.0 and 8.2 fish/net compared to the last four assessments in which the highest catch rate was 1.1 fish/net.  If the catch rates are reflecting real changes in abundance, there are several possible reasons for tullibee numbers to have declined including: increased northern pike numbers, walleye stocking, changes in water quality, competition with smelt and fall tullibee/whitefish netting.  The population is critically important to the fish community for providing quality prey for the predator populations and particularly for trophy fish potential.     Other species observed during the population assessment included bowfin, burbot, lake whitefish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rainbow smelt, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  A special rainbow smelt assessment was also conducted during the fall of 2000 to evaluate changes in that population.     To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural, forestry or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these can be areas of concern, lakeshore property owners may also contribute to water quality problems.  Some examples include putting in sand beaches, removing shoreline trees and vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Proper land use practices by everyone will help insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake is a class 22 lake located 4 miles southwest of Grand Rapids, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  Night electrofishing was used in fall 2006 in an attempt to sample young of the year walleye.  This sampling method has been successfully used on other area walleye lakes to assess natural reproduction.  Six of seven pre-established stations were sampled for a total on-time of 1.41 hours.  Visibility was generally moderate to good except in wind-exposed areas.  Four age-0 walleye were sampled in 2006 for a catch rate of 2.83/hour of on-time.  No age-0 walleye were sampled in the 2005 assessment.  These results would seem to indicate that walleye natural reproduction is relatively limited on Pokegama Lake.  However, occasional good natural year classes have been documented in summer population assessments.  Other attempts to evaluate walleye natural reproduction with electrofishing may be conducted on Pokegama Lake in future years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake is a 6,612 acre lake located near Grand Rapids, Minnesota.  The sprawling lake has several distinct bays and arms with diverse habitats that provides a popular multispecies fishery.  There are seven public accesses and high residential development so the lake can get busy at times.  The 2016 lake management plan (LMP) lists Walleye, Muskellunge and Northern Pike as the primary species of management with Bluegill, Lake Trout, and Large and Smallmouth Bass as secondary species.  The LMP goals included maintaining a Walleye gill-net catch greater than 6.6/net and reducing the Northern Pike gill-net catch to 5.0/net with 50% of the fish exceeding 21 inches and some 34 plus inch fish present.  A targeted survey used 15 gill nets in July of 2021 to assess select game fish species and evaluate the Walleye stocking strategy.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches have varied over the years as managers have attempted to refine the management strategy.  In recent years, the Walleye population has primarily been maintained with annual fingerling stocking.  In 2021, the gill-net catch was above average for Pokegama and exceeded the LMP goal.  The sampled fish ranged from 10.1 to 27.1 inches and averaged 18.5 inches.  Nearly 35% of the sampled Walleye exceeded 20 inches.  Good angling opportunities for Walleye continue to exist. <br> \n <br> \nLike many northern Minnesota lakes, Northern Pike numbers on Pokegama have increased over time, while size quality has declined.  High pike numbers typically result in reduced growth rates and poor size quality.  The 2021 pike gill-net catch remained high compared to similar lakes and size quality was relatively poor.  The sampled pike did not meet the LMP goals for reduced numbers or size.  Northern Pike ranged from 13.1 to 32.4 inches and averaged 21.0 inches.  Because the pike population shows signs of overharvest of larger fish, anglers are encouraged to harvest pike under 22 inches while releasing fish exceeding 26 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) are an important prey species for large predators like Muskellunge, Northern Pike, and Walleye.  However, they can be difficult to sample with our standard summer nets due to their pelagic nature.  Catch rates have varied considerably but have been consistently low since 1984.  The lower catches in recent surveys correspond to the illegal introduction and expansion of Rainbow Smelt before 1984.  Research indicates smelt can have a negative effect on Tullibee populations.  Though our nets did not sample many in 2021, the pulse of Tullibee that anglers noticed in recent years may have been in response to the smelt die-off in 2011.  Most of those fish are likely from one or two year-classes and anglers should not expect consistent recruitment of Tullibee now that smelt have rebounded. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are also an important prey species for many predators.  Catch rates have fluctuated dramatically but have been lower than expected in the last two surveys.  The 2021 catch was the second lowest on record and likely reflects a response to relatively high numbers of predators such as Walleye, bass, and pike.  The sampled perch ranged from 4.7 to 11.3 inches and averaged 7.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the survey included Black Crappie, Bluegill, Brown Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rainbow Smelt, Rock Bass, Silver Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nExotic Zebra Mussels were discovered in Pokegama Lake recently.  Zebra mussels are effective filter feeders that contribute to notably increased water clarity and impact food webs.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help slow the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  The law requires all drain-plugs be removed and bait wells drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters should power wash and dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake is a large, sprawling lake located adjacent to Grand Rapids, Minnesota.  The lake has seven public accesses and is highly developed.  The lake has diverse habitats that allow for the high quality diverse fish community.  The 2022 lake management plan (LMP) indicated Bluegill and Walleye as the primary species for management with bass, Muskie, and Northern Pike as secondary species.  The LMP goals include maintaining the Walleye gill-net catch near 6.6/net and a quality Bluegill fishery with at least 10% of the sample over 8 inches and some 9-inch fish present.  A targeted survey using 15 gill nets was conducted in July of 2023 to assess the fish community, with emphasis on the Walleye management. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have fluctuated from 1.6 to 10.8 fish/gill net since 1949.  The gill-net catch declined from 9.0/net in 2021 to 6.1/net in 2023.  The catch met the LMP goal of being near the average of 6.6 fish/net for lakes with similar habitat.  The sampled fish ranged from 10.5 to 27.3 inches and averaged 18.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPast evaluations determined Walleye natural reproduction was sporadic in Pokegama Lake.  It appears that large, deep lakes do not warm fast enough to produce sufficient food for fry to survive.  Walleye fingerlings can often be an effective management tool in these types of lakes where fry and natural reproduction have not been successful.  The 2023 survey evaluated a period in which Walleye were stocked annually since 2004.  Ten year-classes from age 1 to 18 were identified by scale and otolith analysis.  Two year old fish were the most commonly captured, representing 32% of the sample.  Walleye averaged 18.5 inches after four years of growth, which was faster than the statewide average.  Walleye numbers and size distribution should provide good fishing opportunities for anglers in the next few years. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates have ranged from 4.1 to 10.6 fish/net since 1949.  The catch rates have increased and the last four were the highest on record.  The catch of 10.5 fish/gill net in 2023 was higher than desired for the lake.  High catches often result in slow growth and poor size structure.  Northern Pike ranged from 13.9 to 34.5 inches and averaged 22.6 inches.  Eight year-classes were identified with fish from age 1 to age 8 present.  Age-4 fish represented 34% of the sample.  Growth was similar to statewide averages and pike averaged 23.4 inches after four years of growth.  The pike population shows signs of quality overharvest because of the increasing catch rates and the abrupt drop of fish over 26 inches in the size distribution.  Anglers are encouraged to release all pike over 30 inches to help improve size structure. <br> \n  <br> \nBlack Crappie are often difficult to sample during summer surveys because they frequently suspend in areas where the nets do not fish.  Consequently, catch rates have always been low and likely do not reflect the population well.  The five crappie sampled ranged from 9.3 to 11.1 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected during this survey. <br> \n <br> \nSpring targeted surveys are more effective at evaluating Bluegill populations than summer gill nets.  However, the gill-net survey to evaluate Walleye did sample some Bluegill.  The 43 Bluegill ranged from 3.7 to 9.3 inches and averaged 5.3 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this survey.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibees are difficult to sample with our standard summer nets because they suspend over deep water and the nets are set on the bottom.  Catch rates on Pokegama Lake have ranged from 0 to 8.2 fish/gill net but have not been above 0.6/gill net since 1984.  The lower catches in the last three decades correspond to the illegal introduction and expansion of Rainbow Smelt before 1984.  Rainbow Smelt have been documented to have a negative effect on Tullibee populations.  Angler reports in recent years would suggest the Tullibee population rebounded following the smelt die-off in the summer of 2011, though the gill-net catches did not reflect those potential changes.  The catch of 0.6/net in 2023 was the highest since 1984 but remained low compared to other lakes with similar habitat.  The eight sampled fish ranged from 14.7 to 17.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches ranged from 11.8 to 43.7 fish/gill net prior to 2015, and were at or above average for lakes with similar habitat.  The 2015, 2021 and 2023 catches were the three lowest on record at 4.8, 8.2 and 6.3 fish/gill net.  The Rainbow Smelt die-off during the summer of 2011 likely shifted additional predation towards perch for a few years.  However, long-term trends of increasing pike and high annual stocking of Walleye fingerlings are likely also contributing to lower perch numbers in the gill nets.  The sampled perch ranged from 5.7 to 11.2 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.  Perch are likely more important in the fish community as prey than as a species anglers would target due to their size distributions. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the survey included Bluegill, Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  It appears Green Sunfish were sampled for the first time in Pokegama in 2023. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help slow the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live/bait wells drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are also encouraged to power-wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2022 Lake Management Plan (LMP) identified Bluegill and Walleye as primary management species and bass, Muskie, and Northern Pike as secondary management species.  Rainbow Smelt is a non-native species discovered in Pokegama in the early 1980s that has established a naturalized population.  The origin of smelt and effect on the fish community are unclear beyond their importance as a prey species.  There is a spring spawning run in Sugar Brook that is popular with smelt netters.  Early efforts to sample smelt used a variety of methods but were standardized beginning with the 1995 fall survey.  The goal of the 2023 smelt survey was to monitor the long-term trends in the population following a widespread die-off in the summer of 2011.  Twelve small-mesh gill nets (0.375 and 0.5 inch) were set during the week of October 9th. <br> \n <br> \nCaution is advised when interpreting smelt catch rates because they are a schooling species that often suspends over deeper water, resulting in variable catches.  Small-mesh gill nets have sampled smelt as high as 99.0/net in 2005 and as low as 0.4/net in 2011.  The 2023 catch of 8.8 smelt/net was somewhat lower than the 14.1/net observed in 2015.  The sampled fish ranged from 4.1 to 5.4 inches and had a mean length of 4.8 inches.  Nearly 98% of the sample were captured in the smaller 0.375 inch mesh.  Angler reports of large clouds of presumed smelt on their electronics or in an ice-hole suggests we may be under-sampling the population.  No attempt to age the smelt occurred in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have ranged from 15.3/net in 2000 to 193.8/net in 2015.  The perch catch of 47.2/net was down from a record high in 2015.  The sampled fish ranged from 2.9 to 6.4 inches and had a mean length of 4.5 inches.  A total of 348 measured perch were examined for sex and maturity.  Of the 51 females sampled, nearly 85% were immature that ranged from 3.0 to 5.4 inches (mean = 4.4 inches) while the remainder were mature that ranged from 4.7 to 6.4 inches (mean = 5.2 inches).  In contrast, of the 297 males, only 1.4% were immature that ranged from 3.0 to 5.0 inches (mean = 3.8 inches) while 98.7% were mature ranging from 2.9 to 5.4 inches (mean = 4.4 inches).  Sex and maturity data had not been collected from the fall small-mesh gill net surveys prior to 2023 so it is not clear if it reflects any changes in the population.  However, it demonstrates earlier maturation of males than previously thought and is consistent with recent research from around the state. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Rock Bass, Spottail Shiner, Trout-Perch, Walleye, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Early smelt assessments used non-standardized small mesh nets, however all smelt assessments since 1995 have been standardized. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for smelt should be viewed cautiously due to their open water, schooling nature which tends to have variable catches.  Catch rates, since 1995, have ranged from 17.2/net in 2000 to 99/net in 2005.  Smelt were sampled at a rate of 31.4/net in 2010.  Lengths ranged from 4.5 to 6.7 inches with a mean of 5.4 inches.  Ageing structures were not collected during this assessment, however, past assessments have documented ages 1-3 present.  Comparable length frequencies between assessments suggest similar ages present in the 2010 sample. <br> \n <br> \nFall night electrofishing for young-of-the-year walleye was conducted in October, as part of the Pokegema Lake assessment.  Young of the year smelt were observed at three of the five stations sampled.  A significant amount of YOY smelt were observed at stations in Sherrys Arm.  Due to the size of these fish, they would not be sampled in the standard small mesh gill nets set during the smelt assessment. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, mottled sculpin, northern pike, rock bass, smallmouth bass, spottail shiner, trout-perch, walleye, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Temperature-dissolved oxygen profiles were collected in the deepest basins on Pokegama Lake on August 7, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Two profiles were collected due to the size and complexity of the lake (i.e., Water Quality Station 1 and 3).  Based on the average of the two profiles, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 18 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 65.6 feet in Water Quality Station 1 (WQ 1), and never reached 3.0 mg/L in the WQ 3, both of which were well below the thermocline at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L in WQ 1 (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 5.7?C (42.3?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a wide range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1979-2015 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1975. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",
