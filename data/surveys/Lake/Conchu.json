In midsummer, 5 ppm oxygen is retained to a depth of about 20 ft, where the temperature is about 50 F.Conchu Lake has an inlet from Uranus Lake with a waterfall which prevents fish movement.  The outlet to the Kawishiwi River has a beaver dam and a 4 ft falls limiting fish movement.  Shoal water substrates on Conchu Lake are mostly rubble, ledgerock, and gravel.  Plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 10 ft; sedges and waterlilies are the most common plants.Conchu Lake was poisoned with rotenone in the fall of 1984, killing most of the northern pike, white sucker, rock bass, yellow perch, pumpkinseed sunfish, and largemouth bass that were present.  Uranus Lake was poisoned at the same time.  Conchu Lake was initially stocked with splake and brook trout.  Splake stocking was discontinued in all lakes in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness after 1988 at the request of the U.S, Forest Service because they are not an indigenous species.  Brook trout have been stocked annually since 1988.  The 2003 trout assessment consisted of four gillnets set in early June.  Five previous trout assessments, each consisting of 2-4 gillnet sets, were done from 1986 through 1998.Two 7\" brook trout were captured in the 2003 assessment; both had been stocked (air-dropped from a float plane) the previous fall.  The total catch of trout by weight in 2003 of 0.1 lb/gillnet was much lower than the median catch of 7.9 lb/gillnet in previous assessments on this lake and was lower than the median catch of 4.6 lb/gillnet in recent assessments of 25 stream trout lakes (excluding mine pit lakes) in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.One large northern pike (36\", 12 lb) was captured in the 2003 assessment.  A 41\" pike with several brook trout fingerlings in its stomach was captured in the 1994 assessment, and several large pike have been caught by anglers in recent years.Two largemouth bass were captured in the 2003 assessment.  Largemouth bass have been captured in all four investigations from 1990 to the present.No white sucker were captured in the 2003 assessment.  White sucker were captured in the 1994 and 1998 assessments.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Conchu Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 4, which consists of 47 lakes in northeastern Minnesota that are small, deep, and have clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Conchu Lake stratifies thermally in midsummer and retains good oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) to a depth of about 20 ft, where the temperature is about 50 F.  The inlet from Uranus Lake has a waterfalls preventing fish movement.  The outlet to the Kawishiwi river has a beaver dam and a 4' falls limiting fish movement.   The bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble, ledgerock, and gravel.  Plant growth is sparse, and plants grow to a depth of 10 ft; the most common are sedges and waterlilies.Conchu Lake was poisoned with rotenone (a natural substance extracted from several tropical and sub-tropical plants) in 1984, which killed many of the northern pike, white sucker, rock bass, yellow perch, pumpkinseed sunfish, and (probably) largemouth bass that were present.  Uranus lake was poisoned at the same time.  Conchu Lake was initially stocked with splake and brook trout, but splake stocking was discontinued after 1988 at the request of the USFS.The catch of brook trout in Conchu Lake in 1998 of 18.8/gillnet (6.6 lb/gillnet) was similar to the average trout catch of 13.5/gillnet (8.5 lb/gillnet) in assessments in 1986, 1988, 1990, and 1994.  The 1998 trout catch by weight of 6.6 lb/gillnet was also very near the median catch of 6.0 lb/gillnet for recent assessments on 24 stream trout lakes in the Ely Fisheries Management Area.All but four of the 75 brook trout captured in 1998 were yearlings which had been stocked the previous fall as fingerlings.  These yearlings ranged in size from 6\" to 10\" when captured.  The four larger brook trout ranged in size from 15\" to 19\".  The stomachs of trout examined in 1998 contained zooplankton (55 percent), dragonfly nymphs (17 percent), empty (16 percent), insect remains (5 percent), with the remainder containing winged midges, chaoborus, crayfish, leeches, darters, or caddisflies.Sucker reappeared in the year following poisoning.  Sucker numbers in 1998 (2.2/gillnet) were lower than the peak numbers of 5.5/gillnet captured in 1988 and 1990.  Sucker sizes have increased since reclamation, and were quite large in 1998, averaging 17.9\".Largemouth bass numbers in the 1998 gillnet catch were quite low, but 17 spawning beds were observed in 1998, compared to 15 beds in 1994.  Anglers have also reported catching good sized (over 2 lb) largemouth since about 1990.Northern pike were not captured in the 1998 assessment, but a few very large pike have been caught by anglers, and a 41\" pike was caught in the 1994 assessment. </p>",

Eleven trout (average length of 13.9\") were likely from the fall 1992 fingerling stocking.  One trout (18.5\") was probably from the fall 1991 fingerling stocking.Brook trout were foraging on Chironomids.</p>",
