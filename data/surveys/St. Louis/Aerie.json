The lake was resurveyed in July of 1995.     Panfish (black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed, yellow perch), comprised most of the catch with abundances typical of this type of lake.  Average size tended to be small with a few black crappies over 9 inches and a few bluegills over 7 inches.  Growth rate for both these species were some of the slowest in the Duluth Area.     Northern pike were the major predator in Aerie Lake with an abundance typical of this lake class.  Most pike were small, average length was 17.4 inches, although one fish over 36 inches was taken in this survey.  Growth rate was one of the slower rates seen in the Duluth Area.  Walleye and largemouth bass were also sampled in low numbers.     Other species present in the lake included:  black bullhead, white sucker and green sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Aerie Lake is a 139 acre lake located near Alborn, Minnesota with 69% (96.6 acres) littoral area and a maximum depth of 37 feet.  The public access on Aerie Lake is undeveloped and does not allow easy access to the lake.  Largemouth bass and bluegill are the primary fish species.  The Aerie Lake Property Owners Association maintains a walleye population through private stocking.     Largemouth bass electrofishing catch rates of 61.6 per hour in 1996 were well above the average (32.6 per hour) for Duluth Area bass populations.  Mean length was 8.6 inches and the largest fish captured was 17.6 inches.  Largemouth bass growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area populations.     Bluegill abundance was average for Minnesota lakes with an average of 25.3 fish/trapnet.  Mean length was 6.4 inches with 74% of bluegills 6 inches or greater and a maximum size of 8.4 inches.  Bluegill reproduction was consistent and growth was average for Duluth Area lakes.       Black crappie abundance was 0.8 fish/trapnet and was below average for Minnesota lakes of this type.  The mean length of black crappie was 8.7 inches.  Only two year classes were represented in 2005.     Northern pike abundance was above average for Minnesota lakes with a value of 5.7 fish/gillnet.  Mean length was 20.7 inches; thirty-five percent were over 21 inches and one fish measured 38.4 inches.  Growth was average for Duluth Area populations.  Based on age distribution, northern pike successfully reproduced from 1999 to 2003.       Walleye abundance of 1.0 fish/gillnet was average for Minnesota lakes of this type.  Mean length was 18.8 inches and growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Almost all aged fish correlated to stocked years.         Anglers have reported good largemouth bass and bluegill fishing in Aerie Lake.  Walleye abundance has shown some increase since the Aerie Lake Association began stocking in 1998.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike numbers have continued to decline since a high CPUE of 12 in 1984, yet remain in the median range for this lake class.  The presence of green sunfish, pumpkinseed, bluegill and hybrid sunfish and results of various nettings raises the question of identity from previous surveys.  Therefore, comments are restricted to the high CPUE of bluegill, which is above the third quartile for this lake class.  Growth rates are average for this area.  70% of the present population is age III.  Black crappie numbers and growth fall within acceptable ranges.  Stocking of yellow perch in 1986 may have sent perch soaring to new heights.  A CPUE of 15 is well above the third quartile for this lake class, with growth below MN and local averages.  Recruitment of largemouth bass is good as indicated by 1/4 inch trapnets and shoreline seining.  After continued stocking, walleye populations remain very low.</p>",
