Access is via a series of logging roads that pass within 75 feet of the north end of the lake. The carry down access is suitable only for small boats or canoes.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and yellow perch were collected in gillnets in 2006. Northern pike were sampled in average numbers compared to other lakes in this class, and the mean weight was 1.3 pounds per fish. Most of the northern pike in this assessment were smaller than 20 inches, with the largest fish measuring 24.9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in low numbers in 2006, which was typical of catches in previous assessments on this lake. The numbers and size of yellow perch collected in 2006 indicate a below average fishery for this species, and one that is unacceptable to most anglers.  <br> \n</p>",
