Stingy has a State of Minnesota owned public access on the southwest corner of the lake.  It is best known for its walleye and black crappie fishing.     The northern pike gill net catch rate was 3.9/set, below the 1st quartile for this lake class (#29).  Catch rates have been below the median in all of the eight assessments.  The northern sampled ranged in length from 18.9 to 29.7 inches and had a mean length of 22.4 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide averages.     Walleye were sampled in this assessment at 4.6/gill net, the second highest catch rate.  Many of the wallye sampled (68%) were from years when no stocking occurred.  The 2002 year class (3 year olds) made up 54% of the catch.  This was a year when no stocking occured.  The walleye sampled ranged in length from 7.9 to 19.2 inches and had a mean length of 12.6 inches.  Growth was slower than the statewide averages.       Yellow perch, typically low in Stingy Lake, were again sampled below the lake class median at 2.7/gill net.  The fish sampled were small, ranging in length from 5.4 to 6.7 inches.  They had a mean length of 5.9 inches.     The bluegill trap net catch rate was 29.2/set, above the median.  Most of the bluegill were small.  They ranged in length from 2.8 to 9.8 inches and had a mean length of 5.5 inches. Growth exceeded the averages for this lake class.          The black crappie trap net catch rate was 1.2/set in this assessment compared to the lake class inter-quartile range of 0.8-4.3/set.  They ranged in length from 5.2 to 11.8 and had a mean length of 9.9 inches. No black crappie were sampled in the gill net in this assessment.        Only one largemouth bass was sampled in this assessment.  Spring electrofishing has been shown to more effectively sample bass than conventional test netting, however this was not done during this assessment.        Other species sampled in this assessment were pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker and black bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>There is evidence that the walleye population has increased since the 1986 assessment, based on a Rank Sum Test p=0.14.  The gill net CPUE increased from 1.4 in 1986 to 3.1 in 1991 this compares to the Schupp lake class #29 median of 1.5 (0.67-3.33 mid 50% quartile range).  The CPUE of 3.1 approaches the 3rd quartile for lake class #29.  The walleye population is dominated by the 1989 year class; 18 of 28 were age II.  Length frequency distribution reveals most fish are 9-12\".  The proportional stock density (PSD) is 19 (n=16).  Growth for ages I-III is slightly below the statewide average.  Shoreline seining captured 2 young of the year walleye; 410,000 fry were stocked in 1991.  There is natural reproduction occurring in the lake, evidenced by walleye present from year classes not stocked.The northern pike population has decreased significantly since the 1986 assessment, based on a Rank Sum Test p=.008.  The gill net CPUE decreased from 3.2 in 1986 to 1.0 in 1991.  This compares with the lake class #29 median of 7.5 (4.33-11.4).  A relatively small sample was compared of fish age 1-IV.  Growth appeared to be faster than the statewide average, based on the small sample (n=9).The bluegill population appears to be stable, with a trap net CPUE of 5.9, compared to 4.5 in the 1986 assessment.  This is considerably lower than the lake class median of 23.5 (10.5-55.3 mid 50% quartile), however.  Bluegills were sampled well in gill nets, 6.1/lift.  It appears that larger fish were sampled in the gill nets, evidenced by a PSD of 59 (n=42) compared to a trap net PSD of 11 (n=44).  There was a wide range of sizes sampled, ages III and IV most abundant.  Growth is much slower than the statewide average; mean back-calculated length at annulus formation for age II-2.5\" (n=5), III-3.4\" (n=15), IV-4.7\" (n=22), V-5.6\" (n=9), VI-6.3 (n=1), VII-6.6\" (n=4), VIII-6.9\" (n=6).The yellow perch population at 2.6/gill net is low compared to the lake class #29 median of 9.6 (2.0-23.5), and approaches the 1st quartile.  Shoreline seining sampled a moderate number of young of the year yellow perch.  Walleye management should be conservative, based on yellow perch forage abundance.Only 4 black crappie were sampled, all were age III.  Growth was good; mean back-calculated length at last annulus formation was 6.8\".Only 1 largemouth bass was sampled in gill and trap nets, but a moderate number of young of the year were captured shoreline seining.</p>",

There is moderate development and a secchi depth of only 5.5 ft due to bog stain.Walleye fry have generally been stocked every other year to supplement natural reproduction.  Walleye gill net catch was 7.0/set which was above the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye abundance has increased in the last four surveys dating back to 1981.  Average weight of walleye was 0.6 pounds and length varied from 7 to 20 inches.  Most of the walleye sampled (43%) were between 11 and 12 inches.  Northern pike gill net catch was 2.1/set which is below the expected range for similar lakes.  Northern pike abundance has generally been below the expected range in the last four surveys dating back to 1981.  Average weight of fish sampled was 3.3 pounds and length varied from 17 to 30 inches.   Yellow perch gill net catch was 2.3/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Based on surveys dating back to 1967, yellow perch have never been very abundant in Stingy Lake.  Yellow perch were generally small and no fish were sampled greater than 8.5 inches.  Bluegill trap net catch was 22.1/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Bluegill varied in length from 3.5 to 9.5 inches.  Size structure was good with 86% of the fish sampled greater than 6 inches.  Black crappie were also sampled within the expected range, however, most of the fish were small and no fish were sampled greater than 9 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stingy Lake is located about 18 miles north of Nashwauk, MN, with a small earthen access on the southwest corner. The lake is relatively shallow with moderate fertility and moderately low shoreline development. The fisheries lake management plan was last revised in 2015. Walleye and Black Crappie were the primary management species with goals of maintaining a Walleye catch rate near 4.6/gill net and a Black Crappie catch rate near 1.8/trap net. Bluegill and Northern Pike were considered a secondary management species with no goals. Walleye are actively managed by stocking Mississippi River strain at a rate of 1,000 fry/littoral acre in odd years. A standard survey was conducted in June 2022 to collect updated information on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch was better than lakes with comparable habitat. Past catches tended to be variable but have mostly been better than average. However, the management goal is ambitious and only attained twice. Lengths of gill net sampled fish ranged from 8.0 to 22.6 inches with an average of 14.6 inches. The size distribution was comparable to the previous survey. Scale analysis identified eight age classes between 1 to 9. Odd year fry stocking appeared to have contributed to year class strength. Consecutive ages suggest modest natural reproduction which could possibly be substantial at times. Growth was fast early but slowed to near the statewide average by age 2. Walleye averaged 16 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in both trap nets and gill nets. The trap net catch was lower than expected while the gill net catch was better than expected. Past catches were variable but seldom abundant. The management goal was not attained. The goal may be difficult to attain due to survey timing and year-class strengths. Year-classes appeared irregular. Five year-classes between ages 2 to 9 were sampled. Ages 2 and 3 comprised 54% of the expanded sample. Growth was similar to the statewide average. Lengths ranged from 4.9 to 9.8 inches with an average of 7.7 inches in the gill net sample, but fish up to 12 inches were sampled with trap nets. Age and length distributions suggest the popularity of the fishery is determined by the ages of the largest year-classes. Age 2 and 3 crappie averaged 5.6 and 7.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are not abundant in Stingy Lake. Catches have been below average in all surveys when compared with lakes of similar habitat. Low catches are conducive to growing larger pike. Unfortunately, the size distribution suggests small pike are common, yet the lake has the potential to occasionally produce large fish. Lengths ranged from 21.3 to 30.7 inches with an average of 26.4 inches. Three year-classes were identified between ages 4 to 7 from a sample too small to assess recruitment (n=7). Growth was above average for early ages but slowed to the statewide average by age 5. Northern Pike averaged 25.7 inches by age 5. Stingy Lake has the potential to grow larger pike and anglers are encouraged to limit harvest of pike longer than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant species sampled in trap nets. Past catches were variable, but mostly below average for lakes of similar habitat. Variable catches tend to be common for this lake class. Lengths ranged from 2.8 to 8.4 inches with an average of 4.3 inches. Size structure was poor and similar to past surveys. Scale analysis identified eight year classes between ages 2 and 9 with a high proportion of younger fish. Growth was comparable to lake type averages for younger fish but improved to above average by age 5. Bluegill averaged 6 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch was the highest observed, yet below average for comparable lakes. Lengths ranged from 5.2 to 9.6 inches with an average of 6.9 inches. Despite the low catches it appears the population is capable of supporting a modest Walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

There has been a substantial increase in the northern pike population, especially since 1976.  The yellow perch population has decreased since 1976, there is some reproduction present.  It appears walleye fry stocking has had limited success.  Natural reproduction was occurring and successful enough to produce a fishable population in 1976.  Walleye abundance has declined since that time.  The largemouth bass population appears stable and there is adequate natural reproduction.  The sucker and bluegill populations have decreased since previous surveys.  There has been a substantial increase in the crappie population.  The bullhead population has increased but present levels are not high enough for commercial removal.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stingy Lake is located in northeast Itasca County about 18 miles north of Nashwauk, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake has a surface area of 378 acres and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  Stingy Lake is in ecological lake class 29.  Other area lakes in this class include Beauty, Five Island and Wilson Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe current lake management plan lists Walleye and Black Crappie as the primary species of management.  Past management included Walleye fry stocking in odd-numbered years; however, the 2011 and 2013 stockings were not accomplished as originally scheduled.  The 2014 population assessment evaluated Walleye natural reproduction during a period of several consecutive non-stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 Walleye gill-net catch was near the lake class median at 1.7/net, but down from the previous three surveys.  Historical catches have ranged from 0.3 to 7.0/net.  Sampled Walleye varied from 11.2 to 21.9 inches with a mean length of 15.8 inches.  Ages 2, 4, 5 and 7 were identified in the sample, with 50% of the sample attributed to non-stocked years.  Walleye growth was considered average with fish reaching 16 inches in 4 years.  Some natural reproduction of Walleye is evident in Stingy Lake, but it appears supplemental fry stocking is needed to achieve management goals.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie gill-net catch was 1.4/net, compared to the lake class interquartile range of 1.0 to 4.8/net.  Black Crappie size structure was poor, with fish ranging from 4.9 to 8.9 inches and having a mean length of 6.7 inches.  Ages 2-5 were represented, but age 2 fish (less than 6 inches long) made up approximately half of the sample.  Growth was similar to the lake class average with crappie exceeding 8 inches at age 4. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catches in Stingy Lake have typically been below the normal range for this lake class.  The 2014 assessment was no exception with a catch rate of 4.4/net.  Size structure was modest; sampled pike ranged from 18.7 to 36.4 inches with a mean length of 22.3 inches.  Ages 2-6, and 10 were identified; with age 3 fish making up nearly half the sample.  Growth of pike was slightly above average with fish exceeding 23 inches at age 4.     <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill-net catch was below the lake class first quartile at 0.8/net.  Yellow Perch net catches have been low in all previous surveys.  Sampled perch ranged from 5.9 to 8.4 inches with a mean length of 7.0 inches.  Yellow perch are an important prey species for predator fish like Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch rate for Bluegill was near the lake class first quartile at 8.2/net.  Catches in the two previous assessments were substantially higher, but those surveys occurred slightly later in the summer.  The 2014 assessment was seasonally the earliest ever conducted on Stingy Lake, so the catch rate may not be comparable to other surveys.  During the June 2014 assessment, water temperatures were in the 60's and it appeared the Bluegill had not yet started to spawn.  Size structure of Bluegill was relatively poor.  Sampled Bluegill ranged from 2.6 to 8.7 inches with a mean length of 4.9 inches.  Ages 2-8 were represented, with a high proportion of younger fish.  Age 3-4 fish made up 58% of the sample.  Growth was faster than the lake class average with Bluegill exceeding 6 inches at age 5. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in this assessment included Black Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
