                "narrative": "<p>Twenty-six Lake is located in southeastern Cass County.  Twenty-six Lake is 85 acres, has 1.6 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 12 feet.  There are no outlets, but one small inlet is located on the southwest shore.  Shoal water soils are 80% sand, 10% gravel, 5% muck, and 5% boulder-rubble.  Secchi reading was 4 feet and total alkalinity was 10 p.p.m.  Several emergent and submerged aquatic plants having sparse density rating, except for stonewort and spikerush.Test netting indicated a good fish population of walleye, northern pike, white sucker, black crappie and bluegill.  Spawning habitat is good for northern pike during high water years.  Spawning habitat is fair for walleye during high water years - rubble along the northeast shore would be covered with about one food of water but proper wind action would probably be absent.  Spawning habitat for centrarchids is good.  The walleye population is probably the result of private stocking, since no stocking records could be found.  Black grub (Neascus spp.) was the only parasite found, and bluegill was the only species infected.The limited depth of the lake could result in complete or partial winterkills during severe winters.A local resident reports good walleye fishing (large walleye are caught).  Time of year is unknown.</p>",
