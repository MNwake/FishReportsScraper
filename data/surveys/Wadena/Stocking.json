The lake will continue to suffer on the bass and panfish level, due to low oxygen reading every winter.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stocking Lake is located two miles east of Menahga in northern Wadena County.  Stocking Lake has a surface area of 357 acres and a maximum depth of 22 feet.  Since 1975, the Stocking Lake Association has operated three bubbler type aeration systems to help prevent oxygen depletion and winterkill.  Open water areas are maintained during the winter.  There is a state-owned public access located on the east shore of the lake.  Stocking provides angling opportunities for northern pike, panfish, and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Stocking is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Hennepin, Paine, Peysensky, Upper Twin, Wolf, and Hungryman. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice for anglers year around on Stocking Lake.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed abundance was down from recent surveys, below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed numbers have been much higher in past surveys, with catch rates well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find decent numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 7-8 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers, with gillnet catch rates within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  Anglers will find good fishing for black crappie in the 10-12 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (6.2 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike numbers were very high in the 2001 and 2006 surveys (> 20 pike/gillnet).  Anglers will find lots of small, \"hammer handle\" size pike, as average length and weight was only 17.5 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Larger northern pike are present, with pike measured up to 37.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (2.1 walleye/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  Walleye up to 27.7 inches were sampled.  While natural reproduction occurs, the DNR stocking program is helping to maintain the walleye population in Stocking Lake.  Evaluations showed the strongest year classes were from stocked years.   Stocking Lake is stocked with walleye during odd numbered years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in low numbers.  Yellow perch abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to very high numbers.  Sampled yellow perch were small, with few perch an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown Stocking Lake to have a low to moderate largemouth bass population when compared to other area lakes.  Stocking Lake has aquatic vegetation habitat that will support a largemouth bass population, however, numbers and sizes of bass will vary with partial winterkill events. <br> \n <br> \nStocking Lake is one of the few lakes in this area that supports a carp population and provides limited opportunities for angling and bow fishing.  Present and past surveys have shown Stocking  to have a low to moderate carp population. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of bowfin (dogfish), and low numbers of white sucker, black bullhead, brown bullhead, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

The shallow basin has no thermal stratification and oxygen is present at all depths throughout the summer.  Although the lake appears to be chemically and physically capable of high productivity it is not supporting large populations of game fish and panfish.The net indicies indicate fish populations below the statewide median except for common suckers, pumpkinseeds, and perch which have good populations.The sizes of northern pike tend to be large which is associated with a good age class distribution and a rapid growth rate.There is a tendency among the walleyes, perch, and centrarchids to form dominant year classes.Growth is approximately normal for all species except northern pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stocking Lake is located two miles east of Menahga in northern Wadena County.  Stocking Lake is a shallow lake, and has a surface area of 357 acres and a maximum depth of 22 feet.  Since 1975, Stocking Lake Association has operated three bubbler type aeration systems to help prevent oxygen depletion and winterkill.  Open water areas are maintained during the winter months.  There is a state-owned public access located on the east shore of the lake.  Stocking provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Panfish, and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Stocking is in lake class 39.  Class 39 lakes are characterized by being shallow and have a large littoral area (water depth less than 15 feet).   Other class 39 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include: First Crow Wing, Fourth Crow Wing, Portage, and Upper Twin.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find a moderate to abundant Northern Pike population, dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike in the 18-21 inch size range.  The number of larger Northern Pike (>28.0 inches) has been low in recent surveys.  Northern Pike up to 31.9 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice for anglers year round on Stocking Lake.  Panfish populations in Stocking Lake have fluctuated from low to high numbers over the years.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers for this lake class, while Pumpkinseed and Black Crappie were sampled in low numbers.  Bluegill up to 9.4 inches and Black Crappie up to 12.9 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (4.1 walleye/gillnet) was within the range for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Sampled Walleye had an average length and weight of 17.0 inches and 2.1 pounds, with fish measured up to 29.0 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in low numbers.  Yellow Perch abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to high numbers.  Sampled Yellow Perch were small, with few fish of an acceptable size for most anglers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bowfin, Common Carp, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, White Sucker, and Rock Bass. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Stocking Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stocking Lake is located two miles east of Menahga in northern Wadena County.  Stocking Lake has a surface area of 343 acres and a maximum depth of 22 feet.  Starting in 1975, the Stocking Lake Association operates two bubbler type aeration systems to help prevent oxygen depletion and winterkill.  Two open water areas are maintained during the winter, however, low dissolved oxygen levels still occur.  The public access is located on the east shore and is owned and maintained by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR).  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Stocking Lake is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same class include Ham (5 miles east of Nevis), Hennepin (1 mile southeast of Becida), Minnie (3 miles north of Lake George), Paine (south of Lake George), Peysensky (5 miles east of Park Rapids), Rice (11 miles north of Park Rapids), Shallow (3 miles west of Nevis), and Hungry Man (2 miles northeast of Two Inlets).     The walleye gillnet catch of 5.3/net is within the range typically found in lake class 39 (1.5/net - 5.8/net).  The previous survey in 1991 had a walleye gillnet catch of 3.0/net, while historical catches have ranged from 0.8/net (1986) to 7.0/net (1974).  Sampled walleye were of quality size, with an average length and weight of 19.0 inches and 2.40 lbs.  Walleye up to 26.6 inches were measured.  A strong 1991 year class of WAE is present in Stocking Lake which represented 46% of the catch.  The WAE population in Stocking Lake is maintained through    fingerling stocking with sporadic recruitment through natural reproduction.  Only two of the forty-one WAE sampled were from non-stocked years.  Stocking Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd calendar years.         The northern pike gillnet catch of 9.0/net is within the range typical of lake class 39 (4.6 - 11.6).  Excluding 1955 (2.2/net), historical northern pike gillnet catches have been slightly lower, ranging from 4.8/net (1981) to 8.5/net (1974).  Northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.1 lbs, however, large fish were present with fish sampled up to 33.5 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were similar to other class 39 lakes.       Bluegill were sampled in low numbers (0.3/trapnet), below the range typical for this lake class (2.5/trapnet - 25.0/trapnet). Bluegill and other sunfish species suffered a partial winterkill during the winter of 1995-96.  The partial winterkill accounts for the low bluegill catch during the 1996 netting.  While bluegill numbers were low, size of fish were large, ranging from 8.1 to 9.2 inches.  Except for extreme winters conditions like the winter of 1995-96, the operation of the aeration system since 1975 has helped to increase and stabilize the sunfish populations.  Bluegill abundance was much higher in the two previous surveys, 98.1/trapnet (1986) and 28.7/trapnet (1991).  Prior to the operation of the aeration system, numbers were lower, ranging from 1.0/net (1974) to 11.6/net (1955).  Bluegill exhibited fast growth, above other class 39 lakes.     Black crappie numbers have fluctuated similar to the bluegill population.  Black crappie were sampled at 1.1/gillnet, down from the two previous surveys of 10.3/gillnet (1991) and 6.3/gillnet (1986).  Black crappie gillnet catches prior to the operation of the aeration system were lower, ranging from 0.0/net (1972) to 1.8/net (1955).  Black crappie up to 11.6 inches were sampled.  Black crappie growth was below the average lengths of other class 39 lakes.      One largemouth bass (15.0 inches) was sampled, down from past surveys.  Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective tools in assessing largemouth bass populations.  To adequately assess largemouth bass abundance and size distribution, special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted on Stocking Lake.  Stocking Lake has good spawning areas and aquatic vegetation habitat that will insure a largemouth bass population, however, numbers will vary with periodic winterkills.     The yellow perch gillnet catch of 15.5/net is within the range typical of lake class 39.  Historical yellow perch gillnet catches have fluctuated from low to high numbers (1.5/net -138.8/net).  Yellow perch provide a forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations and are too small to provide a fishery to the angler.  Average size of the yellow perch was 6.3 inches.     Yellow, brown, and black bullhead were sampled in Stocking Lake.  Brown and black bullhead were sampled in low numbers, while yellow bullheads were sampled in moderate numbers (2.7/trapnet).  Yellow and brown bullhead catches have been similar in past surveys, while black bullhead numbers have been declining since the operation of the aeration system.  Black bullhead are able to with stand low dissolved oxygen readings and are a indicator species of lakes suffering winterkill events.  Black bullhead gillnet catches were high in 1972 (13.4/net) and 1974(61.5/net), but have declined since operation of the aeration system: 5.8/net (1981), 1.0/net (1986), 1.8/net (1991), and 0.1/net (1996).     White sucker were sampled in high numbers (12.4/net).  Historical white sucker gillnet catches have fluctuated from moderate to high numbers.     Carp and bowfin (dogfish) were sampled in numbers similar to previous surveys.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were sampled in low numbers.     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but to release medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Stocking Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

Yellow perch were also above average and much higher than the surveys conducted in 1972 and 1973.Management Recommendations:In order to maintain a walleye fishery, fingerling stocking should be continued for lack of good spawning area.  Walleye fingerlings should be stocked at the rate of 0.5 pounds per littoral acre, the rate of fingerlings should be 50 fish per pound or larger, and stocked in alternate years.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1981.  All other species have adequate spawning area to propagate without stocking.  The rough fish population is no problem at this time.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stocking Lake is located two miles east of Menahga in northern Wadena County.  Stocking Lake is a shallow lake and has a surface area of 357 acres and a maximum depth of 22 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the east shore of the lake.  Stocking provides angling opportunities for Panfish, Northern Pike, and Walleye. <br> \nSince 1975, the Stocking Lake Association has operated two aeration systems to help prevent oxygen depletion and winterkill.  Winter anglers should be aware of these open water areas that are maintained during the winter months.   <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Stocking is in lake class 39.  Class 39 lakes are characterized as being shallow and have a large littoral area (water depth less than 15 feet).   Other class 39 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include: First Crow Wing, Fourth Crow Wing, Portage, and Upper Twin.  <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice for anglers on Stocking Lake.  Panfish populations in Stocking Lake have fluctuated from low to high numbers over the years.  Black Crappies were found in very high numbers in 2021, with most fish ranging in size from 7.5 - 9.5 inches in length.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers, with fish up to 8.5 inches in length.  Pumpkinseed were also sampled in moderate numbers. <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant Northern Pike population, with very few large pike.  Northern Pike ranged from 12 - 28 inches in length and were spread evenly throughout this size range. <br> \nWalleye numbers were low, and below all but one past survey.  All sampled Walleye were 11-15 inches in length.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in good numbers. Sampled Yellow Perch were small for anglers, with most fish 5.5 - 8 inches. <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Stocking Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Catch rates of walleye (3.00 fish/gillnet - 5.23 lbs/gillnet) were within the normal ranges for Lake Class 39 of the Schupp Classification System, recovering from a low year in 1986.  Mean weight of walleye sampled was 1.74 lbs.  The present PSD of 67 indicates good size structure, however, there are no preferred length fish.  Walleye growth rates are slow and variable.  The overall mean length at age 5 is 14.34 inches, but the individual year class mean lengths at age 5 range from 12.96 to 15.82 inches.  This variability may be the result of stocking different sizes of fingerlings as a complement to natural recruits.  Walleye in Stocking Lake are capable of natural reproduction, as evidenced by the 1988 year class, which appears as strong as some stocked year classes.Northern pike catch rates (8.25 fish/gillnet and 20.98 lbs/gillnet) also fell within the normal ranges.  These numbers result in a good mean weight of 2.54 lbs.  Both numbers and sizes of northern pike have fluctuated since 1955, but abundance has generally been increasing.  Northern pike exhibit good growth after a slow first year, averaging 20.82 inches at age 4.  However, there is high variability among individuals and year classes.  The PSD (64) and RSD-P (3) indicate good size distributions, but like the walleye population, there are few preferred length fish.Largemouth bass, pumpkinseed and yellow perch catches were within the normal ranges for lakes of this classification.  Largemouth bass numbers and sizes have shown only slight changes since 1955, always remaining near the first quartiles.  Pumpkinseed abundance had been above the third quartile since 1972 before decreasing sharply in 1991.  The size distribution of pumpkinseed is poor (PSD=78).  Most fish are in one size class and no fish reach preferred lengths (RSD-P=0), however, small fish may not have been efficiently sampled as few pumpkinseed less than 6.0 inches were caught.  Yellow perch density has also greatly decreased since 1986 when it was well above the third quartile.  Size structure of yellow perch is very small (PSD=0).  Numbers of bluegill sampled (28.70 fish/trapnet) fell within the normal range, but 7.83 lbs/trapnet was above the third quartile.  Bluegill abundance, like pumpkinseed and yellow perch, decreased sharply since 1986, but numbers are still higher than they were in 1955 and 1972.  Bluegill exhibit slow growth (5.72 inches mean length at age 5), resulting in a size distribution (PSD=81) similar to the pumpkinseed.  Catch rates of black crappie are below the first quartile for trapnets and above the third quartile for gillnets.  The overall trend has been increasing densities since 1955.  Growth rates are slow, with age 4 black crappie averaging 6.81 inches.  Size structure is good (PSD=66), however, there again are no prefered length fish.White sucker catch rates were above the third quartile in 1991, regaining strength in numbers that had been decreasing since 1955.  Sizes are also increasing.  Black bullhead and carp numbers were below the first quartile for lakes of this class.  Carp were first sampled in 1986.  Catches of bowfin, yellow bullhead and brown bullhead were within the normal ranges.  None of these species have been a problem in the past.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stocking Lake is located two miles east of Menahga in northern Wadena County.  Stocking Lake has a surface area of 343 acres and a maximum depth of 22 feet.  Starting in 1975, the Stocking Lake Association has operated two bubbler type aeration systems to help prevent oxygen depletion and winterkill.  Two open water areas are maintained during the winter, however low dissolved oxygen levels can still occur.  There is a state-owned public access located on the east shore of the lake.  Stocking provides angling opportunities for walleye, northern pike, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Stocking is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Hennepin, Paine, Peysensky, Upper Twin, Wolf, and Hungryman. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was up from previous surveys, with the gillnet catch rate above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and the current management goal.  Walleye numbers in past surveys have generally fluctuated within the \"typical\" range.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 18.2 inches and 2.3 pounds with fish measured up to 24.8 inches.  While natural reproduction occurs, a successful DNR stocking program is helping to maintain the walleye population in Stocking Lake.  Evaluations showed the strongest year classes were from stocked years.  Stocking Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in good numbers.  Yellow perch abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to very high numbers.  Sampled yellow perch were small, with few perch an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were abundant, with the gillnet catch rate well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to the previous survey in 2001.  Northern pike abundance in earlier surveys was lower, fluctuating within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 20.7 inches and 2.0 pounds, with pike measured up to 34 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice for anglers, especially during the winter season.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to high numbers.  Bluegill were sampled in high numbers, similar to the previous survey in 2001.  Sampled bluegill had an average length of 5.9 inches.  The proportion of bluegill sampled over 7 inches was low when compared to other area lakes.  Good numbers of pumpkinseed are also found in Stocking.  Sampled pumpkinseed ran small in size with an average length of 5.5 inches.  The operation of the aeration system since 1975 has helped to increase and stabilize the sunfish population. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are found in low to moderate numbers in Stocking Lake.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time, and largemouth bass catch rates were low when compared to other area lakes.  Stocking Lake has aquatic vegetation habitat that will support a largemouth bass population, however numbers and sizes of bass will vary with partial winterkill events. <br> \n <br> \nCarp are present in Stocking and their abundance was up from past surveys.  Other species sampled included moderate numbers of white sucker and bowfin (dogfish), and low numbers of shorthead redhorse, black bullhead, and brown bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stocking Lake is located two miles east of Menahga in northern Wadena County.  Stocking Lake has a surface area of 343 acres and a maximum depth of 22 feet.  Starting in 1975, the Stocking Lake Association has operated two bubbler type aeration systems to help prevent oxygen depletion and winterkill.  Two open water areas are maintained during the winter, however, low dissolved oxygen levels can still occur.  There is a state-owned public access located on the east shore of the lake.  Stocking Lake provides angling opportunities for walleye, northern pike, and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Stocking is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Hennepin, Paine, Peysensky, Upper Twin, Wolf, and Hungryman.Walleye abundance (1.8 walleye/gillnet) was down from previous surveys and below the management goal of 4.0 walleye/gillnet.  This walleye gillnet catch rate of 1.8 walleye/gillnet is at the low end of the \"typical\" range for this lake class.  Walleye numbers in past surveys have generally fluctuated within this \"typical\" range.  Walleye were quality sized with an average length and weight of 18.2 inches and 2.2 pounds and with fish measured up to 28.6 inches.  A successful DNR stocking program is maintaining the walleye population in Stocking Lake as age analysis showed minimal contribution from natural reproduction.  Stocking Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in low numbers.  Yellow perch abundance in past surveys have fluctuated from low to very high numbers.  The yellow perch population in Stocking Lake are small in size with few perch of an acceptable size for angling.Northern pike numbers were way up in Stocking with the catch rate of 21.1 pike/gillnet well above the \"typical\" range for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance in past surveys has fluctuated, but  generally been within this \"typical\" range.  The northern pike sample was dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike with an average length and weight of 19.3 inches and 1.5 pounds.  The northern pike population in Stocking Lake is limited by high reproduction and recruitment of young pike and slow growth rates.Panfish are a popular choice for anglers especially during the winter season.  Black crappie numbers were down from previous surveys and were sampled at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Black crappie abundance in past surveys have fluctuated from low to high numbers.  Black crappie up to 10.2 inches  were sampled.  Bluegill numbers were up with the trapnet catch rate of 49.2 bluegill/net above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Average size of bluegill was only 5.6 inches, however, larger bluegill are present with fish measured up to 8.7 inches.  Good numbers of pumpkinseed are also found in Stocking.  Pumpkinseed ran small in size with an average length of 4.9 inches with fish measured up to 7.6 inches.  The operation of the aeration system since 1975 has helped to increase and stabilize the sunfish populations.Largemouth bass are found in low to moderate numbers in Stocking Lake.  Stocking Lake has aquatic vegetation habitat that will support a largemouth bass population, however, numbers will vary with periodic partial winterkills.Other species sampled included high numbers of white sucker and moderate numbers yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and carp.  Black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), shorthead redhorse, and rock bass were sampled in low numbers.</p>",
