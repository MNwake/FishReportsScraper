                "narrative": "<p>    Round Lake is a riverine lake on the Platte River downstream from Sullivan Lake.  The lake has experienced increased development but still remains primarily wooded.  Water clarity was good for this time of year with a secchi disk reading of 9 feet.  Access to the lake is gained off the township road south of the bridge over the outlet (Platte River).  Water level in the river was low this summer due to little rainfall over the summer.  Dense wild rice stands in the channel and the low water level limited access to the lake except for small boats.  Aquatic vegetation grew out to a depth of 12 feet with coontail, northern milfoil, and Robbins' pondweed being the most common submerged vegetation.  Some curled pondweed grows in the lake near the mouth of the outlet and is more evident in the spring.  The most common emergent species was wild rice which was most abundant on the west side of the lake and in the outlet.  Sand was the most common shallow water substrate found around the lake.\n    The lake supports a diverse fish community that can provide good angling opportunities with panfish and northern pike being the most sought after.  Northern pike numbers came down somewhat since the last survey and the average size seen in the survey was about 20 inches or 1.8 pounds although larger pike are present.  The walleye population is maintained by natural reproduction and while numbers appear to be below the desired management goal, they were within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  A range of sizes was seen in the survey and a spring assessment that was conducted on the lake with trophy size fish being observed in both.  The largemouth bass netted in the lake survey were probably about the size that most anglers would catch, 10 to 14 inches.  Previous surveys, however, have indicated that the lake can produce trophy size fish up to 20 inches.  Black crappies and bluegills provide good fishing year-round with \"keeper\" size fish in both populations.  Other fish species in Round Lake include black bullheads, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullheads, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullheads.  Yellow perch and common carp were caught in the spring nets but not in the summer survey.  The bullheads averaged about 10 inches in length with some up to 14 inches being documented.  \n      Protection of the diverse aquatic plant communities in the lake should be a high priority of lakeshore owners and public officials.  Natural shorelines provide fish and wildlife habitat, absorb nutrients, and stablize the shoreline against erosion.  Anglers and spearers are encouraged to harvest small northern pike (under 24 inches) and release larger pike.  Limiting the harvest of bluegills over 7 inches and black crappies over 10 inches is also encouraged to reduce the potential of overharvest.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     A late June panfish assessment was conducted on Round Lake to evaluate the Black Crappie and Bluegill population size structures.  The spring netting was done in conjunction with a late July population assessment which consisted of gill nets to evaluate the gamefish populations.  Six lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice for a total of twelve net lifts.  All fish species caught were measured.  Scales were collected from both Black Crappie and Bluegill for age data. <br> \n     Spring ice-out and warmer weather was unusually late in 2013.  Previous panfish assessments had been conducted in early to mid-June on Round Lake.  The 25 Black Crappie caught (2/TN) was the lowest crappie catch of the three panfish assessments conducted in 2013, 2007, and 2001.  Even the last summer trap nets set in 2001 caught more crappie, (n=33, 4.2/TN).   Catches of 60 fish (3.5/TN) and 75 fish (4.2/TN) were recorded in 2007 and 2001, respectively.   All but the 2013 catch met the lake management goal of at least three crappie per trap net.    <br> \n     Crappie in the 2013 panfish assessment ranged from 4 to 11.5 inches in length with a mean length of 8.2 inches and modal length of 7.5 - 8 inches for the sample.   Fish exceeding nine inches accounted for 40% (n=10) of the sample with 20% (n=5) more than ten inches in length.  The 2001 crappie catch displayed the most desirable size structure with fish up to 11.6 inches measured and a mean length of 8.6 inches for the sample.  Modal length was 9 - 9.5 inches with 51% (n=38) exceeding nine inches and 16% (n=12) more than ten inches in length.   <br> \n      The 2007 Black Crappie catch displayed the least desirable size structure characteristics of the three panfish assessments.   The longest fish was 10.9 inches and mean length for the sample was 7.1 inches.  Smaller fish dominated the catch as the modal length was 5 - 5.5 inches and only 15% (n=9) of the fish exceeded nine inches with 3% (n=2) more than ten inches.   The 2001 summer trap net catch also displayed some desirable characteristics with the modal length of 9 - 9.5 inches and 45% (n=15) of the fish exceeding nine inches and 18% (n=6) more than ten inches in length.  Two of the panfish assessments, 2013 and 2001, along with the 2001 summer survey catch met a management goal of 30% of the Black Crappie caught exceeding nine inches in length. <br> \n      Black Crappie were also caught in the 2013 summer gill nets as well as the spring electrofishing effort.    The gill net catch consisted of 51 crappie (8.5/GN) between four and eleven inches in length with a mean length of 5.2 inches for the sample.  Smaller fish dominated the catch as 49% (n=25) of the crappie were in the modal length group of 4 - 4.5 inches.  Only one fish (2%) was more than nine inches in length.  Twelve crappie were netted during the 2013 spring electrofishing effort for Largemouth Bass.  The fish ranged from 7.6 to 11.6 inches in length with a mean length of 10.2 inches for the sample.   Crappie exceeding nine inches comprised 83% (n=10) of the catch with 58% (n=7) more than ten inches.  The electrofishing catch was more representative of a spawning adult population than that from the gill nets.   <br> \n      Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the 2013 panfish assessment.  The 2010 year class accounted for 40% of the sample.  All age groups showed normal growth rates when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n     The 2013 panfish assessment recorded the most desirable Bluegill population size structure in comparison to previous panfish assessments and the summer trap nets.  A total of 172 Bluegill (14.3/TN) were caught between 2.9 and 9.7 inches in length with a mean length of 6.4 inches for the sample.  Modal length for the sample was 6.5 - 7 inches with 34% (n=58) of the fish more than seven inches in length and 8% (n=2) exceeding eight inches.   <br> \n     The 2007 Bluegill catch (n=161; 9.5/TN) also had a modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches, but the longest Bluegill caught was 8.4 inches and mean length for the sample was 6.2 inches.  Fish exceeding seven inches accounted for 18% (n= 29) with 1% (n=2) more than eight inches.   The 2001 panfish assessment (n=246; 13.7/TN) and summer trap nets (n=190; 21.1/TN) produced mixed results.  The summer trap nets caught the largest Bluegill, 8.7 inches, compared to 8.5 inches in the spring netting.  Mean length was better in the spring assessment, 5.8 inches, compared to 5.4 inches in the summer nets.  The spring modal length was also better, 6 - 6.5 inches, compared to 4.5 - 5 inches in the summer.  However, a greater portion of the summer catch exceeded seven inches, 8% (n=15) compared to 6% (n=14) in the spring.  Also 2% (n=3) of the Bluegill in the summer catch were more than eight inches in length compared to 0.8% (n=2) in the spring catch.  <br> \n     Ages 2 through 7, 9 and 10 were represented in the 2013 panfish assessment.  The 2009 year class comprised the greatest portion of the Bluegill sample, accounting for 35% of the catch.  Growth appeared normal for age 2 fish and fast in the older age groups when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  High mortality evident in fish six years of age and older. <br> \n     Other panfish species netted in Round Lake were hybrid sunfish and Pumpkinseed.  The Pumpkinseed sampled were between 4.5 and 7.9 inches in length.  Gamefish species caught in the 2013 panfish assessment included five Northern Pike between 13 and 19.5 inches in length as well as two Walleye, one 17.5 inches and the other 27.5 inches.   Additional fish species sampled were Bowfin, Common Carp, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

Largemouth bass are about average in number and size.  Yellow perch were fairly abundant in the NRC.  Yellow bullheads were taken in good numbers and size, but do not pose a problem.

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a riverine lake influenced by the Platte River.  The lake currently has relatively light development for a lake in this area of the state.  The lake's watershed is primarily woodland and marsh with minimal agricultural impacts.  Water clarity was good for this time of year with a secchi disk reading of 8 feet.  Access to the lake is gained off the township road south of bridge over the outlet (Platte River).  Water levels in the river can affect ease of access to the lake.    The lake supports a diverse fish community that can provide good angling opportunities.  The walleye population is maintained by natural reproduction and while numbers appear to have declined from the last survey, they are at a level normal for this type of lake.  Average size of the walleye seen in the survey was almost 2 pounds.  Northern pike numbers have increased with the average size about 1.5 pounds with an occassional large pike being reported.  While the largemouth bass population appears low, the lake does have some quality fish with bass up to 18 inches being observed.  Black crappies and bluegills provide good fishing year-round with \"keeper\" size fish in both populations.  Yellow perch numbers also appeared to have declined from the last survey which could be a response to increased pressure from the higher pike numbers.  Perch can be an important food species for the gamefish in the lake and can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  Other fish species in Round Lake include white suckers, black bullheads, bowfin, pumpkinseeds, brown bullheads, rock bass, hybrid sunfish, and yellow bullheads.  Average size of the pumpkinseeds was 5 inches.  The majority of bullheads seen in the survey were less than 10 inches in length, however some up to 14 inches were documented.    Protection of the diverse aquatic plant communities in the lake should be a high priorty of lakeshore owners and public officials.  Natural shorelines provide fish and wildlife habitat, tie-up nutrients, and stablize the shorelines thus reducing erosion.  Anglers and spearers are encouraged to harvest small northern pike (under 24 inches) and release larger pike.  Limiting the  harvest of the bluegills over 7 inches and black crappies over 10 inches is also encouraged to reduce the potential of overharvest. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a riverine lake influenced by the Platte River.  It has a goodpopulation of walleye and low numbers of northern pike.  The largest walleyeobserved during sampling was 21.5 inches, however, fish up to twenty-seven incheshave been observed in previous surveys.  The population is sustained throughnatural reproduction.  The majority of the northern pike sampled were less than 24inches in length, however, the lake does have the potential to produce largernorthern pike as fish over 30 inches have been observed.  The lake does producetrophy largemouth  bass as fish up to 20 inches were sampled during nightelectrofishing.  Black crappies provide an important winter fishery.  Average sizeof the crappies was about 8 inches with fish up to 12 inches being present.  Netcatches indicate  a low abundance of bluegill.  Some 8 inch fish were observed, butthe average size was about 6 inches.  Yellow perch numbers have increased, however,abundance is moderate and growth is slow.  Perch may be an important prey speciesfor the walleye and northern pike populations.  Roughfish species in the lakeinclude bowfin, carp, white suckers and bullheads.     Access to the lake is obtained by the Platte River off County Road #273 westof the lake.  Low water periods limit size of boats capable of accessing the lakethrough the river.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    An early June trapnet assessment was conducted in Round Lake to evaluate the panfish populations in conjunction with the late July lake survey.  Six lake survey trapnets were lifted three times for a total of 17 net lifts.  The black crappies, bluegills, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye were all measured and scale samples taken from the panfish for age and growth analysis. <br> \n    The nets captured 58 black crappies (3.5/trapnet) ranging from 4 to 11 inches in length with a mean length of 7.1 inches and modal length of 5 - 5.5 inches.  Those crappies exceeding 9 inches accounted for 16% (n=9) of the sample.  A similar trapnet assessment was conducted in early June of 2001 which had 18 net lifts.  A more desirable population size structure was displayed from that assessment.  The crappies (n=75; 4.2/trapnet)  were from 5 to 12 inches with a mean length of 8.6 inches and modal length of 9 - 9.5 inches.  About half (51%) of the crappies were over 9 inches in length.  Trapnets were also set during the 2001 summer survey while they were not used in the 2007 summer survey.  The summer trapnets in 2001 caught 33 crappies (3.7/trapnet) which fell within the normal range for the lake class (interquartile range = 0.8 - 4.3).  The fish were between 4 and 11 inches in length with a mean length of 7.9 inches and the same modal length as the spring assessment, 9 - 9.5 inches.  Crappies exceeding 9 inches accounted for 45% (n=15) of the sample.  The 2007 summer gillnets netted 18 crappies for a catch rate of 3/set which fell within the normal range for lake class 29 (interquartile range = 1 - 4.8).  The length distribution and mean length was the same as that from the 2007 spring assessment, however, the modal lengths were more desirable, 6.5 - 7 and 7.5 - 8 inches.  Only 6% (n=1) of the crappies in the gillnet catch exceeded 9 inches.  The trapnet catches in the panfish assessments and the 2001 summer survey met the management goal of maintaining a trapnet catch of 3/set but the 2007 catches fell below the goal of at least 30% of the fish exceeding 9 inches in length.  Ages 2 thru 7 were represented in the 2007 spring assessment with all but the age 6 fish (n=1) displaying normal growth.  Year class strength suggests consistent recruitment.  Ages 2, 3, and 8 were represented in the 2007 summer survey with the majority of the aged fish displaying normal growth also. <br> \n    The 2007 panfish assessment netted 161 bluegills ranging from 3 to 8.4 inches with a mean length of 6.2 inches and modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches.  Bluegills exceeding 7 inches accounted for 18% (n=29) of the sample which was just below the management goal of at least 20% of the trapnet catch more than 7 inches in length.  Smaller bluegills comprised more of the catch in the 2001 panfish assessment.  The trapnets sampled 246 bluegills between 3 and 8.5 inches in length with a mean length of 5.8 inches and modal length of 6 - 6.5 inches.  Only 6% (n=14) of the bluegills exceeded 7 inches.  The 2001 summer trapnets caught 190 bluegills (21/set) which was within the normal range for the lake class (interquartile range = 8.2 - 50).  The fish ranged from 3 to 9 inches in length with a mean length of 5.4 inches and modal length of 4.5 - 5 inches.  Bluegills more than 7 inches in length accounted for 8% (n=15) of that sample.  Ages 2 thru 8 were represented in the 2007 spring assessment with ages 2 thru 4 and 6 exhibiting normal growth and ages 5, 7, and 8 fast growth.  A strong year class from 2002 accounted for 62% of the catch. <br> \n     The gamefish that were sampled in the 2007 panfish assessment included one 12.4-inch largemouth bass, 14 northern pike between 10 and 25 inches, and 7 walleye from 23 to 28 inches in length.   Other fish species caught included black bullheads, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullheads, common carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, yellow bullheads, and yellow perch. <br> \n     An area mean back-calculated length table was used to compare growth rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Round Lake is a riverine lake on the Platte River downstream from Sullivan Lake. The lake shore has experienced increased development but still remains primarily wooded. Access to the lake is gained off the township road south of the bridge over the outlet (Platte River).  Water level and dense vegetation beds in the river channel can influence lake accessibility.   <br> \n       The lake supports a diverse fish community that can provide good angling opportunities with panfish and Northern Pike the most sought after species. Northern Pike abundance was higher than desired but within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  Average size in the survey was about 21 inches or 1.9 pounds although larger pike are present. The Walleye population is maintained by natural reproduction and while numbers appear to be below the desired management goal, they were within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  The fish averaged around 20 inches or 3.2 pounds in the survey and trophy size fish have been documented in previous surveys.  Spring electrofishing showed that most Largemouth Bass were in the 10 - 14 inch range , which is the size that most anglers could expect to catch, although fish up to 19 inches were netted. <br> \n         Black Crappie and Bluegill provide good fishing year-round with \"keeper\" size fish in both populations. Yellow Perch were one species which showed an increase in abundance since the last survey which should benefit the fish community.  Perch can be an important prey species for predator fish such as Northern Pike, Walleye, and Largemouth Bass.  Other fish species in Round Lake include Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  Common Carp are present but in numbers not considered detrimental to the lake's habitat.  <br> \n         Protection of the diverse aquatic plant communities in the lake should be a high priority of lakeshore owners and public officials. Natural shorelines provide fish and wildlife habitat, absorb nutrients, and stablize the shoreline against erosion. Anglers and spearers are encouraged to harvest small Northern Pike (under 24 inches) and release larger pike. Limiting the harvest of Bluegill over 7 inches and Black Crappie over 10 inches is also encouraged to reduce the potential of overharvest. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This Targeted Survey was completed in early June 2021 to collect size structure data of the sunfish (mainly Bluegill) population prior to effects of a five-fish sunfish bag regulation which began in March 2021. The regulation is intended to increase the numbers of large sunfish in Round Lake NE. It usually takes 5-10 years for a Bluegill population to show any changes resulting from a special regulation. The statewide bag limit for sunfish is 20; when fishing is good and anglers are allowed to keep 20, they usually keep as many large sunfish as allowed (often this equates to 20 fish). By reducing the allowable harvest, anglers end up keeping fewer fish which includes large fish by default.  <br> \n <br> \nFor Round Lake NE, we want to collect \"before and after\" data to see if the regulation improves the average size of sunfish caught by anglers. For this survey, we caught 151 Bluegills ranging in size from 3.0-9.7 inches; average length was 7.3 inches. One way to describe the quality of a Bluegill fishery is the proportion of Bluegill measuring over 8 inches. For this survey, 23% of Bluegills measured over 8 inches. Fisheries staff will be monitoring Round Lake NE in the future using trap nets during the spring to track size-structure changes in the sunfish population. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake NE is a small, 130-acre lake located in northeastern Morrison County, about 20 miles west-northwest of Onamia. The lake is moderately developed with cabins, but mostly on the north side. Otherwise, the lake has a natural feel with a wooded shoreline. Emergent vegetation is common, especially on the west side of the lake where the public access is located directly off county road 149. This is the outlet to the Platte River and anglers must navigate upstream 1,500 feet through a slow-flowing channel of wild rice to access the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nRound's water quality is good with clarity ranging from 5 to 12 feet depending on rainfall amounts. Water color is stained like root beer. The lake supports several gamefish species including Northern Pike, Walleye, Yellow Perch, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Black Crappie naturally - the lake has never been stocked. While a fishery for pike and Walleye exists, the Bluegill fishery is most noteworthy. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills caught during the spring with trap nets indicate the population is not overly-abundant and is comprised of good average-sized fish. Over a third of Bluegills sampled measured eight inches or more. A proposal for a special regulation that would reduce the sunfish bag limit to 5 will be floated to the public in 2020. The regulation, if approved, would take effect sometime in 2021. As a small lake with a potentially fragile Bluegill population, precautions should be taken to ensure that this quality fishery lasts into the future.  In general, fisheries managers recommend keeping more abundant bluegills in the 6 and 7 inch range, limiting harvest of 8 inch fish, and releasing trophy bluegills exceeding 9 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nStandard summer netting surveys show no increasing or decreasing trends with regard to Northern Pike and Walleye abundance.  Numbers have remained stable for 20 years. Both populations can be described as low-density, with adult sizes ranging from 15-30 and 15-22 inches for pike and Walleye, respectively. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass, like pike and Walleye are low-density, but fish up to 18 inches are present. Yellow Perch, a preferred prey species, have fluctuated in abundance since 2001. At this time, they appear to be very low in abundance but historically have shown the ability to bounce back. A healthy perch population is essential in any lake if pike and Walleye are to thrive. <br> \n</p>",
