                "narrative": "<p>Evergreen Lake (29-0227-00) is a 213.31-acre lake with a maximum depth of 38 feet located near Lake George, MN.  Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 18, 2023, to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, six sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Site conditions prevented the use of seines at four sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites with one being conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured twelve species of fish including three species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Blacknose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Black Bullhead, Central Mudminnow, Green Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Tadpole Madtom, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on May 30, 2023 to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Evergreen Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Evergreen Lake is located in the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

Evergreen has a surface area of 213 acres and a maximum depth of 38 feet.  A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the north shore of the lake off Schoolcraft Trail.  Evergreen provides a diverse fishery to the angler, including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, panfish, and a bonus Walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Evergreen is in lake class 31.  Class 31 lakes have hard water and a regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, Boulder, Duck, Lower Twin, Hattie, Hinds, and Tripp. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant Northern Pike population in Evergreen.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 21.1 inches and 2.4 pounds, with fish measured up to 34.9 inches.  Evergreen supports a healthy Largemouth Bass population in both numbers and size of bass.  Anglers will find good numbers of Largemouth Bass in the 12 to 16 inch size range and bass up to 19.5 inches were sampled during the survey.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass, panfish, and Northern Pike in Evergreen.  Present and past surveys have shown the panfish population to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers in Evergreen and can provide good fishing for Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie.  Walleye were sampled in low numbers.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers.   Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye and Northern Pike were sampled in moderate numbers with fish measured up to 10.4 inches.  Other species sampled included moderate numbers of Yellow Bullhead, Rock Bass, Green Sunfish, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Evergreen.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Evergreen Lake is located in northern Hubbard County, eight miles north of Lake George.  Evergreen Lake has a surface area of 200 acres and a maximum depth of 38 feet.  Bulrush beds ring most of the lake and dense stands of submerged aquatic vegetation are found in the shallow, shoreline areas.  A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the north shore of the lake.  There is one resort and 27 cabins on the lake.  Evergreen provides a diverse fishery to the angler, including northern pike, panfish, largemouth bass, and a bonus walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Evergreen Lake is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Boulder, 2nd-5th-6th-7th and 8th Crow Wing Lakes, Duck, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, Tripp, and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was down, with the gillnet catch rate of 1.3 walleye/net.  The previous survey in 2003 had a similar walleye gillnet catch rate (1.6 walleye/net), while earlier surveys had catch rates around 3.0 walleye/gillnet.  The walleye population in Evergreen Lake is maintained through fingerling stockings by the DNR.  Northern pike abundance was up, with the gillnet catch rate of 19.1 pike/gillnet the highest recorded for all surveys.  Past surveys have sampled northern pike in low to moderate numbers in the 1980's and early 1990's.  Pike numbers exploded in the 1998 survey and have remained high since that time.  Small, \"hammer handle\" northern pike dominated the sample as average length and weight was only 17.7 inches and 1.2 pounds.  The number of larger northern pike (> 28.0 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes.  The abundant northern pike population in recent years may be limiting walleye numbers by competition for food and predation on small walleye by northern pike.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed were sampled in moderate numbers, and anglers will find good numbers of in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers.  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate levels.  Anglers have reported good largemouth bass fishing in past years on Evergreen Lake.  No special sampling such as electrofishing has been done on Evergreen Lake to adequately assess the largemouth bass population.  Other species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead, and low numbers of while sucker, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and golden shiner. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Evergreen Lake is located 7 miles north of Lake George in northern Hubbard County. Evergreen has a surface area of 213 acres with a maximum depth of 38 feet.  A public access is located on the north end of the lake off Schoolcraft Trail. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Evergreen is in Lake Class 31. Class 31 lakes generally have very hard water, and regularly shaped shorelines. Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Second, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Crow Wing, Boulder, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, Trip and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of northern pike in Evergreen, but of small size. Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 1.5 pounds, with pike measured up to 31 inches. Walleye abundance was low compared to past surveys. Sampled fish had a great average size for anglers with most fish sampled 17 - 21 inches. Yellow perch were seen in average numbers, but most fish were too small for angling, with most 5-7 inches.  The yellow perch are important to the lake, providing a great forage base for northern pike and walleyes.  Largemouth bass were sampled in similar numbers to past surveys.  Average size was very good, at 15 inches, with the largest being 18 inches. Evergreen supports a healthy panfish population and can provide good fishing especially for bluegill. Bluegills were sampled in high numbers, similar to past surveys. Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 5.5 - 8.5 inch size range. Black crappie size was poor for anglers, with only one fish over 10 inches sampled. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Evergreen. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

Evergreen has a surface area of 213 acres and a maximum depth of 38 feet.  A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the north shore off Schoolcraft Trail.  Evergreen provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, panfish, Largemouth Bass, and a bonus Walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Evergreen in in lake class 31.  Class 31 lakes have hard water and a regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, Boulder, Duck, Lower Twin, Hattie, Hinds, and Tripp. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant Northern Pike population, dominated by small sized fish.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length of 20.5 inches and weight of 2.0 pounds, with fish measured up to 35.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown the panfish populations to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers in Evergreen.  Good numbers of Bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 9-10 inch size range were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in low numbers.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Northern Pike and Walleye were sampled in moderate numbers with fish measured up to 9.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nEvergreen supports a low to moderate Largemouth Bass population when compared to other class 31 lakes.  Largemouth Bass were not sampled in the 2023 survey but were sampled in moderate numbers in the 2018 survey using spring electrofishing gear to specifically target Largemouth Bass populations.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of Rock Bass and Golden Shiner, and low numbers of Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Green Sunfish, and Tadpole Madtom. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Evergreen.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Evergreen Lake is located eight miles north of Lake George in northern Hubbard County.  Evergreen Lake has a surface area of 200 acres and a maximum depth of 38 feet.  Bulrush beds ring most of the lake and dense stands of submerged aquatic vegetation are found in the shallow, shoreline areas.  A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the north shore of the lake.  There is one resort and 23 cabins and homes on the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Evergreen Lake is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same class include: Hattie (1 mile southwest of Evergreen Lake), Second Crow Wing, and Fifth through Eighth Crow Wing Lakes (southeast of Park Rapids).  Evergreen Lake provides a diverse fishery to the angler, including northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and a bonus walleye population.Walleye were sampled in moderate numbers (3.1/gillnet), within the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  Walleye abundance was similar in the 1987 and 1992 surveys.  No walleye were sampled in the 1973 or 1981 surveys.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 20.2 inches and 2.7 lbs.  Walleye growth rates were slower than other area lakes.  The walleye population in Evergreen Lake is maintained entirely through stocking.  All walleye sampled in the 1998 survey were from stocked years.  Evergreen Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings in even years.  Evergreen Lake was stocked periodically with walleye fry from 1948 though 1972.  It was not until stocking was switched to fingerlings in 1979 that a walleye population was established.Northern pike were abundant (12.1/gillnet), above the \"normal range\" for this lake class. Northern pike abundance has been much lower in three of the past four surveys.  Northern pike were sampled at the low end or below the \"normal range\" in 1981, 1987, and 1992.  Northern pike abundance in a 1973 survey was similar to the 1998 survey.  Average size of northern pike  was 20.4 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Larger fish are present, however, with fish sampled up to 38.4 inches.The panfish fishery in Evergreen Lake is probably known more for quality than quantity.  Bluegill were sampled in low numbers, just within the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  Bluegill abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to high numbers.  Average size of bluegill was large (8.3 inches).  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers.  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers.Anglers have reported good largemouth bass fishing in recent years on Evergreen Lake.  No special sampling such as spring electrofishing has been done on Evergreen Lake to adequately assess the largemouth bass population.Other fish sampled in low to moderate numbers include: yellow perch, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, hybrid sunfish, and green sunfish.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing in Evergreen Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Evergreen Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gill net catch rates (3.00 fish/set and 7.93 lbs/set) were within the normal ranges for Lake Class 31.  Mean weight of individual walleye was a high 2.64 pounds.  The size structure (PSD=92, RSD-P=42) is also indicative of a large-sized walleye population.  Only one walleye sampled was < 15.0 inches, and 83% of the sampled walleye were age 6.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in Evergreen Lake at a good initial size, but slow growth rates through age 3 result in a mean length at age 3 of 10.60 inches.  Growth is fast after age 3 due to an abundance of 5.0 to 6.0 inch yellow perch.  The unusual age and size structures of the walleye population are the result of stocking.  There is no evidence of walleye natural reproduction in Evergreen Lake.  All of the walleye sampled represent two stocked year classes.  No walleye were sampled in the lake before intensive stocking efforts were undertaken.Gill net catch rates of northern pike (2.25 fish/set and 6.13 lbs/set) were below the first quartile for the first time in 1992.  A large decrease in abundance has occurred since 1973, along with a decrease in size since 1981.  Mean weight in 1992 was 2.72 pounds.  The size structure (PSD=75) indicates high numbers of quality-length northern pike; however, none sampled were > 27 inches.  Northern pike exhibit slow growth, averaging 18.76 inches at age 4.  These slow growth rates contribute to the absence of preferred-length northern pike.  Analysis of age structure suggests low annual northern pike recruitment.Pumpkinseed, bluegill and largemouth bass trap net catches were within the normal ranges for lakes in Class 31.  Pumpkinseed abundance was well above the third quartile in 1981.  Trap net catches from 1987 cannot be used for year comparisons of any species due to inefficient net sets.  Although a large proportion of pumpkinseed is larger than 6.0 inches (PSD=51), none reached preferred length.  The size structure of bluegill (PSD=91, RSD-P=5) indicates high numbers of quality-length fish, but very few fish over 8.0 inches.  This size structure is reflective of bluegill growth rates.  Bluegill exhibit good growth through age 4, when they average 6.06 inches.  However, after age 4, additional growth is minimal and no bluegill reach 8.0 inches by age 7.  Black crappie are not adequately sampled with lake survey gear; however, the population appears low.  Trap net catches of black crappie were below the first quartile in 1992.  Number of yellow perch sampled was well above the third quartile, whereas pounds per gill net were within the normal range.  The catch rates are indicative of the small size structure (PSD=0).  Yellow perch abundance has been above the third quartile since 1981.No non-game fish species have had nuisance populations in Evergreen Lake since the first survey in 1973.  Brown bullhead catch rates were below the first quartile in 1992 for Lake Class 31.  Catches of golden shiner, white sucker, rock bass, and green sunfish were all within the normal ranges.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Evergreen Lake is located in northern Hubbard County, eight miles north of Lake George.  Evergreen Lake has a surface area of 200 acres and a maximum depth of 38 feet.  Bulrush beds ring most of the lake and dense stands of submerged aquatic vegetation are found in the shallow, shoreline areas.  A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the north shore of the lake.  There is one resort and 27 cabins on the lake.  Evergreen Lake provides a diverse fishery to the angler, including northern pike, panfish, largemouth bass, and a bonus walleye population.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Evergreen Lake is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Boulder, 2nd-5th-6th-7th and 8th Crow Wing Lakes, Duck, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, Tripp, and Lower Twin.Walleye numbers were down in Evergreen Lake with the gillnet catch rate of 1.6 walleye/net below the management goal of 2.5 walleye/net.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has been just above the management goal, around 3.0 walleye/gillnet.  The walleye population in Evergreen Lake is maintained through fingerling stocking by the DNR.  Evergreen Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Northern pike abundance was up, with the gillnet catch rate of 16.5 pike/net the highest recorded for all surveys.  Small, \"hammer handle\" northern pike dominated the sample as average length and weight was only 19.4 inches and 1.6 pounds.  The number of larger northern pike (> 28.0 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers, similar to past surveys.  Anglers will find lots of bluegill in the 6.0 to 7.0 inch range.  Black crappies were sampled in low numbers.  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate levels.  Anglers have reported good largemouth bass fishing in past years on Evergreen Lake.  No special sampling such as spring electrofishing has been done on Evergreen Lake to adequately assess the largemouth bass population.  Other species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead and low numbers of brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, and rock bass.</p>",
