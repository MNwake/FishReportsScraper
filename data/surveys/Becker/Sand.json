Very high numbers of black bullhead, yellow perch and white sucker.  Walleye population appears to be increasing with 1-1/2 to 3 lb. fish common.  Walleye and northern pike show rapid growth.  Northern pike numbers are low due to lack of spawning habitat.  With present high water levels, some walleye natural reproduction is occurring, but the best represented year classes are from fry stocking years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Sand Lake was conducted over several days, beginning on June 21st, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 7 species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e. Iowa Darter) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 21st, 2021 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Buffalo River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Lake is a relatively small lake (197 acres) comprised of seven smaller, nearly separate basins.  It hasa history of widely fluctuating water levels (as much as 10 ft. or more in one year and 20 ft. over time).  Sandysoils near the top of an aquifer apparently make it unusually responsive to ground water fluctuations.   Low wateryears find some of the basins entirely separated.  Sand Lake has also been subject to periodic winterkills,particularily in low water years with severe winters.  The winter of 1993/94 was such an occasion and produceda nearly complete winterkill.  One northern pike, one yellow perch, 16 brown bullhead, and 20 black bullhead werecaptured in trapnets in the spring of 1994.  Adult bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, andwalleye fry were stocked in the spring of 94 to reestablish these species.     Test netting in June 1993, prior to the winterkill of 1993/94, found an abundance of white sucker, a goodwalleye population (5 per gillnet with an average weight of 2.7 lbs), modest populations of bullheads and yellowperch, a small northern pike population, and negligible sunfish populations.  The negligible panfish communityis testament to their susceptiblity to winterkill.  Both northern pike and walleye exhibited fast growth.        Past surveys indicate the fish community has fluctuated considerably over time.  Winterkills or partialwinterkills, fluctuating water levels affecting spawning success, and stocking (primarily walleye) are thepredominant factors affecting fish populations.  A number of consecutive high water years without winterkill canpotentially produce excellent fishing for a variety of gamefish species.  Although significant walleye naturalreproduction has occurred in optimum water level years, it has been routine walleye fry stocking that hassustained a fishery for this species.       Sand Lake is not only unique in its hydrogeologic characteristics but also in its rather pristine nature forthis area.  Only two homes are located on the lake and they are set back from the shore.  A blue heron, egret,and cormorant rookery is located on the northeast shore.  The lake has not only provided periodically good fishingbut also asthetically satisfying experiences for many local anglers.  Minimal disturbance of its existing natureshould be a high priority.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand (Stump) Lake is a 200-acre lake positioned on the county line between Becker and Clay County, five miles southwest of the city of Lake Park. The lake includes many small basins and is subject to extreme water level fluctuations. Sand Lake is very productive and possesses a relatively undeveloped shoreline.  This lake maintains a robust fishery with angling opportunity for Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. A special regulation of five sunfish per day was implemented in March 2022. A standard fisheries survey was completed on Sand Lake in June 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2021 was similar to past surveys, with gill nets catching an average of six Walleye per net. Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 8.4 to 25.7 inches, averaging 20.1 inches long. Walleye exhibited fast growth, reaching an average length of 18.5 inches by age four. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has historically been low in Sand Lake, but gill nets caught a record-high number of fish in 2021 (26 fish per net). Sampled pike ranged in length from 14.5 to 29.0 inches, averaging 21.0 inches long. Almost 13% of pike measured were 24 inches or longer.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 2021 was average, but lower than what was observed in 2015. In 2021, trap nets caught an average of eight Bluegill per net. Sampled Bluegill ranged in length from 2.9 to 9.9 inches, averaging 6.9 inches long. Bluegill grow fast in Sand Lake, averaging 8 inches by age four.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance in Sand Lake has varied in the last three surveys, ranging between five (2021) and 65 (2015) perch per gill net. Perch sampled in 2021 ranged in length from 5.0 to 7.9 inches, averaging 6.1 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 13 Black Crappie were caught in combined gears in 2021. Sampled cappie ranged in length from 3.9 to 11.9 inches. Similar to crappie, Largemouth Bass have not been abundant in sampling gear in Sand Lake. A total of three Largemouth Bass were caught in 2021 ranging in size from six to 17 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the 2021 survey included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, and White Sucker. Brown Bullhead were the dominant bullhead species caught and the remainder of sampled species were relatively low in catch. Anglers can help maintain and improve Sand Lake's fishery by practicing selective harvest and releasing larger fish, as well as taking precautions to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Lake has experienced one severe winterkill during the past 29 years.  During early 1994, all but the species most tolerant of low levels of dissolved oxygen succumbed to winterkill.  Black and brown bullhead were the most abundant survivors at that time. <br> \n <br> \nIn the spring of 1994, walleyes, bluegills, black crappies, largemouth bass, and yellow perch were reintroduced in the lake.  In order to give these species a head start over larger predators, northern pike were not stocked until two years later. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2008, the reintroduced gamefish and panfish species appear to be surviving and providing modest fishing opportunities.  Like fish in many winterkill lakes, those in Sand Lake grow rapidly due to the lake's productivity and to a lack of competition following winterkill.  Although numbers of fish are not high, the average sizes of northern pike and walleye in 2008 were relatively large at 5.7 pounds and 5.3 pounds, respectively. <br> \n <br> \nOne of the reasons walleye sizes averaged this large is that young fish were lacking.  Unless there is a winterkill, walleyes are likely the only species of those listed above that requires continued stocking in Sand Lake to sustain the fishery.  The other popular species usually have access to acceptable spawning habitat except when water levels fluctuate too rapidly.  Walleyes have been stocked biennially in Sand Lake for several years, but the two most recent stockings have apparently not survived well for unknown reasons.  The walleye fry stocking rate was doubled in 2008 and this rate is scheduled to continue for several years.  Future studies will evaluate the success of the increased stocking rate, although a winterkill could confound evaluation.  Stocking of walleyes will likely continue, but if year class failures continue, a different stocking strategy may be attempted. <br> \n <br> \nGiven Sand Lake's history of low northern pike recruitment, low catch rates, and fast growth rates, this lake may be a candidate for more regular pike stocking.  This option would likely be most appealing if the increased walleye stocking does not result in increased catch rates of that species.  In most cases, predatory pike are not stocked in lakes where walleyes are being managed.  Pike can, however, provide good fishing opportunities in lakes where walleye management has not been particularly successful. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand (Stump) Lake is 200 acre lake located just south of U.S. 10 on the Becker-Clay county line.  The lake is composed of seven smaller, almost separate basins. Sand lake has a maximum depth of 28 feet, but is subject to extreme water level fluctuations of up to 10 feet in a single year. These drastic water fluctuations make the lake prone to winterkill in years with long winters and deep snow. The most recent severe winterkill occurred during the winter of 1993-1994. Trap net catches after this winterkill (April 1994) consisted of only one Northern Pike, one Yellow Perch, and 36 bullheads.  To reestablish gamefish populations, Walleye fry, and adult Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch were reintroduced in 1994.  Adult Northern Pike were stocked in 1996.  Gill and trap net catches in the 1998 survey showed the fish community was recovering from the 1994 winterkill. Oxygen tests conducted between 2011-2014 have not detected levels low enough to cause winterkill. <br> \n\t <br> \nSand Lake is primarily managed for sunfish species (Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass), and secondarily for Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nMean Bluegill trap net catch in 2015 was 31.4 per net, which is both the highest on record for Sand Lake and above average for similar lakes in the state.  Average length of trap netted Bluegills was 6.6 inches, and lengths ranged from 3.9-9.2 inches.  Three-year-old Bluegill were most numerous, comprising 71% of the 2015 trap net catch.  Mean length of four-year-old Bluegills was 7.9 inches, which is above average for Sand Lake. Bluegills captured in 2015 ranged from 1-6 years old.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catch rate for Black Crappie averaged 3.8 per net in 2015, which is above average for similar lakes around the state and the highest ever recorded in Sand Lake. The 2012 year class made up 34% of the 2015 Black Crappie trap net catch.  Average Black Crappie length was 9.4 inches, and lengths ranged from 4.0 to12.7 inches.  Black Crappies captured in trap nets ranged from 1-7 years old.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, eleven Largemouth Bass were captured in trap nets for an average of 1.4 per net. This catch rate is above both the Sand Lake average and that of similar lakes around the state. Average length of trap netted Largemouth Bass was 10.8 inches, and lengths ranged from 4.8 to 17.8 inches. Mean weight of Largemouth Bass caught in trap nets was 1.2 pounds, and Largemouth Bass captured in all gears ranged from 1-8 years old. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Northern Pike in 2015 was 6.5 per gill net, which is above average for similar lakes around the state and nearly twice the average for Sand Lake.  Northern Pike exhibit good growth rates with an average four-year-old fish attaining a length of 26.8 inches.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 19.8 to32.3 inches, with a mean length of 24.7 inches. Northern Pike caught in all gears ranged from 2-5 years old with just over half (53%) being two years old. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Walleye spawning has occurred during high water level years, the Walleye fishery in Sand Lake is maintained primarily through annual fry stocking. Walleye catch rates were 9.5 per gill net in 2015, which is the highest observed since the original survey in 1964.  Walleye ranged in age from 1-12 years old, but most were between 2-4 years old. Gill netted walleye ranged in length from 8.7-28.0 inches and averaged 17.4 inches long. Walleyes exhibited good growth rates in Sand Lake, with a typical four-year-old fish reaching a length of 18.3 inches.  <br> \nThe 2015 Yellow Perch catch rate was the second highest recorded at 65.7 per gill net, and well above the Sand Lake average (40.8 per gill net).  Yellow Perch caught in gill nets averaged 7.2 inches long and ranged in size from 3.2-9.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThree other fish species captured in the 2015 survey included White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead, and Brown Bullhead. <br> \n  <br> \nWith continuing shoreline and watershed development, this diverse, productive, and valuable fishery will need help on several fronts to be sustained.  Anglers can help to maintain balance in fish populations by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium and large fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.  This is particularly true for Northern Pike and Bluegill.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, by taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and by using wise land management practices.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Since a devastating winterkill in 1994, Sand Lake's fish community is well on the road to recovery.  It is already providing good angling for northern pike, bluegill, and walleye with largemouth bass and black crappie on the increase.  All analyzed fish species were fast growing.  Bluegill were particularly so since the largely four-year-old population averaged 8.0 inches long and weighed nearly 1/2 pound.  Of the five species listed above, only one northern pike was found in test nets following the 1994 winterkill.  Stocking of brood-size bluegill, crappie, bass, yellow perch, and northern pike as well as walleye fry has accounted for the current fish community.The recently very high water level has opened several acres of new northern pike and yellow perch spawning habitat.  Barring severe winterkill in the near future, these species as well as panfish and stocked walleye should provide good angling for years to come.  However, Sand Lake has a history of drastic water level \"bounce\" that can make fish spawning conditions and winter survival precarious for most gamefish species.While the weather conditions that affect Sand Lake water levels may not be controllable, cultural eutrophication that affects its water quality is more manageable.  Shoreline development is not yet a large factor in Sand Lake's water quality, but with the high water level, the inlet on the southeast shore appeared to be adding significant quantities of unwanted nutrients.  That external loading should be stopped if at all possible.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Lake has experienced one severe winterkill during the past 24 years.  During early 1994, all but the species most tolerant of low levels of dissolved oxygen succumbed to winterkill.  Black and brown bullhead were the most abundant survivors at that time.In the spring of 1994, walleyes, bluegills, black crappies, largemouth bass, and yellow perch were reintroduced in the lake.  In order to give these species a head start over larger predators, northern pike were not stocked until two years later.In 2003, the reintroduced gamefish and panfish species appear to be surviving and providing good fishing opportunities.  Like fish in many winterkill lakes, those in Sand Lake grow rapidly due to the lake's productivity and to a lack of competition following winterkill.  The average sizes of northern pike and walleye in 2003 were 3.6 pounds and 3.9 pounds, respectively.One of the reasons walleye sizes average this large is that young fish were lacking.  Walleyes are the only species of those listed above that require continued stocking in Sand Lake to sustain the fishery.  The other popular species usually have access to good spawning habitat.  Walleyes have been stocked biennially in Sand Lake for several years, but the two most recent stockings have apparently not survived well for unknown reasons.  Stocking of this species will likely continue, but if year class failures continue, a different stocking strategy may be attempted.</p>",

This data will be analyzed in conjunction with the Standard Survey that was completed in 2015 to evaluate the biological condition of Sand Lake, and contribute to the assessment of the watershed.   <br> \nTen sites within Sand Lake were sampled during this survey, using a backpack electrofishing unit and seines.   The fish community sampled during this assessment was not diverse, dominated by Fathead Minnows and young of the year Yellow Perch.  Few Largemouth Bass, also young of the year, were sampled.  Other species sampled included Iowa Darter, White Sucker, Central Mudminnow, and Brook Stickleback.  No Bluegills or other sunfish species were observed.  No species intolerant of poor habitat conditions were found.  The results of this survey suggest that the fish population in Sand Lake does not meet expectations for lakes of similar characteristics, suggesting that this lake is biologically impaired.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
