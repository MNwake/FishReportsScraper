                "narrative": "<p>  On July 21, 1993, a lake survey was conducted on Hay Creek Flowage (lake class 37).  Standard netting methods were used to evaluate the present fish population status.  Hay Creek Flowage is managed for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  The flowage also receives much attention due to its good waterfowl habitat.  Portions of Hay Creek upstream from the flowage are designated trout waters.  No stocking has occurred in Hay Creek Flowage.  The overall fish population is usually affected by low dissolved oxygen levels during severe winters.  This makes over-wintering in the flowage difficult for most fish species.  Most fish would leave the flowage (upstream or downstream) in this situation.  Following such events, brings on a spawning season whereby northern pike, pumpkinseed, black crappie, and bullhead usually dominate in this type of lake system.  Other species are present, but numbers tend to be below normal.  During this survey, the northern pike abundance was low for this lake type.  Of the northerns sampled, lengths ranged from 18.7 to 25.9 inches.  The average weight was 2.4 pounds.  These fish were 1, 2, 4, and 5 years old.  Growth rates were normal.  Black crappie abundance was typical of normal for this type of lake.  Fish sampled ranged from 5.5 to 10.9 inches averaging 7.7 inches.  The average weight was 0.3 pounds.  Ages 1-6 were sampled by netting gear.  Bluegills were not sampled well during the survey.  Low numbers have been reported through the years.  Pumpkinseeds have done well in this flowage.  They commonly survive winterkill conditions better than bluegills.  Their abundance was high with fish ranging from 3.7 to 7.3 inches and averaging 5.5 inches.  Yellow perch abundance was low with fish averaging 7.4 inches.  Ages 3 and 4 were the only age groups sampled.  Largemouth bass generally are not captured well by netting methods.  Only 1 bass (11.4 inches) was caught in the trapnets.  It weighed 0.7 pounds.  No young-of-year bass were sampled, which might have indicated a poor spawn.  The remainder of the fish population consisted of black bullhead, brown bullhead, common carp, white sucker, and      yellow bullhead.  The bullhead abundance levels were normal and the carp and white sucker levels were low for this lake type.  Prepared by:  Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Hay Creek Flowage is a small, shallow, soft water impoundment in eastern Pine County.  Water clarity is moderate due to a light bog stain.  Fishing pressure is light in both summer and winter.  Other activities on the lake include waterfowl hunting and wild rice harvesting.  A township owned access is located on the south west end of the lake near the dam.   Overall, the fish population is greatly influenced by low winter oxygen levels.  Typical species makeup includes northern pike, black crappie, black bullheads, and common carp.  Fish migration is possible both below and above the impoundment.The northern pike abundance in the gillnets, 5 per net, increased from the 1993 sample and was typical of catches in similar lakes.  Northerns averaged 2.4 pounds and ranged from 18 to 26 inches.  Black bullheads also increased since the 1993 sampling.  The catch rate of 66 per gillnet was higher than normal for the lake type.  All captured black bullheads were less than 9 inches.The panfish catch was poor.  Nine trapnets sampled a total of 7 black crappies, 5 yellow perch, and 2 bluegill.  Panfish abundance has historically been low with a similar catch in 1993.Largemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing for the first time in 2003.  The catch rate of 11.6 bass per hour was not impressive but sampling conditions were not optimal.  Bass averaged 0.8 pounds and ranged from 7 to 13.4 inches.  Shoreline seining found reproduction of black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass.</p>",
