                "narrative": "<p>       Crookneck is a small, shallow lake located between three of the largest lakes in Morrison County: Shamineau, Fish Trap, and Alexander.  The lake is landlocked and has a relatively small watershed of 510 acres resulting in widely fluctuating water levels.  A steep hill runs along the north side of the lake and most landowners have built on top of the bluff, thus leaving the lakeshore more natural looking.   Water clarity was good at the time of the survey  (mid-June) with a secchi disk reading of 12 feet.  By mid-July, however the secchi disk reading had decreased to 4 feet due to an algae bloom.  Sand was found to be the most abundant shallow water substrate around the lake.  The lake has a diverse plant community with coontail and southern naiad being the most abundant submergent plant species, growing to a depth of 18 feet.  Much of the shoreline that is suitable has already been developed.  Most anglers on the lake seek northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill. <br> \n       The lake historically has had a high northern pike population.  Despite the abundance, a fair number of pike over 24 inches are present, however, the average size observed in the survey was just over 2 pounds.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were also abundant in the survey and most of the fish were small, under 6 inches in length.  All of the black crappie caught in the survey were also small, under 8 inches in length.  One fish species that may interest some anglers is largemouth bass.  Crookneck Lake has shown that it can produce quality fish with bass over 19 inches present.  Many of the bass in the spring electrofishing were more than 16 inches in length.  Although walleye numbers are low, anglers have an opportunity to catch a quality size fish.  Yellow perch numbers continue to be low which could be due to the high pike numbers.  Perch can be an important food source for gamefish and have also been found to instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  <br> \n       There were two species of bullhead caught in the survey, black bullhead and brown bullhead.  Some of the brown bullheads were up to 12 inches in length and were the more numerous of the two species.  There were also two additional panfish species sampled in the survey, hybrid sunfish and rock bass.   <br> \n       Landowners on Crookneck Lake are encouraged to adopt good shoreline practices around the lake to help the water quality.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small northern pike under 24 inches and release the larger pike along with limiting harvest of larger bluegills to work toward a more balanced fish community.  Anglers and other boaters should be aware that Crookneck Lake has curled pondweed and they need to diligently clean their boats and trailers upon exiting the water to avoid spreading the plant to other waters. <br> \n</p>",

The assessment consisted of 29 survey sites evenly spaced 150 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 70.9 (+/- 3.8) out of 100 possible, indicating habitat condition was moderately low. Approximately 86 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 68.3 (+/- 4.0), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 87.1 (+/- 6.8).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 1997 population assessment conducted on Crookneck Lake noted severalundesirable changes in the fish community.  Northern pike numbers have reached anall-time high and yellow perch continue to be below desired levels.  Panfishpopulations including black crappies, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and rock bass, wereall high.  Also noted was increased vegetation growth in the west bay.  By earlysummer, navigation through the bay is hampered by dense submerged vegetation bedsthat extend to the surface.     High northern pike numbers typically mean an abundance of small hammerhandles. While fishermen do report catching mostly small pike, some improvements were notedas the average size from the survey was 22 to 23 inches with some fish up 32inches.  Yellow perch are an important prey species for northern pike and walleye. With pike numbers high and perch numbers low, pike are utilizing the smallbluegills and black crappies as an alternative food source.  Northern pike thatfeed on bluegill typically show slow growth.  Such is the case in Crookneck Lakewith the two and three year old pike.       The largemouth bass population in Crookneck Lake has shown some goodqualities.  Spring electrofishing was used to assess the bass population. Electrofishing is usually conducted at night in the spring when bass are typicallyin the shallow waters of sheltered bays preparing for spawning.  An electrofishingboat sends a small field of electricity through the water, temporarily stunning thefish and making them easier to net.  The fish are measured and returned to thewater unharmed.  Largemouth bass from nine to twenty inches were sampled in 1997. While the bass population appears moderate in numbers, many of the fish sampledwere over 16 inches in length.       An occasional large walleye could be caught in Crookneck Lake.  Pastmanagement included walleye stocking from 1987 until 1989.  Stocking wasdiscontinued when species management changed to northern pike and largemouth bass. Presence of a high northern pike population decreases survival of young walleye dueto predation.     The bluegill population was abundant and dominated by small, slow growing fishaveraging five to six inches.  Black crappies were also abundant and slow growing. The '94 year class dominated the crappie sample, accounting for the average sizeof 4.5 to 5.5 inches.  Pumpkinseed and rock bass populations were also high andsizes about average for each species.     Roughfish species present were white suckers, black bullheads, and brownbullheads.  While the brown bullhead numbers were high for the lake type, averagesize was good at 10 to 11 inches.  Black bullheads were less abundant and slightlysmaller in size.     Neascus was common on most of the bluegills, pumpkinseeds, and some of thenorthern pike.  Neascus is a black trematode or parasite with a life cycle goingfrom snails to fish to a fish-eating bird, such as herons, to mature.  Human cannot be infested.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasite and cooking willkill the rest.       Crookneck Lake is a heavily developed lake under 200 acres in size.  The lakehas a very small watershed and is easily impacted by land use practices in thesurrounding area.  Protection of lake water quality is encouraged through land usepractices and zoning ordinances.  Selective harvest is encouraged for both anglingand spearing to minimize impacts on the fish community.  Releasing larger northernpike and keeping the smaller ones will help promote quality and a balance in thefish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Crookneck Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 24-25 July 2023.  Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites with one site sampled from the boat.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample seven sites, a 15-foot seine was used at one site, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and one species (Green Sunfish) that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 24-25 July 2023 by IBI Program Staff.  Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types.  One of those trap nets was excluded from analyses due to large holes allowing most fish to escape.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by biomass.  The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 29 lakes and the average length was 5.2 inches, with less than 1% over 7 inches.  The number of Black Crappie sampled per net was near the lower 25% quartile for Lake Class 29 lakes and the average length was 8.0 inches with none captured over 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  An additional survey was completed on Crookneck Lake in July 2021 resulting in a similar FIBI score.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates an exceptional fish community is present in Crookneck Lake and it is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Daytime spring electrofishing was conducted on Crookneck Lake in late April of 2015.  Crookneck Lake is scheduled for lake surveys every twelve years but has a six year cycle for electrofishing.  Largemouth Bass are the primary management species for Crookneck Lake with Northern Pike as secondary.  The lake management goal is to catch more than twenty bass per hour during spring electrofishing with a PSD greater than 40 for the sample.  Four electrofishing assessments have been conducted on Crookneck Lake, two daytime assessments and two night time assessments prior to 2007 when a new electrofishing rig was purchased which generally improved catch rates of most species. <br> \n      A total of forty-two Largemouth Bass were netted in the 2015 daytime electrofishing assessment which produced a catch rate of 44/hour.  The fish ranged from 8.6 to 19.2 inches in length with a mean length of 15.3 inches and mean weight of 2.1 pounds for the sample.  Modal length for the sample was 15 -16 inches with 45% (n=19) more than sixteen inches in length.  PSD for the sample was 83 with an RSD-P of 67.  Age groups 3-9 were found in the 2015 sample indicating consistent recruitment.  Many older fish were also captured as only fish 15 inches and under were aged.  Growth rates of bass were in the normal range for the work area. <br> \n     The daytime electrofishing effort in 2009 produced a catch of seventy-two (58/hour) Largemouth Bass.   There was a wider length range when compared to 2015 with fish between 4.8 and 19.3 inches measured.  Mean length and weight for the sample were the same as in 2015.  Modal length was longer, 16 \u0013 17 inches, and 50% (n=36) of the bass were more than sixteen inches.  PSD for the sample was 98 with an RSD \u0013P of 72. <br> \n    The nighttime electrofishing assessments produced catches of 61 and 25 bass in 2003 and 1997 with catch rates of 38/hour and 18/hour, respectively.  Bass up to 20.6 inches were measured in 2003 and up to 19.9 inches in 1997.  Mean length and weight were the smallest in the 2003 assessment at 11.3 inches and 1.1 pounds, respectively.  The 1997 catch had a mean length of 14.6 inches and mean weight of 1.9 pounds.  Only 11% (n=7) of the bass exceeded sixteen inches in 2003 while in 1997, 36% (n=9) of the bass were more than sixteen inches in length.  PSD in 2003 was 48 with an RSD- P of 27.  PSD in 1997 was 84 with an RSD- P of 36. <br> \n    Results from three of the four electrofishing assessments met the lake management goal of more than twenty Largemouth Bass per hour.  Only two assessments, both daytime, met the management goal of a PSD greater than 40.  All assessments sampled bass exceeding nineteen inches with the 2003 assessment catching two Largemouth Bass more than twenty inches in length, indicating Crookneck Lake can produce memorable size bass. <br> \n     Spring Daytime electrofishing has proven to be an effective method of sampling Largemouth Bass in Crookneck Lake, especially since acquiring the newer, more efficient electrofishing boat.</p>",

A TOTAL OF 540 ADULT NOP HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE LAKE SINCE 1987, DUE TO HIGH ABUNDANCE AND SMALL SIZE. GROWTH RATES WERE NORMAL FOR ALL AGE GROUPS (I-VI, VIII+) PRESENT IN 1991.  AGE GROUPS II AND III ACCOUNTED FOR 69% OF THE NET CATCH.  THE WAE GILL- NET CATCH CONSISTED OF THREE FISH IN THE 20-22 INCH RANGE.  THESE FISH RESULTED FROM THE YEARLING STOCKING DONE IN THE SPRING OF 1987.  FINGERLINGS STOCKED IN THE FALL OF 1988 AND 1989 WERE NOT CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY NETTING.  NORMAL GROWTH RATES WERE EXHIBITED BY THE FISH SAMPLED. FINGERLING/YEARLING STOCKING MAINTAINS THE WAE POPULATION.  YEP GILLNET CATCHES SHOWED A DECREASE SINCE 1986.  ONLY AGE GROUPS IV AND V WERE REPRESENTED IN THE SURVEY NETTING AND NO YOUNG-OF-YEAR PERCH WERE CAPTURED WHILE SEINING. GROWTH RATES WERE NORMAL FOR THE FISH SAMPLED. THE TRAPNET CATCH FOR BLG FELL FROM 424.0/SET TO 177.75/SET, HOWEVER ABUNDANCE IS STILL VERY HIGH AND MEAN WEIGHT REMAINS SMALL.  NO SUNFISH 7 INCHES LONG OR LONGER WERE CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY OR SINCE THE 1981 SURVEY.  AGE GROUPS I THROUGH VII WERE SAMPLED.  NORMAL GROWTH RATES WERE EVIDENT IN AGE GROUPS I AND II AND THEREAFTER.  AGE GROUPS VI AND VII COMPRISED 61% OF THE SAMPLE.  THIS POPULATION SHOWS EVIDENCE OF  IN 1989.  BLC TRAPNET CATCHES FELL FROM 15.50/SET TO 0.50/SET, HOWEVER THE GILLNETS ACCOUNTED FOR 86% OF THE TOTAL CATCH.  FISH RANGING FROM 5 TO 7 INCHES LONG DOMINATED THE CATCH.  AGE GROUPS II THROUGH VII WERE SAMPLED WITH ALL GROUPS DISPLAY- ING II.  LMB WERE SAMPLED ONLY IN THE GILLNETS AND SEINING.  NO FISH WERE CAPTURED IN THE SELECTIVE GEAR (TRAPNETS).  AGE GROUPS II THROUGH V WERE FOUND AND DEMONSTRATED NORMAL GROWTH RATES.  THE SMALL NUMBER CAUGHT INDICATES THE NEED FOR AN ELECTROFISHING ASSESSMENT OF LMB AND OTHER SPECIES.   BRB AND BLB NET CATCHES WERE MUCH HIGH- ER THAN IN 1986 FOR BOTH THE TRAPNETS AND GILLNETS, LIKELY INDICATING AN INCREASING POPULATION.  IN 1990 A COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN REMOVED 240 POUNDS OF BULLHEADS.  1000 POUNDS WERE DESTROYED IN 1989 DURING ICE-OUT NETTING FOR REMOVAL OF NOP.</p>",

HYBRID SUNFISH TRAPNET CATCHES WERE ALSO ABOVE THE STATEIWDE MEDIAN. WHITE SUCKER AND BROWN BULLHEAD CATCH RATES WERE LOW. NO BLACK BULLHEAD WERE CAUGHT IN TRAPNETS BUT THE GILLNET CATCH WAS AVERAGE. YELLOW PERCH NUMBERS WERE AVERAGE IN THE GILLNET CATCH BUT HIGH, ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE, IN TRAPNETS. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE AVG IN BOTH GILLNETS AND TRAPNETS. MORE DATA IS NEEDED BY OTHER METHODS TO INFER POPULATION STATUS SIX GILLNETS WERE SET IN JUNE 1981 AND ONLY 4 GILLNETS IN 1986. GILLNETS WERE REDUCED, AS 6 NETS WERE CONSIDERED TO BE TOO MANY FOR A SMALL 158 ACRE LAKE. SOME NETTING BIAS HAS BEEN INTERJECTED BY THE REDUCTION OF GILLNETS. NORTHERN PIKE AND YELLOW PERCH CATCHES STILL SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN POPULATIONS. NORTHERN PIKE AGES CLASSES PRESENT WERE FROM II THROUGH V. AGES II-IV WERE NEARLY EQUALLY ABUNDANT. GROWTH RATES WERE AVERAGE FOR ALL AGES. THE NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION APPEARS TO HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED. THE 1981 MEAN WEIGHT WAS 1.9 POUNDS AND 1.6 POUNDS IN 1986. THE 1981 LENGTH RANGE WAS 9.0-29.9 INCHES AND 1986 14.0-26.9 INCHES. THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP FOR 1981 WAS 18.0 - 18.9 INCHES WITH A WEIGHTED MEAN LENGTH OF 18.2 INCHES. IN 1986 THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP WAS 20.0-20.9 INCHES AND A WEIGHTED MEAN LENGTH OF 19.1 INCHES. INDICATIONS ARE THE YELLOW PERCH POPULATION HAS INCREASED FROM 1981 (1.50/GILLNET) TO (11.00/GILL- NET) IN 1986. MEAN WEIGHT HAS REMAINED CONSTANT AT ABOUT 0.1 POUNDS. LENGTH FREQUENCY HAS ALSO NOT CHANGED. LENGTHS RANGED FROM 5.5-7.4 IN 1981 AND 5.0 - 8.4 IN 1986. BLUEGILL NUMBERS HAVE DRASTICALLY INCREASED FROM (70.75/GILLNET) TO (424.00/TRAPNET). THE RANGE IN LENGTHS HAS RE- MAINED CONSTANT AT 3.5 - 6.5 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP FOR 1981 AND 1986 AT 4.5- 4.9 INCHES. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE LENGTH IN 1981 WAS 5.50 IN. DECREASING 1986 TO 4.54 INCHES. THE MEAN WEIGHTS ALSO DECREASED SLIGHTLY FROM 0.16 PDS TO 0.07 PDS. ONLY 4% OF BLUEGILLS MEASURED WERE 6.0 IN. OR GREATER IN 1986 WHILE 46% WERE 6.0 INCHES OR GREATER IN 1981. THE NET CATCHES FOR BLACK CRAPPIE INPLY AN IN- CREASE IN THE POPULATION. MEAN WEIGHTS HAVE DECREASED SOMEWHAT FROM 0.18 PDS TO 0.13 PDS. LENGTHS RANGED FROM 3.5 - 8.9 INCHES IN 1981 AND 4.5 - 6.9 INCHES TO 7.0 - 7.4 INCHES. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE LENGTH HAS DECREASED FROM 6.5 6.1 INCHES. NO CRAPPIES NETTED IN 1981 WERE 9.0 INCHES OR GREATER WHILE 6% IN 1986 WERE 9.0 INCHES OR GREATER. PUMPKINSEED NET CATCHES INCREA- SED TO (46.50/TRAPNET) FROM 3.00/TRAPNET) IN 1981. SIZES RANGED FROM 3.0 TO 7.4 INCHES. ROCK BASS WERE NOT TAKEN IN THE 1981 SURVEY.

                "narrative": "<p>Lakeshore owners around Crookneck Lake have experienced rising water levels the last two years with a new record high recorded in July of 2003.  Crookneck Lake is a small landlocked basin with a limited watershed that can be easily influenced by rain events and shoreland practices.  The shoreland around the lake is heavily developed with most of the buildable sites already filled.  The majority of the shallow water substrate is sand and submergent vegetation beds can be dense in places throughout the summer.  Water clarity was good at the time of the survey in June but was slightly impaired by algae the rest of the summer.    Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappies, and bluegills are the primary species of interest to most anglers on Crookneck Lake.  While pike appear to have decreased in numbers since the last survey in 1997, they continue to be abundant.  Anglers on the lake reported that catching small pike was common.  Netting results suggest that although northern pike numbers are high, size structure of the population was good with the average weight seen in the survey being 2.6 pounds.  High pike numbers can have a negative affect on the fish community in a lake by keeping yellow perch numbers down.  Yellow perch can be important food source which helps maintain good growth in the gamefish of a lake. Perch have also been found to be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.    Crookneck Lake has an good largemouth bass population.  While the average size recorded in the survey from spring night electrofishing was around 11 inches and the size most commonly caught by anglers, trophy bass over 20 inches are present.  Bluegills in the lake are over abundant and the population dominated by small, old, slow growing fish.  Average size of the bluegills caught in the survey was around 5 inches with no bluegills seen over 6.5 inches in length.  It was a similar case with the black crappies, they appear to be numerous, small in size (under 9 inches), older, and slow growing.  Pumpkinseeds and rock bass are other sunfish species in the lake that while numerous can provide the opportunity to catch larger panfish.  Several of the pumpkinseeds caught were over 7 inches long while some 10-inch rock bass were measured.  Some hybrid sunfish are also present.    Roughfish species in Crookneck Lake include black bullheads, brown bullheads, and white suckers.  While the brown bullhead numbers were high for the lake type, average size was good at 10 to 11 inches.  The black bullheads were less common and smaller in size.  White sucker abundance appears to be normal for the lake type and all of the fish caught were larger, between 16 and 18 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This standard survey was completed the week of June 14, 2021 and used gill nets to target Walleye, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch; trap nets to target Bluegill and Black Crappie, and electrofishing to target Largemouth Bass. The last standard survey completed was in June 2009, this survey replicated all sampling locations so data comparisons between years can be made. <br> \n <br> \nCrookneck Lake is a good Northern Pike lake. Our surveys consistently indicate good numbers of pike in the mid 20-inch range with a few over 30 inches regularly sampled. The Largemouth Bass fishery is similar - good numbers of medium-sized fish while consistently showing the presence of large fish in the 18-20 inch range. Walleyes on the other hand are almost non-existent. Stocking of fingerlings and yearlings was attempted in the late 80s with very poor survival, so stocking was discontinued. Yellow Perch, a favorite prey for Walleye, are also scarce making Crookneck a lake that does not need any more stocking of predatory fish.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are very abundant and typically measure in the 5-7 inch range. Good numbers of crappies are also present. Individual lengths exceeding 10 inches have been caught but the majority are small and very slow-growing.  <br> \n <br> \nOther common species found in Crookneck Lake include Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Brown Bullhead and Rock Bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Crookneck Lake was conducted on July 1 and 2, 2021 by Little Falls Area Fisheries Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot seine.  Backpack electrofishing and seining was completed at all ten sampling stations.  Several seine hauls consisted of lengthened or double hauls to increase the area sampled.   Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from the June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Crookneck Point Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community during the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
