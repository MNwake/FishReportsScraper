                "narrative": "<p>Shipman Bass Lake is a 37-acre lake with a maximum depth of 34 feet located approximately seven miles northwest of Ely in northeastern St. Louis County.  Access to the lake is off the Dead River with a 1/4 mile portage to the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Shipman Bass Lake is in lake class 10.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Astrid, East Twin, Fenske, and Maude Lakes.  Lakes in this lake class are small, have soft, clear water, and are moderately deep.   <br> \n <br> \nShipman Bass Lake is entirely within the Superior National Forest.  The lake watershed size is 823 acres giving it a watershed to lake ratio of 24.9:1.  The watershed is 47% forested, 32% marsh, and 21% bog with no development either on the lake or in the watershed.  An aquatic vegetation survey on the lake identified 26 aquatic plants with no species being rated as abundant.  Approximately 1% of the lake surface is covered with emergent plants.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2011, a total of 63 fish were captured and the catch comprised six species. Only nine fish were caught in gill nets.  The lengths of the three northern pike sampled were 19.8, 20.6, and 23.2 inches.  Minnow traps were used to sample near-shore young-of-the-year species. Bluegill made up 65% (n=35) of the trap catch followed by yellow perch at 22% (n=12).  A green sunfish and tadpole madtom were also caught.  Largemouth bass and yellow perch young-of-the-year were captured. <br> \n</p>",
