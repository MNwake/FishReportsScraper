                "narrative": "<p>Porter Lake was constructed in 1974 as a flood control reservoir by the Yellow Medicine Watershed District.  It is about 20 acres in size, has a maximum depth of 13 feet, and contains a moderate silt load due to run-off from a largely row-cropped watershed.  Habitat conditions are fair to marginal for desirable game fish species.     Porter Lake has been stocked sporadically since 1975 with bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.  Self-sustaining populations of these species, excluding walleye, have developed and the lake no longer requires stocking.  The most abundant species in 1998 were largemouth bass, bluegill, and black bullhead.  Black crappie and northern pike were also present, but in lower numbers.     Game fish have exhibited favorable growth rates in Porter Lake.  However, few large game fish were present, indicating that anglers may be harvesting them as soon as they reach an attractive size.  The quality of fishing could be improved if anglers practiced more catch and release of the larger fish, such as 7-10 inch bluegills.     The habitat quality of Porter Lake continues to be degraded due to silt and nutrient runoff from the watershed.  These habitat changes will favor black bullhead and black crappie, and these species will likely become more abundant over time.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Porter Lake is a 19-acre impoundment along a tributary of the Yellow Medicine River located 1.5 miles south of Porter.  It was constructed in 1974 by the Yellow Medicine River Watershed District as a flood control reservoir.  A substantial portion of the shoreline is owned by the Watershed District and publicly accessible, however cattails severely restrict shore angling.  Bluegills, Black Crappies, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were stocked when the reservoir was constructed and they have developed self-sustaining populations.  Adult Walleyes will be stocked when available to provide additional angling opportunities and predation on a stunted panfish population.  This targeted survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using trap nets and daytime electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Porter Lake. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Bluegills, and lower numbers of Black Crappies, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch were present.  Game fish grow relatively slow in Porter Lake, and many of them are smaller than desirable.  However, some decent sized Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike typically have been present. <br> \n <br> \nCurly-leaf pondweed, a non-native aquatic plant, was discovered in Porter Lake in 2003.  Anglers are reminded to thoroughly clean their boat and trailer prior to leaving the lake to ensure that plant fragments are not transported to other water bodies. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Porter is a small, 19 acre impoundment of an unnamed tributary to the Yellow Medicine River.  It was created in 1974 as a flood control reservoir by the Yellow Medicine Watershed District.  Black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch have been stocked sporadically since 1975.  Excluding walleye, self-sustaining populations of all species have developed after stocking.     Black crappie were abundant in 2003.  Although crappie up to 10 inches were sampled, the majority measured 6-8 inches.  Crappie growth was slow compared to Porter Lake averages.  Considering slow growth, it will require two years for many of the 6-8 inch crappie to measure over nine inches.  To increase the quality of the black crappie in Porter Lake, anglers are encouraged to keep smaller crappie (7-9 inch) and release fish over 10 inches.         Bluegill was also abundant.  Most bluegill were quality sized, measuring over six inches.  To maintain a quality bluegill fishery, anglers wishing to keep fish to eat are encouraged to harvest smaller six inch bluegill and release fish over seven inches.     Largemouth bass in excess of 14 inches have been sampled in each of the past 4 investigations.  Anglers have reported good to very good bass fishing in recent years.  Largemouth bass are the main predators of small panfish in Porter Lake.  To ensure a good predator/prey balance, catch-and-release fishing of largemouth bass is strongly advocated.     Northern pike have been consistantly sampled in low abundance in Porter Lake.  The majority of pike caught in 2003 measured less than 20 inches, however, one pike measuring 32 inches was also sampled.       Black bullhead were caught in the lowest abundance ever recorded in Porter Lake.  All bullhead sampled were quality sized, measuring over 10 inches.  Competition/predation has apparently limited the recruitment of black bullhead.       Other fish species sampled in 2003 included low numbers of green and hybrid sunfish.  Hybrid sunfish measured 6-8 inches.     Anglers fishing Porter Lake should be aware of the presence of curly-leaf pondweed.  Curly-leaf pondweed is an invasive, exotic vegetation specie that has formed dense beds throughout Porter Lake.  Boaters are reminded to remove all vegetation and turions from boats, trailers and motors, as well as drain all water from livewell when leaving Porter Lake.  Turions are vegetative buds that look like small, brown pine cones that can germinate into new curly-leaf pondweed plants.          Fisheries management activities scheduled for Porter Lake include annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen, annual winter fish house count, fish stocking as needed, and fisheries population assessment in 2006.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Porter Reservoir is a 19-acre impoundment along a tributary of the Yellow Medicine River located 1.5 miles south of the town of Porter.  It was constructed in 1974 by the Yellow Medicine River Watershed District as a flood control reservoir.  A substantial portion of the shoreline is owned by the Watershed District and publicly accessible, however cattails along much of the shoreline restrict shore angling.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills, Black Crappies, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were stocked when the reservoir was constructed and they have developed self-sustaining populations.  Adult Walleyes are stocked when available to provide additional angling opportunities and predation on a stunted panfish population.  This 2021 targeted survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using standard trap nets, quarter-inch trap nets and daytime electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Porter Reservoir. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Bluegills and lower numbers of Black Crappies, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch and Walleyes were present.  Game fish grow relatively slow in Porter Lake, and many of them are smaller than desirable.  However, some decent sized Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike are typically present.  Hundreds of adult Walleyes have been stocked in recent years and fish up to 23 inches were sampled in the 2021 survey.   <br> \n <br> \nBeginning May 2018, new regulations for Northern Pike are in effect.  Porter Reservoir is in the Southern management zone meaning anglers/spearers are allowed to possess 2 pike with a minimum size of 24 inches. See the regulations booklet for more details. <br> \n <br> \nCurlyleaf pondweed, a non-native aquatic plant, was discovered in Porter Reservoir in 2003.  This plant covers much of the lake in spring and early summer.  Anglers are reminded to thoroughly clean their boat and trailer prior to leaving the lake to ensure that plant fragments are not transported to other water bodies. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Porter Lake was constructed in 1974 as a flood control reservoir by the Yellow Medicine Watershed District.  It is about 20 acres in size, has a maximum depth of 13 feet, and contains a moderate silt load due to run-off from a largely row-cropped watershed.  Habitat conditions are fair to marginal for desirable game fish species.     Porter Lake has been stocked sporadically since 1975 with bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.  Self-sustaining populations of these species, excluding walleye, have developed and the lake no longer requires stocking.  Most abundant species in 1995 were black crappie and black bullhead.  Bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike were also present, but in lower numbers.  Black crappie and black bullhead were present from a good range of sizes, with fish of both species sampled up to 11 inches.  Bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike were generally on the small side.     The habitat quality of Porter Lake will continue to be degraded due to siltation/nutrification from watershed run-off.  These habitat changes will favor black bullhead and black crappie, and these species will likely become even more dominant over time.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Porter is a 19 acre impoundment of a tributary to the Yellow Medicine River.  The Yellow Medicine Watershed District created it in 1974 as a flood control reservoir.  Anglers will find several species of fish are present including bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch.  However, during this survey, a majority of the fish were small.  Anglers should be aware that Porter Reservoir contains curly-leaf pondweed, a non-native plant that has formed dense stands of vegetation throughout the reservoir.  Anglers should be sure to remove all plants and sediment from boats, trailers, waders, etc.  Also, be sure not to transport water from Porter to other bodies of water. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant fish specie sampled, with 3/4-inch trap nets capturing 10.8 bluegill per net.  This catch rate is close to the median for class 40 lakes, but below the record-high catch rate observed in 2003 of 21.4 per net.  The bluegill measured in 2007 were small, with only one fish over 8 inches long being sampled.  Bluegill were primarily two- and three-years-old, but fish up to seven-years-old were captured.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance in 3/4-inch trap nets (3.8 per set) during this survey was much below the 23.4 per net observed in 2003.  The decline in abundance is likely due to the loss of the 1999 year class, which made up 53% of the black crappie sampled in 2003.  No black crappie from the 1999 year class were sampled during this survey.  Crappie averaged 6 inches long and 0.1 lb.  Almost all of the crappie (89%) were two-years-old.   <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, northern pike abundance has been low in Porter.  Catch rates observed during this survey (0.8 per 3/4-inch trap net) continue that trend.  All of the pike sampled were two-years-old or less, with an average length and weight of 17 inches and 1.3 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance continues to be low in Porter.  Three-quarter inch trap nets sampled only two bullhead per net, which is below the normal range for lakes such as Porter.  All of the bullhead sampled were 11-14 inches long and had a mean weight of 1.4 lbs.  Quarter-inch trap nets did not sample any YOY bullhead, so abundance will likely remain low. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundance were green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.  <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities planned for Porter Reservoir include monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen levels and fishing pressure, fish stocking as needed and a resurvey in 2013.    <br> \n</p>",

Several game fish species have been stocked and bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch have developed self-sustaining populations.  Curly-leaf pondweed, a non-native plant specie, was discovered in Porter Lake in 2003.  Anglers are reminded to thoroughly clean their boat/trailer prior to leaving the lake to ensure that plant fragments and turions are not transported to another water body. <br> \n <br> \nTestnetting indicated that moderate numbers of bluegill and lower numbers of black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch were present in 2013.   Bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and yellow perch were small and would not attract much angler interest.  Northern pike had an average length of 25 inches and weighed nearly 4 pounds.  Anglers have also reported catching good sized largemouth bass recently and their numbers were likely underrepresented in test nets <br> \n</p>",
