                "narrative": "<p>     West Silent Lake is a 328-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet; however, 36% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 4.8 miles. The secchi disk reading for this survey was 18.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 12.1 to 24.0 feet.         <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cabins.  A state owned public water access is located along the east shoreline of the lake off of County Road 41.  The dominant shoreline substrate is sand.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered around the lake, but are prevalent in the west bay.  Emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     West Silent Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie are the dominant gamefish species present in the lake.   <br> \n     A moderate to high density Northern Pike population exists.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike size structure has historically been poor.  In this survey, only three percent of the pike were 24.0 inches or greater in length.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 20.6 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has historically fluctuated but it has remained stable over the two most recent surveys; however, size structure has declined.  In this survey only thirteen percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.2 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that Black Crappies are abundant.  Age data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Size structure is also good as 65% of the crappies were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.7 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Data from past spring electrofishing assessments indicate that a high-density, slow growing Largemouth Bass population exists.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     West Silent Lake is a 328-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet; however, 36% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 12.1 to 24.0 feet.         <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cabins.  A DNR owned public water access is located off of County Road 41 along the east shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered around the lake, but are prevalent in the west bay.  Emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     A spring trapnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Black Crappie population.  Catch data indicate that Black Crappies are very abundant.  The 2015 year class is strong and should provide consistently good Black Crappie angling for several years.  Crappies ranged in length from 7.0 to 13.5 inches with an average length of 9.7 inches.  Crappies attain an average length of 10.4 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n     West Silent Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.     <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     West Silent Lake is a 328-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet; however, 36% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 4.8 miles. The secchi disk reading for this survey was 17.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 12.1 feet to 24.0 feet.         <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cabins.        A state owned public water access is located along the east shoreline of the lake.  The dominant shoreline substrate is sand.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered around the lake, but are prevalent in the west bay.  Emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     West Silent Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are the dominant gamefish species present in the lake.   <br> \n     A moderate-density northern pike abundance exists.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 10.0 to 31.1 inches with an average length and weight of 16.5 inches and 1.0 pound.  Pike attain an average length of 17.4 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has historically fluctuated but in this survey it was within the expected range for this type of lake.  Bluegill size structure is good with 53% percent of the bluegills meauring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.7 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that black crappies are abundant.  Age data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Size structure is also good as 56% of the black crappie sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 9.3 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a high-density, slow growing largemouth bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 7.2 to 16.5 inches with an average length and weight of 12.2 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 11.2 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in West Silent Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff conducted a targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on June 19, 2017. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with three sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and no tolerant species. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  The FIBI score for West Silent Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     West Silent Lake is a 328-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet; however, 36% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 12.1 to 24.0 feet.         <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cabins.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the east shoreline of the lake off of County Road 41.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered around the lake, but are prevalent in the west bay.  Emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     A spring electrofishing survey was conducted to analyze the Largemouth Bass population.  Catch and length data indicate that a balanced bass population exists.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 8.4 to 18.9 inches with an average length and weight of 13.6 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 13.6 inches at five years of age.      <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n     West Silent Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.     <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Silent Lake is a 328-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County.  The maximum depth is 58 feet with 36% of the lake 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 4.8 miles and the secchi disk reading for this survey was 14.0 feet.  Secchi disk readings, a measurement of water clarity, have ranged from 12.1 feet to 17.0 feet in previous lake surveys.  West Silent Lake is included in lake class 25 of the Minnisota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classiccation scheme.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located on the east shoreline.      The water level on West Silent Lake has been high since the mid-1990's.  No natural inlets or outlets exist on the lake.  Currently, there is a drainage pipe releasing water from West Silent Lake into East Silent Lake in order to reduce the high water level.  The majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cabins.  A resort is located along the southwest shoreline.  Lakeshore development has been shown to negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient levels and shoreline erosion.  This can result in increased plankton/algae blooms, aquatic plant growth and suspended sediments, all of which can lead to decreased water clarity.  By using best management practices (BMP's) and \"lakescaping concepts\", impacts of shoreline development and erosion can be minimized.  Contact any county extension office for information on BMP's and your local DNR-Fisheries office for more information on lakescaping techniques.     The dominate shoreline substrate is sand.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail are located throughout the lake, primarily in the west bay.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     West Silent Lake contains good populations of northen pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.       Northern pike numbers are at a historical high, although the average size is small.  Pike ranged in length from 12.3 to 24.6 inches with an average length and weight of 18.0 inches and 1.1 pounds.  The recent high water level has increased the amount of available spawning habitat for northern pike which may have attributed to their increase in abundance.      Bluegills are abundant with a good size structure present.  Seventy-seven percent of the bluegill were at least 7.0 inches in length.     West Silent Lake is part of the statewide experimental regulation project.  It is a reference lake for largemouth bass and black crappie.  The bass and crappie populations are monitored on a biennial basis.  Recent assessments for these species show that there are good populations of both of these species in West Silent Lake.       Walleye abundance has remained stable over the past twelve years.  Walleye natural reproduction and supplemental stockings of fry and fingerlings have contributed to maintaining the stability in the walleye population.  Walleye sampled in 2001 had an average length and weight of 16.3 inches and 1.7 pounds.     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in West Silent Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Silent Lake is a 328-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet with 36% of the lake 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 4.8 miles and the secchi disk reading for this survey was 24.0 feet.  Secchi disk readings, a measurement of water clarity, have ranged from 12.1 feet to 17.0 feet in previous lake surveys.  West Silent Lake is included in class 25 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located on the east shoreline.      The water level on West Silent Lake has been high since the mid-1990's.  No natural inlets or outlets exist on the lake.  There presently is a drainage pipe releasing water from West Silent Lake into East Silent Lake in an attempt to reduce the water level.  The majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cabins.  A resort is located along the southwest shoreline.  Lakeshore development has been shown to negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient levels and shoreline erosion.  This can result in increased plankton/algae blooms, aquatic plant growth and suspended sediments, all of which can lead to decreased water clarity.  By using best management practices (BMP's) and \"lakescaping concepts\", impacts of shoreline development and erosion can be minimized.  Contact any county extension office for information on BMP's and your local DNR-Fisheries office for more information on lakescaping techniques.     The dominant shoreline substrate is sand.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail are located in certain areas around the lake, primarily in the west bay.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     West Silent Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are the dominant gamefish species present in the lake.       Northern pike abundance is average for class 25 lakes and the average size is small.  Pike ranged in length from 13.2 to 33.3 inches with an average length and weight of 17.8 inches and 1.2 pounds.  The recent high water level has increased the amount of available spawning habitat for northern pike and age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike attain an average length of 17.4 inches at four years of age.      Bluegill abundance exceeds the normal range for class 25 lakes.  The bluegill population has a very good size structure.  Eighty-one percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegill reproduction also appears to be consistently good.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.3 inches at six years of age.     West Silent Lake is part of the statewide experimental regulation project.  It is a reference lake for largemouth bass and black crappie.  The bass and crappie populations have been monitored on a biennial basis since 1994.  Recent special assessments for these species show that there are balanced populations of both of these species in West Silent Lake.       Walleye abundance is below the normal range for class 25 lakes.  Supplemental stockings of walleye fry and fingerlings have occurred on an annual basis since 1996.  Walleye ranged in length from 16.1 to 22.0 inches with an average length and weight of 20.0 inches and 2.5 pounds.     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in West Silent Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     West Silent Lake is a 328-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet; however, 36% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Historical secchi disk readings have ranged from 12.1 to 24.0 feet.         <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cabins.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the east shoreline of the lake off of County Road 41.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered around the lake, but are prevalent in the west bay.  Emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     A reduced daily bag limit regulation for sunfish (5 per day) was implemented in 2021.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain the quality of the Bluegill size structure.  A special spring trapnetting survey was conducted to collect baseline data on the Bluegill population, which will be used for regulation evaluation purposes in future surveys.  The Bluegill population is very abundant and has a high quality size structure.  Ninety-four percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length, while 71% was 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegill growth rates are fast with an average length of 8.3 inches at six years of age. <br> \n      Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n     West Silent Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2021.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.       <br> \n      <br> \n</p>",
