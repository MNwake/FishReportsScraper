                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is 293 acres and is located approximately 11 miles east of Effie, MN in the Big Fork River Watershed.  The lake is the middle lake in a chain of navigable lakes including Deer and Battle Lakes.  There is a state-owned public access with limited parking on the west shore.  A special 10 fish bag limit regulation was implemented in 2006 to maintain the existing quality sunfish population.  This special assessment was conducted to evaluate the results of the special regulation. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trap net catch was 24.5/net which was higher than previous special assessments.  Size structure was good with a PSD of 80, an RSD-P of 19, and an RSD-M of 0.  This was similar to the size structure in the 2011 assessment which had a PSD of 86, an RSD-P of 19, and an RSD-M of 0.  A preregulation assessment in 2005 had size structure indices with a PSD of 71, an RSD-P of 33, and an RSD-M of 0.  Size structure appears to be consistent, but slightly lower for fish greater than 8 inches compared to the preregulation assessment in 2005. <br> \n <br> \nRecruitment appears consistent and fish up to age 10 were sampled, indicating survival to older age classes.  The 2011 assessment included a large 2006 year class which represented 62% of the sample.  In 2013, the same 2006 year class was dominant and represented 67% of the fish sampled.  The abundance of the 2006 year class in the 2013 sample indicates good adult survival. <br> \n <br> \nGrowth was similar to the lake class average up to age 4, then faster than the average for ages 5 to 10.  This pattern was also noted in previous assessments.  Bluegill reached preferred length of 8 inches by age 8.  Growth rates may be slowing because the average length at age 5 in 2005 was 7.8 inches compared to 5.7 inches in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nThe results of this and previous assessments suggest that the regulation is maintaining the current bluegill fishery, or has had no effect.  The 10 sunfish bag limit will be open for public comment and review in the fall of 2014.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is a 293-acre lake located 12 miles east of Effie, MN in the Bigfork River watershed.  A concrete public access is located off Highway 533 on the western shore of the lake with parking for two vehicles with trailers.  Pickerel Lake has a maximum depth of 70 feet and 18% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  The lake's water has lower fertility and is fairly clear, with visibility to 9.5 feet in mid-July 2018.  The depth of water at which oxygen levels limited fish presence was 11 feet.  The lake is the middle lake in a chain of navigable lakes including Deer and Battle.   <br> \n <br> \nThe chain has a special 10 fish bag limit sunfish regulation, implemented in 2006, to maintain the existing quality sunfish population.  The sunfish regulation was reviewed and maintained in 2015.  Targeted surveys for sunfish were conducted in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2018.  The chain also has a special Walleye regulation, implemented in 2005, to provide a more stable Walleye population and increase the contribution of natural reproduction.  All Walleye from 17 to 26 inches must be immediately released, with only one fish over 26 inches allowed in possession.  The bag limit remains six.  Targeted surveys for Walleye were conducted in 2007 and 2013.  Standard surveys were conducted in 2010 and 2018.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 lake management plan indicated Bluegill and Walleye were primary species, while Black Crappie were a secondary species.  Three surveys were conducted on Pickerel Lake in 2018 to monitor various aspects of the fish community.  An early-June targeted survey to sample sunfish, an early-July Index of Biotic Integrity survey to sample the near-shore fish community and evaluate the overall lake health, and a standard survey (this report) in mid-July to monitor the fish community for changes in species composition, abundance, size structure and growth.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population has typically had lower density and good size distribution.  Past surveys described the population as having moderate recruitment with growth faster than lakes with similar habitat.  The trap net catch rate was similar to past surveys.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3 to 9 inches, but the proportions of fish sampled greater than 6 and 8 inches were substantially worse than in past surveys.  Size structure had been noticeably better in the spring targeted survey.  The size distribution in the summer sample was influenced by a high proportion of age 2 and 3 Bluegill, less than 6 inches.  These younger year classes accounted for over 70% of the sample.  It is not unexpected that these fish were not as well-sampled in the spring survey, since that assessment targets adult fish moving shallow prior to spawning.  Bluegill growth was consistent with previous surveys.  Bluegill averaged 7.3 inches at age 6.  Due to the lake's small size it is recommended that anglers release sunfish over 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population has lower density resulting from natural reproduction or migration from adjacent lakes.  Past surveys described the population as having low recruitment with growth comparable to lakes with similar habitat.  Fry stocking was discontinued in 2011 because it did not appreciably increase the Walleye population.  Walleye are limited by low fertility and low perch numbers.  The Walleye catch rate was lower than average for lakes with similar habitat, but typical for Pickerel Lake.  Ten Walleye were sampled in 2018 that ranged from 7 to 24 inches.  Eight year classes from ages 1 to 13 were represented.  Growth was slow; Walleye averaged 16.2 inches at age 6.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe Black Crappie population has low density with average size distribution and growth.  The trap net and gill net catches were low but similar to lake averages.  Eight crappie were sampled in 2018 that ranged from 4 to 12 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population has moderate density with below average size distribution.  The gill net catch in 2018 was similar to the average for the lake and for lakes with similar habitat.  Lengths of gill-net sampled pike ranged from 15 to 33 inches with an average of 20 inches.  Only one fish over 22 inches was sampled.  Due to the lake's small size it is recommended that anglers release fish over 26 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population has never been sampled with spring night time electrofishing, but it is suggested this occur in the future.  Prior to the 2018 survey, only five Largemouth have ever been sampled with trap nets or gill nets.   Eight were sampled in 2018, which ranged from 7 to 16 inches.  Age analysis showed five year classes present from age 2 to 7, with slow growth.  Largemouth Bass averaged 12.0 inches at age 6.  Due to the lake's small size it is recommended that anglers release fish over 15 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population has low density and with few harvestable sized fish present.  Ten perch were sampled in 2018, which ranged from 5 to 6 inches.  The gill net catch was the lowest ever recorded.  Low Yellow Perch numbers likely limit the number of Walleye and other gamefish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Tullibee (Cisco) population has remained low since a summer die off reported in 2003.  Only one 18 inch Tullibee was sampled in 2018, the second lowest catch rate ever.  Smaller Tullibee can provide important prey for predators in addition to Yellow Perch.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2018 included Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Common Shiner, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Smallmouth Bass, Rock Bass, Tadpole Madtom, Yellow Bullhead and White Sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help slow and/or minimize the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is a 293 acre lake located 11 miles east of Effie, MN in northeast Itasca County.  The lake is part of a navigable chain of lakes including Battle and Deer Lakes.  Pickerel Lake is in ecological lake class 25 and has a public boat access on the west shore.  A special trap-net assessment was conducted in the spring of 2009 to evaluate bluegill age and size structure.  Ten trap nets were set and lifted for three consecutive days.  A similar assessment was conducted in spring 2005, prior to the implementation of a conservation regulation (10 fish daily bag limit for sunfish) beginning in spring 2006.  The goal of the regulation is to maintain or improve the quality of the bluegill population.  The 2009 assessment was the first attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of the conservation regulation for sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trap-net catch increased from 6.0/net in 2005 to 9.2/net in 2009.  The increased catch rate was accompanied by a slight decline in bluegill size structure.  Bluegill from the 2005 assessment ranged from 3.4 to 9.8 inches and had a mean length of 6.9 inches, while fish sampled in 2009 ranged from 3.2 to 9.6 inches with a mean length of 6.0 inches.  The total number of sampled bluegill over 8 inches decreased from 59 in 2005 to 29 in 2009.  Five year classes were represented with fish from age 3 to 8 in the 2009 sample.  Recruitment appeared to be fairly consistent with ages 3, 4, 6 and 7 each representing 17 to 32% of the sample.  Growth was similar to the lake class average with fish averaging 7.2 inches at age 6.  The sex distribution for examined fish was 43% female and 57% male.  <br> \n <br> \nThe results of this assessment would seem to indicate the quality of the bluegill population in Pickerel Lake has declined slightly since the previous survey.  A concurrent assessment on adjacent Battle Lake yielded similar results.  The results from any particular assessment can be greatly affected by variability in recruitment as well as the timing of sampling.  It should be noted that historic high bluegill net catches have been recorded in many area lakes during this same time frame, likely a result of increased recruitment in response to favorable environmental conditions.  Additional assessments will be conducted to further evaluate the effectiveness of the 10 fish bag limit. <br> \n</p>",

Pickerel Lake is 293 acres and has a maximum depth of 70 ft.  Currently there are 26 homes or cabins on the lakeshore.  Secchi depth was 10 ft indicating good water clarity.  Pickerel Lake is managed for walleye, northern pike, and panfish.   Walleye gill net catch was 2.2 fish per/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye varied in length from 7 to 20 inches, and mean weight was 0.9 pounds.  Walleye fry are currently stocked every other year.  Walleye growth was good and within 15% the of statewide average.Northern pike gill net catch was 6.3 fish/set which is within the range expected for similar lakes.  Northern pike varied in length from 15 to 33 inches, and mean weight was 2.0 pounds.  The majority of northern pike sampled were between 17 and 22 inches.Tullibee and yellow perch are the primary prey species in Pickerel Lake.  Tullibee abundance was 21.5 fish/gill net which is above the expected range for similar lakes.  Yellow perch abundance is below the expected range.  Length for yellow perch was generally less than 7 inches.  Bluegill trap net catch was 5.8 fish/set which is within the expected range.  Length varied from 3 to 9 inches and size structure was good with 37% of the population larger than 8 inches.  Black crappie trap net catch was 1.8 fish/set which is within the expected range.  Smallmouth bass have previously never been collected, however, during this assessment a smallmouth bass was sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is located 14 miles east of Effie, MN in the Bigfork River watershed.  Pickerel Lake has a total surface area of 293 acres, a littoral area of 152 acres (52 %), and a maximum depth of 70 feet.  The water has a slight bog stain and the Secchi disk transparency was 10 feet.  The water is moderately hard and has relatively low fertility.  Pickerel Lake lies between Battle Lake and Deer Lake, in the middle of a system of three lakes that flows west to the Bigfork River.  The lake has a public access on the western shore.   <br> \n <br> \nPickerel Lake is managed primarily for bluegill, walleye, and black crappie.  The long range goals from the 2008 lake management plan were to increase walleye gill net abundance to 2.5/gill net, and maintain a quality bluegill population with a spring or summer trap net catch of 6.0/net and with 50% exceeding 6 inches and 30% exceeding 8 inches.   <br> \nPickerel Lake was included in a 17 to 26 inch protected slot length limit for walleye with only one fish over 26 inches in possession implemented at the start of the 2005 walleye opener.   Pickerel lake was also included in a 10 sunfish daily/possession bag limit was implemented at the start of the 2006 fishing season.  These regulations also apply to connected Deer and Battle Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nA population assessment was conducted on Pickerel Lake in mid-July of 2010.  The assessment consisted of 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets.  The lake was also included in near-shore IBI sampling that included backpack electrofishing and beach seining. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the most common species captured in the gill net.  The catch rate was within the expected range when compared to similar lakes and about average for Pickerel Lake.  The size structure was moderate as pike ranged from 17.1 to 28.4 inches with a mean of 22.2.  Few fish exceeded the angler preferred size of 28 inches.  Five year classes were identified and recruitment appeared somewhat inconsistent as no age-1 or age-2 individuals were captured.  Growth was near the statewide average with individuals exceeding 21 inches by age-4.  The lack of individuals exceeding 28 inches may limit the popularity of the northern pike fishery. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were the second most common species in the gill net.  The catch rate was below the relatively low compared to similar lakes.  Pickerel Lake has a history of low perch catches.  Yellow perch were generally too small to be of interest to anglers and the average size was 5.3 inches and no perch over 6 inches were captured.   <br> \n <br> \nThe long range goal of catching 2.5 walleye/gill net was not met as walleye were captured at a low rate compared to similar lake.  Lakes with similar habitat and water chemistry typically support relatively few walleye.  Walleye ranged in length from 11.4 to 19.9 inches.  Only four were aged from the gill net sample and four year classes were identified.  Walleye fry are stocked in Pickerel Lake in odd numbered years.  Interestingly, 3 of the 4 aged walleye were from even numbered, non-stocked, years.  Growth was average with individuals exceeding 14 inches by age-4.  Low abundance likely limits the popularity of the walleye fishery. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were captured at rates expected rates for the lake class and near average for Pickerel Lake.  The size structure was moderate as crappies ranged from 4.3 to 10.6 inches.  Five year classes were identified but most individuals (79%) belonged to the 2005 year class.  Inconsistent recruitment of black crappie is a common life history trait for many populations, often resulting in \"boom and bust\" angling cycles.  Growth was slow with individuals typically exceeding 8 inches by age-6. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were captured at a rate within the expected range for the lake class and above the lake average.  The goals of the long range plan were not met as size structure was relatively poor.  Past assessments have typically indicated a quality fishery.  Spring assessments conducted in 2007 and 2009 both sampled moderate numbers of quality sized fish, although the 2009 assessment suggest that the quality of the fishery may be in decline.  The 2010 assessment caught few bluegill over 6 inches.  Growth rates in 2009 were slower than previous assessments but average for the lake class.  Age structures were not collected in 2010. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) were captured at an average rate compared to similar lakes.  Tullibee are likely an important prey species in Pickerel Lake, especially given the history of low perch abundance.  Pickerel Lake is closed to tullibee netting. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured include: white sucker, Johnny darter, bluntnose minnows, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and rock bass.  Pickerel Lake has historically produced relatively small bass catches.  Bass were not captured in the standard nets but juveniles and young of the year were captured during the IBI survey.   <br> \n <br> \nThe protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is a 293-acre lake located east of Effie, MN in the Bigfork River watershed.  The lake has a maximum depth of 70 feet and is part of a navigable chain of lakes including Battle and Deer Lakes.  In 2005, a 17 to 26 inch protected slot limit regulation for Walleye (with one fish over 26 inches in possession) was implemented for the chain of lakes.  All three lakes were included in the regulation because it is possible to navigate a boat from lake to lake.  The specific goals of the regulation related to Walleye catch rate and size structure were focused primarily on Deer Lake.  General goals of the regulation were to provide a more stable walleye population and increase the contribution of natural reproduction throughout the chain.  The 2013 special gill-net assessment was conducted to sample Walleye to monitor the effects of the special regulation on Pickerel Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2013 Walleye gill-net catch was 1.0/net, compared to a catch of 0.7/net in 2010.  This catch rate is just below the lake class expected range but similar to the long-term average for Pickerel Lake.  As in most previous assessments, sample size was too small to calculate meaningful stock density indices.  Walleye sampled in 2013 ranged from 15.9 to 24.1 inches with a mean length of 21.0 inches.  The mean length of Walleye was higher than in the four previous surveys.  The proportion of fish over 20 inches (83%) was higher as well.  Growth appeared similar to the statewide average with Walleye reaching 15 inches at age 4.  Four year classes were represented with two of the five aged fish corresponding to years of fry stocking.  Fry stocking in Pickerel Lake was discontinued in 2011 because it did not appreciably increase the Walleye population beyond what would be expected from natural reproduction and migration among the lakes.  Currently, the fry allocated to Pickerel Lake have been stocked in Deer Lake.  The results of this assessment seem to indicate the special regulation has had limited effect on the Walleye population.  Pickerel Lake has never had an abundant Walleye population, but will likely continue to provide a low-density bonus fishery. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at 7.5/gill net.  This catch rate is within the lake class expected range but is the highest ever recorded for Pickerel Lake.  Historical catch rates have varied from 2.5 to 6.7/net.  Size structure was poor; sampled Northern Pike ranged from 17.5 to 27.9 inches with a mean length of 21.9 inches.  Age and growth data for Pike were not collected in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for Tullibee was 1.0/net.  This is within the lake class expected range and similar to recent assessments.  Historical catch rates have varied from 0 to 21.5/net.  Sampled Tullibee ranged from 15.7 to 17.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at 1.5/gill net.  This is below the lake class expected range but similar to the past two assessments.  Historical catches have varied from 0.7 to 12.5/net.  Sampled Yellow Perch ranged from 5.8 to 6.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included Black Crappie, Smallmouth Bass and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is a 293 acre lake located about 11 miles east of Effie, MN in the Big Fork River Watershed.  The lake is part of a navigable chain of lakes including Battle and Deer Lakes.  There is a state owned public access on the west shore with limited parking available.  A conservation regulation of a 10 sunfish daily bag limit was implemented in spring 2006 for the three lake chain.  The goal of the regulation is to maintain or improve the quality of the bluegill population.  A pre-regulation special assessment was conducted in spring 2005, and the 2011 spring special assessment is the second assessment evaluating the effectiveness of the regulation since implementation. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 17.9/trap net, noticeably higher than previously sampled.  This catch may be more reflective of good sampling conditions than relative abundance indicated by two net nights versus three net nights in 2005 (6.0/trap net) and 2009 (9.2/trap net).  The 2009 assessment pointed to a slight decrease in bluegill size structure since the regulation was implemented, while the 2011 sample indicated a promising increase.  Pre-regulation lengths ranged from 3.4 to 9.8 inches with a mean length of 6.9 inches (n=179) compared to lengths ranging from 3.7 to 9.5 inches with a mean length of 7.2 inches (n=358) in 2011.  Size structure appeared favorable (PSD-6=86, RSD-P=19, RSD-M=0) and comparable to pre-regulation indices (PSD-6=71, RSD-P=33, RSD-M=0).  Sex distribution for examined fish was 40% female and 60% male, similar to the previous assessment (43% female, 57% male).  Female size structure (PSD-6=79, RSD-P=25, RSD-M=0) was slightly more favorable than males (PSD-6=94, RSD-P=18, RSD-M=0).  Recruitment was consistent with ages 3-9 present in the sample.  Males ranged from age 3 to 8 with near lake class average growth up to age 4 with accelerated growth for older ages.  Females ranged from age 4 to 9 but growth was average up to age 6 before exceeding the lake class average.  The 2006 year class (age 5) comprised 62% of the sample with males averaging 6.7 inches and females 6.2 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nResults from the 2011 assessment suggest, at a minimum, the regulation is maintaining a quality bluegill population.   Any one assessment may not be an accurate representation of a population.  Results may be affected by variability in recruitment as well as weather conditions and timing.  Additional assessments will be conducted to further evaluate the effectiveness of the 10 fish bag limit. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is 293 acres and has a maximum depth of 70 feet.  A survey targeting nearshore fish species was conducted by Area staff on 3 July, 2018.  Ten sampling sites (100 feet long) were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-ft or 15-ft 1/8th inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining was conducted at nine sites; one using a 50-ft seine and eight using a 15-ft seine.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured a total of 19 different species; 17 species by seining and eight species by backpack electrofishing.  The species can be found in the gear-specific catch tables in this report. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used with the gill net and trap net data from the standard survey conducted on 16 July, 2018, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of lake health.  The surveys will assist the watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake, and nineteen other lakes in the Grand Rapids fish management area with similar ecological characteristics, are grouped into ecological lake class #25.  These lakes have hard water and are relatively clear.  They are medium to small in size, averaging 57 feet deep, with approximately 47% littoral area.  Examples of lakes in this lake class are Spider, Hart, Balsam, Crooked, and Grave Lakes.  These lakes are in the management classification of walleye-centrarchid and maintenance stocking is done with either fry or fingerling walleye.Species catch rates (CPUE's) were compared to the lake class CPUE's along with age and growth analysis to determine population status.  The tullibee population has always been above the lake class median but declined in the 1987 test netting.  In the 1992 assessment, levels returned to normal and they are at 5.5 fish/gillnet now.  Tullibee sport netting was closed to Pickerel Lake in 1984.  Northern pike abundance has fluctuated over the years - in the netting samples from the lake class median of 5.5/gillnet and below to a CPUE now of 5.0/gillnet; while trap net CPUE's range from the median (0.56/net) to the third quartile (7.0/net) in this assessment.  In age and growth analysis, northern pike show fast growth rates for the first two years (17.4 inches for age II fish).  These fish made up 19% of the sample.All five species of centrarchids sampled show low abundance with catch rates for both gill nets and trap nets historically below the lake class first quartile.  Although they have low abundance, all populations show little fluctuation and remain stable except for bluegill which increased to 7.3/trapnet in this assessment, but this is still below the first quartile.  They all have normal growth rates.The yellow perch population has historically been low but increased in this assessment to 12.5/gillnet, above the lake class median of 9.35/gillnet.  Walleye abundance has always been low, near the first quartile, with a CPUE of 0.8/gillnet.  In this assessment four of the five captured fish were of year classes that correlate to fry-stocked years.  Migration of walleye between Deer, Pickerel, and Battle Lakes may play a part in year class strength as in the 1987 assessment when 44% of the captured fish were the 1981 year class.  This was a nonstocked year for both Pickerel and Battle Lakes but two million fry were stocked in Deer Lake.  Also in the 1981 assessment, 78% of captured fish were the 1979 year class, a nonstocked year again for Pickerel and Battle Lakes but 2 million fry were stocked in Deer Lake.  Natural reproduction does occur, documented by walleye young-of-year sampled in shoreline seining in 1957 and 1964 which were years of no stocking for all three lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is a 293-acre lake located in northeast Itasca County, east of Effie, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 70 ft and is part of a navigable chain of lakes including Battle and Deer Lake.  Pickerel Lake is in lake class 25 and has a public access on the west shore.  Northern pike gill-net catch was 6.7/net, which was towards the upper end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Gill-net catch rates in past assessments have varied from 2.5 to 6.3/net.  Catch rates appear to be increasing in recent assessments.  Size structure was generally poor with most fish sampled less than 24 inches.  However, two larger fish were sampled which were 37 and 39 inches.  Growth for ages one to five was similar to the statewide average, however the two larger fish sampled had growth rates faster than the statewide average for ages six to nine.  Northern pike averaged 24 inches by age five. Bluegill trap-net catch was 11.8/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  The catch rate in 2004 was higher than any of the previous assessments, which have varied from 0.6 to 7.3/net.  Increasing abundance of bluegill is a concern, because in many lakes as abundance increases, size structure decreases.  Size structure was good with fish up to 9 inches sampled.  Scales were not collected for age and growth in 2004.      Angler harvest can have a negative effect on bluegill size structure in a small lake like Pickerel Lake.  Research has shown that the size structure of a bluegill population is highly dependent on the size of the mature male bluegill.  If these large males are overharvested, it can slow the growth rate of the remaining bluegill and ultimately reduce the potential of the lake to produce quality fish.  To maintain quality size structure, anglers should consider releasing bluegill 8 inches and larger.  Walleye gill-net catch was 1.3/net, which was toward the low end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have been low, varying from 0.5 to 2.2/gill net.  Size structure was good with walleye up to 20 inches sampled.  Although Pickerel Lake is primarily a panfish lake, walleye fry are stocked every other year along with Deer and Battle Lake.  Eight walleye were sampled in gill nets and 5 of 8 fish corresponded to stocked years.  Growth was slower than the statewide average for ages one to four and similar to the average for ages five to seven.  Walleye averaged 15 inches by age five.  Black crappie trap-net catch was 2.2/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Gill-net catch was 0.8/net, which was toward the low end of the expected range.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0.6 to 1.8/trap net.  Size structure was good with fish up to 12 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 10 inches by age five.    Yellow perch gill-net catch was 8.7/gill net and was within the expected range.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0.7 to 12.7/gill net.  Although yellow perch were moderately abundant, size structure was poor with no fish larger than 8 inches sampled in gill nets.    One largemouth bass was sampled in trap nets and no fish were sampled in gill nets.  Catch rates in past assessments have been very low varying from 0 to 0.3/trap net.  Sampled size was too low to make conclusions about size structure.   Other species sampled include pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and brown bullhead.  Lakeshore owners can affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by practicing selective harvest.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is 293 acres and is located approximately 12 miles east of Effie, MN in the Big Fork River Watershed.  The lake is the middle lake in a chain of navigable lakes including Deer and Battle Lakes.  There is a state-owned public access with limited parking on the west shore.  A special 10 fish bag limit regulation was implemented in 2006 to maintain the existing quality sunfish population.  This targeted survey was conducted to evaluate the special regulation and to determine the status of the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap net catch was considerably lower than previous spring surveys.  It should be noted that the survey was shortened due to workload considerations and that nets were only lifted over two days.  It is likely that weather during the sampling event had an impact on fish catches, so the number per net may under-represent the actual abundance.   <br> \n <br> \nPickerel Lake has a history of producing quality sized Bluegill.   Size structure remained favorable, as 73% of the sampled Bluegill exceeded 6 inches and 21% exceeded 8 inches.  Bluegill ranged from 3 to 8.5 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  This was similar to the size structure to previous spring surveys and suggests that the 10 fish bag limit may be helping to maintain size quality.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented with ages 3 and 6 the most frequently sampled.  Growth was similar to previous surveys with Bluegill averaging 7.3 inches at age 6.  <br> \n <br> \nLakes with similar habitats typically produce low to moderate crappie catches, and Pickerel is no exception.  The 2018 catch rate was typical for the lake.  The size structure was diverse, as crappies ranged from 3.8 to 12.5 inches and averaged 8.4 inches.  Ages 2 through 9 were identified with no dominant year class.  Growth was average compared to similar lakes with fish typically exceeding 9 inches at age 5. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, Pickerel lake continues to provide good angling opportunities for quality panfish.  Other species sampled in the spring trap nets included Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Hybrid Sunfish. <br> \n</p>",
