                "narrative": "<p>Brook trout were first stocked in the fall of 1988.  Three stockings have been made to date, most recently in early June, 1991.  A single gillnet set was made, taking four brook trout.  The lone fish which was aged suggests that all four were from the 1991 stocking of yearlings.  Several centrarchid species were present. Pumpkinseed (2.0/trapnet) was present in average numbers.  Size (0.11 lb) was small.  Largemouth bass were not sampled in 1986.  Black crappie (7.5/ trapnet) was abundant and were of average size (0.27 lb).  The length frequency distribution suggests that several year classes were present. Yellow perch (0.5/trapnet) was first sampled in 1991.  Northern pike was sampled in 1986 but not in 1991.  Because of steep shoreline slopes, suitable net locations were limited.  Because net sets were few in number, it is difficult to evaluate the fish population.  In general, the species found should not be a serious threat to continued trout management.  Few trout predators were encountered in the two nettings to date, and their abundance appears to be low.  Alternate sampling strategies should be explored to better evaluate the populations of trout and other species in this lake.</p>",

The bluegill population is evidently high because the catch rate data is higher than the third quartile, while a seemingly low black crappie population falls below the first quartile. Species present but which were not sampled are yellow perch, largemouth bass and hybrid sunfish. The sample of northern pike is small, however, the growth appear to be good. Similarly, only one black crappie was sampled which exhibited good growth. From a large sample of bluegills (7 year classes) the most abundant being 5, 6, and 7 showed slow growth throughout the age class distribution as well as at all annuli.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Snoshoe Mine Lake is a small former open pit iron mine located east of Riverton that has filled with water.  The maximum water depth is over 80 ft and the water is very clear with visibility to a depth of nearly 30 ft.  A carry-in access is located on Snowshoe Drive off of County Road 128 near the intersection with County Road 59.   <br> \n <br> \nSnoshoe is a designated stream trout lake.  Designated stream trout lakes have additional angling regulations.  Be sure to consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations book for regulations, seasons, and possession limits before fishing designated trout waters.   <br> \n <br> \nA survey of the fish community in Snoshoe Mine Lake was conducted in August 2012.  The total catch in the gill nets was an average of 7 fish per set which was moderately low compared to other Cuyuna mine pit lakes where average gill net catches have ranged from 2 to 63 total fish per net in recent surveys (median of 10.5 fish per net).  No trout were caught despite 506 yearling brook trout being stocked in early April 2012.  The 5 northern pike captured in the gill nets ranged from 13 to 31 inches long and comprised most of the fish biomass in the gill nets.  Most of the fish captured in trap nets were bluegills that ranged from about 4 to 7 inches long.  The total catch in trap nets was low with an average of 12.5 total fish per net. <br> \n <br> \nThe dissolved oxygen and temperature profiles were measured on August 14, 2012 to monitor habitat for trout.  Optimal temperature and oxygen conditions for brook trout (10-16 C, greater than or equal to 5 ppm DO) occurred in about 10 vertical ft, from a depth of about 23 ft through about 32 ft.  Oxygen was adequate for trout (greater than 5 ppm) down to a depth of at least 45 ft where the temperature was 6.0 C.   <br> \n <br> \nTrout stocking began in 1988 and typically about 500 yearling brook trout have been stocked each spring.   <br> \n</p>",
