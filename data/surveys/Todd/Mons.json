                "narrative": "<p>Mons Lake (DOW# 77-0022-00; Lake Class 23) is a 95 acre lake located near Swanville, Minnesota. A township owned concrete boat ramp is located on the north Shore. Mons Lake has 1.78 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 80 feet. DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Mons Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally very deep, have a very low amount of water less than 15 feet deep, have hard water, and are very clear. <br> \nFor anglers looking for trophy Walleye and Northern Pike, Mons Lake should not be overlooked. Walleye up to 31 inches and Northern Pike up to 34 inches were sampled. Numbers of both are not high, but the reward can be great for those willing to put in the time. In addition anglers may find a surprise with an unexpected Muskellunge. A single 43 inch fish was sampled in 2016, likely the result of an illegal stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Tullibee (Cisco) White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Mons Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This targeted survey was undertaken to obtain quantitative information on the Largemouth Bass fishery of Mons Lake. Mark and recapture methods using electrofishing and angling was completed for bass measuring 10 inches or more resulted in an estimate of approximately 420 fish (about 5 bass/acre). Lengths ranged from 9.8-20.2 inches and averaged 13.3 inches. About a quarter of the bass sampled measured 15 inches or more. As a comparison, recent population estimates on Moose, Pierz Fish and Green Prairie Fish Lakes indicated bass densities of 19.3, 15.4 and 10.0 fish/acre, respectively.  It appears that Mons Lake has a relatively low-density population of Largemouth Bass, perhaps not as abundant as other, more productive lakes in the area. Still, Mons offers a decent-quality fishery to bass anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were abundant during electrofishing efforts and common during trap netting as well. Individual lengths ranged from 11.9 to 31 inches. These two gear-types target fish in shallow-water habitat, which, for Mons Lake, is a relatively narrow rim around the lake's perimeter that drops off abruptly to deeper water. Based on numbers and different sizes of Walleye captured, it is evident that at this time, Mons appears to support a healthy Walleye population.  <br> \n</p>",

Mons Lake supports low-density, trophy-sized populations of these species and assessing their status with targeted netting is the best evaluation tool available.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 28 Walleyes ranging from 11.9-30.10 inches were caught. Nearly 80% of the sample measured greater than 20 inches. Walleyes captured during the 2017 ice-out assessment (three) averaged 29.2 inches and ranged from 26.7-31.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 55 pike were caught with lengths ranging from 10.1-37.4 inches. About 33% of pike measured were 30 inches or greater indicating excellent size structure. Management plan goals are to maintain an ice-out sample with of pike over 30 inches accounting for at least 15% of the catch.  At this time, size structure more than meets this goal and the fishery may warrant consideration for a harvest regulation designed to create a trophy fishery. Comparable ice-out catch rate data in 2017 was 3.2 fish/trap night - this was the first ice-out trapping netting survey completed on Mons Lake. Thirty eight percent of pike were over 24\", and 15% were larger than 30\" at that time. Mean length of Northern Pike sampled was 22.5 inches and lengths ranging from 10.7 to 34.3 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 1 station, a 15-foot seine was used at 8 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 1 site due to abundant vegetation, soft sediments, and deep water. Many sites had dense vegetation and marl substrate, making sampling difficult.  Nearshore sampling captured a diverse suite of species, with15 total species of fish surveyed, including many species that are intolerant of excessive shoreline disturbance and/or poor water quality (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Pugnose Shiner). <br> \n <br> \nA trap net survey was also completed on June 20-21.  Sunfish species dominated the trap net catch, with Bluegill being the most common sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore and trap net fish survey data collected in this survey is combined with gill net data from an August 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for Mons Lake is well above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes.  The exceptionally high FIBI score from this and previous surveys indicate that the fish community is of outstanding biological significance. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Mons Lake is located in the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey to assess the fish community of Mons Lake was completed on various dates from May-August, 2023. A more focused effort was directed toward Largemouth Bass to quantify population density since this has been completed on other Area lakes and lake-to-lake comparisons are considered useful in bass management. Mons Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike with Largemouth Bass of secondary management importance. Because this lake supports Ciscoes, its deepwater, oxythermal habitat is important and therefore receives heightened protection outlined in the management plan.  <br> \n <br> \nThe population estimate completed for Largemouth Bass measuring 10 inches or more resulted in approximately 420 fish (about 5 bass/acre). Lengths ranged from 9.8-20.2 inches and averaged 13.3 inches. About a quarter of the bass sampled measured 15 inches or more. As a comparison, recent population estimates on Moose, Pierz Fish and Green Prairie Fish Lakes indicated bass densities of 19.3, 15.4 and 10.0 fish/acre, respectively.  It appears that Mons Lake has a relatively low-density population of Largemouth Bass, perhaps not as abundant as other, more productive lakes in the area. Still, Mons offers a decent-quality fishery to bass anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were abundant during electrofishing efforts and common during trap netting as well. Individual lengths ranged from 11.9 to 31 inches. These two gear-types target fish in shallow-water habitat, which, for Mons Lake, is a relatively narrow rim around the lake's perimeter that drops off abruptly to deeper water. Based on numbers and different sizes of Walleye captured, it is evident that at this time, Mons appears to support a healthy Walleye population.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill were caught during this survey.  Crappies ranged from 4-11.5 inches and Bluegills were from 3.2-7.2 inches. Thirteen Pumpkinseeds were caught that ranged from 4.3-7.2 inches. Other species caught in trap nets include Hybrid Sunfish (28), Yellow Bullhead (16), Largemouth Bass (5), Walleye (3), and Green Sunfish (1). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Daytime electrofishing was conducted on Mons Lake in mid-June to gather information on the Largemouth Bass population.  Mons Lake was one of the lakes under consideration as a control lake for a proposed bass regulation that would allow for an early catch and release season from March 1st until the last weekend in May (current bass opener) for Largemouth and Smallmouth bass.  Thereafter, regular harvest, length and bag limits would apply.  The intent of the regulation would be to increase recreational opportunity for bass angling during spring on four lakes in the Little Falls Area. <br> \n       The lake has data from five electrofishing efforts, two daytime and three nighttime with two different boats.  The entire shoreline was sampled in the 2014 daytime electrofishing assessment.   A total of 102 Largemouth Bass were netted for a catch rate of 191/hour which was 2.8 times the Area Mean of 68.5/hour.  The fish ranged from 5 to 16.9 inches in length.   Small bass dominated the sample as mean length was 8.9 inches and modal length 7.5- 8 inches with 54% (n=55) of the bass less than eight inches in length.  PSD for the sample was 42.5 which was below the Area Mean PSD of 55. <br> \n       Scales were taken from bass less than 14 inches in length caught in the 2014 electrofishing assessment, as it becomes increasingly difficult to accurately age larger, older bass.    Ages 2 through 6 were represented in the fish less than 14 inches in length.   A strong year class from 2011 accounted for 58% of the aged sample and was largely responsible for both the mean and modal lengths.  The fish displayed normal to fast growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n       Daytime electrofishing for Largemouth Bass was also conducted in 2010.  A total of 66 bass were caught in that effort for a catch rate of 125/hour.  Size structure of the sample was more desirable when compared to the 2014 sample.  The fish measured from 5.8 to 16.8 inches in length with a mean length of 11.5 inches and modal length of 12 - 13 inches.  Only four bass were less than eight inches in length, but PSD was comparable to that in 2014 at 47. <br> \n       Both electrofishing efforts in 2014 and 2010 far exceeded the lake management goal catch rate of more than 40 bass per hour.  The management goal of a PSD greater than 40 was also met by both electrofishing efforts.   A new, more efficient electrofishing boat was purchased in 2007 which appeared to increase catches in most lakes in the area even when used during the day.  Two netters have also commonly been used compared to one netter with the older boat. <br> \n        Nighttime electrofishing was conducted in 2004, 1998, and 1992 with an older, less efficient boat.  Catch efforts ranged from 27 in 1992 to 125 bass per hour in 2004.  Both the 2004 and 1998 (69/hour) catch rates met the lake management goal while results from the 1992 assessment were below goal.  The PSDs were conversely related to the catch efforts, with the high catch rate in 2004 having a PSD of 7 and the low catch in 1992 having a much higher PSD of 59.  The 1992 PSD was the only nighttime electrofishing PSD to meet the lake management goal. <br> \n        Additional fish caught in the 2014 electrofishing effort was a nine-inch Black Crappie and a 13-inch Northern Pike.   Three Walleye between 6.8 and 8.7 inches in length were measured and several other 1+ Walleye were observed which were likely from a fingerling stocking in 2013.  Noted during the electrofishing effort was the observation of many Bluegill, Yellow Perch as well as some Bowfin, Yellow Bullhead and few additional crappie.</p>",

Mons Lake has 1.78 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 80 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Bluegill. The lake was initially surveyed in 1969 and 14 fish sampling surveys or investigations have occurred since then with the most recent prior sampling in 2016. A targeted survey for Northern Pike and Walleye was conducted on Mons Lake following ice out using trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 48 Northern Pike were captured during the ice out survey with trap nets. The 2017 trap net catch rate was 3.2 fish/net night. This was the first ice-out trapping netting survey, therefore data for comparison is unavailable. Thirty eight percent of pike were over 24\", and 15% were larger than 30\". The mean length of Northern Pike sampled was 22.52 inches with lengths ranging from 10.7 to 34.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of three Walleye were captured. The 2017 trap net catch rate was 0.2 fish/net night. This was the first ice-out trapping netting survey, therefore data for comparison is unavailable. Size structure analyses were not run due to sample size. The mean length of Walleye sampled was 29.21 inches with lengths ranging from 26.7 to 31.0 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       A spring panfish assessment targeting bluegill and black crappie was conducted on Mons Lake in late May.  This was the first assessment of this type done on the lake.  A routine population assessment using only gill nets was conducted in late August to evaluate the gamefish populations.  Six lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice for a total of 12 net lifts in the panfish assessment.   Most of the fish caught were measured, bluegill, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish, were subsampled.  Scales were taken from the bluegill and black crappie for aging data. <br> \n       The spring trap netting was effective at sampling bluegill, catching 611 fish (50.9/TN) between 2.4 and 9.6 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 6.3 inches and modal length 6.5 - 7 inches.  Fish seven inches and larger accounted for 27% (n=167) of the catch with 9% (n=57) more than eight inches.  Six of the fish (1%) were more than nine inches in length.  Ages 3 through 10 were represented in the 2010 bluegill sample.  A strong 2005 year class accounted for 38% of the sample with 21% from the 2004 year class.  Age 3 bluegill showed slow growth, and ages 4 and 6 normal growth, while the remaining age groups fast growth when compared to an area mean table. <br> \n       When looking at past summer trap netting from routine surveys, few of the bluegill caught were more than seven inches in length and those fish usually came from the gill nets.  Most of the bluegill caught in the late summer trap nets were less than five inches in length.  Summer trap net catches ranged from 103.2/set in 1969 to 28.5/set in 1998.  An ice-out assessment was conducted in 1992, but that assessment caught only one bluegill. <br> \n       The 2010 spring trap nets so far have produced the largest black crappie catch when compared to past summer surveys  and ice out assessment.   A total of 26 crappie (2.2/trap net) were caught in the 2010 panfish assessment.  In previous summer surveys the gill nets were the most successful summer gear type for sampling crappie.  The biggest gill net catch was six crappie in the 1988 population assessment.  The summer trap nets have caught only one black crappie which was also in 1988.  No crappie were caught in the 1992 ice out assessment.    <br> \n       Crappie in the 2010 assessment measured from 7.6 to 9.9 inches in length with a mean length of 8.5 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 8 - 8.5 inches and 19% (n=5) of the fish were more than nine inches in length.  Ages 3 through 5 were represented in the sample with the majority (69%) of fish from the 2007 year class.  The age 3 fish displayed fast growth while the other two year classes showed normal growth.  <br> \n       Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were two additional panfish species sampled in the 2010 panfish assessment.  The hybrid sunfish were the more numerous of the two species having a catch rate of 14.1/trap net (n=168) compared to 3.3/trap net (n=40) for pumpkinseed sunfish.  The hybrid sunfish were on the average larger than the pumpkinseed sunfish.  The hybrid sunfish measured from 4.3 to 8.3 inches in length with a mean length of 6.9 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 7 - 7.5 inches and 54% (n=90) were more than 7 inches in length.  The pumpkinseed were between 4.8 and 7 inches in length with a mean length of 5.8 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 5 - 5.5 inches.  There was also one four-inch green sunfish caught in the assessment. <br> \n       The gamefish species caught in the 2010 panfish assessment included seven largemouth bass between nine and fourteen inches and five northern pike ranging from 13 to 20 inches in length.  Two roughfish species, bowfin and yellow bullhead, were also netted in the panfish assessment. <br> \n       Spring trap net assessments which target bluegill and black crappie appear to provide the most information on the presence of larger individuals in the populations.  Spring electrofishing could also prove to be another method of sampling the panfish populations in Mons Lake.  Field notes from the 2010 spring largemouth bass electrofishing reported the observation of numerous bluegill between seven and nine inches as well as crappie between seven and ten inches common.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mons Lake is a small, deep 86 acre lake west of Swanville. The access has a concrete ramp with a small parking area and is maintained by the township.  Water clarity was excellent for a lake in central Minnesota with a secchi disk reading of 13 feet.  The lake is charaterized by shallow shoal waters with marl bottom and dense muskgrass growth in addition to some bulrush and waterlilies.  Steep drop-offs are common around much of the lake.      Fish species in the lake that may interest anglers include walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  The summer survey was conducted using only gillnets which tend to target gamefish.  Northern pike numbers appear to have declined since the last survey and are at the lowest abundance since 1969.  Average size of the pike seen in the survey was about 4 pounds.  Walleye numbers were up slightly and the population appears to be dominated by bigger fish as most of the fish in the survey were over 20 inches in length.  Largemouth bass continue to be abundant but the average size was small by anglers' standards at about 8 inches.  Some trophy size bass up to 20 inches can be found in the lake but it could take some work to find them.      Tullibee or cisco were netted for the first time in a summer survey since 1969 so the population appears to be increasing.  Average size of the tullibees was about 11 inches which makes it about the right size for the larger gamefish in the lake.  The downside to the higher numbers was the presence of the white grub or triaenophorus in the flesh of most of the fish.  Yellow perch numbers continue to low in Mons Lake.  Higher perch numbers are desired as they can be an important prey species for pike and walleye and they have also been found to help maintain a well-balanced bluegill population.  Few bluegills and black crappies were seen in the summer survey but those species are better sampled using other methods.  Past surveys recorded bluegills up to 7 inches but the average size was closer to 5 inches.      Selective harvest of fish is encouraged for both angling and spearing to minimize the impact on the fish community.  Releasing larger northern pike and walleye and voluntarily limiting harvest of larger panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Mons Lake has a small watershed that presently has good buffers around much of the lake that filter the water entering but human activity could easily affect the water quality.  Lakeshore owners could help to protect the water quality by maintaining home septic systems, keeping shoreline buffer zones, limiting removal of inlake vegetation, and using zero phosphorus lawn fertilizers, thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.  The Todd County Planning and Zoning office in Long Prairie also has a good website which provides information for shoreland property owners. (www.co.todd.mn.us/PlanningZoning/planning.htm)</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Mons Lake is a small, deep water lake with excellent summer water clarity compared to others  in central Minnesota.  The access on the north side of the lake has a concrete ramp, but the parking area is small.  The lake is characterized by shoal waters with marl bottom and dense muskgrass growth in addition to some bulrush and waterliles.  Steep drop-offs are common around much of the lake.   <br> \n       The lake supports a little known fishery that could interest trophy seekers.  Results from the summer survey suggest that northern pike numbers may have increased from the last survey, but quality fish are still present.  The average size of pike caught was one of the highest in the area at five pounds.  The largest pike observed in the survey was over 36 inches.  The walleye caught in the survey also averaged over five pounds and local residents report an occasional ten pound walleye being caught.   Largemouth bass continue to be abundant but the average size was less than a pound, although, fish over 19 inches have been documented in past surveys. <br> \n       The most abundant fish species caught in the summer survey was tullibee or cisco.  Locals report that tullibee provide a popular winter fishery.  White grub or triaenophorus was found in the flesh of half the fish checked during the summer survey which may make the tullibee undesirable to anglers.  The tullibee are also an important food species for the gamefish in the lake and promote good growth in large predators such as northern pike and walleye.   <br> \n       A panfish assessment conducted in late May showed a bluegill population with some desirable features.  Although the average size was around six inches, fish over seven inches were common, with some over nine inches measured.  Finding quality black crappie would likely be more of a challenge as all the crappie sampled in 2010 were less than ten inches in length.  Other common species in Mons Lake include hybrid sunfish, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, and bowfin or dogfish. <br> \n       Selective harvest of fish is encouraged for both angling and spearing to minimize the negative impact on the fish community.  Releasing larger northern pike and walleye and voluntarily limiting harvest of larger panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Mons Lake has a small watershed that presently has good buffers around much of the lake that filter the runoff, but increasing human activity could easily affect the water quality.  Lakeshore owners could help protect the water quality by maintaining home septic systems and leaving native vegetation along the shore and in the water. <br> \n       Fishermen and recreational boaters are reminded to diligently clean their boats and trailers before moving between lakes to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mons Lake is a small, deep 86 acre lake west of Swanville.  The access has a concrete ramp with a small parking area and is maintained by the township.  Water clarity was good for a lake in central Minnesota with a secchi disk reading of 14.4 feet.  The lake is characterized by shallow shoal waters with dense muskgrass growth in addition to some bulrush and waterlilies.  Steep drop-offs are the norm around most of the lake.     Fish species in the lake that may interest anglers include walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegills, black crappies, and bullheads.  Walleye abundance appears to be low for the lake type despite stocking every third year, and the presence of certain year classes indicate some natural reproduction also occurs.  Large, trophy size walleye, over ten pounds, are present in Mons Lake.  Northern pike numbers were within the normal range for the lake type, with almost half of the pike sampled exceeding 24 inches in length.  Mons Lake appears to have a moderate abundance of largemouth bass.  While most of the bass were less than 12 inches in length, some bass up to nineteen inches were observed indicating the lake has the potential to produce trophy size fish.  Catch rates for bluegills suggested a normal population abundance for the lake.  Size structure of the population showed an improvement from the last survey with an increase in the number of bluegills over six inches, however, most of the fish continue to be under five inches and grow slowly.  Black crappies and yellow perch continue to show lowabundance.  Higher numbers of yellow perch are desirable as they are a principal prey species for northern pike and walleye, and have also been shown to help maintain a well-balanced bluegill population.  Brown and yellow bullheads were both recorded in the summer survey with fish up to fourteen inches measured.      Other species in the fish community included white suckers, pumpkinseeds, hybrid sunfish, and bowfin.  Tullibee are also known to be present in the lake.  No tullibee were netted in the survey, but several were observed in stomachs of the northern pike, indicating their importance as a food species for the gamefish.       Neascus was common on the northern pike and also found on some the bluegills and walleye.  Neascus is a black trematode or parasite usually found in the skin of a fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds such as herons and king-fishers.  Skinning the fish removes most of theparasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Human cannot be infested.     Selective harvest of fish is encouraged for both angling and spearing to minimize the impact on the fish community.  Releasing larger northern pike and walleye and voluntarily limiting harvest of larger panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Mons Lake has a small watershed, being a responsible lakeshore owner by maintaining home septic systems, keeping shoreline buffer zones, and limiting use of lawn fertilizers will help promote good water quality for the lake.</p>",
