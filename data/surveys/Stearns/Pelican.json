A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake. \n\nNorthern Pike abundance increased to rate of 10.5/gill net which is at the upper limit of the normal range for similar lakes.  Four age classes were sampled and growth rates appeared to be average.  Walleye abundance also increased from the previous survey to above average. Four age classes were sampled with age 2 Walleye being most abundant and growth rates were average. The Yellow Perch catch rate declined tenfold in gill nets since the 1975 survey, but shoreline seining showed that reproduction and abundance were similar.  Bluegill were sampled in trap nets at rate of 33.9/net which is within the range expected for similar lakes.  Black Crappie were sampled at a rate of 5.2/gill net, which is above the expected range for lakes like Big Spunk. \n\nThe rough fish population is at or above average abundance.  Length frequency data showed several years classes present.  Common Carp were sampled in trap nets at a rate greatly exceeding the range typical of similar lakes. One adult Common Carp sampled, while the rest appeared to be mostly yearlings.  \n\nOther species sampled in low numbers included: Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish) hybrid and Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.\n</p>",

The catch rate of Northern Pike in gill nets did not significantly change from the previous survey, and remained above average for lakes similar to Pelican. Northern Pike caught ranged in size from 11.5-26.4 inches and averaged 19.7 inches in length. No dominant year class appeared, and the majority of fish caught were between 2-4 years old. The growth rate of pike in Pelican Lake was average. The catch rate of Walleye in gill nets significantly increased from the 1988 survey and rose to 2.5 times the state average for this lake type. Walleye caught ranged in size from 9.6-30.3 inches and averaged 16.7 inches in length. The average weight of Walleye caught (2.0 lbs) remained near the lake class average. Five year old fish were the most common year class caught (33% of total), while good representation of two, four, and seven year old fish was also found. The growth rate of Walleye was average. The catch rate of Bluegill in trap nets (62.7/net) appeared to increase from the previous survey (20.9/net) and rose above expected values for this lake class. Bluegill caught ranged in size from 2.8-7.5 inches and averaged 5.0 inches in length. The average weight of Bluegill (0.1 lbs) was below average for this lake class. The catch rate of Black Crappie in trap and gill nets has historically been low, and remained low in this survey. Other fish species that were caught during the assessment included: Bowfin (dogfish)(4.3/trap net), Brown Bullhead (3.2/trap net), Yellow Perch (1.3/gill net), Pumpkinseed Sunfish (2.3/trap net), Black Bullhead (1.2/gill net), and Yellow Bullhead (3.8/gill net). The catch rates of Bowfin and Brown Bullhead were above expected levels for this lake class, while catch rates were average for Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Black Bullhead and Yellow Bullhead. The catch rate was below average for Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a 337-acre recreational development lake located a half mile southwest of the city of St. Anna in central Stearns County.  The lake has good water quality with a maximum depth of 46 feet, secchi disk reading of 13.5 feet and adequate dissolved oxygen (greater than 3ppm) down to 24 feet.  Pelican Lake has a public access located along the northwest side of the lake and is a popular lake for all types of recreational use.  The Pelican Lake watershed is approximately 2,000 acres and consists of 60% agricultural/pasture, 21% marsh, 10% forest, 6% residential, and 3% grassland.  This was the first survey since 2000. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2010, the Division of Ecological and Water Resources conducted a point intercept plant survey of Pelican Lake.  The aquatic plant community is diverse with 30 species observed including four - emergent, three - floating-leaved and 23 submerged and free-floating plants.  Yellow water lily was the most common floating-leaf plant and occurred in 10% of the shallow (0-5 feet) water sites.  Submerged plants were found growing to a maximum depth of 20 feet.  Northern watermilfoil was the most common submerged species and occurred in 51% of the survey sites.  Other species that were found in at least 20% of the sites included: muskgrass, coontail, star duckweed, flat-stemmed pondweed, narrow-leaved pondweed, and Canada waterweed.  Curled pondweed was surveyed on May 28, 2010 by DNR Fisheries and was found growing at or near the surface on less than 1% of lake surface area. <br> \n <br> \nPelican Lake has been stocked with walleye since 1945, however since 1980; the DNR has stocked walleye fingerlings every other year at a rate of 0.5 lbs/littoral acre.  In 2003, the Pelican Lake Association started stocking additional walleye fingerlings annually supplementing the DNR stocking.  Since 2003, Pelican Lake has been stocked annually at a rate of 2.5 lbs/littoral acre, which is five times the average stocking rate for Montrose Area lakes.  The catch of walleye (6.8/gill net) increased significantly from 2000 (1.5/gill net) is above the expected values for similar lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 7 - 26 inches with a mean length and weight of 17 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Growth of female walleye was faster than the statewide average reaching 15 inches by age 3.  It appears that the supplemental stocking by the lake association is contributing to the walleye fishery and in the next couple of years; anglers might expect moderate success for walleye as the 2008 year class represented 51% of the ageing sample and will be of harvestable size. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of northern pike in 2010 (25.2/gill net) was less than 2000 (34.1/gill net), but still above the expected values for similar lakes.  Northern pike abundance has been high and above expected values since 1982.  Northern pike ranged in length from 11 - 29.5 inches with a mean length and weight of 19 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Only 4% of the northern pike sampled were longer than 24 inches and no northern pike longer than 30 inches were sampled.  Growth of female northern pike was faster than the statewide average through age 4, whereas growth of male northern pike was similar to the statewide average.  Female northern pike reached 22 inches in four years, whereas males reached 20 inches in the same length of time.  No male northern pike older than age 4 were sampled. Due to the high number of small northern pike, anglers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike (less than24 inches) and release the medium to large pike (greater than 24 inches). <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing on May 10, 2010.  A total of 103 largemouth bass were captured in 0.99 hours of electrofishing for a catch rate of 104.6 fish/hour.  This was greater than that reported in 2000 (27.4 fish/hour, night time).  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 5 - 17 inches and averaged 12 inches and one pound.  Forty-seven percent of the bass sampled were larger than 12 inches and 13% were larger than 15 inches.  Anglers might expect good fishing for bass 12 - 15 inches with an occasional fish larger than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch of yellow perch (0.2/gill net) was similar to 2000 (0.3/gill net) and below expected values for similar lakes.  Yellow perch abundance has been low since 1982, the same year that northern pike abundance started to increase.  Pelican Lake exhibits a typical pattern similar to many area lakes where high northern pike abundance equates to low yellow perch abundance and reduced walleye stocking success. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill (9.7/trap net) catches were lower than 2000 (29.8/trap net) and below expected values for similar lakes.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3 - 8 inches with an average length of six inches.  Growth of bluegill was similar to the statewide average taking 5 - 6 years to reach seven inches.  Historically, the bluegill population has been abundant and small. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of black crappie (0.2/trap net) was below the expected values for similar lakes.  Only two black crappies were sampled during the survey.  Historically, black crappie abundance has been low.  The highest black crappie catch was 0.3/trap net in 1982. <br> \n <br> \nFour sensitive species were collected during the seining survey.  Those species included: banded killifish and blackchin, blacknose, and pugnose shiners.  These species are highly sensitive to habitat degradation. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance during the survey included:  bluntnose minnow, bowfin (dogfish), brook silverside, central mudminnow, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Johnny darter, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a 337-acre lake located five miles northeast of Avon in Stearns County. It has a maximum depth of 46 feet and a small watershed dominated by agriculture (pasture/row crops) and open water. A state-owned public access is located on the northwest side of the lake. Pelican Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and was last surveyed in 2016. Water clarity has always been good on the lake (10-year average - 13 feet) and was 17 feet on July 10th. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish to 24 feet. Emergent and floating-leaf vegetation was last surveyed in 2016, and the primary species present were cattail and white waterlily.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were similar to 2016 and remain within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Pelican Lake. Walleye fingerlings have been stocked by DNR for many years with supplemental stocking taking place by the lake association during years that DNR does not stock. Walleye lengths ranged from 18.4 to 24.5 inches with an average length and weight of 20.3 inches and 2.9 pounds. Growth is average in the lake with Walleye taking about six years to reach 20 inches. All Walleye sampled in 2023 were longer than 15 inches with 35% being longer than 20 inches, indicating that the size structure is skewed towards larger individuals and that recent stockings may not have been successful.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches have been high in Pelican Lake for years. While the catch in 2023 was the lowest on record and pike numbers appear to have decreased in relation to historic numbers, they are still at the high end of what we would expect to see for lakes similar to Pelican Lake. Most pike were small, ranging in length from 14.6 to 34.7 inches with an average length and weight of 19.5 inches and 1.7 pounds. Only 21% of the Northern Pike sampled were longer than 21 inches and 9% were longer than 26 inches. Anglers should expect to catch ample numbers of small pike (< 22 inches) with an occasional larger (> 26 inches) fish. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled on May 25th by daytime electrofishing. The catch rate of 42.2/hour was less than half the catch observed in 2016 and was lower than the Sauk Rapids Area daytime average of 52/hr. Lengths ranged from 6.5 to 18.0 inches with an average length of 12.0 inches. Fifty-three percent of Largemouth Bass were longer than 12 inches and 19% were longer than 15 inches. While the bass numbers appear to be down, the size structure is still in good shape and anglers have a good chance at catching a larger fish (> 15 inches). <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch was lower than 2016, but was similar to 2010 and within the expected range for lake class. Lengths ranged from 3.1 to 9.2 inches with an average length of 5.8 inches. While the Bluegill catch was low, anglers can expect to find a few nicer Bluegills roaming around the lake. Black Crappie numbers have always been low and catches in 2023 were no different. Lengths ranged from 7.0 to 13.6 inches with an average length of 10.4. While the crappie numbers are low, anglers may run into a few larger crappie (> 10 inches) during certain times of the year.  <br> \n <br> \nNo Yellow Perch were captured in 2023 after only one was captured in 2016 and two were captured in 2010. Perch abundance is likely limited due to the high Northern Pike abundance and to a lesser degree, increasing Walleye numbers. Other species captured in 2023 included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is located one half mile southwest of St. Anna in Stearns County.  The lake has a surface area of 337 acres and a maximum depth of 46 feet.  The north and west sides of the lake are shallow and have dense, submerged vegetation.  The lakeshore is heavily developed, except for the west side (largely wetland), but the watershed is small and water quality is good.  The lake is a popular for fishing and a public access is located on the northwest side of the lake.Northern pike are abundant and dominated the summer lake survey in 2000.  Catch rates of pike were very high, but the average size (18.8 inches) and weight (1.5 pounds) were low and growth rates were slow.  Few pike longer than 24 inches were caught, although the largest fish was 32.8 inches.  Although the catch rate of pike has increased since the last survey in 1993, catch rates for pike have always been relatively high.  Few yellow perch were captured, probably due to the high numbers of northern pike.  It seems likely that there are too many small pike and not enough prey fish to support good pike growth.  Walleye catch rate was low in 2000 and has declined since 1993, but the average size was high (3.6 pounds, 22 inches).  Lakes with a high northern pike population and few yellow perch typically do not support high numbers of walleye.  Walleye fingerlings are currently stocked every other year, but no walleye were caught from fish stocked in 1994 or 1997.  All walleye captured in 2000 were 9-11 years old.  Walleye stocked in 1999 may have been too small to be caught in gill nets in 2000.  The high number of small pike probably limit the survival of fingerling walleye.  The largemouth bass catch rate declined from 1993 to 2000 during spring electrofishing, but was still normal for area lakes.  The average size (13 inches, 1.4 pounds) was relatively large, despite slow growth rates.  The largest bass caught was 20 inches long and estimated to be 14 years old.  Good natural reproduction was evident from the wide variety of bass ages from electrofishing as well as numerous juveniles caught during shoreline seining in late summer.The catch rate for bluegill declined from 1993 to 2000, but was within the expected range for lakes similar to Pelican; trap net catch rates for bluegill are highly variable and typically fluctuate from survey to survey .  The growth rate and average size of bluegill (5.3 inches) caught in summer trap nets were average.  Some large individuals up to 9 inches were captured.  No black crappie were captured in 2000 and historical crappie catch rates have been low.  Other panfish caught included hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and green sunfish.Catch rates for both yellow bullhead and black bullhead were average for the lake type, but average size was high; yellow bullhead averaged 0.8 pounds each and black bullhead averaged 1 pound.  Other species captured included brown bullhead, bowfin, white sucker and several minnow species.Anglers can help improve the fishery by selectively harvesting smaller northern pike (less than 22 inches) and releasing larger fish.  This may allow both better pike growth and better walleye survival.  Wise stewardship by lakeshore owners and efforts to protect natural shoreline areas can also help preserve good water quality and habitat for fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a 337 acre lake located three miles north of Avon in Stearns County. It has a maximum depth of 46 feet and a small watershed dominated by pasture, row crops, and open water. A DNR public access is located on the northwest side of the lake. Pelican Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and was last surveyed in 2010. Anglers can expect good fishing for Walleye, smaller Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent and floating-leaf vegetation was common along shore in early July, primarily cattail and white waterlily. Submerged vegetation was not surveyed, but northern watermilfoil, chara, and coontail were the most common species found in 2010. Water clarity was excellent; Secchi depth was 14 feet on July 5 and MPCA data show a summer average of 13 feet over the last ten years. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish down to 22 feet in early July. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were lower than 2010, but average for lakes similar to Pelican. Walleye fingerlings have been stocked for many years and after a low catch in the 2000 survey, the lake association stocked high numbers of Walleye fingerlings in addition to DNR stocking. This likely accounts for the high catch rate in 2010 and the lower result in 2016 after the lake association reduced their stocking. Walleye lengths in 2016 ranged from 9.8 to 28.3 inches with an average length and weight of 18.7 inches and 1.8 pounds. Most Walleye were between 2 and 5 years old and growth was fast, reaching 17 inches in 3 years. Increased stocking may boost Walleye abundance, but the cost seems prohibitive, especially given the high number of Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches have historically been high. The catch in 2016 was lower than the past two surveys, but still well above the expected range for similar lakes. Pike were small; lengths in 2016 ranged from 15.8 to 33.7 inches with an average length and weight of 19.6 inches and 1.6 pounds. Only 3 percent of Northern Pike were 24 inches or longer, similar to 2010. High numbers of pike likely limit Walleye stocking effectiveness in Pelican Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled on May 26 by daytime electrofishing and bass numbers were high. The catch rate of 119.6/hour was almost three times the Sauk Rapids area daytime average of 43.3/hour and similar to 2010 results, but bass size was larger in 2016. Lengths in 2016 ranged from 5.9 to 17.6 inches with an average length of 12.9 inches. Of catchable size fish (>8 inches), 25% were 15 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were higher than in 2010, but within the expected range of values for lakes similar to Pelican. Lengths ranged from 3.3 to 7.8 inches with an average length of 4.8 inches. Black Crappie numbers were low, but also within the expected range for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 4.1 to 11.9 inches with a mean length of 7.0 inches. Surveys in late summer likely under represent panfish abundance and size; netting near shore around spawning time would be more effective to assess Bluegill and Black Crappie populations. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one Yellow Perch was captured in 2016 and two in 2010; perch abundance is likely limited by high Northern Pike numbers. Other species captured in 2016 included: Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nAn Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey was also conducted on Pelican Lake; results are summarized in a separate report. <br> \n</p>",

A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake. \n\nNorthern Pike abundance decreased from the 1982 survey to rate of 13.0/gill net but remained higher than the normal range for similar lakes Ages 2-6 were sampled, with age 3 and 4 fish being most abundant. Size ranged from 14-27 inches but most fish were 15-19 inches and growth was good.  The Walleye catch increased from 1.2/ gill net in the previous survey to 2.7 /gill net in 1988. Fingerlings stocked in 1980-1986 were represented in the sample. Size ranged from 11.5-22.6 inches. Over one-half were under 17.0 inches long and those over 18.0 inches were all females. Growth was good.  The Yellow Perch catch remained very low.  Largemouth Bass were sampled by night electrofishing in the fall. Bass were caught at a rate of 27.8 per hour electrofished. Sizes ranged from 6.2-16.5 inches and ages 1-7 were sampled. Of the 37 bass sampled, 21 were age 1 and 6.2-7.4 inches long. An additional 13 fish were at least 12.0 inches in length. Composite growth was slow through age 2, then good. Bluegills, at 20.86/trap net, were the most abundant panfish. Size ranged from 2.7-7.0 inches. Ages 2-6 were sampled, with the 1986 and 1984 year classes being most strongly represented. Growth was slow. Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were caught in near average numbers in trap nets. Black Crappie were sampled only in gill nets and ranged from 4.5-11.4 inches, most being 7.0-7.9 inches long. Bowfin numbers bordered on high compared to the local median. Yellow Bullheads were the most abundant bullhead species. Black and Brown Bullhead were caught only in gill nets. Individuals 12-14 inches were sampled for all three species. \n</p>",
