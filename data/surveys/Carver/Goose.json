THE BIGGEST MAJORITY OF THE FISH WERE 13 TO 19 REACHING 30 IN NUMBER BUT WERE VERY NICE FISH. IT APPEARS THE OPERATION OF THE FISH TRAP IN PETERSON CREEK AT LAKE WACONIA HAS RESULTED IN A SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER CARP POPULATION IN GOOSE LAKE. THE TRAP IS OPERATD SO AS TO ALLOW UPSTREAM MIGRATION OF SPAWNING NORTHERN PIKE BUT SOON AFTER THE UPSTREAM SPAWNING RUN IS COMPLETED, THROATS ARE INSTALLED WHICH ALLOW NORTHERN PIKE RETURN PASSAGE TO WACONIA BUT PREVENT CARP AND OTHER LARGE FISH FROM MOVING UP- STREAM. A 1960 SURVEY INDICATED A HIGH POPULATION OF CARP FOLLOWING A HEAVY WINTERKILL IN 1959-60. THESE LARGE CARP HAD TO MIGRATE FROM WACONIA. NO CARP WERE SAMPLED IN 1985 AND ALTHOUGH IT IS LIKELY SOME ARE PRESENT, THEIR NUMBERS ARE LOW. BETTER GROWTH OF ROOTED AQUATICS WAS OBSERVED IN 1985 WITH PLANTS GROWING TO A DEPTH OF 8 FT WHERE- AS IN 1960 (MANY CARP PRESENT) ROOTED AQUATICS GREW TO A DEPTH OF 5 FT. ALTHOUGH STILL A WINTER- KILL LAKE, IT APPEARS THAT THE FISH TRAP ON WACONA HAS MADE GOOSE LAKE A BETTER WATERFOWL LAKE IN 1985 THAN IT WAS IN 1960.</p>",
