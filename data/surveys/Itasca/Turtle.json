                "narrative": "<p>Little Turtle Lake is located north of Talmoon, MN in Itasca County, within the Chippewa National Forest, and the Bigfork River watershed. The lake has an area of 485 acres, littoral area of 226 acres (47% of total acres), maximum depth of 29 feet, and water clarity of 6 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nLittle Turtle Lake has been historically managed for Walleye and Northern Pike. The lake management plan (LMP) was last revised in 2007.  Walleye and Northern Pike were the primary management species and Largemouth Bass was the secondary species.   <br> \n <br> \nLittle Turtle Lake was sampled to assess the fish community in July of 2014.   A total of 9 gill nets and 9 trap nets were set in various locations and depths around the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the most common fish captured in 2014.  The catch rate of 30.8 per gill net was in the typical compared to similar lakes. Yellow Perch caught in gill nets ranged from 5.1 to 8.3 inches, and averaged 6.1 inches. Poor size structure likely limits angler interest although Yellow Perch are an important prey species in Little Turtle Lake.  <br> \n   <br> \nNorthern Pike were the second most common fish in the gill net sample.  The gill net catch rate for Northern Pike was 10.3 per net, which is a typical catch rate compared to similar lakes and for Little Turtle Lake.  Lengths ranged from 14.7 to 29.5 inches and averaged 20.8 inches.  Few pike exceeded 28 inches, failing to meet the length specific goal of the 2007 Lake Management Plan.   A lack of pike exceeding 28 inches may limit the popularity of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has been an important management tool for Little Turtle Lake.  Walleye fry were stocked from 1977-1999.  From 2002 to present, yearling and fingerling Walleye were stocked every other year.  The gill net catch rate was 5.4 per net in 2014. The catch was high compared to similar lakes, but typical for Little Turtle Lake.  Lengths ranged from 7.5 to 20.8 inches and averaged 13.9 inches.  Age and growth analysis identified seven year classes, but most fish belonged to the 2010 (43%) and 2012 (35%) year classes, both of which were stocked.  Most Walleye were relatively young, as Walleye averaged 3.7 years old and only 8% of sampled Walleye were age 6 or older.  Growth was near the statewide average, as Walleye exceeded 16 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nCisco (Tullibee) are an important prey species often associated with the production of large predators such as Northern Pike and Walleye.  The 2014 gill net catch rate was typical for the lake class, with a total of 22 caught or 2.4 per net. Length ranged from 7.9 to 15.8 inches and averaged 13.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch rate for Bluegill was lower than expected compared to similar lakes, at 4.8 per net, but the average length increased from the previous assessment, from 5.5 to 6.6 inches.  Bluegill length ranged from 3.2 to 10 inches and 29% of the catch exceeded the angler preferred length of 8 inches. Age data was not collected during the summer assessment, but data from a 2014 spring trap net assessment indicated moderate growth, as fish averaged 8 inches by age 7.  The spring assessment also indicated a high proportion of older individuals, as nearly 80% of the sampled fish were age-5 or older.  Good angling opportunities appear to exist, given the favorable size structure and relative abundance. The age structure and growth rate indicate the importance of low adult mortality in maintaining a quality size structure.  Anglers should be encouraged to voluntarily limit harvest to 5 or fewer Bluegill or practice catch and release. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have been traditionally very low. Catch rates remained low in 2014, as the gill and trap net catch rates were 0.9 and 1.3 per net, respectively in 2014. The catch rates were low compared to similar lakes.  Gill net crappies ranged from 4.3 to 6.9 inches with an average length of 5.7 inches. Trap net crappies ranged from 4.2 to 11 inches with an average of 7.6 inches. The trap net catch had a similar length frequency as a spring trap net assessment from June of 2014.  Crappies were not aged from the summer assessment, but age and growth analysis from the spring assessment identified 6 year classes with sporadic recruitment.  Many fish (48%) belonged to the 2012 year class.  Growth was near the statewide average as crappie exceeded 10 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nPassive gears like gill nets and trap nets are relatively ineffective at accurately sampling Largemouth Bass and past catch rates have been low, ranging from 0 to 0.1 per gill net and from 0 to 0.7 per trap net with no trend over time.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for bass for the first time in 2014 to better evaluate the bass populations.  A total of 26 Largemouth Bass were captured for a catch rate of 19.5 per hour.  This was a moderate catch rate for lakes in the Grand Rapids Area.  Largemouth Bass ranged 9.8 inches to 18.9 inches and averaged of 14.7 inches, indicating and the presence of quality fish. Age analysis identified seven year classes and recruitment appeared sporadic.  Growth was near the statewide average as bass typically exceeded 15 inches by age 6.   <br> \n <br> \nOther Species sampled included; Bowfin (dogfish), Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive exotic species are known from Little Turtle Lake.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n? <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Turtle Lake is located north of Talmoon, MN, in Itasca County within the Chippewa National Forest and the Big Fork River watershed.  The lake covers 475 acres, of which 226 are littoral (48%) and has a maximum depth of 29 ft.   <br> \n <br> \nPast sampling has indicated quality Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  A special assessment using trap nets was conducted in June of 2014 to evaluate the status of the Bluegill and Black Crappie in the lake.  This assessment consisted of 25 trap net sets.  Caution should be used when interpreting spring catch rates, as targeted sampling can result in variable catches that are not comparable to standard sampling.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 326 Bluegills were captured, resulting in a catch rate of 13.0 per trap net.  The population supported a favorable size structure, as lengths ranged from 3.3 to 10.0 inches with an average length of 7.1 inches.  The proportional stock density (PSD) of Bluegill exceeding 6 inches was 79 and the relative stock density (RSD-P) of Bluegill exceeding 8 inches was 20.  Two Bluegills exceeded 10 inches, resulting in a relative stock density of memorable (RSD-M) Bluegill of 1.  Class 31 lakes typically produce slow growing Bluegill.  Bluegill from Little Turtle grew faster than expected for the lake class, although overall, growth was moderate as Bluegill generally exceeded the angler-preferred length of 8 inches by age 7.  Recruitment appeared inconsistent as the 2009 year class comprised 42% of the sample.  The population supported a high proportion of older individuals, as nearly 80% of the sampled fish were age-5 or older and Bluegill averaged 5.7 years of age, suggesting a combination of low adult mortality and limited recent recruitment.  Good angling opportunities appear to exist, given the favorable size structure and relative abundance. The age structure and growth rate indicate the importance of low adult mortality in maintaining a quality size structure.  Anglers should be encouraged to voluntarily limit harvest to 5 or fewer Bluegill or practice catch and release. <br> \n <br> \nFifty-five Black Crappies were captured for a catch rate of 2.2 per trap net.  Size structure was favorable as crappie ranged in length from 4.8 to 12.0 inches.  PSD (8 inches) was 65, RSD-P (10 inches) was 24, and RSD-M (12 inches) was 2.  Sporadic recruitment is a typical trait for Black Crappie, often resulting in shifting age and size structures and boom and bust angling cycles.  Age analysis from Little Turtle identified 6 year classes with sporadic recruitment.  Many fish (48%) belonged to the 2012 year class.  Growth was near the statewide average as Crappie exceeded 10 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Northern Pike, Rock Bass, Walleye, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

Growth rates appear to be good.  The walleye sampled averaged 1.9 pounds and had an average length of 16.7 inches with 25.4 inches being the longest sampled.  Despite being stocked every other year since 2002, 31% of the fish sampled in this assessment were from non-stocked year classes.   <br> \n\tNorthern pike were sampled at a rate greater than the lake class expected range in gill nets, but a little lower than the previous assessment.  The average weight (3.2 pounds) of these fish was also greater than the expected range, in part, due to the abundance of prey available.  The average length was 24 inches; the longest was 32.1 inches, with most of the fish sampled in the 22 to 27 inch range. <br> \n\tBluegill had a trap net catch rate lower than the expected range, but the growth rates were within the lake class state average.  The catch rate was similar to historical catch rates except for the 1999 re-survey were the rate was within the expected range.  Bluegill ranged in length between 3.8-8.7 inches and the average length was 5.5 inches.  Anglers have indicated fair success at times. <br> \n\tYellow perch and tullibee, both valuable prey species, were sampled at all time highs, well above the expected ranges. The yellow perch sampled, averaged 6.7 inches with the longest being 9.3 inches.  Tullibee averaged 10.6 inches. <br> \n\tLargemouth bass were sampled at a rate within the expected range for trap nets, however this may not be an accurate indication of true abundance.  Preferred habitat, net avoidance, and unentrapment makes active techniques like electro-fishing better at assessing bass populations.  The lengths ranged between 6.7-8.0 inches. <br> \n\tWhile black crappie have been sampled in greater abundance in the past, only three fish were sampled in gill nets, lengths ranged between 4.8-11.8 inches. <br> \n\tOther species sampled in gill and trap nets include; black and brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2015 lake management plan (LMP) indicated Bluegill and Walleye were primary management species while Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike were secondary.  The LMP goal was to maintain a Walleye gill-net catch rate at 5.0/net.  Only gill nets were used in the 2020 survey.  Information from the 2020 spring electrofishing survey for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass are presented in another report. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catches have ranged from 6.8 fish/net in 2020 to 13.3 fish/net in 1982.  The catch in 2020 was the lowest on record but similar to lakes with similar habitat.  The sampled fish ranged from 15.1 to 31.9 inches and averaged 21.8 inches.  Seven age-classes were estimated with fish from age 1 to 7 represented.  Pike averaged 21.7 inches by age 4; which was similar to the statewide average of 20.5 inches.  Voluntary release of larger pike is encouraged so those genetics can be passed on to future generations. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been actively managed for many years.  The most recent strategy has been to stock 2 lbs of fall fingerlings/littoral acre (452 lbs) every other year.  Gill-net catch rates have ranged from 2.1/net in 1988 to 10.3/net in 1982.  The 2020 catch of 6.8 was above average for the lake (5.2/net).  The sampled fish ranged from 9.2 to 23.4 inches and averaged 15.1 inches.  The five year-classes sampled included fish from 2 to 8 years old.  Roughly 90% of the fish were age 2 or 4, both stocked years.  Based on the lake habitat only limited natural reproduction is anticipated.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 14.7 inches at age 4.  The Walleye population likely provides some good angling. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill-net catch rates have varied from 24.6 fish/net in 2020 to 112.2 fish/net in 2006.  The 2020 catch was the lowest on record yet above average for similar lakes.   Perch catches have generally been high with poor size distributions.  The sampled fish ranged from 4.1 to 8.5 inches and averaged 6.0 inches.  Perch are likely more important as prey for predators like bass, pike and Walleye than they are of interest to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee can be difficult to sample because they frequently live suspended over deep water, an area the survey nets were not designed to sample.  However, they are important to fish communities as a prey source for large predators.  Tullibee gill-net catch rates have ranged from 0.6 fish/net in 2020 to 25.5 fish/net in 1974.  The 2020 catch was the lowest on record.  The five sampled fish ranged from 13.9 to 14.8 inches and averaged 14.2 inches.  It appears only one year-class was sampled based on the length distribution. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Brown Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Turtle Lake is known for its walleye, northern pike, bluegill and crappie fisheries.  It is a productive lake that is rimmed with aquatic vegetation that can be dense in places.     Walleye were sampled in gill nets at a rate within the expected range for this type of lake.  They averaged 1.8 pounds and had an average length of 16.9 inches.  Natural reproduction produces most of the walleye in the lake.  In this assessment, only 1 of 27 of the aged walleye were from a year that was stocked.  Growth rates appear to be good.     Northern pike were at an all time high for Little Turtle Lake and above the expected range.  The northern pike sampled in gill nets ranged from 16.6 to 32.6 inches in length.  They had a mean weight of 2.4 pounds.  Growth is especially good for young northern pike, probably because of the high perch abundance.  Because northern pike will compete with walleye by feeding directly on them and by competing for the same foods, high northern pike abundance can limit walleye abundance.      Yellow perch are also at an all time high and above the expected range.  Although perch up to 11.0 inches were sampled, the mean length was only 6.8 inches.     Bluegill were sampled at an all time high in trap nets, yet this rate is still within the expected range.  Twenty percent of the bluegill sampled were between 8 - 10 inches in length.  Bluegill in Little Turtle Lake grow fast relative to similar lakes around the state.     Although few were caught in gill nets, black crappie were fairly abundant in trap nets.  They ranged from 4.2 - 12.6 inches in length (average 8.8 inches).     Although only three largemouth were sampled in our nets, anglers reported fair bass fishing during some periods of the year.      Other species sampled include; brown and yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee (cisco) and white sucker.     Little Turtle Lake appears to have poorer water quality than many surrounding lakes, with more frequent algae blooms, and occasionally, dense mats of vegetation forming.  While water quality can be determined partly by the shape and characterics of the lake, lakeshore owners can also do their part to preserve water quality by limiting the amount of nutrients they allow to reach the lake.  Maintaining natural shoreline vegetation, both in the water and on shore, will reduce the amount of nutrients reaching the lake by filtering them from run-off and by reducing shoreline erosion.  Vegetaion is also valuable fish and wildlife habitat.  Minimizing fertilizer use or using phosphorus free fertilizers is also beneficial.  Installing and regularly maintaining conforming septic systems also helps water quality.  Finally, this quality fishery can be preserved by all anglers by voluntarily releasing a portion of your catch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Turtle Lake is located just north of Talmoon, MN in the Chippewa National Forest and the Big Fork River watershed.  The lake management plan (LMP) was last updated in 2014.  Walleye and Bluegill were considered primary management species and Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass were considered secondary management species.   <br> \n <br> \nPast sampling has indicated quality Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  Little Turtle may be considered for a special sunfish regulation to maintain size quality.  A targeted survey using trap nets was conducted in June 2019 to evaluate the status of Bluegill and Black Crappie in the lake.  The survey consisted of 18 trap net sets.  A similar survey was conducted in June 2014.  Caution should be used when interpreting spring catch rates.  The timing of sampling in relation to spring weather conditions and fish movements can result in variable catch rates that are not comparable to standard summer sampling. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap-net catch rate was similar to the previous survey at 16.7/net.  Size structure decreased slightly, but was still favorable.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.7 to 9.6 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches.  The size distribution was influenced by the age structure of the sample.  Recruitment appeared consistent but variable.  Ages 3 through 10 were represented, but a strong 2015 year class (age 4) made up 42% of the sample.  This resulted in a high proportion of fish under 6 inches.  As in the previous survey, growth was faster than average compared to similar lakes.  Bluegill averaged 7.5 inches after 6 years.  Little Turtle offers good angling opportunities for Bluegill and appears to be a good candidate for a reduced bag limit regulation to maintain or improve size structure.  Anglers are encouraged to limit harvest to 5 or fewer Bluegill and release fish exceeding 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate was similar to the previous survey at 2.9/net.  Size structure was favorable, as crappie ranged from 7.6 to 12.3 inches with an average length of 10.3 inches.  Age analysis identified six year classes with variable recruitment.  Ages 4 through 6 made up the majority of the sample.  Growth was considered average compared to similar lakes.  Black Crappie averaged 9.9 inches after 5 years.  Little Turtle likely offers good angling opportunities for crappie at times. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Walleye, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish that Little Turtle Lake may be most noted for is its northern pike.  Abundance is fairly high and there is a good range of sizes available.  The northern pike that were sampled in 1993 averaged 19.6 inches long and 1.8 pounds.  They ranged from 9.1 to 32.5 inches in length and appear to grow at a normal rate.     The walleye population in Little Turtle Lake is about average for this type of lake.  There is a good range of sizes.  In 1993, walleyes were sampled that ranged from 12.1 to 22.8 inches long.  The average size fish that was sampled was about 16.4 inches long and the average weight was 1.7 pounds.  Walleyes were sampled from years in which no stocking took place suggesting that many of the walleyes in Little Turtle Lake may be the result of natural reproduction.     There is a large perch population with most of the fish being between 5 to 8 inches long.  Bluegill numbers are below average for this type of lake.  Black crappies aren't present in high numbers, but they appear to average about a pound.  Largemouth bass are also present but their population doesn't appear to be very large either.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Turtle Lake has a history of producing quality Bluegill and has been considered for a special harvest regulation.  The 2015 Lake Management Plan (LMP) indicated that Bluegill was a primary management species while Largemouth Bass was a secondary species.  The LMP goal for Bluegill was to maintain a size distribution having ?60% longer than 6 inches, 20% longer than 8 inches, and at least some 10-inch fish represented.  There was no specific LMP goal for Largemouth Bass.  During the spring of 2020, night electrofishing was used to sample the Bluegill and Largemouth Bass populations. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 138 Bluegill and one Hybrid Sunfish were sampled.  The sampled fish ranged from 3.1 to 8.9 inches and averaged 5.6 inches.  Only one fish exceeded 8 inches.  Consequently, the LMP size distribution goals were not met.  Males and females were equally represented in the sample.  Six age-classes were present with fish ranging from age 2 to 8.  Age-5 fish represented more than 50% of the sample, while age 3, 4, and 5 represented 84%.  Growth was slightly faster than other lakes with similar habitat.  Fish averaged 6.1 inches after five years of growth.  Age and growth information appears to reflect a population with variable recruitment and/or recent angler harvest of the larger, older individuals.  Anglers are encouraged to release some of the larger fish they catch because large males have a reproductive strategy that helps maintain quality size structure. <br> \n  <br> \nSpring night electrofishing for bass occurred in 2020 for only the second time.  Twenty-six Largemouth Bass were captured for a catch rate of 19.5 fish/hour compared to 16 fish (12 fish/hour) in 2020.  Size distributions were similar between samples; the 2020 sample included fish from 11.1 to 18.5 inches that averaged 15.2 inches.  Nine age-classes were estimated from scales with fish ranging from age 3 to 12.  Growth was similar to statewide averages.  Five year-old fish averaged nearly 14 inches.  The two electrofishing samples suggest the lake maintains a relatively low-density population with moderate size structure. <br> \n</p>",
