                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Louise Lake was conducted on August 1-3, 2022, by DNR Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Rock Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Common Carp, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff on August 1-3, 2022. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured 13 species of fish, including two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Pumpkinseed and Bluegill comprised a majority by biomass.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data will be combined with gill net data from a survey planned in 2023 to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Banded Killifish), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Louise is a 220-acre basin located approximately 5 miles northwest of Alexandria.  The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 15 feet and is common in shallow areas.  Stands of hardstem bulrush are present along the relatively undeveloped south shoreline.  Aquatic plants are important in maintaining water quality and clarity.  They also provide valuable spawning and escape cover for game fish.Northern pike dominate the fish community in Lake Louise.  Gill net catches averaged over 25 fish/net, well above the normal range of catch rates for lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics.  As expected, size structure of the population is poor.  Most of the fish are between 17 and 21 inches.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish likely provide the best fishing opportunities.  These species are relatively abundant and most of the fish are between 6 and 8 inches in length.  Black crappie are also an important part of the fishery, however standard test nets do not effectively sample this species during summer months.  Lake Louise is part of a special research project investigating black crappie populations in west-central Minnesota lakes.  Largemouth bass are also abundant, but the current size structure of the population is dominated by 8 to 12 inch fish.Walleye are considered a bonus fishery.  Only five fish were captured in gill nets.  These fish ranged from 18 to 26 inches in length and averaged about 3.5 pounds.  Walleye fingerling stockings between 1982 and 1998 were found to be unsuccessful in increasing walleye abundance in Lake Louise.  High northern pike numbers and low yellow perch abundance are likely responsible for poor stocking success. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Louise is a 220-acre basin located approximately five miles northwest of Alexandria.  Maximum depth is 33 ft.  Water quality is good.  Water clarity typically exceeds 8.0 ft throughout the summer.  In response, the lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Submergent vegetation is diverse and abundant over the 98 acres of the lake less than 15 ft in depth.  Stands of hardstem bulrush are present along the largely undeveloped south shoreline.   Habitat attributes are characteristic of a bass-panfish lake. <br> \n <br> \nSunfish populations, specifically bluegill, pumpkinseed, and largemouth bass are abundant.  Anglers can expect very active fishing experiences.  Fishing quality in terms of average size caught is marginal.  High densities, slow growth, and size-selective harvest of limited numbers of larger sunfishes influence size distributions and potential recreational fishing quality.  Mean length of bluegill captured during the 2006 survey was 5.6 inches.  The largest bass measured was 16.9 inches in length.  Black crappie support a boom or bust fishery due to inconsistent annual reproductive success or survival of young fish, but this popular panfish is commonly harvested.  Few 10.0-inch crappie have been observed during lake surveys.  Crappie in Lake Louise have a fairly short life span, seldom exceeding five years.  Older fish are subject to greater harvest pressure once growing to 9.0 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nClear, well-vegetated basins with extensive flowage connections tend to support an abundant northern pike population.  Northern pike have long been the primary predator making up Lake Louise's fish community. Surveys catches have commonly exceeded normal catch rates for similar basins.  Growth of pike is strongly density-dependent.  Older pike captured during the 2006 survey averaged only 20.7 inches in length at age-4.  Most captured pike were between and 16.0 and 20.0 inches in total length.  Mean weight was 1.8 pounds.  These hungry predators have over-run their available prey base.  Densities of adult yellow perch are very low.   No yellow perch were captured in 2002 gillnet catches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been captured in all surveys, but population abundance is low.  Immigration of adult walleye during annual spawning runs account for most walleye present in the lake.   Fingerling stockings have been unsuccessful in increasing population abundance and sustaining a viable fishery.  Survey catch rates were higher during an extended period when stocking was discontinued than that of catches in surveys following stockings.   Survival of stocking fingerlings is very poor in response to predation and extensive competition with northern pike and largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community residing in Lake Louise is overloaded with predators and small- to medium-size sunfishes too large for all but the largest predators to consume.  Anglers can serve a beneficial role in restructuring the fish community, improving gamefish growth rates, and enhancing walleye recruitment by focusing harvest on small northern pike, bluegill, and largemouth bass.  Release large pike to help control recruitment of small pike.  Specialized or consumptive fishing for large bluegill, crappie, and walleye and under-exploitation of harvestable surpluses of other gamefishes comes at the cost of fish community stability and sustainability. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Louise is a small (215 acres), moderately developed basin located northwest of Alexandria in Douglas County.  Water quality and clarity are good.  Consequently, this basin supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Habitat attributes are characteristics of a bass-panfish lake.  Lake Louise is connected to Lake Charley to the north and North Union Lake to the south.  Navigation between these basins is extremely limited.  A small public assess is located along the northwest shoreline.  Shore anglers enjoy fishing off the northeast shoreline adjacent to the inlet from Lake Charley. <br> \n     <br> \nThe fish community in Lake Louise is similar to many bass-panfish lakes found in west-central Minnesota.  Anglers can anticipate high catch rates of bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike.  These populations tend to be comprised of relatively high proportions of small- and medium-sized fish.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest these surplus gamefishes.  Black crappie and walleye are present but abundance of these species is typically low.  The few walleye that are caught are usually harvestable-size fish.  Mean size in 2011 was 16.5 inches and 1.6 pounds. <br> \n   <br> \nOther species captured during the 2011 survey included tullibee (cisco), pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass.  Less desirable species recorded in the survey catch included black, brown, and yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, and white sucker.  The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2017. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Louise is a small (215 acres), moderately developed basin located northwest of Alexandria in Douglas County.  Water quality and clarity are good and the lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Habitat attributes are characteristic of a bass-panfish lake.  Lake Louise is connected to Lake Charley to the north and North Union Lake to the south.  Navigation on the channel between these basins is limited.  A small public access is located along the northwest shoreline.  Shore anglers enjoy fishing off the northeast shoreline along Sunset Strip NW and the inlet channel from Lake Charley. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Lake Louise is similar to many bass-panfish lakes found in west-central Minnesota.  The lake supports abundant populations of Bluegills, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike. At elevated population densities, these populations tend to be comprised of relatively high proportions of small- and medium-sized fish. A majority of the Bluegills caught during the survey were 5.0 to 7.0 inches in length.  A few 8.0 inch fish were measured during the 2017 survey.  Largemouth Bass averaged 8.7 inches in length, but fish up 18.0 inches were observed.  Northern Pike captures averaged 19.2 inches.  Most pike were less than 22.0 inches in length.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest these surplus small gamefishes. Starting in May 2018, new Northern Pike regulations will allow harvest of more small pike.  Lake Louise falls within the North-central pike zone and anglers will be able to harvest up to 10 Northern Pike less than 22.0 inches in length.  Black Crappie and Walleye are present but survey catches are limited and population densities appear to be low.  The few Walleyes that were caught were large, older fish ranging from 19.0 to 25.0 inches long.  Black Crappie captures averaged 8.8 inches.  Modest numbers of 10.0-inch and larger crappies were measured.  The largest crappie caught measured 11.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLake Louise was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2015. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting August 14, 2017. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six sites, a 15-foot seine was used at four sites. Nearshore sampling captured 19 native species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Louise Lake from this survey is exceptionally high and well above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike density remains high.  Gillnet catches averaged 22.0 fish/net compared to an average CPUE of 20.0 fish/gillnet since 1966.  The size structures of the Northern Pike population is poor.  PSD was 24% and mean of fish captured was 1.6 pounds. Small fish have comprised the majority of fish captured in survey nets since 1966.  Age 2 and iii fish comprised 77% of fish captured in 1991. Northern Pike growth rates are similar to the lake classification mean.  Walleye abundance remains low in spite of intensive fingerling stocking.  Walleye CPUE was 3.0 fish/gillnet in 1991 after stocking fingerlings at between 1.5 and 2.0 pounds per littoral acre in five of the last nine years.  Walleye CPUE was 5.60 in 1981 prior to the initial Walleye stocking in 1982.  There is no correlation between fish stocking and dominant year classes in the 1991 survey.  Yellow Perch CPUE was only 0.6 fish/gillnet. Abundance declined significantly since 1986 when catches averaged 18.6 fish/gillnet.  However, catch rates had been low in past surveys, averaging 0.25 fish/gillnet and 2.8 fish/gillnet in 1976 and 1981, respectively.  Northern Pike density may be limiting Yellow Perch abundance.  Bluegill catch rates averaged 16.4 fish/trapnet compared to 20.4 fish/ trapnet in 1986.  Size structure, as measured by PSD, improved from 28% to 37% in 1986 and 1991, respectively.  The PSD of 37% is within a desirable range, however the WR of stock length fish was 79.7 and growth is slow to age 5.  This would suggest some overcrowding of fish 3-6 inches in length.  Largemouth Bass were captured at a rate of 27.3 fish per hour of standard daytime ac electrofishing.  Ages 1 through 6+ fish were present indicating consistent natural reproduction.  The PSD of captured fish was 38% with a RSD=P of 7%. The growth rate of Largemouth Bass is similar to the lake classification mean.  The efficiency of stocking Walleye fingerlings to increase Walleye abundance appears to be poor.  Northern Pike abundance is most likely the limiting factor.  Reducing the abundance and improving the size structure of the Northern Pike population may lead to favorable charges in the fish community and enhance angling quality in terms of the average size of fish caught.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Louise has maintained an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  The distribution ofaquatic plants is similar to the results from the last vegetation survey in 1976.  Submergentvegetation grows to a depth of 15 feet and is common to abundant in shallow areas.  Hardstem bulrushcoverage is limited to stands along the southwest shoreline.  Wild rice is rated as common invegetation transects and has increased in density over the past twenty years.  Northern pike density remains high.  Gillnet catches averaged 15.5 fish/net which exceeds the normalrange of mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (3.5 - 10.5fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches have ranged from 17.6 to 22.0 fish/net in previous surveys.  Sizestructure of the northern pike population is poor.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.5 pounds. Daytime, DC electrofishing yielded 49.5 largemouth bass per hour.  There is a limited amount ofsuitable habitat to sample during daylight hours.  About one-half of the catchable size fish were 12inches in length or greater, however no fish exceeded 14 inches.  Bluegill catches increased from 16.4fish/trapnet in 1991 to 41.4 fish/trapnet in 1996.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similarlakes is 6.1 - 46.6 fish/trapnet.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 6.3 to 45.0 fish/net in previoussurveys.  Approximately 70% of the fish captured were 6 inches in length or greater, but few exceeded8 inches.  Walleye are considered a \"bonus\" angling opportunity on Lake Louise.  Gillnet catchesaveraged 2.2 fish/net which is within the expected range of mean catch rates from similar lakes. Gillnet catches have ranged from 1.5 to 5.6 fish/gillnet in previous surveys, nearly identical to thatexpected range.   Mean weight of fish captured in 1996 was 2.4 pounds.  Walleye fingerling stocking wasinitiated in 1982, however there is no evidence to suggest that stocking has increased walleyeabundance.  Yellow perch catches averaged 5.8 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 0.3 to18.6 fish/net in previous surveys.  Most of the fish captured were between 5 and 8 inches in length.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Louise is a small (215 acres), moderately developed basin located northwest of Alexandria in Douglas County.  Water quality and clarity are good and the lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Habitat attributes are characteristic of a bass-panfish lake.  Lake Louise is connected to Lake Charley to the north and North Union Lake to the south.  Navigation on the channel between these basins is limited.  A small public access is located along the northwest shoreline.  Shore anglers enjoy fishing off the northeast shoreline along Sunset Strip NW and the inlet channel from Lake Charley. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Lake Louise is similar to many bass-panfish lakes found in west-central Minnesota.  The lake supports abundant populations of Bluegills, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike. At elevated population densities, these populations tend to have high proportions of small- and medium-sized fish. A majority of the Bluegill caught during the survey were 4.0 to 7.0 inches in length.  A few 8.0 inch fish were measured during the 2023 survey.  Largemouth Bass averaged 11.8 inches in length, but fish up 20.0 inches were observed. Northern Pike averaged 21.1 inches. The largest pike measured 35.0 inches, but most pike were less than 22.0 inches. Anglers are encouraged to harvest these surplus small gamefishes. Starting in May 2018, new Northern Pike regulations now allow harvest of more small pike. Lake Louise falls within the north-central pike zone and anglers are able to harvest up to ten Northern Pike less than 22.0 inches in length. Black Crappie and Walleye are present but survey catches are limited and population densities appear to be low. The few Walleyes that were caught ranged from 15.0 to 20.0 inches. The few crappies that were sampled ranged from 8.6 to 11.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLake Louise was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2015. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",
