                "narrative": "<p>Vanduse Lake is located about two miles south of Jacobsen in northeastern Aitkin County.  It has bog-stained water and is relatively shallow with a maximum depth of 27 feet.  There is a public access with a gravel ramp on the west side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake supports a popular panfish fishery, but the most recent survey suggests the size of the fish has decreased over the last decade.  The average size of bluegill in survey trap nets was 6.1 inches in 2012, compared to 6.5 inches in 2002, and the percentage of fish greater than eight inches decreased from 22% to 1%, between the two surveys.  Similar changes were seen in the black crappie size structure in survey gill nets where the average size was 6.7 inches in 2012, compared to 7.9 inches in 2002.   <br> \n <br> \nAngler harvest can impact the quality of bluegill populations.  Continually removing large, sexually mature sunfish from a population causes the remaining fish to begin reproducing when younger and smaller.  This reduces bluegill growth rates, as more energy is used for reproduction rather than growth, which increases the time it takes to produce fish of a desirable size.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate of 11.7 per gill net was similar to previous surveys dating back to the 1980's, which have consistently been high compared to similar lakes.  These pike averaged 20.9 inches and ranged from 12.2 to 32.6 inches. The size structure showed improvement as the percentage of fish greater than 24 inches increased from 12% in 2002, to 26% in this survey.  While catching large pike (greater than 24 inches) can be exhilarating, anglers are encouraged to release large fish due to their role in maintaining quality size structure of many species, and to maximize the sporting benefit for multiple anglers by recycling these quality fish. <br> \n</p>",

Van Duce has a history of occasional winter kill with the last known winterkill occurring about twenty-five years ago.  The public access has a gravel ramp and is located on the west side of the lake. Vanduse has been noted for years for producing quality sized bluegill and black crappie.  Bluegill in this survey averaged 6.5 inches in length but the fish caught ranged up to 9.5 inches in length or about three-quarters of a pound.  The average black crappie sampled was about 8 inches long, but several fish greater than 12 inches, or about one pound in size, were caught.  Northern pike fishing should also be good in Van Duce Lake.  Northern pike are more abundant than normal for this lake type and while the average size northern sampled was less than 20 inches in length several northern pike greater than 30 inches in length were caught.Early summer electrofishing indicated that there is a good population of largemouth bass in Van Duce Lake.  Bass sampled ranged from seven to almost 16 inches in length with an average size of almost 12 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Reports from lake residents describing a severe winterkill on Vanduse Lake were received late in the winter of 2019.  The lake has a history of winterkill particularly in the north basin.  To follow up with these reports a post winterkill survey was conducted on 6/03/2019. Two gill nets and six trap nets were set at varying locations around the lake.  Both gears caught fish in good numbers indicating the severity of the winterkill may not have been as severe as originally thought. Though not directly comparable since only 2 gill nets were used compared to 6 in the standard survey, catches of Northern Pike (15/net) and Black Crappie (14/net) were at or above historical averages. Trap net catches showed a catch of 5 Bluegill per net which is lower than the long term average of around 30 so it's possible that Bluegill density may have been reduced to some degree.  Nonetheless restocking of the lake was not necessary.  Periodic winterkills occur frequently in the area and are generally thought to help improve growth rates and size structure of sunfish species and Northern Pike populations by reducing intra and interspecific competition.  We encourage people to report potential winterkills for our records as many likely go unnoticed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in Vanduse Lake provides quality angling opportunities for panfish and northern pike. In this survey, black crappies were caught at normal rates for this lake type and most of the fish were 9 to 10 inches long. The lower number of smaller crappies will result in lower angling success in two to three years. Slower growth of the larger crappies will result in few crappies over 11 inches. Bluegills, which were caught at above normal rates, were above average in weight. Anglers will have the opportunity to catch more acceptably-sized bluegills in the next couple of years. Few smaller bluegills were caught in this survey, indicating the population will decrease in a couple of years and result in lower angling success. Pumpkinseeds were also larger than average and probably will also provide good fishing for a couple of years and then decrease in abundance.    Northern pike remained abundant. The average size is somewhat small, however 19 percent of the northerns in this survey were at least 21 inches long and six percent were at least 28 inches long. Recruitment and size structure has been consistent across the lake surveys, indicating continued stability in pike angling on the lake.    Yellow perch, the northern pike's main forage, were caught at normal rates despite high northern pike abundance. Yellow perch grew slowly and do not reach sizes acceptable for anglers.    No walleyes were caught in this survey, and only two were caught in the last survey. Lack of quality walleye spawning habitat, intense northern pike predation on small walleyes, and the potential for walleye predation on young black crappies are factors indicating walleye management may be inappropriate.     Yellow bullheads, on the other hand, were caught at above normal rates and the bullheads averaged over a half pound each. The bullheads provide an alternative target species for anglers. </p>",

The trap net catch rate for black bullhead, largemouth bass and black crappie are below their respective first regional quartiles. Northern pike ranged from one to eight plus years of age with no fish sampled from the 1981 year class and a strong year class established in 1985. Growth rates are normal. Bluegill ranged from three to eight plus years of age with strong year classes established in 1980, 1981 and 1982. Growth rates for the second and third increments are thirty-three and twenty seven percent slower than normal respectively. Black crappie ranged from two to six years of age. Although the sample is small, the growth rates appear to be normal. Yellow perch ranged from three to six years of age with apparently strong year classes established in 1983 and 1984. Growth rates for the first and second increments were thirty-eight and twenty-eight and twenty-six percent slower than normal.</p>",
