Bluegill and Pumpkinseed are both common and about equal in abundance. The Bluegill are somewhat larger than the Pumpkinseed, especially those Bluegill from deeper water. Largemouth Bass are present though in low densities.Yellow perch are common with some perch up to 12 inches captured; however, about half the perch have yellow grub or Neascus, especially toward the south end of the lake.Black crappie have never been recorded in Delwater lake.</p>",

With a maximum depth of 32 feet and a 133 acre littoral zone, Dellwater is prone to occasional winterkills. Most likely due to such an event, a standard population assessment conducted in 2000 failed to sample any Largemouth Bass (LMB). This initiated a re-introductory stocking of 4620 LMB fingerlings in 2002. In turn, the stocking prompted periodic monitoring. <br> \n <br> \nIn early June of 2015, a night electrofishing assessment took place on Dellwater Lake.  This targeted effort collected 58 LMB for measurement before being released back into the lake.  This resulted in a catch rate of 44.4 LMB/hour of electrofishing.  Lengths ranged from 8.5 to 18.9 inches with an average of 14.3 inches.  This assessment yielded the highest catch rate and largest average lengths of any since before 2000.  From these results, it appears that the recovered LMB population is healthy and continuing to expand in Dellwater Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Delwater Lake is a 180-acre lake located in western Beltrami County.  Much of the lake is less than 10 feet deep, and the maximum depth is 24 feet.  Delwater Lake is classified in lake class 29.  Other class 29 lakes in the Bemidji area include Sandy (0124), Medicine, and Bagley.  Delwater has a history of partial winterkills and reintroductions of fish species.  Fish populations in winterkill lakes can exhibit wide fluctuations in abundance and growth rates of fish.  The 2002 fisheries management plan lists bluegill as the primary management species, with largemouth bass and black crappie managed as secondary species.   <br> \nThe 2010 population assessment showed a very abundant bluegill population dominated by small fish.  Bluegill have flourished since the last winterkill reintroduction in the late 1990's.  Although some fish over 9.0 inches in length were present in the catch, the average size was only 5.0 inches.  Growth rates for this bluegill population are slow.   Black crappie are present in Delwater Lake.  Catch rates were below the median for this lake class.  Five age classes of fish were identified in the catch.  Unlike the bluegill population, crappie have not been as prolific since the last winterkill, and are just starting to become re-established at previous levels.  Average size was 6.8 inches in length.  Barring another winterkill event, black crappie should continue to increase in abundance.  The largemouth bass population has shown improvement since the last bass assessment was conducted in 2008.  The electrofishing catch rate for bass was 38 fish/hr, which is similar to other lakes in the area that are managed for bass.  Bass up to 18.0 inches in length were present in the sample.  Average size was on the small side at 10.0 inches in length due to the presence of two very abundant year classes of young bass (2007 and 2008).  Hopefully, largemouth bass numbers will expand to the point where they can effectively control bluegill numbers through predation.   Currently, the northern pike population is the most notable part of the Delwater fishery.  Average size was 24.2 inches in length, with 54% of the catch greater than 24.0 inches in length.   <br> \n</p>",

Much of the lake basin is shallow with abundant aquatic vegetation and an average depth of 8 feet.  This survey was conducted to evaluate the status of the Black Crappie population of Dellwater Lake, which was reintroduced through stocking after a severe winterkill event occurred in the winter of 1996.   <br> \nDellwater Lake was re-stocked with adult Black Crappie prior to spawning in 2002, 2006 and 2007.  The 2015 survey captured a total of 65 Black Crappie resulting in a catch rate of 3.82/trap net.  A total of 5 year classes of Black Crappie were identified in the catch, with 85% of the catch comprised of age-4 (2011 year class) and age-5 (2010 year class) fish.  A small number of Black Crappie from the 2007 stocking were identified.   Black Crappie captured ranged from 5.12 inches to 10.75 inches with an average size of 7.53 inches in length.  While the re-establishment and successful reproduction of the species was confirmed, age and growth analysis showed that Black Crappie in Dellwater Lake are growing slowly in comparison to other area lakes, which may limit the maximum size they are able to obtain.  The lake currently has high numbers of small Bluegill that are directly competing with Black Crappie for forage, which may be hindering Black Crappie growth rates.  The most notable fishing opportunities on Dellwater Lake at this time are for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike, which are able to utilize the abundant, small Bluegill as forage.  While not recorded in the catch, numerous Largemouth Bass up to 19 inches in length and northern pike exceeding 24 inches in length were captured in this survey.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Delwater Lake is located about 30 miles northwest of Bemidji off County Road 32.  It is a small lake that experiences periodic partial winterkills.  The last documented loss of fish was over the winter of 1995-96.  A new public access capable of handling about 10 fishing rigs was developed in 1999 on the west side of the lake.  The lake is relatively clear with abundant submerged vegetation scattered throughout the lake.  The last documented fish stocking was walleye fry in 1986.  Winterkills and time have removed all known remnants of that stock.At least some bluegill, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish survived the last winterkill, and their populations are currently recovering from that event.  Most of the panfish are currently too small to be of interest to anglers, but a few large brood stock are present.  Future angling prospects are good, if winterkill can be avoided.Largemouth bass were not sampled in the lake, but they have been sampled in past assessments.  They are presumed to be absent due to the last winterkill.  No attempt has been made to reestablish the population to date.  Black crappie have never been sampled in Delwater Lake.Northern pike are tolerant of low oxygen levels and have maintained a presence in the lake.  They were sampled at above normal abundance for this lake type.  Average weight in the 2000 assessment was 2.3 pounds, a size large enough to be acceptable to many anglers.Yellow perch are abundant, and many are large enough to be of interest to anglers.  Thirty seven percent of the sample measured over 8 inches.  Past assessments have shown a high incidence of parasites in the flesh of perch.  Though some perch fillets may be unsightly, they are still edible.  Brown bullheads are abundant and are relatively small with a mean length of about 9 inches.  Other species sampled in 2000 were white sucker, hybrid sunfish and rock bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dellwater Lake is a 199-acre lake located in western Beltrami County.  The lake is classified as moderately productive and surround by forest and agricultural land.  Water clarity averages 19 feet and the maximum depth is 29 feet.  Dellwater has a mean depth of only 8 feet and is 82% littoral (< 15.0 feet), making it prone to partial winterkills.  There are 2.5 miles of shoreline with no inlets or outlets connecting to other waterbodies.  A public boat access is located on the western shore and has space for 10 vehicles. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed on Dellwater Lake in 2020 to assess the fish community.  Gamefish species targeted by anglers in this lake include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was high and has steadily increased since 2005.  Northern Pike ranged from 14 to 28 inches in length and averaged about 2 pounds each.  With 72% of Northern Pike outside the statewide/zone protected slot of 22-26 inches, anglers should have the opportunity to catch harvestable sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill lengths ranged from 4 to 8 inches and averaged 7 inches.  Bluegill abundance was high and all but 1 fish were less than 8 inches long.  Bluegill ages ranged from 1 to 10 years old.  Bluegill growth is slow in Dellwater, with fish averaging just over 4 inches at 4 years old.  The Bluegill population appears stunted due to high abundance, causing slow growth. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie ranged from 6 to nearly 11 inches and averaged around 9 inches.  Black Crappie abundance has recovered since adults were stocked in 2002, following a partial winterkill.  Black Crappie also grow slowly in Dellwater Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 7 Largemouth Bass were captured with lengths ranging from 9 to 19 inches.  Previous surveys targeting Largemouth Bass in 2006, 2008, and 2015 confirmed the population has reestablished following stocking to reintroduce the species in 2002. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are an important forage species for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass.  Yellow Perch abundance was below average compared to similar lakes in the area.  Yellow Perch ranged from 6 to 7 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been found in Dellwater Lake.  AIS can be transferred by anglers and boats from infested to non-infested waterbodies.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake.  Please follow the current AIS regulations to avoid spreading to other lakes. <br> \n</p>",
