                "narrative": "<p>Gervais Lake is the largest of a chain of five lakes located in the cities of Little Canada and St. Paul.  The chain of lakes includes, from upstream to down, Kohlman (74 acres), Gervais (234 acres), Keller (82 acres), Round (20 acres) and Phalen (198 acres).  Boat access to Kohlman, Gervais, and Keller is from a Ramsey County Park on a subbasin of Keller Lake (Spoon Lake).  The access has parking for 10 vehicle/trailer combinations.Bluegill were the most abundant fish captured in this assessment, making up 42% of the gillnet catch and 93% of the trapnet catch.  Over half of the fish were between 6 and 7 inches long, with few over 7 inches.  All fish captured were 4 years old or less and exhibited good growth.Black crappie captured were small, with few over 8 inches long.  Numbers were below average for this type of lake and near historic lows for netting done on this lake.Walleye were caught in numbers of 3.50/gillnet, the second highest ever for this lake and the highest since stocking started in 1994.  All fish were age 2 or 4, matching stockings in 1998 and 1996.  Over one-third of the fish were at least 20 inches long.Largemouth bass were captured in moderate numbers during daytime electrofishing.  Most were small, however some 15 and 16 inch fish were measured.Northern pike were low in number, with only two fish captured (25.55 and 34.92 inches).One tiger muskellunge was captured, measuring 32.68 inches and age III, matching the 1997 stocking.White sucker were captured in good numbers for this type of lake and near the median of historic catches in Gervais Lake.  Yellow perch numbers, after reaching historic highs in 1995, dropped to near the historic median for the lake.  Golden shiner were present in low numbers.Yellow bullhead were present in low numbers, with only two fish captured.  No black bullhead were captured, the first time this species was not found in the lake. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gervais Lake is categorized as lake class 24 with a surface area of 235 acres; with 91 acres being littoral (38.7%). The lake has a maximum depth of 41.0 feet. The lake has variable, but fair water clarity with a maximum secchi disk reading during this survey of 4.0 feet which is lower than the long-term average on this lake. Gervais Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and hybrid Muskellunge. Recent management activities have consisted of the regular stocking of those two species. Walleye management was changed in 2017 to stocking 0.65 pounds of fingerlings per littoral-acre on an annual basis (59 pounds). The previous stocking regime since 1994 consisted of stocking fingerlings biennially, in even numbered years, at a rate of 2.0 pounds per littoral acre (182 pounds). Although Walleye were captured in netting assessments in this lake prior to initiation of stocking, it is likely that they migrated here from previous stockings in Phalen Lake. The stocking of hybrid Muskellunge was initiated in 1984 with the stocking of 125 fingerlings. Current hybrid Muskellunge stocking is conducted biennially, on odd numbered years, at a rate of 1.0 fingerlings per surface acre (235 fish). Gervais Lake is also stocked with surplus hybrid Muskellunge fry in years they are available. \n\nThe 2017 Walleye catch rate on Gervias Lake was 2.00 per gill net, the same as the 2011 survey but down from the 2005 and 2000 surveys (See Table 1). The average size of Walleye in the gill nets was 18.7 inches and sampled fish ranged in age from 3 up to 10 years old. \n\nThe Northern Pike catch rate of 9.20 fish per gill net is the highest on record for Gervais Lake. High numbers of Northern Pike can reduce the success of Walleye and Tiger Muskelunge stocking due to predation. The average size pike in 2017 was 25.5 inches long. Gervais Lake is in the North-Central Zone for Northern Pike management which allows a harvest of 10 fish, with 2 allowed over 26 inches, and a protected slot between 22 and 26 inches.\n\nTable 1. Historic gill net catch per net table for Gervais Lake:\nNorthern Pike (NOP); Walleye (WAE)\n\n        1958    1975    1980    1985    1990    1995    2000    2005    2011    2017\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNOP   0.75    7.50     6.75     5.25    2.67     1.00     0.17    1.33     6.20      9.20\n\nWAE   0.75    0.00     4.50     0.00   0.33      3.17    3.50     4.50     2.00      2.00\n\nThe panfish population in Gervais Lake is very typical of most metro area lakes. Yellow Perch, Black Crappie and Bluegill were all sampled within their normal range of abundance. Black Crappie averaged 7.7 inches long and perch were 6.7 inches long. The Bluegill catch rate was 49 per trap net which is two to three times lower than than the previous two surveys. A lower density Bluegill population can result in an increased size structure, but this was not evident in the 2017 survey yet. The average Bluegill was 6.0 inches long and only eight of 683 fish measured more than 7.50 inches long. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore and littoral fish species in Gervais Lake was conducted beginning on September 7th, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations, and site conditions (soft sediment and deep water) prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including no species that are intolerant of disturbance and three that is species that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted the week of September 7th, 2021 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill and Common Carp accounted for the majority of the biomass. Bluegill count per net was between the 25th and 50th quartile, while the Bluegill mean weight was just below the 25th quartile for similar Lake Class 24 lakes.  <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish, Black Bullhead, and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Twin Cities Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gervais Lake is primarily managed for Walleye (WAE) and Hybrid Muskie (TME). Recent WAE management began in 1994 and consists of stocking fingerlings biennially on even numbered years at a rate of 2.0 pounds/littoral-acre (182.0 pounds). In the 2011 assessment, walleye were sampled below the median level for abundance and mean weight in the gill net catch. While the gill net catch rate for walleye was down from that observed in 2009, it has remained within the normal interquartile range for abundance since 1995. The average size of WAE sampled in 2011 was 12.7 inches and 0.8 pounds. Only 10 percent of all WAE captured measured 15.0 inches or longer. Growth rate for sampled WAE was found to be fair with the average length being approximately 12.2 inches at age IV. Hybrid Muskie management began in 1984 and current stocking is conducted biennially on odd numbered years at a rate of 1.0 fingerlings/surface-acre (235 fish). Three Hybrid Muskies representing 2 different stocked year classes were captured during this assessment. The average size of TME captured was 35.7 inches and 11.5 pounds and growth rates were found to be average. Northern Pike (NOP) were captured above the median level for abundance and mean weight. The gill net catch rate for NOP was the highest recorded for this lake since 1980. The average size of NOP captured was 25.55 inches and 4.21 pounds. Approximately 23 percent of all NOP captured measured 28.0 inches or longer. Growth rates for NOP are good with the average length of sampled fish being 26.4 inches in length by age V. Yellow Perch (YEP) were sampled above the third quartile level for abundance in gill nets with catch rates being up from those observed in 2005.  The average size of YEP sampled was 6.9 inches and 0.16 pounds (6.3 fish/pound). The presence of good numbers of yellow perch in the lake could make angling for walleye and northern more challenging at the present time. Black Crappie (BLC) were sampled above the first quartile level for abundance and mean weight in trap nets. No BLC were present in the gill net sample. The average BLC captured was 7.05\" in length and 0.20 pounds. Approximately 10.0 percent of BLC sampled measured 8.0 inches or longer with the largest individual captured measuring 9.53 inches. Bluegill (BLG) were sampled above the third quartile level for abundance in trap nets and near the third quartile level for mean weight. The average size of BLG in the trap net sample was 6.7 inches in length and 0.24 pounds. Over 27 percent of all BLG sampled measured 7.0 inches or longer, with the largest individual captured measuring 7.83\" in length. Growth rates for BLG and BLC were found to be average. Largemouth Bass (LMB) also appear to have a significant presence in this lake as they were sampled above the median level for abundance in both gill and trap nets. The average size LMB sampled was 7.4 inches long and 0.28 pounds. While no electrofishing was conducted during this assessment, local anglers report some quality size LMB are present.</p>",

Black bullhead numbers are low.  The most abundant year class of northern pike were III annulus fish which corresponds th the 1978 yearling stocking.  Some fish of the 1980 yearling stocking were also caught.  No walleye were stocked in recent years in Gervais Lake.  Walleyes taken were aged as I and II annulus fish.  Both of these year classes correspond to walleye fingerling stockings made in Lake Phalen.  These fish in Gervais Lake are probably migrants from Lake Phalen.  More smaller carp were taken in 1980 than 1978, indicating a possible increase in the population.  The only other fish species which appears more abundant that the 1975 or 1978 nettings is the white crappie.</p>",

Northern pike were larger than average for local lakes and showed no recruitment since 1986.  Growth of pike was average for the area.  Black crappie were quite small and were thought to be undesirable to most anglers.  Largemouth bass and walleye were sampled in low numbers.  The walleye was undoubtedly a migrant from walleye fingerlings stocked into Lake Phalen.  One tiger muskie was captured.  This specimen was from the most recent stocking completed the previous spring.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gervais Lake is categorized as lake class 24 with a surface area of 235 acres, with 91 acres being littoral (38.7%). The lake has a maximum depth of 41.0 feet. The lake has variable, but fair water clarity with a maximum secchi disk reading during this survey of 3.5 feet, which is lower than the long-term average on this lake. Ramsey County operates a small park on the southwest corner of the lake which contains a picnic area, a swimming beach, and a fishing pier.  Boats gain access to this lake from a channel in adjacent Spoon Lake, and frequently use the park area as a starting point for water skiing and other recreational activities. The water is deemed suitable for swimming and wading, with decent clarity and low algae levels with moderate turbidity throughout the open water season. Gervais Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Hybrid Muskellunge (Tiger Muskellunge). Walleye management was changed in 2017 to stocking 0.65 pounds of fingerlings per littoral-acre on an annual basis (59 pounds). The previous stocking regime since 1994 consisted of stocking fingerlings biennially, in even numbered years, at a rate of 2.0 pounds per littoral acre (182 pounds). The stocking of Tiger Muskellunge was initiated in 1985 with the stocking of 125 fingerlings. Current Tiger Muskellunge stocking is conducted biennially, on odd numbered years, at a rate of 1.0 fingerlings per surface acre (235 fish). Gervais Lake is also stocked with surplus Tiger Muskellunge fry in years they are available. Concentrations of PFOS and mercury in fish tissue from Gervais exceed the water quality standard, and a fish consumption advisory has been issued for this lake for Bluegill, Black Crappie and Walleye. Monitoring contaminants in fish from Gervais Lake will be ongoing. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 Walleye catch rate on Gervais Lake was 4 per gill net, the third highest observed in Gervais Lake (See Table 1). The average size of Walleye in the gill nets was 14.89 inches and sampled fish ranged in age from 1 to 6 years old. The 2020 Northern Pike catch rate abundance (15.8 fish per gill net) was the highest on record for Gervais Lake. High numbers of Northern Pike can reduce the success of Walleye and Tiger Muskellunge stocking due to predation. The average size pike in 2020 was 25 inches long. Gervais Lake is in the North-Central Zone for Northern Pike management which allows a harvest of 10 fish, with 2 allowed over 26 inches, and a protected slot between 22 and 26 inches. The objectives of this regulation is to see some modest improvement in northern pike size distribution, reduce densities of small pike, and improve harvest opportunity for smaller and preferred size pike. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Yellow perch were also present in high numbers, of small size.  Black crappie were present in moderate to low numbers, with few fish over 8 inches.  Walleye were moderate in numbers, with all fish sampled acceptable to anglers.  Northern pike were present in low numbers, with several large fish sampled.  Two tiger muskie from the 1994 stocking were captured.  Largemouth bass numbers appear good, although no electrofishing was done to assess the population.  White sucker were present in moderate numbers.  Carp, black and yellow bullhead and golden shiner were present in low numbers.</p>",

Increasing use of the lake and shoreline by humans increases the pollution danger.Control of Fish Population: Although the presence of carp was not proved detrimental by this survey the lake should be given a thorough seining to evaluate the rough fish problem.  Crappies and sunfish numbers and their respective growth rates indicate no scarcity of these species.Stocking Recommendations: No planting of panfishes is needed.  If stocking is undertaken it should be bass or northern pike in numbers up to 10,000 fingerlings every two years.Fishing Procedures and Regulations: Spearing of northern pike should be prohibited but year around angling for perch, bullheads, crappies, and sunfishes should be permitted.</p>",

Recent Walleye management began in 1994 and consists of stocking fingerlings biennially at a rate of 2.0 pounds/littoral-acre. The current Walleye population is above the median level for abundance in the gill net catch and the average fish was 19.8\" in length and 3.4 pounds. Approximately 30% of the gill net Walleye were 24.0\" or longer. Walleye growth rates are above average. Yellow Perch were also sampled above median levels for abundance in gill nets with the average fish being 6.9\" in length and 0.13 pounds. Hybrid Muskie management began in 1984 and current stocking is conducted biennially at a rate of 1.0 fingerlings/surface-acre. Three Hybrid Muskies from the 2001 stocked year class were captured during this assessment. They averaged 34.8\" in length and 8.9 pounds. Their rate of growth was found to be average. Northern Pike were sampled at the highest gill net catch rate for this lake since 1990, but still below the normal range for abundance. The average fish captured was 28.9\" in length and weighed 5.4 pounds. Over half of the fish sampled measured 28.0 inches or longer, with the largest fish captured being 35.0 inches. Northern Pike growth rate was average.Bluegill were sampled above the normal range for abundance in trap nets with the average fish being 5.9\" and 0.15 pounds. Only 3% of the Bluegill captured measured 7.0\" or larger. Black Crappie were sampled in below median levels of abundance and averaged small in size.
