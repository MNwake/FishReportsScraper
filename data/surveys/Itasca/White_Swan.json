                "narrative": "<p>White Swan Lake is mainly a northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish lake, but has also been privately stocked with walleye.  Northern pike were sampled in the gill nets at a rate within the expected range for this type of lake.  Pike caught in gill nets ranged from 13.2 to 36.0 inches in length.  They had a mean length of 21.4 inches and a mean weight of 2.4 pounds.  Growth rates appear to be above average.     Walleye were sampled in gill nets at a rate within the expected range for this type of lake.  They ranged from 13.1 to 25.4 inches in length.  Growth appears to be good.     Black crappie appear to be abundant.  They were sampled in trap nets at a rate over twice the expected rate.  They ranged from 3.7 to 10.2 inches in length.     Largemouth bass were sampled in both gill and trap nets at rates that are within their respective expected ranges.  Because bass avoid nets, it is impossible to say how abundant they are from netting data.  Growth appears good.     Bluegill were sampled in trap nets at the highest rate yet seen on White Swan and the rate exceeds the expected range.  The bluegill sampled ranged from 3.4 to 8.5 inches in length.     Yellow perch were sampled in gill nets at a rate within the expected range.  They ranged from 5.1 to 9.3 inches in length.     Other species sampled include, golden shiner, white sucker, rock bass and pumpkinseed sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Swan Lake is 158-acre bass/panfish lake located 14 miles southeast of Bigfork, MN in northern Itasca County.  The lake has a moderate amount of development but no designated public access. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill-net catch in 2006 was 1.3/net, above the lake class average but down from the catch of 2.2/net in 1996.  Walleye fingerlings have been privately purchased and stocked by lake residents on several occasions, most recently in 2004.  Ages 9, 10 and 13 were represented in the 2006 gill-net sample, with six of the eight walleye corresponding to stocked years.  Sampled walleye ranged from 19.8 to 25.7 inches in length, and growth was similar to the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for northern pike (6.5/net) was near the lake class average (7.0/net) and similar to previous assessments.  Gill-net sampled pike ranged from 15.2 to 39.0 inches, with an average length of 23.1 inches.  Average weight of pike was relatively good at 2.8 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass gill-net catch rate (3.7/net) and trap-net catch rate (1.3/net) exceeded the expected normal ranges in 2006.  The gill-net catch is the highest on record.  Since gill-net catches are not a reliable indicator of largemouth bass abundance, it is difficult to say if this represents an actual increase in the population.  Gill-net sampled bass ranged from 5.8 to 17.1 inches, with an average length of 11.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for yellow perch was within the lake class normal range at 4.5/net.  Gill-net sampled perch ranged from 5.8 to 7.5 inches in length.  Yellow perch in White Swan Lake are more important as a prey species than as a target for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch rate for black crappie was well above the lake class normal range at 11.6/net.  Similar high catches have been observed in previous assessments.  As is often the case, the high catch rate was associated with poor size structure.  Trap-net sampled crappie ranged from 5.1 to 9.3 inches, with an average length of 7.3 inches.  Growth was more than 15% below the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch for bluegill was near the lake class average at 24.7/net.  Bluegill ranged from 3.5 to 7.8 inches, with an average length of 5.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: golden shiner, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish and rock bass.   <br> \n</p>",
