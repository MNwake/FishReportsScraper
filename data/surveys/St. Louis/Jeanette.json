Jeanette Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it is smaller (580 acres) than the lake class average of 1,242 acres.Jeanette Lake does not stratify thermally in midsummer and retains good oxygen to near the bottom.  There is no direct inlet to Jeanette Lake from other lakes, and the outlet has boulder drops and falls which prevent fish immigration.  Lake bottom substrates are mostly boulder and gravel.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 3 ft.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 1999 (all species combined) of 46 fish/net (40 lb/net) was normal for this lake class and was similar catches in eleven previous gillnettings in this lake dating back to 1973.  Lake Class 16 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.Fish populations in 1999, as in previous surveys and assessments, were dominated by white sucker, yellow perch, walleye, and northern pike.White sucker numbers in 1999 (8.8/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to previous gillnet catches in this lake.  Sucker sizes in 1999 averaged 17.1\", which is normal for this lake class.  The largest sucker was 22.6\".Yellow perch numbers in 1999 (26.6/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were similar to previous gillnet catches in this lake.  Perch sizes in 1999 averaged 8.2\", which is normal for this lake class.  The largest perch was 13.3\" (1.1 lb).  Perch growth (9\" at age 4) was faster than normal for the area.Walleye numbers in 1999 (7.3/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were lower than the average catch of 10.4/net in previous gillnet catches in this lake.  Walleye sizes in 1999 averaged 12.7\", which is normal for this lake class.  The largest walleye was 24.6\" (5.8 lb).  Most of the walleye were from strong 1995 and 1997 year classes.  Walleye growth (12\" at age 4) was normal for the area.Norther pike numbers in 1999 (3.7/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and higher than the average catch of 1.7/net in previous gillnet catches in this lake.  Pike sizes in 1999 averaged 19.7\", which is normal for this lake class.  The largest pike was 35.3\" (10.2 lb).  Pike growth (19\" at age 4) was slower than normal for the area.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jeanette Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 16, which consists of 38 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, shallow, and have bog-stained and very soft (unmineralized) water.  Jeanette Lake is smaller (580 acres) than the lake class average of 1,242 acres.  Jeanette Lake was not thermally stratified on 07/06/2004 and retained good oxygen to within a foot of the bottom.  Jeanette Lake has no inlets from other lakes, and the outlet has boulder drops and falls that prevent fish immigration.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are 40 % boulder, 22% gravel, 15% muck, 12% ledge, 9% sand, and 2% rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 3 ft.The 2004 fish population assessment consisted of 9 gillnet sets and 9 trapnet sets.  Twelve previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1973, used 1-12 gillnet sets.  Six of these previous investigations used 2-8 trapnet sets.  Trapnets in Jeanette Lake have historically caught very few fish.Fish populations in 2004, as in previous investigations on Jeanette Lake, were dominated  by walleye, white sucker, yellow perch, and northern pike.  No other fish species were captured in 2004.Walleye numbers in 2004 (10.4/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 8.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2004 averaged 13.9\" (1.1 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 13.5\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2004 was 26.4\".  Most walleye captured in 2004 were ages two and three, from the 2002 and 2001 year classes.  Growth of walleye captured in 2004 was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards. Yellow perch numbers in 2004 (20.1/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 22.6/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2004 averaged 8.2\" (0.3 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 7.7\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch captured in 2004 was 12.1\".  Most perch captured in 2004 were ages two and three, from the 2002 and 2001 year classes.  Growth of perch captured in 2004 was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.Northern pike numbers in 2004 (5.2/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 2.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2004 averaged 20.6\" (1.9 lb), which was near the median for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 21.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike captured in 2004 was 31.9\".  Most pike captured in 2004 were ages two through four.  Growth of pike captured in 2004 was normal (in the second or third quartiles) by area standards.Some of the game fish examined in 2004 were infected with neascus.  A few of the perch also had yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed when filleting the fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jeanette Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 16, which consists of 38 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, shallow, and have bog-stained and very soft (low mineral content) water.  Jeanette Lake is smaller (580 acres) than the lake class average of 1,242 acres.   <br> \n <br> \nJeanette Lake was partially thermally stratified on 07/06/2009 with a surface temperature of 68 ?F and bottom temperature of 61.7 ?F.  Five ppm oxygen was retained to within a foot of the bottom.  Jeanette Lake has four inlets including Nigh Creek and three unnamed tributaries that drain nearby bogs.   Two of the unnamed inlets had beaver dams creating barriers to fish movement.  The outlet is Jeanette Creek, a tributary to the Little Indian Sioux River, and it has boulder drops and falls that prevent upstream fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are 40% boulder, 22% gravel, 15% muck, 12% ledge, 9% sand, and 2% rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 6 feet. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 lake survey consisted of nine standard gillnet sets, nine standard trapnet sets, and four 1/4 inch trapnet sets.  Thirteen previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1973, used 1-12 gillnet sets.  Six of these previous investigations used 2-8 standard trapnet sets.  Trapnets in Jeanette Lake have historically caught very few fish.     <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2009, as in previous investigations on Jeanette Lake, were dominated by yellow perch, walleye, white sucker, and northern pike.  Bluntnose minnows and largemouth bass were caught only in the 1/4 inch trapnets in 2009.  No other species were sampled in the 2009 assessment, but past investigations caught burbot, golden shiner, and smallmouth bass.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 walleye catch rate (8.2/gillnet) was normal for Lake Class 16 and similar to the median (8.7/gillnet) for all investigations on Jeanette Lake.  Walleye sizes in 2009 averaged 14.5 inches (1.42 lbs), which was larger than normal for this lake class and higher than the median (13.5 inches) for all investigations on this lake.  Trophy size walleye were caught in past assessments including a 29 inch fish in 1982 (caught in a trapnet) and a 29.8 inch walleye in 2009 (caught in a gillnet).  Most of the walleye caught in 2009 were ages 2 through 4 but several other age classes were represented.  Growth of walleye captured in 2009 was somewhat slower than normal (first or second quartile, depending on age class) by area standards.   <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate in 2009 (11.0/gillnet) was normal for this lake class and lower than the median (21.4/gillnet) for all investigations on Jeanette Lake.  Perch sizes in 2009 were similar to past investigations, averaging 8.8 inches; the largest was 12.9 inches.  Perch were represented by 8 age classes in the 2009 catch and most were ages 2 through 5.  Growth was faster than normal by area standards.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 northern pike catch rate (2.7/gillnet) was normal for Lake Class 16 and similar to the median (2.0/gillnet) for all investigations on Jeanette Lake.  Pike sizes in 2009 averaged 21.7 inches (2.4 lbs), similar to the median (21.0 inches) for all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike caught in 2009 was 35 inches long.  The northern pike catch in the 2009 assessment was represented by 6 age classes, and growth was normal by area standards.   <br> \n <br> \nSome of the game fish examined in 2009 were infected with neascus.  A few of the yellow perch also had yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  These parasites do not infect humans, can often be removed when filleting the fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jeanette Lake is a 612 acre lake located eleven miles east of Buyck with its access' off the north side of the Echo Trail.  There are two public landings on the south side of the lake.  The main public landing has a concrete ramp with parking for approximately ten trucks and trailers.  The other is located in the US Forest Service managed Jeanette Lake Campground.  Jeanette has a maximum depth of 15 feet and the water is dark brown.  \n\nJeanette Lake is generally quite rocky and surrounded entirely by public land.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 6 feet.  Navigational hazards exist throughout the lake from shallow reefs to rogue boulders.  These hazards may not always be marked, use caution.\n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 28.8 fish/net; a fair amount lower than the historic average.  Fish species sampled in gill nets were yellow perch, walleye, white sucker, and northern pike.  The overall trapnet catch rate for all fish combined was 7.9 fish/net which was close to average for the lake.  Fish species sampled in trap nets were the same four as sampled in gill nets indicating a relatively simple fish community.  \n\nThe 2014 walleye gillnet catch rate was 6.3 fish/net which was a little below normal compared to similar lakes throughout the state.  Walleye lengths ranged from 7 to 30 inches with an average of 14 inches (1.4 pounds).  Growth is just below average compared to other lakes in the area.  Ages ranged from 1 to 18 years old.  The bulk of the catch was made up of 1 to 6 year old fish.  Jeanette lake is not scheduled to be stocked because of strong evidence of good natural reproduction, however it has been used in recent years as a lake that can receive surplus walleye fry from the Pike River Hatchery when an excess of fry are available.  \n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 2.4 fish/net which was slightly better than 25% of other similar lakes throughout the state.  Sizes ranged from 17 to 34 inches with an average of 22 inches.  Average weight was 2.7 pounds which was above 75% of other similar lakes.  \n\nThe yellow perch catch rate (14.3/gill net) was quite high compared to other similar lakes throughout the state.  Perch sizes in 2014 were similar to past investigations, averaging 8 inches.  The largest perch was 11.5 inches.  \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jeanette Lake is a 612 acre lake located eleven miles east of Buyck.  There are two public landings on the south side of the lake off the Echo Trail.  The main public landing has a concrete ramp with parking for approximately ten vehicles and trailers.  The other is located in the US Forest Service managed Jeanette Lake Campground.  This gravel ramp has a much smaller parking area, although many users are campground guests and keep their trailers at their camp sites.  Jeanette has a maximum depth of 15 feet and dark brown water.  \n\nJeanette Lake was weakly thermally stratified on July 9, 2019 with a surface temperature of 76 F and a bottom temp of 67 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish throughout the water column.  The lake's five inlets include Jeanette Creek and four unnamed tributaries that drain nearby bogs.  The lone outlet is also considered Jeanette Creek which flows into the Little Indian Sioux River.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, gravel, and ledgerock with muck in some of the bays.  Sporadic shallow boulders also exist within the lake basin.  Caution should be used while boating.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 6 feet.\n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 33.0 fish/net which was a little below average compared to past surveys.  Total yield was 28.1 lbs/net which was also a little below average.  Fish species sampled were walleye, yellow perch, white sucker, and northern pike. No trap nets were set as this survey was targeted to assess walleye stocking.\n\nJeanette Lake is stocked every third year with walleye fry.  The 2019 walleye gillnet catch rate was 12.8 fish/net which was above average compared to other similar lakes and very good compared to past surveys on the lake.  Walleye lengths ranged from 7 to 26 inches with an average of nearly 13 inches which was comparable to past catches on Jeanette.  Growth rates were average compared to other walleye lakes in the area taking 5 years to reach 15 inches.  Walleye from this sample ranged in age from 1 to 14 years old with every year class represented.  Most of the fish were under 6 years old and no single year class was dominant.  Nearly 41% of the 2019 catch came from stocked year classes.  This does not mean all of these fish were stocked as there is no way to account for the naturally produced fish that also exist within those stocked year classes.\n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 1.6 fish/net which was low compared to other similar lakes and slightly below average compared to past surveys on Jeanette.  Sizes ranged from 16 to 34 inches with an average of 22 inches.  The average weight was nearly 3 pounds which was good compared to other similar lakes.  \n\nThe yellow perch catch rate was 12.9 fish/net which was above average compared to other similar lakes but below average compared to past surveys on Jeanette.  Perch likely play a major role in Jeanette as a primary food source for walleye and pike.  Perch sizes were similar to past investigations, averaging 8 inches with the largest fish just over 12 inches.  \n</p>",
