THE 1981 ASSESSMENT AVERAGED 5.75/GILLNET WITH A FAVORABLE DISTRIBU- TION OF 8.0 - 23.9 FISH. BECAUSE FEW WALLEYES WERE BEING CAUGHT BY ANGLERS PRIOR TO THE SURVEY AND A LARGE PERCH POPULATION (157.50/GILLNET) WAS PRE- SENT, INCREASED FINGERLING STOCKING WAS RECOMMEND- ED TO REDUCE THE PERCH POPULATION AND MAKE THE WALLEYES VULNERABLE TO ANGLING. WALLEYE FINGERLING STOCKING AVERAGED 508 LBS/YEAR FROM 81-83. THE 84 SURVEY INDICATED A REDUCTION IN PERCH ABUNDANCE TO 18.25/GILLNET AND REPORTS OF EXCELLENT WALLEYE FISHING FOR TWO YEARS. IN 84 THE WALLEYE POPULA- TION WAS REDUCED TO 3.25/GILLNET ALONG WITH A REDUCTION IN SIZE OF WALLEYES SAMPLED. IN 84 WALL- EYE STOCKING WAS REDUCED TO IMPROVE PERCH ABUNDANCE AND INCREASE NUMBERS AND SIZE OF WALLEYES. WALLEYE FINGERLING WERE STOCKED AT AN AVERAGE OF 278 BL/YEAR FROM 84-87. THE 87 ASSESSMENT INDICATES AN INCREASE IN WALLEYE TO 7.50/GILLNET WITH A DOMINATE 82 YEAR CLASS. IT APPEARS THE 82 YEAR CLASS IS FROM CONSECUTIVE ANNUAL STOCKINGS OF 82 YEAR CLASS WALLEYES. THE PERCH POPULATION INCREASED FROM 18.25/GILLNET IN 84 TO 43.00/GILLNET IN 87. IT APPEARS WITH THE ABSENCE OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION THAT A GOOD WALLEYE FISHERY CAN BE MAINTAINED BY STOCKING 300-400 LBS. OF FINGERLINGS ANNUALLY. THE NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION IMPROVED FROM 0.50/ GILLNET IN 84 TO 5.75/GILLNET IN 87. IT APPEARS HIGH WATER CONDITIONS RECENTLY HAVE IMPROVED THE MARGINAL NORTHERN PIKE SPAWNING SITES. THE PRESENT NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION IS DOMINATED BY I AND II AGE CLASS FISH. THE BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATION HAS IMPROVED FROM 15.00/TRAPNET IN 84 TO 27.50/TRAPNET IN 87. THE PRESENT CRAPPIES ARE DOMINATED BY AGE CLASS FISH WITH FEWER II-V AGE CLASS FISH PRESENT. THE 84 BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATION WAS REPRESENTED BY II-IV AGE CLASSES, WITH II AND III AGE CLASSES SHOWING THE MOST STRENGTH. BLUEGILLS NOW AVERAGE 18.25/TRAPNET COMPARED TO 24.50/TRAPNET IN 84. THE PRESENT BLUEGILL POPULATION IS DOMINATED BY I AGE CLASS FISH AND FEWER II AGE CLASS FISH. THE 84 BLUEGILLS WERE REPRESENTED BY LARGER II-IV AGE CLASSES WITH III AGE CLASS FISH DOMINATING. SOME OF THE NON-GAMEFISH HAVE SHOWN INCREASES. FRESHWATER DRUM INCREASED FROM 8.00/GILLNET IN 84 TO 68.75/GILLNET IN 87. BLACK BULLHEADS HAVE INCREASED FROM 19.50/GILLNET IN 84 TO 201.25/GILL- NET IN 87. AN ABUNDANCE OF 4.0-5.9 BLACK BULLHEADS WERE SAMPLED IN TRAPNETS, AVERAGING 667.00/TRAPNET CARP HAVE DECLINED FROM 9.00/GILLNET IN 84 TO 1.50 GILLNET IN 87. BOWFIN HAVE INCREASED FROM 0.25/ TRAPNET IN 84 TO 3.50/TRAPNET IN 87. OTHER SPECIES SAMPLED IN LOW NUMBERS AND REMAIN UNCHANGED IN- CLUDE PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH, GREEN SUNFISH, AND YELLOW BULLHEAD.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Volney Lake is a 283-acre lake located approximately 3 miles southeast of the town of Le Center in Le Sueur County. It is one of the deepest lakes in the Waterville Area with a maximum depth of 67 feet. Roughly 46% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. Despite having better water clarity than most Waterville Area lakes, it is still considered eutrophic due to elevated nutrient levels. A DNR-owned public access is located on the southeast side of the lake off County Road 136. Volney Lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. Volney Lake is included in a research project investigating Walleye strain performance in the Cannon River chain of lakes beginning in 2018. The management plan calls for stocking a 50:50 ratio of Lower Mississippi and Mississippi Strain Walleye fry at a rate of 65,000 annually. Wetlands adjacent to Volney Lake are stocked with 32,500 Northern Pike fry in odd years.  <br> \n <br> \nVolney Lake is designated as a Tier-2 Lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program every 6 years. The 2019 standard survey was completed the week of June 10, 2020 using 6 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and 74 minutes of standard boat electrofishing. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were one of the most abundantly sampled species in 2019. A total of 87 were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 14.5/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Since 1993, catch rates varied from 0.5/net to 17.5/net with an average of 8.1/net. Lengths ranged from 4.7 inches to 11.1 inches with an average of 6.2 inches. The sample displayed poor size structure with only 2 fish over 8 inches long. Black Crappie were also common in the trap net sample with a catch rate of 8.2/net and a mean length of 6.2 inches. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 5 years old with 4 year classes present. The vast majority of Black Crappie were 2 years old. Growth was moderate with quality length of 8 inches exceeded by year 4. The large 2017 year class should provide a good fishing opportunity in another 2 years or so. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 70 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 7.8/net, indicating low to moderate numbers were present. Since 1993, catch rates have varied from 5.0/net to 21.3/net with an average of 13.3/net. The catch rate in 2014 was 11.6/net. Lengths in 2019 ranged from 2.9 inches to 8.9 inches with an average of 7.3 inches. Approximately 40% of the sample were greater than 8 inches in length. An additional 9 fish ranging from 4.3 to 9.2 inches were sampled with the gill nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 4 years old with 4 year classes present. The age-3 year class from 2016 was the most abundant. Growth was fast with 6 inches reached by year 3 and 8 inches exceeded by year 4. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were abundant in 2019 with 41 sampled with standard boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 33.2/hour. Lengths ranged from 4.4 inches to 19.1 inches with an average length of 12.7 inches. Five more Largemouth Bass ranging from 14.3 to 20.6 inches were sampled with net gears. Largemouth Bass ranged from 1 to 10 years old with 10 year classes present. Three and four year old fish accounted for approximately 55% of the sample. Growth was moderate with 12 inches exceeded by year 4. The habitat in Volney Lake is well suited for Largemouth Bass and the 2019 sample reflected that. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 29 Northern Pike were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 4.8/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. This was by far the highest catch rate since 1993 when the average catch rate was just 1.2/net. Lengths ranged from 21.5 inches to 30.9 inches with an average of 27.2 inches. Over 85% of Northern Pike sampled exceeded the legal minimum length of 24 inches. Three more Northern Pike averaging 24.3 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 2 to 4 years old with 3 year classes present. Approximately 63% of the sample was from 2016 (age-3), which was a non-stocked year. Growth was fast with fish reaching 24 inches in their third year of growth. <br> \n <br> \nJust 14 Walleyes were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 2.3/net, indicating low to moderate numbers were present. The catch rate in 2014 was 1.8 and the average catch rate from 1993 to 2019 was 1.5/net. Walleye ranged from 11.0 inches to 25.9 inches with an average of 20.4 inches. Size structure was good with over 40% of the sample greater than 20 inches. Fish were 2 to over 15 years old with 7 year classes present. About half the sample was from years in which fry were stocked. Growth was moderate with 15 inches reached in the third growing season.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were common in 2019 with a gill net catch rate of 11.8/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. The long-term average catch rate was 14.2/net, showing Yellow Perch have historically been abundant in Volney Lake. Yellow Perch ranged from 5.8 inches to 10.2 inches with an average of 7.6 inches. Approximately 30% of the sample exceeded 8 inches in length. Growth was relatively fast with 8 inches exceeded by year 3. The Yellow Perch population in Volney Lake should help support efforts to boost predator fish numbers while also providing a modest fishery themselves. <br> \n <br> \nOne of the most abundant species in Volney Lake was Freshwater Drum. In 2019 a total of 156 were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 26.0/net. The catch rate in 2014 was 9.8/net and the average catch rate since 1993 was 37.5/net. The mean length in 2019 was 12.9 inches. Although not often targeted, Freshwater Drum can provide both sport and harvest value to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp are rare in Volney Lake and just 7 fish averaging 25.5 inches were sampled with trap nets in 2019 for a catch rate of 0.8/net. Since 1993, catch rates have varied from 0.0/net to 2.6/net with an average of 1.0/net. Maintaining similar numbers should prevent Common Carp from having a major impact on habitat and game fish management in Volney Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2019 include Black Bullhead, Golden Shiner, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was good with a secchi depth of 16.5 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 10.0 ppm and 69.4 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 3.7 ppm and 54.1 degrees Fahrenheit at 30 feet. A thermocline was detected at approximately 15 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding.

                "narrative": "<p>\tVolney Lake in LeSueur County is a 283 acre lake located near LeCenter. A county-owned public access is located on the southeast shore, east of the swimming beach. Volney lake is Waterville DNR Area Fisheries\u0019 deepest lake at 69 feet, and is regarded as one of the clearest lakes. Volney is connected to Gorman Lake and the Cannon River through a wetland complex on the southern end of the lake.  <br> \n\tVolney Lake was surveyed the week of June 9th, 2008 as part of a walleye stocking research study evaluating the use of walleye fry, fryling, and fingerling stocking in similarly classified lakes. A secchi disk reading measured water clarity at 12.5 feet. Walleye gillnet catches remained stable from the 2006 assessment. 1.83 walleye per gill net were caught, with fish ranging from 16 to 22 inches.  <br> \n\tBlack crappies were the most abundant fish in trap net catches and second only to yellow perch in gill net catches. Most crappie surveyed were between 6.5 to 9 inches. Yellow Perch were abundant in gill net catches. Most perch were between 5 to 10 inches. Bluegill abundance was 21.33 fish per trap net, which is right at the average for this respective lake class. Two northern pike were caught in the assessment measuring 32 and 28 inches. Freshwater Drum (Sheephead) are present in moderate numbers; gill net catches are near the lake class average of around 11 fish per net. Drum range from 8 to 11 inches in length. <br> \n\tCommon Carp abundance was in the upper quartile range at 2.33 carp per trap net. Carp were spawning during the assessment, which contributed to higher catches in the near shore trap nets. Anecdotal angler and bowfisherman reports suggest a robust carp population with large individuals. Fish caught in the trap nets were large, ranging from 27 to 37 inches. Average (mean) fish weight was 12 pounds. Bowfisherman favor the lake for its water clarity and large fish size. <br> \n\tOther fish sampled include golden shiner and black bullhead. Flathead catfish were stocked in the lake in 1991. A total of 9 flathead catfish have been caught in gill or trap nets since that time, including 3 captured in the 2004 survey. Volney lake angler flathead catfish catch reports to the DNR are encouraged. <br> \n\tAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Volney Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n\tShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. <br> \n\tShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye are represented by larger fish, most being 15-19 inches in length.  Black crappie usually are moderately abundant and above average in size for area lakes.  Black crappie averaged 25/trap net with many fish at 6-8 inches and 15% were 9-11 inches.  Bluegill were in relatively low abundance at 5/trap net.  Black bullhead have been very abundant in recent years but have declined to 46/trap net from 280/trap net in 1992.  Northern pike remain in low abundance, averaging 1.2/gill net.  Freshwater drum continue to be abundant, 134/gill net being an extremely high number for this lake type.  In spite of the apparent decline in black bullhead numbers, the composition of the fish community does not appear to have changed in any obvious way since flathead catfish were introduced in 1991.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Volney is a fairly small (283 acres) yet deep (maximum depth of 67 ft.) lake located southeast of Le Center in central Le Sueur County.  A fishery survey was conducted in June 2003 to assess the status of the fish community and the aquatic habitat.  Yellow perch were common in the gill net catches and were at the highest abundance recorded in this lake since 1987.  Most perch were around 8 to 10 inches long.  Freshwater drum were at high levels of abundance compared to other similar lakes in Minnesota.  Most drum were around 8 to 10 inches long.  Bluegill and black crappie are common in Lake Volney.  Most bluegill were around 5 to 8 inches and black crappies were mostly 7 to 9 inches long.  Walleye were either large 20 to 27 inch, six to eight year old fish or small 10 to 12 inch one and three year old (age in 2004) fish.  Some northern pike are present and ranged up to about 30 inches in length.  Except for curlyleaf pondweed with can be common in May through June, other aquatic plants are rare.  Water clarity can vary greatly from less than one foot to 15 feet or more depending on the time of year and algae growth.  A public boat launch is located on the southeast shore, adjacent to a small county park.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Standard fish sampling gears used by the MN DNR include gill nets and trap nets, which are effective at sampling a variety of fish species and provide an index of abundance for a particular lake. Largemouth Bass are unique in that they are not effectively sampled in gill or trap nets, which makes it difficult to assess the population. As a result, targeted surveys using boat electrofishing are necessary to sample Largemouth Bass and assess their populations in lakes in which they are managed. Electrofishing allows fisheries managers to effectively sample Largemouth Bass, record length and weight, remove a scale sample for aging, and release the fish back into the lake. These Targeted Surveys focus exclusively on Largemouth Bass and are conducted in the spring time during daylight hours. <br> \n <br> \nVolney Lake is a 269 acre lake located in Le Sueur County southeast of the town of Le Center. A DNR-owned public access is located on the southeast corner of the lake. With a maximum depth of 67 feet, Volney Lake is the deepest lake in the area. A Targeted Survey was conducted on May 19, 2016 to assess the Largemouth Bass population. This survey consisted of boat electrofishing during the daytime at 3 standardized transects located around the shoreline of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 61.9 fish/hour. The lengths of Largemouth Bass in the 2016 survey ranged from 3.8 to 17.3 inches and averaged 9.3 inches. Most (59%) of the fish measured less than 8.0 inches. Largemouth Bass prefer lakes with heavy cover, like aquatic vegetation and woody debris. The next Largemouth Bass electrofishing survey will be conducted in spring of 2020, along with a Standard Survey using gill and trap nets during the summer.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Volney Lake is a 283-acre lake located approximately 3 miles southeast of the town of Le Center in Le Sueur County. It is one of the deepest lakes in the Waterville Area with a maximum depth of 67 feet. Roughly 46% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. A DNR-owned public access is located on the southeast side of the lake off County Road 136. Volney lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. Volney Lake is included in a research project investigating Walleye strain performance in the Cannon River chain of lakes beginning in 2018. The management plan calls for stocking a 50:50 ratio of Lower Mississippi Strain and Mississippi Strain Walleye fry at a rate of 500/littoral acre (N = 65,000) annually. Northern Pike fry are stocked into adjacent wetlands in odd years at a rate of 250/littoral acre (N = 32,500).  <br> \n <br> \nVolney Lake is designated as a Tier-2 Lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program every 6 years. The 2022 targeted survey was conducted the week of June 8, 2022, and methods were the same as a standard survey including number of nets set, net location, and time of year. Results from this targeted survey can be compared with results from standard surveys. The next survey is scheduled for 2025 and following surveys will follow the Tier-2 six-year schedule. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were the most abundantly sampled species in 2022. A total of 177 Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 29.5/net. Black Crappie catch rates since 1993 have varied from 0.5/net to 29.5/net with a mean of 10.3/net. Black Crappie ranged from 4.3 inches to 11.7 inches with an average of 6.5 inches. Only 12 Black Crappie were greater than 8 inches long. Black Crappie ranged from age-1 to age-7 with 5 year-classes present. The largest age class was age-2. Growth was moderate with quality length of 8.0 inches exceeded by age-4. The large 2020 year-class should provide a good fishing opportunity in another 2 years or so. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 83 Bluegills were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 13.8/net. Bluegill lengths in 2022 ranged from 4.2 inches to 10.0 inches with a mean of 7.6 inches. Bluegills ranged from age-2 to age-6 with 5 year-classes present. Growth was fast with 6.0 inches reached by age-3 and 8.0 inches exceeded by age-4. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 26 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.3/net, which was greater than the lake class average. Northern Pike ranged from 19.7 inches to 39.4 inches with an average of 29.5 inches. Over 90% of Northern Pike sampled exceeded the legal minimum length of 24 inches. Northern Pike ranged from age-2 to age-9 with 7 year-classes present. Growth was fast. <br> \n <br> \nJust 13 Walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 2.2/net, which was less than the lake class average (2.8/net). The average catch rate from 1993 to 2022 was 1.6/net. Walleye lengths in 2022 ranged from 20.5 inches to 25.8 inches with an average of 22.8 inches. Walleye ranged from age-6 to age-10 with 5 year-classes present. Most of the sample was from years in which fry were stocked. Walleye growth was moderate, reaching 15 inches in three years. The current management strategy has failed to produce a respectable Walleye catch rate and changes in the stocking plan should be considered. Perhaps additional information about Walleye strain performance will help improve Walleye numbers in Volney Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were common in 2022 with a gill net catch rate of 10.8/net, which was just above the lake class average (10.5/net). The long-term mean catch rate was 13.8/net, showing Yellow Perch have historically been abundant in Lake Volney. Yellow Perch lengths in 2022 ranged from 5.2 inches to 10.4 inches with an average of 7.0 inches. Approximately 20% of the sample exceeded 8.0 inches in length. Growth was relatively fast with Yellow Perch reaching 8.0 inches by year 4. The Yellow Perch population in Lake Volney should help support efforts to boost Walleye numbers while also providing a modest fishery themselves. <br> \n <br> \nOne of the most abundant species in Volney Lake was Freshwater Drum. In 2022, a total of 105 Freshwater Drum were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 17.5/net. The catch rate in 2019 was 26.0/net and the average catch rate since 1993 was 35.5/net. The average Freshwater Drum length in 2022 was 13.9 inches. Although not often targeted, Freshwater Drum can provide both sport and harvest value to anglers and should be promoted as such.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2022 included Largemouth Bass and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was good. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 9.2 ppm and 67.1 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 0.2 ppm and 48.7 degrees Fahrenheit at 40 feet. A thermocline was detected at approximately 20 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nIt is important for all who use this waterbody to remember Clean In and Clean Out. CLEAN all visible aquatic plants, zebra mussels, and other prohibited invasive species from watercraft, trailers, and water-related equipment before leaving and entering any water access or shoreland. DRAIN water-related equipment (boat, ballast tanks, portable bait containers, and motor) and drain bilge, livewell and baitwell by removing drain plugs before leaving a water access or shoreline property. Keep drain plugs out and water-draining devices open while transporting watercraft. DISPOSE of unwanted bait, including minnows, leeches, and worms, in the trash. It is illegal to release bait into a waterbody or release aquatic animals from one waterbody to another. If you want to keep your bait, you must refill the bait container with bottled or tap water. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

Overall the fish population in Volney is better than in previous surveys and should should provide panfishing and walleye fishing opportunities as well.  The Volney Lake Association and other concerned citizens have taken an active role in improving the water quality.  Lake Volney currently has a Clean Water Partnership with the MN Pollution Control Agency in an effort to reduce the amount of silt and nutrient loading into the lake from the surrounding watershed. </p>",

THE REDUCTION IN THE SIZE AND NUMBERS OF WALLEYES IS DUE TO THE INCREASED VULNERABILITY TO ANGLING, WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE EXCELLENT WALLEYE FISHNG OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. THE INCREASED WALLEYE STOCKING HAS REDUCED THE WALLEYES POPULATION FROM 157.50/GILLNET IN '81 TO 18.25/GILLNET IN '84, WHICH HAS MADE WALLEYES MORE VULNERABLE TO ANGLING WALLEYES ARE REPRESENTED BY 6 YR. CLASSES, 1-6 YR OLDS WITH THE I YR CLASS DOMINATING. NORTHERNS HAVE DECLINED DRAMATICALLY FROM 6.50/GILLNET IN '81 TO 0.50/GILLNET TODAY. THE DROP IN NORTHERNS IS TO BE EXPECTED WITH POOR NATUAL REPRODUCTION AND DISCONTINUED STOCKING. BLACK CRAPPIES HAVE REMAINED ABOUT THE SAME IN NUMBERS SINCE '81 BUT ARE NOW DOMINATED BY LARGER III YR CLASS FISH; IN '81 SMALLER II YR CLASS FISH DOMINATED. AGE- CLASS DISTRIBUTIONS AND GROWTH RATES ARE ABOUT THE SAME AS IN '81. FEW BLUEGILLS WERE PRESENT IN '81, WITH ONLY ONE CAPTURED IN SHORELINE SEINING. TODAY, A GOOD BLUEGILL POPULATION HAS DEVELOPED, AVERAGING 24.50/TRAPNET AND IS REPRESENTED BY II AND III YR CLASSES. IT IS SURPRISING TO SEE A GOOD BLUEGILL POPULATION DEVELOP IN SPITE OF THE LACK OF COVER (EMERGENT AND SUBMERGED PLANTS). ROUGHFISH WERE REPRESENTED BY A STRONG BLACK BULL- HEAD YEAR CLASS AVERAGING 3.5 FISH/LB; THE '81 NETTING WAS 0.50/TRAPNET, AND TODAYS AVG 67.25/ TRAPNET. CARP AND YELLOW BULLHEAD WERE SAMPLED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 84.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nVolney Lake is a 283 acre lake located in Le Sueur County southeast of the town of Le Center. A DNR-owned public access is located on the southeast corner of the lake off 185th Avenue. With a maximum depth of 67 feet, Volney Lake is the deepest lake in the area. It is also one of the clearest lakes in the area. About 46% of the lake is considered littoral (> 15 feet deep). Based on limnological variables and lake characteristics, Volney Lake is placed in Lake Class 24. Other lakes in this lake class include Madison (Blue Earth County), Mazaska (Rice County), and Reeds (Waseca County). Volney Lake is primarily managed for black crappie and secondarily managed for bluegill and walleye. Walleye are stocked according to a base stocking plan of stocking fry three out of every four years at a rate of 1,000 fish per littoral acre. Walleye fingerlings (1.5 pound/acre) are stocked every other year if a fall electrofishing evaluation deems necessary (catch rate below 30.0 fish/hour). Northern pike are also stocked according to a base stocking plan of stocking fry annually at a rate of 50,000 fry per year. Northern pike fry are stocked into an adjacent wetland northeast of the lake, rather than directly into the lake. Volney Lake was surveyed the week of June 10, 2014 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying trap nets and gill nets, as well as recording water quality parameters.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nThe walleye population in Volney Lake has varied in abundance throughout the past twenty years and has been relatively low since the early 1990s. The walleye catch rate in the 2014 survey was 1.8 fish/gill net, which marked an increase from 2009 (0.8 fish/gill net). Walleye lengths ranged from 9.5 to 20.0 inches and averaged 16.0 inches. Most fish from this survey were from the 2012 year class (age-2). The average length of age-2 walleye was 14.7 inches. Walleye growth rates in Volney Lake appear to be about average compared to similar lakes in the area. The only year class missing from this survey within the past four years was 2011, when no walleye stocking took place. This suggests that little to no natural reproduction takes place in Volney Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates in trap nets have varied throughout the survey history of Volney Lake. In 2009, trap nets yielded 6.7 fish/net. In the 2014 survey, the trap net catch rate was 94.3, which marked a record high for Volney Lake. A vast majority of these black crappie were young, small fish, which suggests a strong year class will be working through the fishery in the coming years. Lengths of black crappie collected in trap nets ranged from 3.0 to 11.7 inches, indicating a relatively good size structure. Black crappie were also sampled in gill nets at a rate of 2.0 fish/net. These fish ranged in length from 4.2 to 12.1 inches. Although black crappie were not aged, the population appears to be comprised of numerous size classes. Like all panfish in Volney Lake, the black crappie population is sustained by natural recruitment. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate in 2014 was 11.8 fish/trap net, which closely resembled the long-term average for Volney Lake (12.5 fish/trap net). Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.9 to 9.1 inches, with most fish measuring between 6.0 and 7.0 inches, which indicates a relatively small size structure. The clear water and abundant macrophytes of Volney Lake provide ideal bluegill habitat and make it a quality bluegill fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nYellow perch were the second most abundant fish species observed in the gill nets, ranking right behind freshwater drum. The 2014 catch rate of 9.7 fish/net was a decrease from the catch rate of 2009 (27.2 fish/net). Yellow perch lengths ranged from 6.6 to 10.0 inches and averaged 8.0 inches, indicating a relatively small size structure of yellow perch. Although yellow perch were not aged, most fish appeared to be from the same year class. Small size structures of yellow perch are common among lakes in south-central Minnesota. However, young yellow perch are often the main forage fish for predators, such as walleye. <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nThe northern pike population in Volney Lake has remained in relatively low abundance since the early 1990s, averaging only 0.7 fish/net throughout the past twenty years. The 2014 catch rate increased to 1.5 fish/net, which is average for similar lakes in the area. The lengths of northern pike ranged from 18.7 to 35.9 inches and averaged 26.2 inches, indicating a moderate size class. Starting in 2013, northern pike fry have been stocked annually in an attempt to increase the population. The fry are stocked into a connected wetland northeast of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nFreshwater drum were abundant during the 2014 survey, with catch rates of 9.8 fish/gill net and 6.4 fish/trap net. Freshwater drum have a firm, white flesh and make good table fare. Other fish species collected in this survey in low abundance included bowfin (N = 4), common carp (N = 1), and black bullhead (N = 3).  Although not observed in 2014, reports of flathead catfish in Lake Volney have been received. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n</p>",
