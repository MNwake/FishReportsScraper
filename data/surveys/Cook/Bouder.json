                "narrative": "<p>Bouder Lake has maintained a fairly large walleye population for a lake of its size and class.  The 2002 catch was typical of past catches in Bouder Lake.  A wide range of sizes was present.  Most walleye were 12-15 inches long.  Several year-classes were present, and all walleye resulted from natural reproduction.  Growth rates were about average when compared to similar lakes in the Grand Marais Area.  Walleye in Bouder Lake reached 11.6 inches at age 3, 12.3 inches at age 4, and 13.7 inches at age 5.  Walleye over 20 inches long when captured were 9 or 10 years old.Bouder Lake appeared to have a small-to-moderate population of muskellunge.  Average weight was higher than in past assessments, exceeding 4 lb, but none were of legal length.  Muskellunge were stocked in Bouder and Crescent Lakes in the late 1970s.Smallmouth bass were collected for the first time in this lake in 2002.  The five bass were small, ranging from 5.5 to 8.3 inches long.The yellow perch catch has fluctuated widely in recent assessments, and only five were collected in 2002.  Lengths ranged from 5.5 to 6.6 inches.Northern pike have been found in most assessments, but none were caught in 2002.The lake had a moderate population of white sucker, and a wide range of sizes was present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bouder and Crescent Lakes are connected by a navigable channel 2-4 feet deep.  Boat and motor access to Bouder Lake is most often and most easily accomplished from an access ramp on Crescent Lake. Boaters should be alert for boulders in the channel, and in Bouder Lake, and proceed with caution.  Both lakes have similar and self-sustained fish communities, and fish are able to move freely between the lakes.  These lakes have not been stocked since the 1970s. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were fairly abundant in Bouder Lake in 2014, but most were small.  The walleye catch was higher in 2014 than it had been in 2005, but was similar to earlier catches and met the long range management goal for the lake.  Natural reproduction had occurred over several years, based on the age of fish caught.  Walleye from a strong 2012 year class (two-year-old fish) were most abundant, and could be expected to sustain the fishery for the next few years.  Growth rates of walleye had been about average for this class of lake and this area. <br> \n <br> \nBouder Lake is one of just three Cook County lakes supporting significant numbers of muskellunge.  Muskellunge were more abundant than in the previous three assessments, and the population was relatively strong for this type of lake.  The number and size of musky caught met the long range goal for the lake.  The three largest fish caught were 36-39 inches long.  These musky are descended from Shoepack strain fish introduced in the 1970s; fish of that strain seldom exceed 40 inches.  Minimum legal length will become 54 inches in 2015, so the musky fishery will essentially be catch and release only.  Seven year classes contributed to the 2014 catch, with fish as old as nine years taken.  Growth of three-to-five year old musky had been about average for the area.  Five-year-old musky averaged 26 inches long when captured. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass have been present in Bouder Lake since at least 2002.  Only a few were caught in the 2014 survey, but none of the sampling gears used were intended for sampling smallmouth bass, so that catch may not reflect their true abundance.  Smallmouth growth rates had been average, or slightly below average, for the lake class. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch provided forage for walleye and muskellunge, and a limited fishery.  The largest perch taken in the 2014 survey was 8.4 inches long.  Both perch and white sucker numbers have generally been lower since muskellunge were introduced. <br> \n</p>",

The average size of walleye was among the lower values for the lake and the lake class.  Walleye caught were age 2, age 3, or age 6, naturally produced, and had grown at close to the average rate for the lake class and the area.Muskellunge were stocked in 1977 and 1978, and caught in all four assessments since then.  The number caught per gill net in 2005 tied the low value of the previous three assessments, and was below three-fourths of the values recorded for the lake class.  The average weight of muskellunge was the second highest in the four assessments of this lake, and ranked below the middle in all assessments of this lake class.  Muskellunge caught were age 3 or age 4, and had grown slightly faster than the average rate for the area, but none exceeded the minimum legal length of 40 inches.Smallmouth bass were first netted in 2002.  The lone fish caught in 2005 was two years old and had grown at about the average rate for the area.The yellow perch catch ranked near the middle for assessments of this lake and somewhat lower for the lake class.  The average size of yellow perch was among the lower values for the lake and the lake class.The number of white sucker caught per gill net was the lake's second lowest, but average weight was the lake's highest.</p>",
