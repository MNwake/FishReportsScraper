Northern pike (45 of 54 aged) ranged from two to six years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1989.  Growth rates for the first through the third annual increments were faster than normal. The growth rate for the fifth annual increment was slower than normal.  Bluegill (40 of 103 aged) ranged from two to five years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1989.  Growth rates were normal.  Black crappie (37 of 127 aged) ranged from two to five years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1988 and 1989.  Growth rates were normal.  Yep (20 of 77 aged) ranged from two to six years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1988.  The growth rate for the first annual increment was slower than normal.  Bowfin trap net catches decreased from the 1987 assessment to the 1992 survey (Wilcoxon's signed rank test: p=0.0745, n=11).  Bluegill trap net catches increased from the 1987 assessment to the 1992 survey (Wilcoxon's signed rank test:  p=0.0059, n=11). It appears that Portage Lake suffered a partial winterkill in 1987 as indicated by the lack of fish sampled from year classes prior to 1987.  In the 1987 population assessment bluegill, black crappie, and yep all had fish sampled older than five years of age. The strong 1984 year class of yep and 1985 year class of black crappie should both have been sampled in 1992 but both were missing.  Growth rates for northern pike, black crappie, and yep have all increased dramatically from those calculated in 1987.  Winter dissolved oxygen tests were not conducted on Portage Lake in 1987.</p>",

The assessment consisted of twelve standard survey trap nets fished overnight at likely pike spawning locations.  A total of 125 northern pike were captured ranging in size from 7.9 to 28.0\" with an average of 21.8\" and 2.3 pounds.  Black crappie were captured at a rate of 44.8/ trap net lift and ranged from 3.9 to 14.0\", but only 6% were greater than 9\".  Trap nets also sampled 13 largemouth bass, which ranged from 12.2 to 21.3\" and averaged 17.5\" and 3.1 pounds.   <br> \nSpring trap nets also sampled two large adult walleye.  This is the first time walleye have been sampled in Portage Lake.  It is unknown if the fish migrated to the lake from the Rice River or are the result of non-DNR introductory activities. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Portage Lake is a moderate sized, shallow lake with bog stained water and abundant aquatic vegetation, and is located in central Aitkin County.  There is a public access with a concrete log ramp in the southwest corner of the lake.  Although the lake has historically experienced occasional winterkill conditions, there have been no such events observed recently.  Light residential development is concentrated on the eastern shore, with some scattered development along the west shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and black crappie are the main species targeted by anglers.  Pike abundance in gill nets was within the normal range for similar lakes.  Average size of fish was respectable at 22.5 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Length ranged from 16.5 to 27.7 inches with 31% greater than 24 inches.  While catching large pike (greater than 24 inches) can be exhilarating, anglers are encouraged to release large fish due to their role in maintaining quality size structure of many species, and to maximize the sporting benefit for multiple anglers by recycling these quality fish. <br> \n  <br> \nBlack crappie were captured within the normal range in both gill nets and trap nets.  Fish from trap nets ranged from 4.5 to 10.5 inches, but averaged just 6.0 inches.  A one-day spring trap net assessment was conducted in addition to standard survey netting.  Spring sampling captured crappie up to 14 inches, but the average size was still only 6.2 inches.  Fish growth was slow compared to county and state averages. <br> \n <br> \nThe spring trap net assessment also provided some additional information about the largemouth bass population, since only one bass was sampled with standard survey nets.  Although not abundant in spring trap nets (13 fish total), size was impressive with fish ranging from 12.2 to 21.3 inches, and averaging 17.5 inches and 3.1 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in trap nets was normal, but size and growth was poor.  Only one bluegill over 7 inches was sampled during this assessment.  Age analysis nearly annual recruitment, with nine year-classes identified. However, bluegill grew to just 5 inches long in six growing seasons, which is well below average for the area. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Portage Lake is a moderate sized, shallow lake with bog-stained water and abundant aquatic vegetation and is in central Aitkin County. There is a public access with a concrete log ramp in the southwest corner of the lake. The lake has historically experienced occasional winterkill conditions. Light residential development is concentrated on the eastern shore, with some scattered development along the west shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike and Black Crappie are the main species targeted by anglers. Pike abundance in gill nets seems to have increased in recent years and was 16 per gill net in 2022. Thanks to a healthy forage base of Yellow Perch the average size of pike remained respectable at 21.7 inches and 2.3 pounds. Length ranged from 13.6 to 30.3 inches with a good number of fish in the mid to upper 20-inch range. While catching large pike (greater than 26 inches) can be exhilarating, anglers are encouraged to release large fish due to their role in maintaining quality size structure of many species, and to maximize the sporting benefit for multiple anglers by recycling these quality fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers have increased as well in both gill nets and trap nets and are above the long-term average for this lake. The size of fish, though, remained on the small side, with fish averaging about 6.5 inches. Fish growth was slow compared to county and state averages. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance (15.0/trap net) was normal for the lake type, but the size structure has shown improvement with a good number of fish over 8 inches present. A recent partial winterkill may have influenced this trend. Growth rates of fish showed much improvement over last survey in 2012. For example, age 2 fish averaged 4.5 inches with some reaching 6 inches in comparison to last survey where Bluegill grew to just 5 inches long in six growing seasons, which is well below average for the area.  <br> \n <br> \nStandard summer gear captured only one Largemouth Bass, but previous spring trap net surveys have sampled some large adults. Black Bullhead were extremely numerous in the 2022 survey. Golden Shiners were also observed in relatively high numbers, which is not surprising given their tolerance to winterkill situations. <br> \n</p>",

The lake has dark brown colored water and prolific vegetation along most of the shoreline.  The primary species sought by anglers are northern pike and black crappie.  Portage Lake has one of the nicer, well balanced, northern pike populations of the lakes in the Aitkin Fisheries Area.  While no large trophy fish (30 + inches) were sampled in the survey the average northern pike sampled was 23 inches long and weighed almost three pounds.  With the moderate population size and the good growth rates, this population should continue to provide excellent fishing opportunities.</p>",

Trap net indices for bowfin and black crappie are both above their respective third regional quartiles. Trap net indices for black bullhead, brown bullhead and bluegill are all below their respective first regional quartiles. Northern pike ranged from one to five years of age fifteen of the seventeen fish aged were three years old or older. The growth increment for the second year is very slow (30% slower than normal). The fourth growth increment is 33 percent faster than normal. Bluegill (14 of 16 fish aged) ranged from two to eight years of age with over half of the sample aged being five and six years old. Growth is normal except for the second and third increments which range from 20 to 33 percent slower than normal. Black crappie ranged from one to eight years of age with strong year classes in 1982 and 1985. Growth for years of strong year classes is slow otherwise normal growth rates are seen. Yellow perch ranged from three to five years of age with a very strong year class in 1984. Growth for the first and second increments are slow. Growth increments for ages three through five are normal. The yellow perch catch index increased significantly (for three gillnets) from 23.0 per gillnet in 1971 to 56.0 per gillnet in 1987. Black bull- head showed a dramatic decrease in abundance over the same time period from 27.2 per lift in 1971 to 0.6 per trap net in 1987. Based on tables, developed by Dennis Schupp, of the relative percentages of change in numbers of gill net caught fish which would be necessary to state with a relatively accurate statistical certainty that a population has changed from one assessment to the next.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Portage Lake was conducted on August 8, 2022 by Aitkin Area Fisheries Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four stations. Four site locations had to be moved slightly to allow the minimum amount of seine hauls necessary for sampling. Nearshore sampling captured eleven species of fish including one species that was intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and one that was tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates the fish community of Portage Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Grand Rapids Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
