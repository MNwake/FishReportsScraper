The park offers ball fields, playground, parking, restrooms, picnicking, and walking paths.  The Ramsey-Washington Metro Watershed District conducted a shoreline restoration in the park in 2007.  This will create better habitat for fish and wildlife and help stabilize the shore.  As part of the restoration, two access areas were created to give people places to fish or view the lake.  No motors are allowed on the lake. <br> \n <br> \nDespite being very shallow (less than 4 feet), the lake does contain fish and receives fishing use.  Commonly caught fish are bullhead, carp and green sunfish.  The fish assessment conducted in 2007 found very high abundance of black crappie.  Average size was small (6 inches), but a few individuals up to 10 inches were sampled.  Common carp were also sampled in high numbers, with lengths ranging from 12 to 17 inches.  Green sunfish were abundant but small, with none over 5 inches.  Black bullhead abundance was moderate, with an average length of 7 inches and none over 9 inches. <br> \n</p>",
