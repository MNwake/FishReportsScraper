                "narrative": "<p>Twentynine is a 50 acre lake with 33 (66%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  Twentynine Lake is located along Interstate #35 two miles northeast of Barnum, MN.  Twentynine Lake has no public access.  Five lots are currently being offered for sale along the east shore of the lake.     Northern pike abundance of 21.5 per gillnet was far above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length for northerns of 21.2 inches is average.  Growth was slow, with length at age four of 20.5 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed strong 1998 and 1996 year classes and all year classes from 1995 through 1998 represented.     Yellow perch abundance of 5.5 per gillnet was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of yellow perch was 8.1 inches.  Growth was average, with length at age four of 5.9 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed all year classes from 1992 through 1997 represented, with none that were exceptionally strong.     Other fish species sampled in Twentynine Lake include common shiner, golden shiner, tadpole madtom, white sucker and yellow bullhead.      It appears, from stumps in approximately two feet of water, that water level increased after the construction of Intersate #35.  It is uncertian if the rise in water level caused increased abundance of northern pike.     Because there is no opportunity for the public to access Twentynine Lake, fishing pressure is considered to be low.  Future DNR fisheries management activities will also be limited by the lack of public access.</p>",

The shoreline is fairly irregular and shallow shoal water soils are composed of 80 percent muck and 20 percent clay.  A thin band of emergent aquatic plants lines all the shores.  Submerged plant life is scattered around the lake in water up to 6 feet deep.Test netting of the lake revealed that golden shiner, northern pike, yellow perch, yellow bullhead and pumpkinseed sunfish were caught in numbers above respective state wide medians.The yellow bullhead population appears to be specifically dense.  Black crappie numbers were the same as the state-wide median.  Very few white sucker were netted.</p>",
