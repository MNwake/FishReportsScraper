                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \n <br> \nWells Lake is a 634 acre lake located in Rice County west of the city of Faribault. The lake is accessible by boat from Cannon Lake. Wells Lake is a very shallow, eutrophic lake with a maximum depth of 4 feet. Based on limnological variables and lake characteristics, Wells Lake is placed in Lake Class 43. Other area lakes with this classification include Cody Lake (Rice County), Ida Lake (Blue Earth County), and Loon Lake (Waseca County). Wells Lake is managed primarily for walleye. Although no stocking takes place, walleye and other game fish regularly migrate into Wells Lake from Cannon Lake and other lakes within the Cannon River chain. Wells Lake was surveyed the week of August 10, 2014 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying gill nets and trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nWalleye abundance in Wells Lake increased from 2.1 fish/net in 2004 and 0.3 fish/net in 2009 to a record high 23.8 fish/net in 2014. The next highest catch rate of walleye in Wells Lake was in 1989 when 12.6 fish/net were sampled. This was the highest walleye catch observed among all area surveys conducted in 2014. Walleye lengths ranged from 8.3 to 26.1 inches and averaged 11.6 inches, indicating a very small size structure. Walleye otoliths were removed and aged. Ninety-nine percent of all walleye sampled were age-1, indicating a very strong year class from 2013. These young walleye most likely migrated into Wells Lake from Cannon Lake, which was stocked with over two million walleye fry in 2013. Wells and Cannon Lakes are directly connected by water under a bridge, so the likelihood of fish migration is high. The warm, shallow, productive waters of Wells Lake may serve as a nursery habitat for walleye and other young game fish to grow in early life stages before migrating throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nYellow perch catch rates in Wells Lake have varied greatly throughout the survey history, as abundance is dependent on spawning success from year to year. The yellow perch catch rate in Wells Lake increased from zero fish in the 2009 survey to 29.8 fish/net in 2014. This catch rate was above the long-term average for Wells Lake (21.8 fish/net). Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5.5 to 10.8 inches and averaged 6.9 inches, indicating a small size structure of yellow perch. Yellow perch populations throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes tend to be comprised of small sizes, however some yellow perch angling takes place. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in Wells Lake has been relatively low throughout the survey history. The 2014 catch rate was the highest among recent years with 2.3 fish/net, which is above the long-term average for Wells Lake (1.2 fish/net). Lengths of northern pike ranged from 16.2 to 24.4 inches and averaged 21.2 inches, indicating a small size structure. All northern pike collected in this survey were age-1 (2013 year class). This further suggests that Wells Lake serves as a nursery habitat for young fish. No northern pike stocking takes place in Wells Lake, so the population exists from either natural reproduction or migration from other lakes within the Cannon River chain. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nThe black crappie population in Wells Lake remains in moderately low abundance with a 2014 trap net catch rate of 3.1 fish/net. This is an increase from the 2009 survey when the catch rate was 1.3 fish/trap net and compares to the long-term average for Wells Lake of 4.0 fish/net. Black crappie were also collected in gill nets in 2014 at a rate of 2.4 fish/net. Lengths of all black crappie collected in this survey ranged from 3.1 to 11.5 inches, with 39% of the catch measuring 10.0 inches or larger, indicating a quality size structure.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nBluegill abundance remains low in Wells Lake. The 2014 catch rate was 1.4 fish/net, which is below the long-term average of 2.0 fish/net. Bluegill lengths ranged from 4.3 to 9.1 inches, with 77% measuring less than 6.0 inches, indicating a small size structure. Bluegill populations tend to struggle in lakes with minimal macrophyte abundance, such as Wells Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass <br> \nWhite bass abundance in Wells Lake has fluctuated in recent history, with catch rates ranging from 57.8 fish/net in 1999 to 4.8 fish/net in 2009. The 2014 catch rate of white bass was 13.0 fish/net, which is high relative to other similar lakes. Not only was the catch rate relatively high in 2014, the size of white bass was also impressive. Lengths ranged from 4.6 to 17.4 inches, with 41% of the catch measuring over 10.0 inches. The Cannon River chain of lakes, including Wells Lake, have quality white bass populations and offer a valuable angling opportunity, especially with population demographics like that of Wells Lake. White bass can be caught throughout the year, including through the ice, and are considered great table fare.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead <br> \nBlack bullhead typically thrive in shallow, eutrophic lakes similar to Wells Lake. However, the abundance in Wells Lake has remained low for years. The 2014 catch rate in gill nets was 3.0 fish/net, which is very low for Lake Class 43. The population consisted of mostly large individuals, with lengths ranging from 6.3 to 13.4 inches. Eighty-one percent of the catch measured 10.0 inches or larger. Predators, such as walleye and northern pike, will feed on young black bullhead. While many factors may influence the low abundance of black bullhead in Wells Lake, predation may play a role in keeping the numbers at bay. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nCommon carp were collected in high abundance in 2014, with a total of 190 fish sampled from gill and trap nets. While common carp catch rates have varied in Wells Lake, abundance has always been relatively high. Common carp thrive in shallow, eutrophic lakes like Wells Lake. Freshwater drum and white sucker were also abundant (N = 84 and N = 25, respectively). Other fish species collected in low abundance included bigmouth buffalo (N = 5), bowfin (N = 14), channel catfish (N = 5), largemouth bass (N = 1), yellow bullhead (N = 13), and golden shiner (N = 1). <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wells Lake is a 634-acre lake located in Rice County west of the city of Faribault. The lake is accessible by boat from Cannon Lake. Wells Lake is a very shallow, eutrophic lake with a maximum depth of 4 feet. Wells Lake is managed primarily for Walleye. Although no stocking takes place, Walleye and other game fish regularly migrate into Wells Lake from Cannon Lake and other lakes within the Cannon River chain.  <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was conducted the week of August 17, 2020 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying nine gill nets as well as recording water quality parameters. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, only gillnets were used in order to comply with social distancing protocols. Results from this survey can be compared to historical standard surveys since standardized methods were used. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in Wells Lake increased from 0.3 fish/gill net in 2009 to a record high 23.8 fish/gill net in 2014. In 2020, the Walleye catch rate was 11.4/gill net. Walleye lengths ranged from 13.1 to 27.3 inches and averaged 17.5 inches. Fifty-eight percent of Walleye sampled were age-1, indicating a strong year class from 2019. These young Walleye most likely migrated into Wells Lake from Cannon Lake, which was stocked with Walleye fry in 2019. Wells and Cannon Lake are directly connected by water under a bridge, so the likelihood of fish migration is high. The warm, shallow, productive waters of Wells Lake may serve as a nursery habitat for Walleye and other young game fish to grow in early life stages before migrating throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes. <br> \n  <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates in Wells Lake have varied greatly throughout the survey history, as abundance is dependent on spawning success from year to year. The Yellow Perch gill net catch rate in Wells Lake dropped from 29.8 fish/net in 2014 to 15.8 fish/net in 2020. This catch rate was below the long-term average for Wells Lake (20.9 fish/net). Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 3.0 to 11.1 inches and averaged 6.7 inches. Yellow Perch populations throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes tend to be comprised of small fish, however some Yellow Perch angling takes place. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance in Wells Lake has been relatively low throughout the survey history. The 2020 gill net catch rate of 0.9 fish/net was slightly below the long-term average for Wells Lake (1.2 fish/net). Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 11.0 to 30.1inches and averaged 23.8 inches. All Northern Pike collected in this survey were age-3 (2017 year class) or younger. No Northern Pike stocking takes place in Wells Lake, so the population exists from either natural reproduction or migration from other lakes within the Cannon River chain. Wells Lake is located in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. In order to harvest a Northern Pike the fish must be over 24.0 inches in length.  The daily bag limit in this zone is 2 Northern Pike per day. <br> \n <br> \nDue to the Covid-19 social distancing protocols trap nets were not used in 2020. The Black Crappie population in Wells Lake remains in moderately low abundance. The 2014 trap net catch rate was 3.1 fish/net. This was an increase from the 2009 survey when the catch rate was 1.3 fish/trap net and compares to the long-term average for Wells Lake of 4.0 fish/net. Black Crappie were collected in gill nets in 2020 at a rate of 1.4 fish/net. Lengths of Black Crappie collected in gill nets ranged from 6.3 to 13.4 inches, with 92% of the catch measuring less than 10.0 inches.  <br> \nBluegill abundance remains low in Wells Lake. The 2014 catch rate was 1.4 fish/net, which was below the long-term average of 2.0 fish/net and right at the minimum rate for the second quartile range for Lake Class 43 (1.4 - 3.9 fish/net). Bluegill lengths ranged from 4.3 to 9.1 inches, with 77% measuring less than 6.0 inches. Bluegill populations tend to struggle in lakes with minimal vegetation, such as Wells Lake. <br> \n   <br> \nWhite Bass abundance in Wells Lake has fluctuated in recent history, with gill net catch rates ranging from 57.8 fish/net in 1999 to 4.8 fish/net in 2009. The 2020 gill net catch rate of White Bass was 22.8 fish/net, which is above the interquartile range for Lake Class 43 (0.3 - 9.9 fish/net). Lengths ranged from 4.9 to 16.3 inches, and averaged 7.5 inches. The Cannon River chain of lakes, including Wells Lake, have quality White Bass populations and offer a valuable angling opportunity, especially with population demographics like that of Wells Lake. White Bass can be caught throughout the year, including through the ice, and are considered great table fare.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead typically thrive in shallow, eutrophic lakes similar to Wells Lake. However, the abundance in Wells Lake has remained low for years until 2020. The 2020 catch rate in gill nets was 109 fish/net, which is the historic high, and ranks in the third quartile for Lake Class 43 (75.6 - 150.6 fish/net). The population consisted of mostly small individuals, with lengths ranging from 4.8 to 15.0 inches. Ninety-four percent of the catch measured 8 inches or smaller.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were collected in moderate abundance in 2020, with a total of 63 fish sampled from gill nets. While Common Carp catch rates have varied in Wells Lake, abundance has always been relatively high. Common Carp thrive in shallow, eutrophic lakes like Wells Lake. Freshwater Drum and White Sucker were also abundant. Other fish species collected included Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (dogfish), Channel Catfish, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Bullhead, and Golden Shiner. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wells Lake is located along the Cannon River east of Faribault and directly northeast and downstream of Cannon Lake.  A fishery survey was conducted on Wells lake in 2004 to assess the status of the fish community and the aquatic habitat.  White bass were the most abundant species in the gill net catch with an average catch per net above normal compared to other similar lakes in Minnesota.  Freshwater drum were also common in the gill nets.  Walleye had been caught in moderate numbers in 1994 and 1999 but were only present in low numbers (2 per gill net) in 2004, similar to the tend observed in Cannon Lake.  Walleye were primarily 13 to 19 inches; age-3 fish from 2001 when walleye fry were not stocked in the Cannon River chain of lakes.  In 1989 and 1999 high catches of yellow perch occurred.  In 2004, perch were caught in moderate numbers with many around 10 inches long.  Yellow perch were mostly age-1 and age-3.  Freshwater drum were the most abundant fish in the trap nets.  Freshwater drum were mainly around 9 and 14 inches long.  Catches of other species were at low to moderate values for class 43 lakes.  Bluegill and crappie were present in low numbers.  Most of the catch of these two species was composed of age-1 fish.  Over one-half of the northern pike sampled were young-of-year fish, indicating a potentially good year-class of northern pike in 2004.  Aquatic vegetation was rare in most of the main portion of Wells Lake, except for the southwest and southeast corner where there were significant areas of cattail.  Vegetation was more common in the shallow bays of the more riverine eastern arm.  Small patches of flowering rush, an exotic emergent plant, were present in the small eastern basin, west of the 35 bridge, and at the bridge between Cannon and Wells lakes.  Wells Lake can be accessed from Cannon Lake.  Shore access is available on the road the runs between these two lakes, and at the King Mill dam at the Outlet of Well lake on the west side of Faribault.</p>",

Panfish are usually found in relatively low numbers.  White bass are moderately abundant and, at times, produce good numbers of 1/2-3/4 lb. fish.</p>",

There is a public access off the county road along the north shore, but it is rather steep and difficult to manuever anything but the smallest of boats.  On the far east end of Wells, there is a public fishing pier located at King Mill Dam in the city of Faribault.  This seems to be a popular fishing spot for panfish.  The west end of Wells, although very shallow, does support a nice population of gamefish.  Bluegill and yellow perch averaged nearly 9 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wells Lake in Rice County is a 634 acre lake located west of the city of Faribault. The lake can be accessed from Cannon Lake or from a small, county-owned unimproved access located in Velzke County Park. Shorefishing opportunities are present at a fishing pier near the King Mill Dam on the Cannon River, immediately downstream of Wells Lake, or from shore on Rice County Road 12/Cannon Lake Trail. <br> \n <br> \nWells Lake was surveyed the week of August 17th, 2009 to monitor the fish community. Common carp were the most abundant fish in both trap and gill nets. In particular, young of the year carp were abundant in trap nets. Carp are well suited to the turbid, low water quality of Wells Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass were the most abundant game fish sampled at just under five fish per gill net lift. White bass ranged from 9 to 18 inches in length. Average white bass size was 14.7 inches and 2.1 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie, bluegill, northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, and channel catfish were all sampled at low or even trace levels. General poor water quality and a lack of aquatic vegetation limits game fish presence and abundance. Also sampled in the survey were freshwater drum (sheepshead), bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, and bowfin (dogfish).  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Wells Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",
