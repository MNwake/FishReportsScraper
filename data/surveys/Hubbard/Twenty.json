                "narrative": "<p>Lake Twenty is a small 40 acre lake nestled in the jack pine forest of northern Hubbard County.  Lake Twenty is a shallow lake with a maximum depth of 24.0 feet.  A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the southeast shore.   Lake Twenty provides fishing oportunites for panfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Lake Twenty is in lake class 21.  Other area lakes in this same classification include East Harlverson, McCarty, and Robertson.Lake Twenty has an abundant panfish population and provides good fishing for bluegill and black crappie.  Bluegill abundance (157.7 bluegill/trapnet) was well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 6-7 inch range.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were sampled, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled black crappie were small in size (< 9.0 inches).  Age analysis showed slow growth rates for black crappie when compared to other area lakes.  Lake Twenty has a good largemouth bass population.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass and panfish in Lake Twenty.  Northern pike were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tLake Twenty is located five miles north of Lake George in Northern Hubbard County. Lake Twenty has a surface area of 41 acres and a maximum depth of 24 feet. There is a county owned public access on the southeast shore of the lake. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Lake Twenty is in lake class 21. Class 21 lakes generally are very small, have a high littoral area (depths less than 15 feet), and soft water, with a regularly shaped shoreline. Other class 21 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: East Halverson, McCarty, and Robertson. Due to its small size, Lake Twenty is very susceptible to over-harvest. Anglers must practice selective harvest if they want to improve or maintain the fishery. <br> \n\tLargemouth Bass abundance was lower than previous years, and on the low end of similar lakes. Bass were an average size of 11.8 inches, with fish sampled up to 15.4 inches. <br> \n\tBluegills were lower in abundance than recent years, but well above most similar lakes.  Fish of all sizes from 2.7 to 9.5 inches were sampled, with an average size of 5.9 inches. <br> \n\tNorthern Pike abundance was comparable to similar lakes, and above the long term average for Lake Twenty. In the past, Northern Pike abundance has been below the range typical for this lake class. The average size of 21 inches and 3.6 pound was higher than recent surveys, with the largest just over 36 inches. <br> \n\tBlack Crappie abundance was similar to comparable lakes, with a good distribution of sizes. Fish were sampled from 4.5 inches to 13.4 inches, providing a great opportunity for anglers now and into the future. <br> \n\tYellow Perch are important forage for Northern Pike, and abundance in 2015 was in the range of past surveys. Perch had an average length of 7.5 inches, with the largest 9.7 inches. <br> \n\tCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Lake Twenty. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
