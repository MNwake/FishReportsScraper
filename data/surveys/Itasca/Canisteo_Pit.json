                "narrative": "<p>Rainbow smelt are a regulated invasive species in Minnesota.  Smelt were first reported from the abandoned Canisteo Mine Pit by winter anglers in 1994.  An assessment conducted in 1995 verified a viable population existed in the Pit.  The Canisteo Pit has a long history of rising water levels and several options were under consideration to alleviate water level concerns in the adjacent communities.  One proposal was made to discharge pit water from Canisteo Pit into nearby Trout and Holman lakes, creating probable vectors of smelt introduction into these lakes.   Given the sensitivity of proposed project, data was needed to determine the current status of rainbow smelt in the Canisteo Mine Pit.  <br> \n <br> \nFourteen small mesh gill nets were deployed over three nights on the Canisteo Pit.  The nets were set to target rainbow smelt in an attempt to determine the presence of that species in the Pit.  Ten smelt were captured, resulting in a catch rate of 0.7 smelt per gill net.  Captured smelt varied from 4.5 to 5.4 inches in length and appeared to be age 2.  All were sexually mature.  All smelt were captured in the small (.375 inch) mesh and wedged at the belly, indicating that many more may have swam through the mesh and were not retained.   <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of smelt have varied considerably in past assessments.  The catch rate was 5.4/gill net in the initial assessment in 1995 and was 61.2/gill net in the following assessment in 2000.  Since that time, the smelt population appears to have declined and stabilized as catches in 2005 and 2009 were 0.7/gill net.  It is possible that an increasing lake trout population has reduced the smelt numbers to a degree.  Rainbow smelt are difficult to sample due to their pelagic nature, however, and the population may be larger than the catch data suggests.  Acoustical surveys at the time of the 2009 sampling indicated that the majority of fish in the pit were away from shore and suspended over deep water, making gill net sampling problematic. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were sampled for the first time in 2009 and this species was the most common in the gill net, with a catch rate of 3.3/gill net.  Tullibee ranged from 3.9 to 10 inches.  Adult tullibee were stocked into the Pit in 2006 and 2008 in an effort to create a self sufficient population and provide prey for lake trout.  The 2009 sample indicates that tullibee are reproducing in the pit. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill, rockbass, yellow perch, and spottial shiners were also captured.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Canisteo Mine Pit (CMP) is a complex of mine pits abandoned in 1985.  Since then ground water has been filling the pit.  CMP is located a little north of the cities of Coleraine, Bovey, and Taconite.  The complex has as area of 1,425 acres, a maximum depth over 300 feet, a mean depth near 100 feet, and limited littoral area as of 2010.  CMP has been managed for lake trout since the initial survey in 1995.  Annual stocking of yearling, and occasionally adult, Isle Royale strain lake trout occurred from 1996 to 2005.  Biennial stocking of Isle Royale strain yearling lake trout has occurred since 2007.  All trout had a distinguishing fin clip to identify stocked fish, except some adults from 1997 to 1999 and 2002.  Adult tullibee were introduced twice (2006 and 2008) in an attempt to provide a second, naturally sustaining prey species. <br> \n <br> \nDeepwater gill nets sampled 28 lake trout at a rate of 1.9/net, consistent with catch rates from previous assessments since lake trout had been stocked (1.7-1.9/net), and near the lake management plan goal of 2.0/net.  Lengths were from 8.1-22.6 inches with a mean length of 14.3 inches and a mean weight of 1.0 lbs.  Field analysis identified two fin clipped marked fish, both from the 2009 stocking and age-2.  The remainder of the sample (n=26) had no distinguishing marks and are assumed to be from natural reproduction.  Internal examinations of 18 fish identified eight females and 10 males which 75 % of the females and 90% of the males were immature.  The 2010 mean length was less than the 2005 (24.1\") and 2000 (20.5\") assessments.  A relatively small mean length, when compared to CMP length frequencies, suggests younger fish comprised the majority of the sample.  Interestingly, the 2010 assessment suggests a couple of relatively young, strong natural year classes are present in the system. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were the most numerous species sampled in deepwater gill nets at a rate of 2.7/net.  Lengths were from 6.9-10.8 inches with a mean length of 8.8 inches.  Scale analysis identified ages 1 to 4 present in the sample.  It appears tullibee have become established and naturally occurring since adults were last stocked in 2008 and it is clear that at least the 2008 and 2009 year classes were the result of natural reproduction.  Tullibee, too small to be sampled in gill nets, were observed in the stomach contents of lake trout and smallmouth bass, and were observed swimming near the surface further suggesting successful natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill comprised the largest catch in trap nets, 16.5/net, exceeding the expected range for lake of this type.  Trap net catches have varied from 2.5/net in 2005 to 17.9/net in 1995.  Lengths were from 3.7-7.4 inches with a mean length of 5.3 inches.  Ageing structures were not collected during this assessment, but past assessments suggest growth was relatively slow. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for other species in deepwater gill nets are typically low and may not be good indicators of relative abundance.  Rainbow smelt are occasionally sampled in standard deepwater gill nets, but none were sampled during this assessment.  A special assessment for rainbow smelt conducted in 2009 using small mesh gill nets confirmed the occurrence of smelt.  Eight smallmouth bass were sampled with lengths from 8.2-19.5 inches and a mean length of 13 inches.  Other species sampled in deepwater gill nets include northern pike, rock bass, and white sucker.  Other species sampled in trap nets include largemouth bass, northern pike, rock bass, tullibee and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",
