The lake has a maximum depth of 66 feet, however, during this survey there was a severe lack of dissolved oxygen below 21 feet.  The shoreline is low and dominated by bog.  Substrates are generally composed of very soft materials including muck and detritus.  The immediate watershed is steep.  The high hills surrounding the lake are covered by a dense hardwood forest.\n\nAccess to Bottle Lake is difficult.  There is a recreational hiking/ski trail that leads to and circles the lake.  The trailhead is at a parking lot located off Highway 71. Bottle is a very scenic location however, no gamefish were present during this survey and therefore angling opportunities presently do not exist. </p>",
