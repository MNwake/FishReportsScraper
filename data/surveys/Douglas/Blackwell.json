                "narrative": "<p>Blackwell Lake is a 307-acre basin located about nine miles southwest of Alexandria, near the town of Holmes City.  The steep, earthen public access site is difficult for many vehicles and larger boats.  Four-wheel drive vehicles are recommended.  Parking is available across the road at the Grants Lake public access.  A new public access site is being planned.Blackwell Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Submergent vegetation is dense in many shallow areas of the lake.  Emergent vegetation is common in the southern basin of the lake.  This aquatic vegetation is important in maintaining the water quality and clarity in Blackwell Lake.  Aquatic plant also provide valuable spawning habitat and cover for many fish species.  The fish community in Blackwell Lake is typical of small, densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota. Largemouth bass and bluegill are both abundant and should provide quality fishing opportunities.  Many of the largemouth bass captured were 15 inches in length or greater.  Bluegill size structure has improved in recent years.  About 70% of the fish captured in trap nets exceeded 6.0 inches in length, however none exceeded 8.0 inches.  Northern pike and black crappie are also commonly sought after by anglers.  Walleye may also provide some additional angling opportunities in the near future.  Most of the fish captured in 2004 were two-year old fish that averaged about 12 inches in length.  Walleye have not been stocked into Blackwell Lake. These fish are likely the result of movement from nearby lakes during periods of high water.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackwell Lake is a 307-acre basin located nine miles southwest of Alexandria, near the town of Holmes City.  A new public access site was acquired and developed in 2006.  The new access is located on the east central portion of the lake off Country Lane. <br> \n <br> \nBlackwell Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Submergent vegetation is dense in shallow areas of the lake.  Emergent vegetation is common in the southern area of the lake.  Aquatic vegetation is important in maintaining water quality and clarity.  Water clarity remains good with a Secchi depth reading of 12.3 feet.  Aquatic plants also provide valuable spawning habitat and cover for many fish species. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Blackwell Lake should provide quality fishing opportunities.  Largemouth bass remain abundant.  Although only three percent of the sample exceeded 15.0 inches in length, larger individuals are present.  Bluegill trapnet catches were within the range of expected catch rates for lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics.  Approximately 30 percent of sampled fish exceeded 6.0 inches in length.  Several bluegills exceeded 8.0 inches.  Northern pike abundance has increased.  Average size remains small with a mean length of 21.0 inches; however, five percent of captures exceeded 28.0 inches in length.  Walleye provide additional angling opportunities.  Gillnet catches averaged 2.8 fish/net.  Forty-seven percent of the walleye catch was greater than 20.0 inches in length.  Walleye have not been stocked in Blackwell Lake.  Presence of walleye is likely the result of migration from nearby lakes during periods of high water or from natural reproduction by earlier migrants.  Black crappie also contribute to the fishery. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A trap net survey was conducted on Blackwell Lake on July 11-12, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 25% quartile and below the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 34 lakes and the average length was 5.3 inches, with 14% over seven inches. Bluegill, Northern Pike, and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the trap net catch by biomass.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fish data collected in this trap net survey were combined with data from an August 2020 gill net survey and July 2020 survey of nearshore fishes to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Smallmouth Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Blackwell Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackwell Lake supports a diverse and abundant aquatic plant community that provides ample spawninghabitat and cover for centrarchids.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 10.0 feet and is densein shallow areas.  Hardstem bulrush is common among most of the shoreline.     Northern pike gillnet catches averaged 3.7 fish/net which is within the normal range of mean catchrates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (3.5 -8.9 fish/gillnet).  Gillnetcatches averaged 5.5, 4.5, and 6.0 fish/net in 1990, 1985, and 1980, respectively.  The size structureof the northern pike population is similar to past surveys.  Approximately 60% of the fish were 21inches in length or greater and 15% exceeded 28 inches.  Mean weight of fish captured was 3.1 pounds. Largemouth bass are abundant and size structure of the population is highly desirable for qualityangling opportunities.  Electrofishing yielded 88.0 largemouth bass per hour.  Over 50% of the fishwere 12 inches in length or greater and 20% exceeded 15 inches.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.4pounds.  Bluegill remain abundant in Blackwell Lake.  Trapnet catches averaged 58.2 fish/net in 1994. Trapnet catches ranged from 26.7 - 73.4 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1980.  The normalrange of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 9.5 - 57.3 fish/trapnet.  Forty-four percent of thefish captured were 6.0 inches in length or greater.  Black crappie trapnet catches averaged 7.9fish/net which exceeds the normal range for similar lakes (0.8 - 4.0 fish/trapnet).   Trapnet catchesaveraged 5.9, 16.3, and 4.5 fish/net in 1990, 1985, and 1980, respectively.  Black crappie gillnetcatches averaged 7.6 fish/net in 1994.  Gillnet catches ranged from 15.5 - 42.5 in previous surveys. Most of the fish captured were between 8 and 9 inches in length.  Yellow perch gillnet catches averaged7.3 fish/net.  Gillnet catches ranged from 0.0 - 6.0 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1980. The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 1.0 - 10.3 fish/gillnet.  Most of the fishare between 5 and 8 inches in length.  Four walleye were captured in survey nets in 1994.  Totallengths of the fish ranged from 20.0 - 25.0 inches.  These fish represent a remnant population ofwalleyes that migrated into Blackwell Lake from a walleye rearing pond during high water levels in1986.              </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Largemouth Bass CPUE was 31 fish/hour of electrofishing.  Over 50 percent of these fish were below stock-length (8 inches).  Largemouth Bass PSD was calculated at 58%.  Growth was considered average with age IV fish averaging 12.5 inches in total length.  The bluegill population remains over abundant and individuals show symptoms of stunting. Trap net catches averaged 38.5 fish/net.  This catch rate is well below catches reported in 1974 and 19 80 surveys.  Mean weight of Bluegill captured was 0.11 lbs.  Despite the apparent decrease in relative abundance, size structure decreased.  PSD was calculated at 10.0%.  The shift in size structure may be a function of a missing 1987 year class and a greater percentage of young fish in the population.  Black Crappie trap net catch rates declined from 16.3 fish net/night in 1985 to 5.9 fish/net night in 1990.  Gill net CPUE approached 32.0 fish/net night.  PSD calculated from trap net catches increased from 0.7% to 65.0% during the same time period. 58% of fish captured in 1990 were below stock length.  CPUE of stock size fish was only 2.5 fish/net.  Growth of Black Crappie is slow with age IV fish averaging less than 6.0 inches.  Due to the large number of small fish and slow growth; size distribution is expected to remain poor.  Northern Pike abundance has remained stable.  Catch rates averaged 5.5 fish/gillnet and mean weight was estimated at 3.30 lbs.  Size distribution was desirable with a PSD of 56.0% and a RSDPM of 18.0%.  Growth rates are average with age V fish averaging 24.9 inches.  Young of year Walleye gained entrance into Blackwell Lake from the Wicklund pond in 1986.  Walleye catch rates averaged 5.0 fish/gillnet night. Nineteen of the 20 walleye captured were cohorts of the 1986 year class.  These fish had a mean weight of 1.5 lbs. And a mean length of 16 inches. The other Walleye captured was age I+ and 9.0 inches long.  This may be the result of natural reproduction, unauthorized stocking, or immigration.  Catch statistics suggest a slight decrease in the relative abundance of Yellow Perch.  Gill net catch rates declined from approximately 6.0 fish/net night to 3.0 fish/net night.  Few rough fish species, i.e. Carp, bullhead or bowfin were captured in the 1990 survey.</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Blackwell Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nFifteen species were collected during this survey.  Three species (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) were considered \"intolerant\" and one species (Green Sunfish) was considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Blackwell Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackwell Lake is a 307-acre fertile lake located one mile southwest of Holmes City.  The public access is located on the northeast shore.  Launching boats at this steep, sandy access is difficult.  Four-wheel drive vehicles are recommended, however vehicles towing larger boats may still have trouble at this shallow access.  Parking is available across the road at the Grants Lake public access.Water quality on Blackwell Lake is relatively good.   Secchi disk measurement was 6.0 feet during mid-August.  Aquatic vegetation is abundant and diverse.  Dense submerged vegetation encircles the entire basin and forms a well-defined weedline at 11.0 feet.  Emergent vegetation is common in  the shallow southern bay.  Dense mats of filamentous algae form near shore in this shallow area and restrict recreational opportunities.  Protection and preservation of the aquatic vegetation plays an important role in maintaining the water quality and ecological integrity of this lake.Blackwell Lake is best known for its panfishing.  The abundant aquatic vegetation provides good  nursery habitat and escape cover for panfish.  This results in abundant bluegill and black crappie populations.  However, the average size of these species tends to be small.  Local anglers target larger crappie in winter with good success.  These fish are also vulnerable in the shallows in the spring.   Blackwell Lake also supports a quality largemouth bass fishery.  Fish are very abundant and the size structure of the population should appeal to most anglers.   Approximately 35% of the catchable size fish exceeded 15 inches with the largest fish going just under 21 inches.  Northern pike have also provided consistent fishing opportunities.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackwell Lake is a 307-acre basin located nine miles southwest of Alexandria, near the town of Holmes City.  The basin has a maximum depth of 42.0 feet.  Average depth is estimated at 10.0 feet.  Water quality measures are relatively good.  Water transparency measures over summer months of 2010 and 2011 averaged over 9.0 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nBlackwell Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Submergent vegetation can be seasonally dense in shallow areas of the lake.  Emergent vegetation is common in the southern area of the lake.  Habitat and ecological attributes of this relative small lake are characteristic of \"bass-panfish\" lakes.   The fish community in Blackwell Lake should provide quality fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass proved to be very abundant during the 2014 survey.  The bass population sample was comprised of an atypically high proportion of older and larger fish.  Thirty-six percent of electrofishing captures exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Mean length of fish sampled was 12.7 inches.  The largest fish measured 18.7 inches in total length.  <br> \n  <br> \nPanfishes common to the lake include Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie.  Bluegills are moderately abundant.  Most captures during the 2014 survey were young fish stemming from establishment of a very strong year class in 2011.  Approximately 26% of Bluegills captured in trapnets exceeded 6.0 inches in length.  The lake does support a good Bluegill fishery.  Larger Bluegills were captured in offshore gillnet sets.  Twenty-two percent of gillnet captures exceeded 8.0 inches.  The largest fish sampled measured 9.2 inches.  Blackwell Lake supports a fair to good Black Crappie fishery.  Survey catches in 2014 were relatively modest, but catches in August tend to be conservative due to a behavioral tendency for larger crappies to move offshore and into deeper water during summer months.  Average length of Black Crappies measured in 2014 was 8.3 inches which was smaller than that of prior survey catches.  The modest average size was the result of the high proportion of three-year-old fish in the population sample.  The largest fish measured 11.1 inches in length. <br> \n   <br> \nOther predators in Blackwell Lake include Northern Pike and Walleye.  Northern Pike catches in 2014 exceeded 10.0 fish/gillnet which is the highest catch rate among surveys.  Average size of pike captures was relatively small at 21.0 inches, but there are bigger fish in the lake.  The largest captured during the 2014 survey measured 31.6 inches in length.  Walleyes are not stocked, but a population persists at a low density in response to natural reproduction or migration from connected waters.  Six Walleyes were captured in gillnets during the 2014 survey.  Most proved to be yearlings.  Size at capture ranged from 9.7 to 20.5 inches in length. <br> \n     <br> \nBlackwell Lake does not have any known infestations of aquatic invasive species.  If you suspect a new infestation of an invasive plant or animal, take a photo and note the location, or save a specimen and report it to a local DNR invasive species contact at http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/ais/contacts.html <br> \n <br> \nA new public access site was acquired and developed in 2006.  The new access is located on the east central portion of the lake off Country Lane. <br> \n</p>",

Northern Pike are abundant and are of a quality size. The Northern Pike appear to have weak year classes some years. This could contribute to the overall quality of the Northern Pike. Yellow perch were present in this survey and absent in the last survey. Largemouth Bass are present and could provide a good fishery. Yellow Bullheads have a good size distribution and could contribute to the fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackwell Lake is a 307-acre lake located nine miles southwest of Alexandria, near the town of Holmes City.  There is a public access located on the southeast shoreline off of Country Lane SW.  Two concrete launches with docks are now available.  An additional launch and parking were added in 2020.  The northern basin has a maximum depth of 42.0 feet, while the southern bays tend to be shallow and vegetated.  The average depth is 10.0 feet.  Water quality and clarity (9.5 feet during this survey) are good.  This is the result of an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Aquatic vegetation also provides valuable spawning habitat and cover for many fish species.  Submergent vegetation can be seasonally dense in shallow areas of the lake.  Emergent vegetation is common in the southern area of the lake.  This type of habitat is characteristic of \"bass-panfish\" lakes and the fish community in Blackwell Lake is reflective of this.\n\nA standard fisheries survey was completed during summer 2020 to provide updated information on the fish community of Blackwell Lake.  Standard survey components typically include spring electrofishing, gill nets, and trap nets.  However, due to safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, gill nets were the only component used in 2020.\n\nHistorically, Bluegill have been very abundant and small in this basin.  Bluegill were still abundant in the 2020 survey, but are now at sizes that would be of interest to anglers.  Average and maximum lengths were 6.9 and 8.9 inches, respectively.  Black Crappie abundance was moderate, but comparable to recent surveys.  Catches in August tend to be conservative due to the tendency of crappie to move offshore and into deeper water during summer months.  Average and maximum lengths were 9.3 and 12.4 inches, respectively.  Anglers can expect to encounter good numbers of Largemouth Bass.  Average and maximum lengths were 13.4 and 17.8 inches, respectively.\n\nNorthern Pike are abundant but tend to be small.  Average length was just 19.6 inches but a 33.3-inch pike was sampled.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike.  New Northern Pike zone regulations were implement in 2018 to increase pike size structure.  Blackwell Lake is in the North-central Zone, where all pike 22 to 26 inches must be released.  Anglers can keep 10 pike but not more than two can be longer than 26 inches.  Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches, or two larger than 26 inches.  For more information see: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/pike/index.html.\n\nBlackwell Lake is not managed for Walleye but a population persists at a low density in response to limited natural reproduction or migration from connected waters.  Four Walleye were sampled ranging in length from 7.0 to 19.5 inches.\n \nYellow Bullhead were abundant and at sizes that may be of interest to some anglers.  Additional species sampled include Pumpkinseed and White Sucker.  The next standard fisheries survey is tentatively scheduled for 2026.\n\nBlackwell Lake is not a designated infested water.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can negatively affect lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain water from their boat before leaving the access.  For more information regarding aquatic invasive species see the following: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/ais/index.html \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was completed in the spring of 2022 on Blackwell Lake to assess the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations. A special regulation that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 down to 10 was also implemented in the spring of 2022. The goal of this new regulation is to maintain or increase the average size of Bluegill. This survey will be used to help evaluate effects of the regulation on the Bluegill population. Bluegill catch rates were high, but only 13% of Bluegill were preferred size (> 8 inches). Growth rates of Bluegill in Blackwell Lake are slow and 7-year-old Bluegill averaged 7 inches in length. The largest Bluegill observed in the survey was just over 9 inches. Black Crappie catch rates were high and a variety of sizes were observed in the survey. Approximately 29% of the fish were greater than 10 inches in length. Black Crappie growth rates are slow; average length of age 4 fish was under 9 inches. The largest Black Crappie in the sample was over 11 inches and the oldest crappie was 8 years old. <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Blackwell Lake. Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of the fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish can help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish. <br> \n  <br> \nZebra mussels were documented in Blackwell Lake in 2021, but no other invasive species have been documented.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to this or other lakes. <br> \n</p>",
