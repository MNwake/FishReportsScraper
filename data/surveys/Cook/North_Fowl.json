There appeared to be good natural reproduction in most years, and the population was entirely self-sustained.  Yellow perch were also very abundant and, with a mean weight of 0.9 lb/fish, were larger than usual for lakes in this area.  Northern pike and smallmouth bass were present in average numbers.  Most of the northern pike collected were small, two-year-old fish, while most of the smallmouth bass collected were relatively large (12-19 inches).</p>",

The walleye population was entirely natural, and several year classes were included in the catch.  Walleye growth rates appeared to have been fairly fast for a lake of this class, probably due to the presence of an excellent yellow perch forage base.Yellow perch were abundant, and many large fish were present.  Yellow perch growth had also been relatively fast.  The northern pike catch was about average for lakes of this class, and for this lake historically.  Smallmouth bass were present; although none were taken in gill nets, YOY fish were collected in 1/4-in-mesh trap nets used in 1998.</p>",
