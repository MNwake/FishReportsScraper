High population levels are indicated by catch rates above the third quartile and low population levels by catch rates below the first quartile.  Catch rates falling between the first and third quartiles are indicative of average, or normal numbers for a particular species. Average size of fish for a particular species or mean weight per individual fish are listed as small, average and large.  Average size is indicated by mean weight falling between the first and first and third quartile.  Small size is indicated by mean weight below the first quartile and large size by mean weight above the third quartile.</p>",
