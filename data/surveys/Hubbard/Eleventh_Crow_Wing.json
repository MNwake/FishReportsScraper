There does not seem to be too much natural reproduction.  If there is, the high panfish population could be holding it down.  Northern pike need not be stocked, providing the controlled areas located on the southeast shore provides a good crop of fingerlings every year.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Eleventh Crow Wing Lake was conducted on August 9-10, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Nearshore sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen sampling stations.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations, and a 15-foot seine was used at five stations due to the site conditions (soft sediments and dense vegetation).  Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Common Carp and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Eleventh Crow Wing Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eleventh Crow Wing Lake is located just north of Akeley in east-central Hubbard County.  Eleventh Crow Wing has a surface area of 751 acres and a maximum depth of 80 feet.  There is a public access and campground owned and maintained by the city of Akeley, located on the south shore.  A new culvert was installed on Highway 64 which separates the east and west basins of Eleventh Crow Wing.  The new culvert design will accommodate the passage of most boats and pontoons.  Eleventh Crow Wing is a deep lake with excellent water quality and lots of structure to challenge anglers.  Eleventh Crow Wing supports a good Walleye population that maintains healthy numbers and size ranges of fish, as well as providing angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Eleventh Crow Wing is in lake class 23.  Class 23 lakes are generally very deep, clear, have a very low percentage of littoral area (depth less than 15 feet), and have hard water.  Other class 23 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include Benedict, Blue, Boot, East Crooked, Ninth Crow Wing, and Spearhead. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was down slightly from previous surveys, but still at the upper range for this lake class.  Walleye sampled had an average length of 18 inches and measured up to 29 inches.  Yellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) are important forage species for large predators such as Walleye and Northern Pike.  Past and present surveys have shown that Yellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) populations fluctuate from moderate to high numbers for this lake class.  Yellow Perch sampled had an average length of 6.6 inches and measured up to 11.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nEleventh Crow is known for having a low to moderate Northern Pike population composed of quality-sized fish.  Northern Pike abundance was below the range for this lake class but similar to past surveys.  Large Northern Pike utilize the abundant Tullibee (Cisco) population in Eleventh Crow Wing which accounts for the fast growth rates observed in this population. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not really known as a Bass-Panfish Lake, Eleventh Crow Wing does support moderate numbers of Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Largemouth Bass, and low numbers of Black Crappie. Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers for this lake class and anglers will find that size tends to run small, with fish in the 5 to 7 inch size range.  Black Crappie were sampled in moderate numbers for this lake class with fish measuring up to 11.5 inches.  Eleventh Crow Wing supports a low to moderate Largemouth Bass population with better Bass habitat in the east basin. <br> \n  <br> \nRusty Crayfish and Curly-leaf Pondweed have been identified in Eleventh Crow Wing Lake.  To avoid spreading Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS), lake users are required to remove all aquatic plant or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eleventh Crow Wing Lake is located just north of Akeley in east-central Hubbard County.  Eleventh Crow Wing has a surface area of 790 acres and a maximum depth of 80 feet.  The public access is located on the south shore and is owned and maintained by the city of Akeley.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Eleventh Crow Wing is in Lake class 22.  Other area lakes in this same class include Long (3 miles east of Park Rapids), Potato (7 miles north of Park Rapids), and Big Sand (2.5 miles north of Dorset).     Eleventh Crow Wing Lake is well noted for its walleye fishery and production of trophy class fish.  The 1996 walleye gillnet catch of 8.3/net is within the range typical of lake class 22.  The previous survey in 1991 has a similar gillnet catch (8.9/net), while historical catches have ranged from 2.7/net (1972) to 11.0/net (1981).  Sampled walleye had a average length and weight of 17.6 inches and 2.0 pounds, with fish measured up to 27.1 inches.  Thirty-two percent of the sample was 20.0 inches or larger.  An abundant tullibee (cisco) population provides an excellent forage base for the walleye and northern pike.  While natural reproduction does occur in Eleventh Crow Wing, walleye fingerling stocking contributes heavily to the population.  Only 17% of the walleye sample came from years of no stocking.  Eleventh Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd calendar years.  Twelve year classes of walleye were represented in the sample, with growth rates similar to other class 22 lakes.     Eleventh Crow Wing is known for having a low northern pike population composed of quality-sized fish.  The northern pike gillnet catch of 1.1/net is below the range typical of other class 22 lakes, but similar to the range of previous surveys (0.3/net - 3.1/net).  Age analysis shows weak and missing year classes, with large northern pike present.  Northern pike up to 37.3 inches were sampled.  Large northern pike utilize the abundant tullibee population in Eleventh Crow Wing.  Northern pike numbers are limited by the lack of preferred spawning habitat in the west basin, and limited spawning areas in the east basin.  The east basin has a drainable northern pike spawning area that is operated by the Crow Wing Crest Resort.  Northern pike growth rates were fast, and above the average lengths of other class 22 lakes.     Yellow perch were sampled at 26.2/gillnet which is within the range typical of lake class 22.  Historical yellow perch gillnet catches have fluctuated, but have generally been moderate to high numbers.  Yellow perch provide an additional forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations, but provide only a limited fishery to the angler as only 3% of the sample was 9.0 inches or larger.     The bluegill trapnet catch of 34.3/net is within the range typical of lake class 22.  With the exception of 1981 (93.0/net), historical trapnet catches have been similar.  Average size of the bluegill was small (5.6 inches), with only 6% of the sample 7.0 inches or larger.  Bluegill growth rates were similar to other class 22 lakes.     Largemouth bass were sampled at a rate typical for lake class 22 and similar to historical netting.  Largemouth bass up to 20.3 inches were sampled.  Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective methods to assess largemouth bass abundance or size distribution.  To adequately assess a largemouth bass population special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted on Eleventh Crow Wing Lake.  The east basin of Eleventh Crow Wing contains more preferred largemouth bass habitat then the west basin.     Black crappie were in low numbers, below the range typical for this lake class.  Black crappie have been sampled in only two of the past five surveys at catch rates similar to 1996.     Pumpkinseed were sampled within the range typical for this lake class, however, average size was small (5.1 inches).       Rock bass and yellow bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers, while brown bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish were sampled in low numbers.     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but to release medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Eleventh Crow Wing and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eleventh Crow Wing is located just north of Akeley in east-central Hubbard County.  Eleventh Crow Wing has a surface area of 790 acres and a maximum depth of 80 feet.  There is a public access and campground owned and maintained by the city of Akeley located on the south shore.  Eleventh Crow Wing is a deep water lake with excellent water quality and lots of structure to challenge the fisherperson.  Eleventh Crow Wing supports a good walleye population of both numbers and sizes of fish as well as angling opportunities for northern pike and largemouth bass.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Eleventh Crow Wing is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Benedict, Blue, Boot, East Crooked, Ninth Crow Wing, and Spearhead.Walleye abundance (6.8 walleye/gillnet) was just above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Walleye numbers in recent surveys have been higher, ranging from 8.3 walleye/gillnet (1996) to 11.0 walleye/gillnet (1981).  Earlier surveys in 1959 and 1972 had abundance within the \"typical\" range.  Walleye were large in size with a mean length and weight of 18.8 inches and 2.4 pounds and with fish measured up to 28.6 inches.  An aggressive DNR stocking program is maintaining the walleye population in Eleventh Crow Wing as age analysis showed minimal contribution from natural reproduction.  Eleventh Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd years.  Forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in good numbers.  Yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) are important forage species for large predators such as walleye and northern pike.Eleventh Crow Wing is known for having a low northern pike population composed of quality-sized fish.  Northern pike abundance (2.1 pike/gillnet) was below the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.  Large northern pike were not sampled in this survey but have been sampled in past surveys as well as reports from anglers.   Large northern pike utilize the abundant tullibee (cisco) population in Eleventh Crow Wing and account for the fast growth rates observed in the pike.  Northern pike numbers are limited by the lack of preferred spawning habitat in the west basin, and limited spawning habitat in the east basin.Eleventh Crow Wing supports a moderate largemouth bass population, with the better bass habitat in the east basin.  Moderate numbers of bass were sampled with standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets), however, no special sampling such as spring electrofishing has been conducted on Eleventh Crow Wing.  Spring electrofishing is a better tool for adequately assessing largemouth bass abundance and size distribution.Not really known as a panfish lake, Eleventh Crow Wing does support moderate numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed and low numbers of black crappie.  While bluegill abundance (29.5 bluegill/trapnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, their size was small.  Sampled bluegill had a average length of 5.8 inches with fish measured up to 7.9 inches.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.Other species sampled included moderate numbers of rock bass, yellow bullhead, and hybrid sunfish, and low numbers of bowfin, brown bullhead, golden shiner, and green sunfish.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eleventh Crow Wing Lake is located in Akeley, MN in eastern Hubbard County. Eleventh Crow Wing has a surface area of 751 acres and a maximum depth of 80 feet. A city owned public access is located on the south shore of the western basin of the lake. There is a culvert that goes under State Highway 64 between the basins.  The culvert is passable by smaller fishing boats, generally those without a windshield. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Eleventh Crow Wing Lake is in lake class 23. Class 23 lakes generally are very deep, have a very low percentage of littoral area (depths less than 15 feet), very clear and have hard water. Other class 23 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Benedict, Blue, Boot, East Crooked, Ninth Crow Wing, and Spearhead. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has been consistent in previous years, and well above other class 23 lakes. Many Walleyes are a great size for anglers of 14-20 inches, with a number of smaller fish for the future. The average length was 17 inches, with the largest sampled at 28 inches. Yellow Perch are important forage for Walleyes and Northern Pike, and perch abundance was well above other class 23 lakes. Perch were an average size of 6.5 inches and were sampled up to 10.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was normal compared to class 23 lakes, and past surveys of Eleventh Crow Wing. Pike ranged from 10 to 32 inches in length.  The average size of 21.5 inches and 2.2 pounds were in line with past surveys, but no fish over 34 inches were sampled as in recent surveys. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing was done for Largemouth Bass, and catch rates were higher than past samplings.  Fish ranged across all sizes from 6 to 19 inches, with an average size of 10.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAngling opportunities for panfish including Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed. Black Crappie abundance was on the low end of class 23 lakes.  Most crappies were 7.5-9 inches in length. Bluegill and Pumpkinseed abundance was higher than recent years, and most were 4.5-6 inches with the largest being 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRusty Crayfish and Curly-leaf Pondweed have been identified in Eleventh Crow Wing Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eleventh Crow Wing Lake (29-0036-00) is a 751-acre lake with a maximum depth of 80 feet Located near Akeley, MN.  A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on 21-22 July 2017 to assess populations of non-game species and small sport fish. Fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, six sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and seven sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at one sites. Backpack electrofishing was done at all fourteen sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured several species of fish including five species intolerant of disturbance such as Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Least Darter, and Mottled Sculpin.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Stickleback, Central Mudminnow, Common Shiner, Green Sunfish, Golden Shiner, Hybrid sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Mimic Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tadpole Madtom, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. Nearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a survey on 18 July 2016, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Eleventh Crow Wing Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. Eleventh Crow Wing Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

Density has fluctuated from 2.71 fish/gillnet in 1972 to 11.00 fish/gillnet in 1981.  Mean weight of walleye sampled in 1991 was 1.99 lbs.  The PSD (87) and RSD-P (14) indicate a good, but unbalanced, size structure, the problem lying in the lack of substock length fish.  Walleye growth rates are slow for the first three years and then again after age 6.  Mean length at age 4 is 13.39 inches.  Most of the walleye recruitment in 11th Crow Wing Lake is the result of fingerling stockings.  Only small year classes are observed for non-stocked years.Northern pike catch rates (1.63 fish/gillnet and 4.95 lbs/gillnet) are below the first quartile in 1991, as they have since 1959.  These numbers result in a mean weight of 3.04 lbs.  Northern pike exhibit high growth the first three years before declining to slow growth rates.  Mean length at age 3 is 17.93 inches.  Although the sample is small, northern pike appear to have a good size distribution (PSD=69, RSD-P=7).  Northern pike fingerlings were stocked in 11th Crow Wing until 1984 with little success.  Natural recruitment is maintaining the present population.Bluegill catches were within the normal ranges for lakes of this classification, while catch rates of pumpkinseed, largemouth bass, yellow perch, rock bass and green sunfish were all above the third quartile.  Numerous hybrid sunfish were also sampled.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed abundances peaked in 1981 when catches were above the third quartile.  Both species presently have slow growth rates, reflected in small size structures.  Bluegill PSD=30 and mean length at age 4 is 4.99 inches.  Mean length at age 4 for pumpkinseed is 4.60 and the PSD for trapnet catches is 11.  Largemouth bass catch rates also peaked in 1981.  Growth rates of largemouth bass are variable among year classes, but are slow on the average.  Mean length at age 4 is 8.73 inches.  Yellow perch catch rates have been increasing since 1972, but size structure remains small (PSD=8).Cisco, white sucker, yellow bullhead and brown bullhead catch rates were all within the normal ranges for lakes of this class.  Cisco densities have remained within the normal ranges since 1959; white sucker abundances has fluctuated from below the first quartile in 1972 to above the third quartile in 1986.  Yellow, brown and black bullhead numbers have all increased since 1959, however, catches of black bullhead still fell below the first quartile in 1991.  Bowfin abundance has decreased since they were first sampled in 1981 and catches fell below the first quartile in 1991.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eleventh Crow Wing Lake is located just north of Akeley in east-central Hubbard County.  Eleventh Crow Wing has a surface area of 751 acres and a maximum depth of 80 feet.  There is a public access and campground, owned and maintained by the city of Akeley, located on the south shore.  Eleventh Crow Wing is a deep lake with excellent water quality and lots of structures to challenge the angler.  Eleventh Crow Wing supports a good walleye population for both numbers and sizes of fish, as well as providing angling opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Eleventh Crow Wing is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Benedict, Blue, Boot, East Crooked, Ninth Crow Wing, and Spearhead. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (6.9 walleye/gillnet) was above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and near the current management goal of 7.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance since 1991 has been similar, with gillnet catch rates ranging near or just above the current management goal.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 17.9 inches and 2.1 pounds, with fish measured up to 29.5 inches.  While natural reproduction occurs, the DNR stocking program is helping to maintain walleye abundance in Eleventh Crow Wing Lake.  Eleventh Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) are important forage species for large predators such as walleye and northern pike.  Tullibee were sampled in good numbers (25.0 tullibee/gillnet), but yellow perch abundance (8.5 perch/gillnet) was down from past surveys.  Yellow perch are small in size and generally are not an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nEleventh Crow Wing is known for having a low northern pike population composed of quality-sized fish.  Northern pike abundance (3.9 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to the previous survey in 2006.  Northern pike have been sampled in low numbers in earlier surveys, generally below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Large northern pike utilize the abundant tullibee (cisco) population in Eleventh Crow Wing which accounts for the fast growth rates observed in the pike.  Northern pike up to 40.5 inches were sampled.  Northern pike numbers are limited by a lack of preferred spawning habitat in the west basin and a limited amount of spawning habitat in the east basin. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not really known as a bass-panfish lake, Eleventh Crow Wing does support moderate numbers of bluegill, pumpkinseed, and largemouth bass and low numbers of black crappie.  While bluegill abundance (47.9 bluegill/trapnet) was just above the range \"typical\" for this lake class, anglers will find that size tends to run small.  Sampled bluegill had an average length of 5.5 inches with fish measured up to 7.9 inches.  Bluegill growth rates were slow compared to other area lakes.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Eleventh Crow Wing supports a low to moderate largemouth bass population, with the better bass habitat in the east basin. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of hybrid sunfish, rock bass and yellow bullhead.  White sucker, bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner, and green sunfish were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eleventh Crow Wing Lake is located just north of Akeley in east-central Hubbard County.  Eleventh Crow Wing has a surface area of 790 acres and a maximum depth of 80 feet.  There is a public access and campground, owned and maintained by the city of Akeley, located on the south shore.  Eleventh Crow Wing is a deep lake with excellent water quality and lots of structure to challenge the angler.  Eleventh Crow Wing supports a good walleye population for both numbers and sizes of fish, as well as providing angling opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Eleventh Crow Wing is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Benedict, Blue, Boot, East Crooked, Ninth Crow Wing, and Spearhead. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and above the current management goal.  Walleye gillnet catch rates since 1991 have been similar, ranging near or just above the management goal.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 2.1 pounds and 18.1 inches, with fish measured up to 29.0 inches.  While natural reproduction occurs, the DNR stocking program is helping to maintain walleye abundance in Eleventh Crow Wing Lake.  Eleventh Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) are important forage species for large predators such as walleye and northern pike.  Tullibee were sampled in good numbers, but perch abundance was lower than the long range goal. <br> \n <br> \nEleventh Crow Wing is known for having a low northern pike population composed of quality-size fish.  Northern pike abundance was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and the highest recorded for Eleventh Crow Wing.  Northern pike have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys, generally below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Large northern pike utilize the abundant tullibee (cisco) population in Eleventh Crow Wing which accounts for the fast growth rates observed in the pike.  Northern pike numbers are limited by a lack of preferred spawning habitat in the west basin and a limited amount of spawning habitat in the east basin. <br> \n <br> \nEleventh Crow Wing supports a moderate bass population, with the better bass habitat in the east basin.  Spring electrofishing was conducted in 2006 for the first time on Eleventh Crow Wing.  Moderate numbers of bass were sampled when compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not really known as a panfish lake, Eleventh Crow Wing does support moderate numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed and low numbers of black crappie.  While bluegill abundance was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, their size was small.  Sampled bluegill had an average length of 5.4 inches with fish measured up to 7.2 inches.  Bluegill growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes.  Black crappies were sampled in low to moderate numbers, similar to past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of rock bass, yellow bullhead, white sucker, and low numbers of brown bullhead, bowfin, and golden shiner.</p>",
