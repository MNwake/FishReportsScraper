                "narrative": "<p>Lake Stella, Meeker county, was surveyed during the week of August 9, 1999.  Standard gill nets, trap nets, and spring night-time electrofishing techniques were included for the population assessment.  The lake management plan lists walleye and northern pike as primary species managed for while smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch are all classified as secondary species managed for.Gill nets sampled 124 walleye.  Fish ranged in length from 7.8 to 21.9 inches and had an average length of 11.4 inches.  Walleye numbers have remained fairly consistent over the years and continue to provide angling oppertunities.Gill nets sampled 48 northern pike.  Fish ranged in length from 14.8 to 29.2 inches and had an average length of 21.6 inches.  Pike numbers have been fairly consistent over the years with a wide range of sizes available.Gill nets sampled 15 smallmouth bass.  Fish ranged in length from 8.9 to 17.2 inches and had an average length of 13.6 inches.Gill nets sampled 13 yellow perch. Fish ranged in length from 5.5 to 6.9 inches and had an average length of 6.2 inches.  Trap nets sampled 75 bluegill.  Fish ranged in length from 2.2 to 7.4 inches and had an average length of 4.5 inches.  Trap nets sampled four black crappie.  Fish ranged in length from 8.1 to 8.8 inches and had an average length of 8.5 inches.  Black crappie have never been abundant in this lake.Electrofishing sampled 40 largemouth bass, which ranged in length from 5.2 to 20.2 inches and displayed an average length of 11.4 inches.  A total of four smallmouth bass were sampled and ranged in length from 8.6 to 13.3 inches with an average length of 10.8 inches.</p>",

A total of 13 different species of fish were sampled, plus hybrid sunfish.  Eurasian watermilfoil, an exotic plant, was present at Stella Lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 179 walleye for a catch rate of 19.9/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 9.1/net.  Walleye were 6.9 to 23.0 inches long averaging 10.7 inches.  Approximately 67% of the gill netted walleye were less than 10 inches in length.  Walleye were 1 to 9 years old with 8 year-classes present.  The 2007 year-class would be considered strong, accounting for 78% of the gill net sample.  The latest stocking regime (1,000 fry/littoral acre every-other-year) was initiated in 1993.  Years when walleye were not stocked accounted for 7% of the gill net sample, documenting natural reproduction.  Gill net catch rates (2008, 2004, 2001, 1999) during the latest regime ranged from 9.1 to 20.6/net, averaging 15.9/net. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 34 northern pike for a catch rate of 3.8/net, which was withing the normal range for lakes of this type.  The 2004 catch rate was 1.6/net.  Northern pike were 9.5 to 28.8 inches long averaging 20.9 inches.  Trap nets sampled pike up to 33.7 inches in length.   Northern pike were young-of-the-year to 5 years old with 6 year-classes present.        <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 108 yellow perch for a catch rate of 12.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 1.6/net.  Yellow perch were 5.6 to 8.4 inches long averaging 6.7 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 20 smallmouth bass for a catch rate of 2.2/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 1.6/net.  Smallmouth bass were 6.3 to 17.3 inches long averaging 11.8 inches.  Spring night-time electrofishing sampled 4 smallmouth bass for a catch rate of 3.0/hr of electrofisher on-time.  The catch rate in 2006 was 0.8/hr.  Electrofished smallmouth bass were 5.0 to 9.3 inches long averaging 7.8 inches.  Smallmouth bass were 1 to 2 years old with 2 year-classes present.  Stella is one of the few lakes in Meeker or McLeod County that contains a fishable population of smallmouth bass.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 8 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 6.0/hr of electrofisher on-time.  The catch rate in 2006 was 20.3/hr.  Catch rates (n=9) from 1991 to 2008 ranged from 2.3 to 37.4/hr, averaging 16.4/hr.  Largemouth bass were 5.2 to 18.4 inches long averaging 9.3 inches.  Largemouth bass were 1 to 8 years old with 5 year-classes present.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 8 carp for a catch rate of 0.9/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 2.1/net.  Carp were 24.0 to 27.0 inches long averaging 25.4 inches.  The trap net catch rate was also low at 0.3/net, with the longest fish being 39.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 17 black bullhead for a catch rate of 1.9/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 60.6/net.  Black bullhead were 8.0 to 13.6 inches long averaging 12.1 inches.  Trap nets only sampled 1 black bullhead.  Trap nets sampled 1 yellow bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 5 black crappie for a catch rate of 0.6/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 0.7/net.  Black crappie were 7.5 to 10.3 inches long averaging 8.3 inches.  Gill nets sampled 29 black crappie for a catch rate of 3.2/net.  Gill netted black crappie were 5.3 to 11.8 inches long averaging 8.5 inches.  The 2004 catch rate was 3.0/net. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 215 bluegill for a catch rate of 23.9/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Bluegill were 3.2 to 7.8 inches long averaging 4.8 inches.  Approximately 20% of the trap net sample was at least 6 inches long, while 4% of the catch was 7 inches or longer. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stella is a medium-size lake (599 acres) located south of the City of Darwin in Meeker County. A moderate sized state-owned access with paved parking and a double cement boat ramp is present on the south shore. Smaller boats may also enter Stella (from Washington Lake) via a cement box culvert at the east end of the lake. Stella has over four miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of seventy-five feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Stella is a class 24 lake and other similar waterbodies in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Erie Lake in Meeker County and Stahls Lake in McLeod County. Stella's 2021 lake management plan listed Walleye, Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass as primary management species, while Black Crappie and Northern Pike were secondary species.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Walleye were netted in 2023 (7.0/gill net), and fish averaged 18 inches in length. The maximum length of Walleye sampled was just over 27 inches. An impressive 82% of the catch was 17 inches or longer. Ageing data from the 2023 survey indicated that natural reproduction of Walleye was substantial at Stella Lake. The oldest Walleye was age-16. <br> \n  <br> \nLow numbers of Smallmouth Bass were netted, with fish averaging 15 inches in length. The longest Smallmouth Bass captured was 19.3 inches. Low numbers of Largemouth Bass were netted, but that species typically does not sample well in gill nets. Largemouth Bass averaged 14 inches in length, with the longest fish being 16 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nRecord high numbers of Black Crappie were gill netted in 2023, but many were small. The average size was 6.2 inches in length. However, Black Crappie up to 14.8 inches were found to be present at Stella Lake. Approximately 22% of the catch was 9 inches or longer. Moderate numbers of Bluegill were gill netted in 2023. However, sunfish populations typically do not sample well in this gear. Most of the Bluegill were small, averaging 4.6 inches in length. The longest Bluegill sampled was 7.2 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nRecord high numbers of Northern Pike were gill netted this year at Stella Lake, with fish averaging 23 inches in length. The longest pike sampled was 33.5 inches. Approximately 21% of pike netted were 26 inches or longer. Northern Pike regulations were revised at a statewide level beginning in 2018 to better accommodate regional differences in pike habitats, population abundances and size structures. Three management zones were established for Northern Pike, with their own bag limit and length limit restrictions. In the north-central zone, where Stella Lake is found, anglers can keep ten Northern Pike. Only two can be longer than 26 inches and all pike from 22 to 26 inches long must be immediately released. This zone regulation is meant to decrease numbers of small Northern Pike and increase the abundance of medium and large sized fish.  <br> \n <br> \nAdditional fish varieties sampled in the 2023 gill nets included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.    <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Stella Lake has two AIS - Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussel. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local MNDNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the MNDNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

Aquatic plant sampling and water quality monitoring were also conducted.Eurasian watermilfoil was first discovered in Stella Lake in 1999, near the outlet to Washington Lake.  A small patch was found growing on the south shore of the main lake in 2004.  A total of 25 native plant species were also sampled.  Much of the Stella Lake shoreline is developed and the lakes watershed is dominated by agricultural row crops.  Water clarity was 5.5 feet in early August.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations were not sufficient for most fish species below 30 feet during August, so don't fish too deep at this time of the year.Moderate numbers (9.1/net) of walleye were gill netted in 2004 compared to the high numbers (20.6/net) sampled in 2001.  Walleye were 8.3-26.2 inches long averaging 13.7 inches.  Walleye fry are stocked every-other-year at Stella Lake.  Naturally reproduced walleye accounted for at least 15% of the gill net catch.  Low numbers (1.6/net) of northern pike were gill netted in 2004 compared to moderate numbers sampled in 2001 (8.1/net).  Northern pike were 15.9-30.2 inches long averaging 23.1 inches.  Few yellow perch were sampled and size was small, averaging 6.1 inches.  Stella is one-of-three lakes in Meeker County with a fishable population of smallmouth bass.  Moderate numbers (1.6/net) of smallmouth bass were gill netted in 2004.  The 2001 catch rate was three times higher.  Smallmouth bass were 10.8-18.6 inches long averging 13.8 inches in 2004.  Low numbers (6.1/net) of bluegill were trap netted in 2004.  This was also the case in 1999.  Bluegill were 3.2-7.3 inches long averging 5.4 inches. Approximately 40% of the catch was 6 inches or longer, while 4% reached 7 inches.  Low numbers of black crappie were trap netted, averaging 8.2 inches.  Black crappie have never been trap netted in large numbers at Stella Lake.  Spring night-time electrofishing for bass sampled moderate numbers (16.5/hour) of largemouth bass and few smallmouth bass.  Largemouth bass were 5.2-17.8 inches long averaging 11.3 inches.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A full resurvey was conducted at Lake Stella in Meeker County in 2014.  Lake Stella is a class 24 lake and is managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass, and Bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Lake Stella watershed (16,033 acres) was highly disturbed and dominated (64%) by row crop agriculture.  The shoreline was heavily developed with 125 homes counted within the riparian zone and residential land use accounting for 62% of the shoreline.  The watershed to lake ratio was 26:1.  The maximum depth at which aquatic vegetation was sampled was 14.1 feet in mid-July.  A total of 28 aquatic plant species were sampled, of which Clasping-leaf Pondweed, Filamentous Algae, Muskgrass, Water Celery, and Sago Pondweed were most common.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations dropped below 2 ppm at a depth of 21 feet, so don't fish too deep in the summer.  The secchi disk reading was 5.5 feet in mid-August, indicating decent water clarity.  The most common shoalwater substrates were gravel and sand. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 76 Walleye were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 8.4/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake as was every assessment dating back to 1957.  The catch rate in 2008 was 19.9/net and historically (n=11) catch rates have varied from 8.4/net in 2014 to 29.8/net in 1957 with an average of 17.2/net.  Lengths ranged from 6.9 to 23.0 inches with an average of 10.7 inches.  Approximately 49% of the gill net sample was 14 inches or longer, indicating a balanced population with good numbers of quality and larger fish available.  A total of 3 Walleye ranging from 17.8 to 24.2 inches were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.3/net.  Walleye from both gears ranged from age-1 to age-10 with 9 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate or fast.  Approximately 85% of the aged Walleye were from stocked years.  It was unknown what portion of that 85% was due to natural reproduction and what was due to stocking.  The current stocking regime began in 1993 and calls for 1,000 fry/littoral acre (acres less than 15 feet) to be stocked on odd number years.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 40 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.4/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this type.  The catch rate in 2008 was 3.8/net and historically (n=11) catch rates have varied from 0.0/net in 1979 to 8.1/net in 2001 with an average of 3.4/net.  Lengths ranged from 20.0 to 32.6 inches with an average of 25.9 inches.  Approximately 93% of the gill net catch was 22 inches or longer, while 13% were 30 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  An additional 5 northern pike ranging from 21.3 to 30.1 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.6/net.  Northern Pike from both gears ranged from age-2 to age-9 with 8 year-classes present.  Age-2 and age-3 fish accounted for 51% of the aged sample.  Growth was fast.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 40 Smallmouth Bass were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.4/net, which was well above the normal range for this type of lake and the second highest catch rate ever recorded in Lake Stella.  Since 1957 (n=11), catch rates have ranged from 0.0/net in 1957, 1974 and 1993 to 4.7/net in 2001 with an average catch rate of 1.7/net.  Lengths ranged from 6.9 to 19.3 inches with an average of 15.3 inches.  Approximately 88% of the gill net catch was 14 inches or longer, indicating a population with many larger fish available.  An additional 4 Smallmouth Bass ranging from 5.9 to 7.9 inches were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.4/net.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 231 Bluegill were sampled in trap nets for a catch rate of 25.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Since 1957 (n=10), Bluegill catch rates have ranged from 2.3/net in 1957 to 55.0/net in 1983 with an average of 19.6/net.  Lengths ranged from 2.8 to 7.4 inches with an average of 4.3 inches.  Approximately 5% of the trap net catch was 6 inches or longer, indicating a population dominated by small fish.  A total of 49 Bluegill ranging from 3.6 to 7.2 inches were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 5.4/net.   <br> \n <br> \nNo Black Crappie were sampled with trap nets and only 3 ranging from 8.9 to 13.8 inches were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was well below the normal range for this lake type.  Historically (n=10), Black Crappie trap net catch rates have ranged from 0.0/net in 1983 and 2014 to 3.3/net in 1957 with an average of 0.7/net.   <br> \n <br> \nJust 2 Largemouth Bass ranging from 13.8 to 19.5 inches were sampled with gill and trap nets in 2014. The spring night-time electrofishing catch rate was 4.3/hr and the second lowest on record, but sampling was not conducted at the most ideal time.  Historically (n=9), electrofishing catch rates have varied from 2.3/hour on-time in 2001 to 37.4/hour on-time in 1992 with an average of 15.2/hour on-time.  In 2014, spring electrofished Largemouth Bass were 13.2 to 19.3 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 5 Yellow Perch ranging from 2.1 to 6.2 inches were sampled with gill and trap nets in 2014. Since 1957 (n=11), gill net catch rates have been flashy ranging from 0.4/net in 2014 to 115.0/net in 1957 with an average of 25.8/net.  In recent samples since 1999 (n=5), Yellow Perch numbers have remained low with an average of just 3.3/net. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp and Black Bullhead numbers remain low in Lake Stella with gill net catch rates of 0.3/net and 0.0/net, respectively.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2014 include Bowfin, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish (Lepomis spp.), Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Growth is good and age classes are well distributed from age 1 up to age 7.  Though net catches of 8.6 per gillnet indicate a fair population, catches are down from 25 walleyes per lift in 1979.  The perch forage base is also down from 76 per lift in 1979 to 23 per lift in 1983.  Though this is still a substantial perch population, the decline in numbers per lift may be a sign of a future slump.  The northern pike population has increased from 2.5 per lift in 1979 to 5.7 in 1983 with fish between 14 inches and 30 inches in length.  Growth is good on the northerns.  The bluegill population is very good at 55 per trapnet lift compared to 30 per lift in 1979.  Most of the bluegills are in the 4\"-6\" range and growth is good.  The population of black and white crappies is small at 2.2 and 0.3 per lift, respectively.  There are good largemouth and smallmouth bass populations.  Carp and black bullhead populations are low, at 0.2 and 9.8 per lift, respectively.</p>",

A state owned public access, with two cement boat ramps, and a moderate amount of parking is present on the south shore. Water clarity is good and submergent vegetation is plentiful at Stella.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring daytime electrofishing, targeting Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass, was completed at Stella Lake on May 17, 2021. Bass species were measured, and age and growth information was collected from Largemouth Bass, which is lacking from lakes in the southern part of Minnesota. <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of Largemouth Bass were collected during the electrofishing survey, with fish averaging 12 inches in length. Many smaller sized Largemouth Bass were captured in this assessment, but fish up to 19 inches were also found to be present. Largemouth Bass were age-2 to age-18 with 13 year classes present. Low numbers of Smallmouth Bass were captured, but this species has rarely been sampled well with the electrofishing gear at Stella. Smallmouth Bass were 13 to 17 inches long. Stella is one of the more popular bass lakes in Meeker County, for both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass. Bass fishing clubs often visit Stella Lake because of its history of producing good numbers of nice sized bass. Twitching crankbaits, slow-rolling spinner baits, buzz baits and a jig-and-a-pig will all take Stella bass. Bass can occassionally be found in the lily pads and bulrush beds. A leech under a bobber is another tried-and-true method of catching Stella Lake bass. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Stella Lake has the AIS - Eurasian watermilfoil and Zebra mussel. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

All other species were caught at the expected rates for the area. <br> \n <br> \nNatural reproduction as indicated by shoreline seining was good for most species found in the lake.  Age-class structure of the walleye population indicates good reproduction most years. <br> \n <br> \nThe above information indicates the lake is a roughfish-gamefish lake and should be managed as a bass-panfish-walleye lake.  Primary efforts should be devoted to increasing the northern pike and bluegill populations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Stella Lake beginning on July 29, 2019, to monitor the lake's fish population and to evaluate the 1993 Walleye fry stocking regime.  Stella is a class 24 lake and net catches were compared to other similar lakes around the state.  The 2015 lake management plan (LMP) listed Northern Pike and Walleye as the primary management species at Stella Lake.  Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass were listed as secondary management species.  In 2019, a total of 13 species, plus hybrid sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets (GN) and trap nets (TN).  The dissolved oxygen concentration dropped below 2.0 mg/l at 20 feet down on July 29, 2019.  This indicated limited oxygen for fish use below 20 feet deep, and this was common for deep lakes in this part of the state.  Anglers may want to concentrate their fishing efforts in water less than 20 feet deep, during mid-summer, at Stella Lake.  Water clarity was moderate with a secchi disk reading of 8.0 feet.  Decreased clarity was due to an algae bloom.  Public shore fishing opportunities were limited to the public access on the south side of the lake.  Stella Lake was listed at being infested with Eurasian watermilfoil in 1999 and zebra mussel in 2015.  Anglers should drain water from their boats and remove plant fragments from their trailers, to make sure they were not transporting any aquatic invasive species.  Stella was part of a three-year study (2019 to 2021), on the Washington, Stella, Manuella chain of lakes, designed to estimate angler exploitation of Walleye.  Walleye were marked with a jaw tags, during an ice-out electrofishing survey, and summer gill netted fish were examined for tags, to complete a separate population estimate.  Anglers were encouraged to report jaw tags (tag number, length of fish, kept or released, and lake it was caught in) to the Hutchinson Area Fisheries Office (320) 234-2550.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Largemouth Bass (8) for a catch rate of 0.9/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Gill netted Largemouth Bass were 5.4 to 14.8 inches long averaging 10.9 inches.  Trap nets also sampled low numbers (2) of Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was within the normal range for this lake type.  Trap netted Largemouth Bass were 7.1 to 18.6 inches long, indicating that quality sized fish were present.  Gill nets and trap nets typically do not sample Largemouth Bass well, but bass anglers know that Stella has a quality population with all sizes of fish being present.  A Largemouth Bass population estimate is planned for 2020. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (<5/GN) of Northern Pike (21) for a catch rate of 2.3/net, which was within the normal range for this lake type.  The 2014 catch rate was similar at 4.4/net.  The 2015 LMP's long-range goal (3.8 to 7.3/net) was not met.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 8.1/net averaging 3.3/net.  Historically, recruitment would be classified as low at Stella Lake.  In 2019, gill netted Northern Pike were 22.3 to 33.5 inches long with an impressive average of 27.8 inches, indicating a quality size structure.  Stella was included in the 2018 Northern Pike North Central Management Zone regulation area, which had a 22 to 26 inch protected slot limit (PSL), which required immediate release of all Northern Pike from 22 to 26 inches in length.  A ten fish bag limit (8 below and 2 above) was also in place.  The PSL regulation was designed to allow more harvest of abundant small pike and to shift the population size structure to more medium sized fish.  Stella has traditionally been known as a lake that had low numbers of nice sized pike.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Smallmouth Bass (41) for a catch rate of 4.6/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake, and the second highest catch ever recorded at Stella.  The 2014 GN catch rate was very similar at 4.4/net.  The 2015 LMP's goal for Smallmouth Bass (>0.5/GN) was met.  Historic GN catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12) were mostly low ranging from 0.0 to 4.7/net averaging 1.9/net.  In 2019, GN Smallmouth Bass were 6.1 to 18.2 inches long averaging 13.3 inches.  Approximately 35% of the GN catch was 15 inches or longer, indicating that a quality population was present.  Smallmouth Bass were age-2 to age-9 with eight year classes being present.  Age-1 (18%), age-2 (15%), age-3 (25%), and age-4 (23%) fish, were most abundant, accounting for 81% of the aged fish.      <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (10) of Black Crappie in 2019 for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was below the normal range for this lake type.  The 2014 TN catch rate was also low (0.0/TN).  The 2015 LMP's long-range goal (maintain presence) was met.  Trap net catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=11) were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 3.3/net averaging 0.7/net.  A total of 10 out of 11 (91%) of the historical TN catch rates were below the normal range for this lake type, indicating that this time of year was not good for sampling Black Crappie at Stella Lake.  In 2019, trap netted Black Crappie were 3.9 to 7.2 inches long averaging 5.3 inches.  Gill nets sampled moderate numbers (74) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 8.2/net, which was within the normal range for this lake type, and was the second highest GN catch ever measured at Stella.  Historic GN catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12) were variable, ranging from 0.3 to 9.0/net averaging 3.4/net.  In 2019, the gill netted Black Crappie were 4.1 to 12.3 inches long, averaging 6.3 inches.  Approximately 16% of the GN catch was 10 inches or longer, indicating that quality sized fish were present.  The length distribution tables indicated inconsistent recruitment. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate to high numbers of Bluegill (281) for a catch rate of 35.1/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Bluegill were the most abundant fish sampled in 2019 TN's.  The 2014 TN catch rate was similar at 25.7/net.  The 2015 LMP's Bluegill long-range goal (7.5 to 62.5) was met.  Historic TN catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=11) were variable, ranging from 2.3 to 55.0/net, averaging 21.0/net.  In 2019, trap netted Bluegill were 2.9 to 7.8 inches long averaging 5.3 inches.  The TN length distribution table indicated that multiple year classes were present and recruitment was consistent.  A separate TN survey, conducted in the spring of 2019, showed fair numbers of 7 inch Bluegill being present, along with a few 8 inch, and even a couple of 9 inch fish also being present at Stella.  Anglers should find plenty of small sunfish action in the shallows, but the bigger Bluegill may be a little tougher to locate during mid to late summer (try off the deep weed edge).  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Walleye (100) for a catch rate of 11.1/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2015 LMP's long-range goal for Walleye (>6.3/GN) was met.  The 2014 GN catch rate was similar (8.4/net) to the 2019 catch.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12), under various stocking regimes, were mostly moderate to high, ranging from 8.4 to 29.8/net averaging 16.7/net.  All twelve of Stella's historic Walleye GN catch rates were above the normal range for this type of lake.  In 2019, gill netted Walleye were 9.9 to 27.2 inches long averaging 15.3 inches.  Approximately 47% of the GN catch was 14 inches or longer, indicating that a quality population was present.  Gill netted Walleye were estimated to be age-1 to age-12 with 10 year classes present, indicating somewhat consistent recruitment.  Only 12% of the aged fish were age-5 or older.  The 2017 year class was considered strong.  The 2015 and 2016 year classes were considered moderate in size.  The other seven year classes were ranked as weak.  Growth was considered typical for Stella Lake.  In 2019, non-stocked years accounted for 26% of the GN aged (n=100) Walleye, indicating that natural reproduction was occurring, somewhere within the Washington, Stella, Manuella chain of lakes.  The contribution from natural reproduction during fry stocked years remained unknown, due to the inability to differentiate the two groups.  Gill net catch rates from 1999 to 2019 (n=6), during the 1993 stocking regime (226,000 fry 1 of 2 years), ranged from 8.4 to 20.6/net averaging 13.8/GN, possibly indicating a successful stocking strategy.  Nine jaw tagged Walleye were captured in the summer gill nets at Stella.  Stella was known as a good Walleye lake.  Abundant vegetation and clearer water can sometimes make Walleye fishing on Stella  <br> \ndifficult.  Try fishing deep, and at the prime times of sunrise and sunset, or at night.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (13) for a catch rate of 1.4/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2014 GN catch rate was also low (0.4/net).  Historic GN catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12) were variable ranging from 0.4 to 115.0/net averaging 23.8/net.  In 2019, gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.3 to 6.6 inches long.  Fishable sized Yellow Perch were rare at Stella Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (94) of Yellow Bullhead for a catch rate of 10.4/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake, and the second highest catch rate ever measured at Stella.  The 2014 GN catch rate was much lower at 0.7/GN.  Historic GN catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12) were mostly low, ranging from 0.1 to 13.3/net averaging 3.7.  In 2019, Yellow Bullhead were 4.9 to 14.1 inches long averaging 10.6 inches.  Approximately 22% of the GN sample was 12 inches or longer, indicating that a quality population was present for anglers seeking this species.        <br> \n <br> \nGill nets failed to sample any Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.0/net, which was below the normal range for this lake type.  Historic GN catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 142.7/net averaging 18.7/net.  In 2019, trap nets also failed to sample any Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.0/net, which tied the all-time lows from 1957, 1988, 1999, and 2014.  Historic TN catch rates (n=11) were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 1.6/TN, averaging 0.2/net.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (3) for a catch rate of 0.4/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The trap netted Common Carp were 20.4 to 20.5 inches long.  Historic TN catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=11) were almost all low, ranging from 0.0 to 6.0/TN and averaging 0.9/net. Gill nets failed to sample any Common Carp this year, for a catch rate of 0.0/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake, and tied Stella's all-time low from 1993.  Historic GN catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12) were almost all low, ranging from 0.0 to 8.0/net averaging 1.5/net.  Data indicated that Common Carp abundance was typically low at Stella Lake.  Bow anglers may want to try a different lake. <br> \n      <br> \nAdditional fishes sampled in the standard gear included: Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Stella is a moderate size lake in Meeker County with a surface area of 533 acres and a maximum depth of 75 feet.  This is a popular fishing lake and generally provides good fishing for a variety of fish species.  In 1993 personnel from the Hutchinson Area Fisheries Headquarters used trapnets, gillnets, seines and an electrofishing boat to survey the fish population in Lake Stella.  Gamefish species collected in this years survey included northern pike, bluegill, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black crappie, walleye and yellow perch.  Other species, such as white sucker, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, bowfin and common carp were also present in testnet samples.     Walleye numbers have remained somewhat consistent over the last ten years.  In this years survey walleye were captured at a rate of 16 per gillnet.  This is nearly identical to the catch rate during the 1988 survey.  The average size of walleye was 13 inches.  Although the largest fish captured in gillnets was only 21 inches, spring trapnetting showed that good numbers of larger fish are also present in Lake Stella.       Northern pike numbers in Lake Stella have followed a downward trend similar to that observed in most area lakes.  Drought conditions and low water levels during the late 1980's limited the success of northern pike reproduction.  Although the catch rate in this years survey (3 per gillnet) was near the average for lakes similar to Lake Stella, the average size was small (23 inches).  Return of normal water levels and improved spawning conditions should help northern pike populations recover.     Only five black crappie were sampled during the summer survey, but this species is often not sampled well with trapnets or gillnets during summer months.  Since black crappie often suspend in open water, away from the shoreline, they may not show up in testnets in representative numbers.  Observation of anglers, especially during winter, indicated good fishing success for black crappie.     Bluegill numbers have varied considerably since 1979.  The highest catch rate was observed in 1983.  The current survey showed that bluegill were captured at a rate of 17 per trapnet, which is below average for lakes with physical characteristics similar to Lake Stella.  Most bluegill were between 5 to 6 inches, but fish up to 8 inches were also present in trapnets.     Largemouth and smallmouth bass provide additional opportunities to anglers on Lake Stella.  Good populations of both species are present, and anglers often catch smallmouth bass larger that 3 pounds.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stella is a moderate-sized lake (599 acres) located near Darwin in Meeker County. A large state-owned access with a double cement boat ramp is located on the south shore. Stella has 5 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 75 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Stella is a class 24 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Erie and Manuella.      <br> \n <br> \nStella Lake is experiencing system change (increases in water clarity and submerged plant abundance) and as the habitat has changed, the fish community is in a period of change as well. Historically, good numbers of Walleye were typically sampled at Stella Lake and this was again the case in 2021. The 2021 gill net catch rate indicated that moderate numbers were present, with Walleye averaging almost 17 inches in length. The maximum length for Walleye was 27 inches. Do not expect to catch high numbers of Northern Pike at Stella, but if you do catch one, it could be nice sized. In 2021, Northern Pike averaged 25 inches in length with a maximum length of 32 inches. Fair numbers of Black Crappie were sampled in 2021, but anglers may need to do some searching for this elusive species. However, big crappie are present (maximum length was just under 14 inches) at Stella Lake. Anglers can expect decent Bluegill action, but the bigger ones can be hard to find in Stella, due to the abundant vegetation and good oxygen levels in water down to around 17 feet in late summer. Bluegill over 8 inches were sampled. Bass anglers know that Stella has both decent numbers and nice sizes of both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass. The Washington, Stella, and Manuella chain of lakes offers the best fishing opportunities in Meeker County for Smallmouth Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter include Black Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.    <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Eurasian watermilfoil and Zebra mussel are now present in Stella Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

Though difficult to age, the sample seems composed of 2, 3, and 4 year old fish, which range in size from 10-20 inches in length.  Norther pike are less abundant at 2.5/gillnet.  Fishermen report catching smaller size northern pike.  Catches of bluegill (30.2/trapnet) twice exceed the local median catch rate.  About one-half of the sample is represented by fish five inches or greater, a size acceptable to the angler; and growth is average.  Smallmouth bass have become established in the lake and a catch rate of 1.2/trapnet was recorded.  Yellow perch are numerous (76/gillnet) and ranged in size from 5-7.5 inches.  Test netting shows roughfish populations to be at low levels.  Shoreline seining reveals that sunfish and largemouth bass have successfully reproduced this past season.  Several other species were collected including shiners, yellow perch and banded killifish, indicating that multiple prey species are available as forage.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stella is a moderate sized Lake (599 acres) located near Darwin, in Meeker County.  A large sized state owned access, with a double cement boat ramp, is present on the south shore.  Stella has 4.74 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 75 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Stella is a class 24 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Manuella and Big Swan.    <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, high numbers of Walleye were typically netted at Stella Lake, but this was not the case in 2020.  The 2020 gill net catch rate was the lowest on record, but still indicated that decent numbers of Walleye were present.  A wide range of Walleye lengths were sampled in 2020, with fish averaging 15 inches and maxing out at 26 inches.  Don't expect to catch too many Northern Pike at Stella, but if you do it will probably be a nice one.  In 2020, Northern Pike averaged an impressive 26 inches in length.  Moderate numbers of Black Crappie were sampled in 2020, which was above the lake's historic average.  Black Crappie up to 13 inches in length were collected this year.  Anglers could expect decent Bluegill action at Stella, but will need to do some sorting and searching if they are after larger fish.  .  Try fishing a little deeper, off the deep weed-line in mid-summer, to find the bigger sunfish. Bass anglers should find that there are typically good numbers and a wide size range of bass at Stella Lake.  The Washington, Stella, and Manuella chain of lakes offers the best fishing opportunities in Meeker County for Smallmouth Bass.  The maximum lengths for Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass sampled in 2020 were 19 and 18 inches, respectively. Other species that anglers may encounter include Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.      <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussel are now present in Stella Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.  Thanks and good fishing! <br> \n</p>",

It had been seined in 1940 also.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake and drainage basin characteristics are as follows: It's area is 606 acres and the maximum depth is 62.5 feet.  It's shoreline slopes gradually dropping 20 feet in about 1,000 feet.  An inlet flows at a rate of 2.2 cubic feet per second from Lake Manuella.  The outlet flows to Washington Lake at a rate of 2.9 cubic feet per second.  No dam was present. <br> \n <br> \nThe fairly colorless water lacked sufficient oxygen, below 25 feet, for fish life.  The turbidity of the lake is moderate.  Its alkalinity was found to be 188 ppm or moderately hard water. <br> \n <br> \nOf the 22 kinds of fish present, the test netting found green sunfish and black crappie fairly high in numbers; carp average; dogfish, bullheads, walleye, bluegill, sunfish, and white crappie low in numbers.  Growth rates of bluegill, sunfish, and both crappie were found to be slightly better than average.  Fish sizes were average. <br> \nSpawning conditions were found be fair to good for panfish and walleye, but poor for northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nFish shelter, usually provided by natural vegetation, was noticeably lacking. <br> \nCrappies and bluegill were found to be infested with yellow grub at the time of the survey. <br> \n <br> \nLake Stella will be managed as a walleye lake and certain conditions and environment will be improved.  Control of rough fish is to be continued, along with heavy stocking of walleye fingerlings in certain years.</p>",
