                "narrative": "<p>The walleye and northern pike populations of Lake Calhoun exhibited increases in relative abundance since the 1996 population assessment. Walleye were sampled at the highest level for number per gill net ever recorded. The average sized walleye observed was 16.4 inches and 1.7 pounds. Approximately 15 percent of the overall catch measured 20.0 inches or longer. Northern Pike were sampled in the highest abundance since 1982 and the average fish was about 3.8 pounds. Approximately 53 percent of the pike captured were 25.0 inches or longer. Only two Hybrid Muskies were captured and neither one was of the minimum harvest size of 40.0 inches in length. Growth rates for all three primary predator species was found to be above average. Few largemouth bass were sampled but anglers continue to report good bass fishing in Lake Calhoun. Bluegill and black crappie were present in above average numbers in the trap net samples, but they averaged small in size. Bluegill averaged 5.5 inches and one-sixth pound and black crappie averaged 6.5 inches and one-seventh of a pound per fish. Yellow perch were sampled at median levels of abundance and averaged 7.4 inches in length. Growth rates for bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch were found to be average. White sucker and yellow bullhead were also present in normal abundance.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Calhoun is one of the Minneapolis chain of lakes including Cedar, Lake of the Isles and Harriet.  Calhoun offers a quality multi-species fishery with many shore-fishing locations and in-lake vegetation lines, points and bars to fish.  Boating is limited to electric motor propelled or motor-less boats.Walleye and hybrid muskellunge are the primary management species in Lake Calhoun.  Walleye are less abundant, larger, and older than they were in the 2000 survey.  The catch of 2.3 per gillnet is between 25th percentile and 50th percentile levels for this lake-type.  The population is strongly represented by the 1999 year-class of walleye that were stocked as yearlings.  Mean length and weight is 18.9 inches and 2.6 pounds.  The largest individual was 24.7 inches and 5.8 pounds.  The mean age increased from 3.9 years in 2000 to 4.3 years in 2003.  Growth rates are above average for this lake-type.No hybrid muskellunge or pure strain muskellunge were sampled in gillnets, as is common, although one yearling was caught in a trapnet.  Two individuals were found dead and decaying.  Hooking mortality appeared to be the cause of death.  No length at age information was recoverable, growth rates have been below average in the past.Northern pike are Calhoun's most abundant predator species sampled in survey nets.  Pike are slightly more abundant and smaller than they were in the 2000 survey.  The catch of 3.9 NOP per gillnet is just above 50th percentile levels for this lake-type.  Six different year-classes of fish are represented in the sample of the population.  Mean length and weight is 24.1 inches and 3.5 pounds.  The largest individual was 35.0 inches and 10.6 pounds.  Growth rates have slowed to slightly below average for this lake-type.Largemouth bass may be the most sought after species in Calhoun, however, they are not well sampled in survey nets.  Five young-of-the-year were caught in seine hauls indicating successful natural reproduction.  Anglers report a quality fishery with catches good in both numbers and size.Bluegill abundance is lower than in the 2000 survey, at which time it was near historical highs.  The trapnet catch was 74 per net, which is above the 75th percentile level for this lake-type.  Average size has been decreasing since 1992.  Mean length and weight is 5.2 inches and 0.10 pounds.  Only about 1 in ten are larger than 6 inches.  The largest bluegill captured was 6.9 inches.  Four year-classes from 1998 to 2001 were strongly represented in the catch.  Growth rates are slightly below average for this lake class.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were also sampled in above average numbers.Yellow perch abundances have fallen precipitously since the 2000 survey at which time they were at historical highs (48 per net).  The 2003 gillnet catch of 4.3 per net is between the 25th and 50th percentile levels.  Mean length is 6.7 inches with about 1 in 5 larger than 8 inches, an improved size structure compared to 3 years ago.  Growth rates are about average.Black crappie abundance is about average for this lake type.  The 2003 trapnet sample mean length and weight were 6.1 inches and 0.11 pounds, while less than 1 in 10 was larger than 8 inches.  The largest individual sampled was 9.1 inches.  The population is strongly represented by the 2000 year-class and the 2001 year-class to a lesser degree.  Growth rates are below average.Yellow and black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, and carp were also present in the survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Calhoun is a 401-acre lake located in south Minneapolis that is primarily managed as a Muskellunge and Walleye fishery.  A boat launch operated by the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board is located on the northeast corner of the lake, with a limited amount of street parking nearby.  From 2013 and still in place as of this report (early spring 2015), city-imposed inspections for aquatic invasive species include evening / overnight ramp closures.  Additionally, there is a fishing pier and ample shore fishing opportunities as the lake is encircled by bike and pedestrian paths. Motor use is restricted to electric-only; other motors may remain attached but must be propped up.  A population assessment was conducted during the summer of 2014 to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \n2014's gill net catch of 1.9 Walleye per gill net was below average for this type of lake.  Few large Walleyes were sampled, but the average size was good (16.6 inches and 1.68 pounds).  Sixty-three percent of the sampled fish exceeded 15 inches in length.  Walleye growth was average when compared to similar lakes; fish reached 13.8 inches by age 3 and 18.5 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of 5.7 Northern Pike per gill net is above average.   Additionally, Northern Pike displayed a good size structure, with an average length and weight of 23.2 inches and 3.06 pounds.  Eighty percent of the measured fish were longer than 21 inches, and 12% were longer than 28 inches.  Ages 1-7 were sampled, and the fish are growing at a fast rate for this Lake Class. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance remains low, at 2.4 fish/ gill net in the 2014 survey.  The fish averaged 7.0 inches and 0.17 pounds.  Ten percent of the sample was longer than 8 inches and the largest fish measured 8.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAt 41.6 fish per trap net, Bluegill relative abundance was above median levels for this type of lake.  Sampled Bluegill averaged 5.9 inches and only 3 percent of the catch exceeded 7.0 inches.  The population is dominated by small individuals where fish reached an average length of 6.2 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2014, 1.1 Yellow Perch per gill net were caught, which is low for this Lake Class.  None of the sampled fish exceeded 8 inches, and the average size was 6.2 inches and 0.10 pounds.  <br> \n  <br> \nOther fish sampled during this survey included Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, Bowfin and Common Carp. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye and tiger muskellunge are the primary management species in Lake Calhoun.  Walleye were less abundant, smaller and younger than in the 2003 survey.  The catch of 1.2 per gillnet is above the 25th percentile level for this lake class.  Mean length and weight is 18.2 inches and 3.9 pounds.  As in the 2003 survey, the population is well represented by the 1999 year-class of walleyes stocked as yearlings (35% of the catch), but 53% of the sample consisted of Age-II walleyes stocked as fingerlings in 2003.  These 2003 year-class walleye average 10 inches.Hybrid or tiger muskellunge are infrequently sampled with standard survey gear, however, 2 were sampled in this survey.  The mean length and weight from combined gear-types was 23.1 inches and 3.3 pounds.  One individual was 29.9 inches and 6.1 pounds and originated from the 2002 year-class.  The other was 16.3 inches and 0.6 pounds and was Age-I.  Growth rates are about average.Northern pike are less abundant larger and older than they were in the 2003 survey.  The catch of 2.6 per gillnet is between 25th percentile and median levels for this lake type.  Mean length and weight is 26.9 inches and 5.0 pounds.  Pike average age is 4.6 years due to a strong 2000 year-class (constituting 45% of the sample).  Black crappie trap net abundance is just above median levels for class 24 lakes.  The average length is 6.8 inches.  Only 3 crappie sampled were larger than 8 inches.  The average age increased from 3.2 years in 2003 to 3.8 years and growth rates did not change substantially from the last survey.The bluegill size structure in Calhoun continues to be poor.  They are abundant in 75th percentile levels.  The catch of 65.4 per trap net is lower than that of the 2003 and 2000 at which time catches were quite high.  Average length and weight is up slightly but is still only 5.6 inches and 0.11 pounds (9.1 to the pound).  Growth rates are slightly below average as they were in 2003.Yellow perch abundance increased slightly from the 2003 survey after precipitously declining from historic highs in 2000.  The catch of 6.4 per gillnet is below median levels.  Mean length is 6.3 inches with no individuals over 8.2 inches.  Perch in Calhoun are hence valuable as a forage source but they are of little interest to anglers looking for a harvest.  Growth rates are slightly below average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye population of Lake Calhoun exhibited a significant increase in relative abundance by nearly doubling the gill net catch rate for this species since the 1996 assessment. This is the highest catch rate ever observed in fisheries assessments for walleye since the onset of management for this species in this lake. The average size walleye observed was 17.6 inches in length and 2.1 pounds. Approximately 25.0 percent of the overall walleye catch measured 20.0 inches or longer. Northern pike (3.0 fish/set), while sampled within normal levels of abundance for a lake of this type, exhibited a decrease in gill net catch rate from that observed in 1996. The average northern pike was about 25.6 inches in length and 4.3 pounds.  Better than one in every five northern pike captured in the 2000 assessment of the fish population measured 28.0 inches or longer. No hybrid muskies were captured, but several small adult Muskellunge from recent stockings were captured that averaged 25.6 inches in length. Growth rates for northern pike and walleye were found to be above average. Few largemouth bass were sampled, but some anglers continue to report good fishing for this species in Lake Calhoun.     Bluegill and black crappie were present in relatively high numbers in the trap net samples, but they averaged small in size. Bluegill averaged 5.3 inches and black crappie averaged 6.1 inches in length. Yellow perch were sampled at the highest levels of abundance observed for this lake since 1972, and they averaged 6.5 inches in length. Growth rates for bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch were found to be average. White sucker and yellow bullhead were also present, but in relative low abundance in the sampling gear.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bde Maka Ska is a 419-acre, Class 24 lake located in south Minneapolis that is primarily managed for its Muskellunge and Walleye fisheries.  A boat launch operated by the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board is located on the northeast corner of the lake, with a limited amount of street parking nearby. There is also a fishing pier and ample shore fishing opportunities as the lake is encircled by a bike path and city park. Motor use is restricted to electric only; other motors may remain attached but must be propped up.  Bde Maka Ska is infested with zebra mussels and Eurasian watermilfoil.  Since 2013, city-imposed inspections for aquatic invasive species included evening / overnight ramp closures.  A Standard Survey was conducted during the summer of 2019 to describe the populations of game fish in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nFew Walleye were caught in 2019.  The fish ranged between 16.1 and 21.0 inches, and the average size was 18.7 inches and 2.27 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Muskie sampling did not occur in 2019, one fish was incidentally captured in the gill net.  The fish was 50 inches long and released back into the lake.  Targeted sampling for Largemouth Bass was also not conducted in 2019.  However, two fish were incidentally caught in the gill nets, of lengths 14.4 and 20.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Northern Pike have not been abundant in Bde Maka Ska.  However, in 2019, the amount of Northern Pike sampled was over three times any value measured since 1987.  The fish ranged in size from 9.5 inches to 34.3 inches, and the average size of northern was 22.2 inches and 2.7 pounds.  With 54% of the population being smaller than 22 inches, Bde Maka Ska would be an ideal lake for anglers hoping to maximize their harvest under the new Northern Pike regulation.  Up to 10 fish under 22 inches can be harvested, as well as 2 over 26 inches.  All fish between 22 and 26 inches must be immediately released.  With 26% of the fish exceeding 26 inches, anglers have a good chance to harvest larger fish as well.  The largest Northern Pike sampled in 2019 was 34.3 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nFew Black Crappie were sampled in 2019, and their size was modest.  Average length was 7.6 inches and the largest fish was 9.5 inches.  Bluegill are highly abundant in the lake, and quality-sized fish can be found.  Twenty percent of the catch exceeded 7 inches and the largest fish was 8.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during this survey included Yellow Perch, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish,  and Common Carp.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye relative abundance was similar to previous assessments.  The gillnet catch of 1.4 fish/net was above the 25th percentile for similar lakes.  Few large walleyes were sampled, but the average size was good (17.0 in).  This was likely an artifact of the age classes sampled.  Despite historically consistent stocking efforts only four year-classes were sampled with the oldest individual age 6,.  The strong 1999 year-class of walleyes sampled in surveys during 2003 and 2005 appeared to no longer be evident in the walleye population of Lake Calhoun in 2010.  Walleye growth was slow when compared to similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundances have historically been below the 50th percentile for similar lakes.  The gillnet catch of 2.5 fish/net was the lowest abundance observed in the previous five assessments.  Northern pike size structure was good, with an average length of 17.8 inches.  The average length of adult northern pike in Lake Calhoun is likely larger than this value since numerous small, immature northern pike were unusually sampled during this assessment.  The low abundance of northern pike in Lake Calhoun allowed for fast growth of this population.  Ages 3-6 were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass relative abundance (28.8/hr of energized time) and size (12.1 in; 1.1 lbs) were near average for area lakes.  The largest individual captured was 18.3 inches and 4.1 pounds.  Largemouth bass recruitment was consistent with 8 year-classes sampled.  Growth was slightly below the average for similar lakes with fish reaching an average of 14.5 inches by age 6.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie relative abundance has been decreasing since the 2000 Survey, and fell below the 25th percentile for similar lakes in 2010.  Black crappie averaged 7.9 inches.  Recruitment was consistent with 7 year-classes sampled.  Black crappie growth was slower than average, and fish reached an average length of 7.5 inches by age 6.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill relative abundance was above median levels for similar lakes, but has been decreasing since 2000.  Sampled bluegill averaged 5.2 inches with 0.5 percent of the catch exceeding 7.0 inches.  The population is dominated by small individuals where fish reached an average length of 5.9 inches by age 5.  Bluegill growth was slower than average, as was also reported in 2003 and 2005 surveys. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch relative abundance has been declining since highs reported in 1996 and 2000.  Yellow perch average size remained small with only one fish exceeding 7.5 inches.  Yellow perch recruitment appears consistent with 5 year-classes sampled.  Growth was slower than average. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during this survey included hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, green sunfish, bowfin and tiger muskellunge. <br> \n</p>",

THE AVERAGE BLG SAMPLED WAS 6.32 PER POUND, AND THE POPULATION EXHIBITS A TRAPNET PSD= 75.31 AND A RSD=17.28 PERCENT.  GROWTH RATE WAS NORMAL THROUGH AGE 4 AND SLIGHTLY BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGE 5. FEW LMB WERE SAMPLED, BUT GROWTH APPEARS TO BE NORMAL THROUGH AGE 2. SEVERAL LMB YOY WERE CAPTURED IN THE 4 SHORELINE SEINE HAULS.  THREE HSF WERE CAPTURED IN GILLNETS AND ONE OF THE LARGER FISH WAS RELEASED ALIVE.  A FOURTH FISH (36.5 OFFICES AND INCLUDED IN THE GROWTH ANALYSIS. GROWTH RATE WAS FOUND TO BE VERY GOOD WITH TME ATTAINING THE 36 AGE 4+.  THREE OF THE FOUR FISH IN THE SAMPLE WERE FROM THE 1988 YEAR CLASS.  YEP WERE SAMPLED ABOVE ALL MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS AND EXHIBITED ABOVE AVERAGE GROWTH RATE.  THE AVERAGE YEP SAMPLED WAS 6.5 YOY WERE COMMON IN THE SHORELINE SEINE SAMPLING AND WERE ALSO OBSERVED IN THE STOMACHS OF SOME OF THE YEARLING WAE CAPTURED.  THE YEP POPULATION HAS REMAINED HIGH SINCE 1972 IN SPITE OF INCREASING NUMBERS OF VARIOUS PREDATOR SPECIES.  WAE WERE CAPTURED ABOVE LOCAL MEDIAN TRAP AND GILL NET LEVELS FOR NUMBER AND POUNDS PER SET.  GROWTH RATE WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL FOR BOTH MALES AND FEMALES. THE RSD=55.6% FOR SAMPLED WAE.  THE 1985 YEAR CLASS CONTINUES TO BE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE POPULATION.  PMK WERE SAMPLED 2.25 TIMES THE LOCAL TRAP NET MEDIAN WITH THE AVERAGE FISH BEING 5.65 TL AND 6.18 FISH PER POUND.  BLC WERE SAMPLED WELL ABOVE GILL AND TRAP MEDIANS FOR NUMBER (3.7X) AND POUNDS PER SET.  THE AVERAGE BLC CAPTURED WAS 7.63 INCHES TL AND 4.5 FISH PER POUND.  NO INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED ON BLC GROWTH.  ALTHOUGH NO ADULT WHC WERE CAPTURED IN THE STANDARD SAMPLING GEAR, 19 YOY WERE IDENTIFIED IN 3 OF THE FOUR SHORELINE SEINE HAULS.  NO WHC WERE RECORDED IN PREVIOUS SAMPLING YEARS FOR THIS BASIN.  HOWEVER, THEY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN OTHER LAKES OF THIS CHAIN, 51 BLC YOY WERE ALSO CAPTURED DURING SHORELINE SEINING.  CARP WERE SAMPLED BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS FOR ABUNDANCE IN BOTH GILL AND TRAP NETS.  WTS WERE CAPTURED ABOVE LOCAL MEDIAN LEVELS FOR NUMBER AND POUNDS PER SET.  OTHER SPECIES OF FISH SAMPLED INCLUDE BLB, YEB, HSF, AND GSF.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Bde Maka Ska Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting August 18, 2020. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven sites and a 15-foot seine was used to sample 3 sites. Nearshore sampling captured 12 native species of fish and 1 non-native species (Common Carp). Two of these species are intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter and Least Darter) and two species are tolerant of disturbance (Common Carp and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was conducted in conjunction with the targeted survey of the nearshore fish community. Bluegill dominated the trap net catch numbers, but only comprised approximately 32% of total trap net biomass; Northern Pike (33%) and Common Carp (20%) were the other common species by biomass. Of the Bluegills sampled, 51% were between 5 and 7 inches, 7% were over 7 inches and none of Bluegills sampled were over 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore and trap net survey is combined with gill net data from a July 2019 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Bde Maka Ska Lake from this survey is below an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Twin Cities Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. </p>",
