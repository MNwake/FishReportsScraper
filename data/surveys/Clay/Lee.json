                "narrative": "<p>A Targeted survey was completed on Lee Lake on June 14, 2017 to assess the near-shore fish population.  This data will be analyzed in conjunction with the gill net and trap net survey completed in 2015 to provide a complete assessment of the fish community that will be used to evaluate the biological condition of Lee Lake, and contribute to the assessment of the watershed.  Sampling gear utilized during this survey targets fish species not commonly sampled by gill nets and trap nets. <br> \nTen sites within Lee Lake were sampled using backpack electrofishing and shoreline seines.  Electrofishing was conducted at all 10 sites, while difficult sampling conditions prevented the use of seines at three sites.  The shoreline substrate of Lee Lake is primarily soft, with areas of dense submersed vegetation and abundant woody structure.  <br> \nSpecies sampled during this survey included Black Crappie, Bluegill, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, and Yellow Perch.  Numerous crayfish were observed, and there is an abundant native mussel community within Lee Lake.  While the diversity of the fish community is extremely limited within Lee Lake, the results of this survey fall within the normal range for lakes of similar characteristics, and suggest that the lake is not considered to be biologically impaired.   <br> \nConversations with anglers on the lake during the time of this survey suggest good Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass fishing success on Lee Lake.  Preservation of aquatic habitat is extremely important for the long term health of the lake.  Several areas of new construction were observed during this assessment, with alterations to the shoreline habitat including rip-rap, sand blankets, and shoreline vegetation removal.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lee Lake is a 134-acre lake located in eastern Clay County.  For a small lake, it is relatively deep with a maximum depth of 36 feet.  There is a state-owned ramp located on the northwest side of the lake off of Minnesota Highway 32 and 7th Ave south.  A standard fisheries survey was completed in early August 2022 to assess the fish populations.  Lee Lake has reportedly winterkilled in the past, with the last severe winterkill occurring during the winter of 2022 to 2023.  This kill occurred after this survey was completed, so the fish population has changed from what is reported here. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates in gill nets have fluctuated over the years of surveys.  In 2022, catch rates were 7.8 fish per gill net, slightly above the historical average for the lake.  The average length of Northern Pike sampled in 2022 was 21.2 inches and ranged from 16.0 to 27.1 inches.  Walleye gill net catch rates continued to decline and dipped below Lee Lake's historical catch rate in 2022 catching only 1.8 Walleye per gill net.  The historic average catch rate is 2.1 Walleye per gill net.  Walleyes collected in gill nets averaged 18.8 inches long and ranged in size from 10.1 to 24.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 2022 was slightly below average.  Bluegill had an average length of 4.2 inches and ranged from 2.8 to 8.3 inches.  Only 3% of the Bluegills were over seven inches in 2022.  Black Crappie abundance declined from the last survey in 2015.  Crappie measured 5.5 to 9.8 inches and an average length of 7.3 inches.  Largemouth Bass catches at Lee Lake have historically been low.  In 2022, only five fish were sampled.  These fish ranged from 7.1 to 19.8 inches and averaged 12.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch rate (38.7 per net) remained above the historical average of 26.2 per set.  Yellow Perch average length was 6.1 inches with fish up to 9.5 inches measured.  Other species sampled in the 2022 survey included Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A walleye gillnet catch just under the local median indicates a substantial walleye population has been established since 1985, when only one walleye was taken in survey gillnets.   The recent success of walleye fingerling stocking is most likely due to the development of a yellow perch forage base.  Abundant yellow perch were first observed in 1985.  Yellow perch have declined from the high level of 1985 but still remain well above the local median.  The gillnet catch of northern pike has declined to a level equivalent to the local median.  Northern pike continue to maintain an above-average length frequency distribution.  Bluegills have declined dramatically, to a historic low point.  They are currently far below the local median.  Black crappies have also declined significantly but stil remain above the local median.  The average size of black crappies is small.  Although no largemouth bass were taken in survey nets, shoreline seining confirms natural reproduction and local anglers report a significant largemouth bass fishery with many 2-4 lb. fish.  A total absence of bullheads, either historically or presently, makes Lee Lake unique.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lee Lake is a small lake located in eastern Clay County.  Although relatively deep (36 feet) for a small lake, it is a fertile lake that is sharply stratified during the summer months.  This stratification creates a situation where the deep water (below about 15 feet) does not have enough oxygen to support fish.  Lakeshore development in the form of homes and cabins is essentially the same as it was in the 1960s.  However, a large campground on the northeast shore has greatly increased recreational use on Lee Lake in recent years.The fish community of Lee Lake has changed dramatically over time.  Northern pike are a good example, a major increase in catch rates has occurred over the last decade to nearly 18 per gill net or double what is typical in other similar lakes.  The average size was 21 inches.  Predictably, a previously abundant yellow perch population has been reduced to very low numbers, likely by abundant northern pike.The walleye catch rate has also increased in recent years and is currently at five per gill net or near the upper end of what is typical for other similar lakes.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year in Lee Lake.  The present population shows a high percentage of fish in the 15 to 22 inch range.Largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are also present in modest numbers in Lee Lake.  Black crappie fishing is reportedly good at times.  The bluegill population is comprised of mostly smaller fish with an average length of 4.5 inches.  Bluegill and northern pike populations have probably both been impacted by increased fishing pressure and selective harvest (anglers keeping the bigger fish and throwing back the little ones).  Lee Lake is very unusual compared to other western Minnesota lakes in that it has no bullheads.Lee Lake is a small lake in a predominantly agricultural area that has experienced a significant increase in recreational activity.  It also appears to have suffered a decline in water quality in recent years.  Whether this is a result of increased activity, high water eroding shorelines, or nutrient input from some other source, it is critical that shoreland best management practices be implemented and adhered to around Lee Lake in order to prevent further declines in water quality.  These might include: (1)leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, (2)leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail beds, (3)not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4)ensuring compliance of septic systems, (5)stabilizing eroding banks, and (6)utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Lee Lake was conducted on August 5-6, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured ten species of fish including no species that are intolerant of disturbance and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on August 5-7, 2019 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill, Yellow Perch, and Brown Bullhead comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was similar to the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 34 lakes and the average length was 6.1 inches, with only 2% over 7 inches. Conversely, the number of Black Crappie sampled per net was below the 50% quartile for Lake Class 34 lakes.  White Sucker and Brown Bullhead comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2015 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Buffalo River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in Lee Lake appears to be changing even more dramatically than in a typical permanent fish lake.  Many factors can affect fish populations in a lake.  Water levels, pollution, sedimentation, weather, fish stocking (legal and illegal), aquatic vegetation removal, fishing pressure, and several other elements can impact the fish community.  Three that are most recently noticeable on Lee Lake include the illegal introduction of yellow perch, high water levels, and increased fishing pressure generated by the campground.  The long range effects of all three are not yet clear.In the short run, yellow perch have provided forage for northern pike and walleye.  This has led to an increase in abundance of both of those predators in the past ten years.  However, perch have also detrimentally impacted the bluegill (and possibly black crappie) populations.  Panfish populations have decreased dramatically during the past ten years, since perch became abundant.High water levels have also helped to cause the increase in northern pike natural reproduction.  The preferred spawning habitat for northern pike is flooded meadow grasses and more of this type habitat becomes available with high water levels.While no creel survey information is available to quantify an increase in fishing pressure, there is evidence to suggest that pressure has greatly increased in recent years.  A 1976 lake survey reported shoreline development as four homes and two boats.  Fourteen years later, three homes, approximately sixty camper trailers and 46 boats were counted along the shoreline by a fisheries test net crew.  There is also evidence in fish populations themselves.  In 1995, no northern pike older than two years were sampled in test nets.  It is likely that pike are being kept and removed from the lake as soon as they reach what most anglers consider \"keeper\" size.  This is common in heavily exploited lakes.Time will tell how these factors and others will affect the fish community in Lee Lake.  There are several steps that lakeshore owners and other lake users can take to maintain the quality of fishing in Lee Lake.  First, of course, is to clean up after oneself by keeping septic systems functional, not littering, not mowing close to the lakeshore to help prevent erosion, and not fertilizing.  Next, riparian owners can help fish populations by leaving aquatic vegetation intact, especially the important bullrush and cattail stands.  Anglers can benefit the fish community by practicing catch and release.  It's fine to catch and keep a few smaller fish for eating, but, releasing older, sexually mature fish means that natural reproduction will continue as long as spawning habitat is available.  One final way in which anglers can benefit, or at least keep from harming, Lee Lake is to not dump minnow buckets into the lake when done fishing.  Lee Lake is one of very few lakes in this part of the state where there are no bullheads.  Bullheads, carp and several other undesirable fish species have been introduced into lakes in this way.  Besides, it's illegal.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lee Lake is a 134-acre lake located in eastern Clay County.  The maximum depth is 36 feet, which is relatively deep for a small lake.  However, it is a fertile lake that is sharply stratified during the summer months.  This stratification creates a situation where the water below about 15-19 feet does not have enough oxygen to support fish during summer.  Algal blooms are a common occurrence during most summers on Lee Lake.  Lakeshore development in the form of homes and cabins is essentially the same as it was in the 1960s.  However, a large campground on the northeast shore has greatly increased recreational use on Lee Lake in recent years.The fish community of Lee Lake has varied widely over time.  The earliest lake surveys showed few yellow perch, walleye, largemouth bass, and very few northern pike.  Northern pike catches have since experienced several peaks and valleys and the 2005 catch rate was lower than the lake's historical average at 2.7 per gill net.  The average pike length was 24.1 inches.  Predictably, yellow perch catch rates increased modestly in response to decreased pike predation.   Lee Lake is very unusual compared to other western Minnesota lakes in that it has no bullheads.Little natural reproduction of walleyes occurs in Lee Lake.  Walleye fingerlings are regularly stocked to provide fishing opportunities for that species.  Since 1990, test net catch rates have remained near the high end of the normal range compared to similar lakes.  Walleyes sampled in 2005 showed a nice average size of 17.6 inches in length and 2.2 pounds in weight.Largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are also present in modest numbers in Lee Lake.  Black crappie fishing is reportedly good at times although catches were down in 2005.  The bluegill population is relatively abundant and is comprised of mostly smaller fish with an average length of 5.2 inches.  Increased fishing pressure and anglers keeping larger fish and throwing back the little ones have probably negatively impacted bluegill and northern pike populations.  Bluegills over 7.0 inches are rare in this lake.  If anglers want to catch larger fish, they are encouraged to release larger fish and keep smaller ones for eating.Lee Lake is a small lake in a predominantly agricultural area that has experienced a substantial increase in recreational activity.  It also appears to have suffered a decline in water quality in recent years.  It is critical that shoreland best management practices be implemented and adhered to around Lee Lake in order to prevent further declines in water quality.  These might include leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact - especially bulrush and cattail beds, not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, compliance with septic system codes, stabilizing eroding banks with natural vegetation, and following practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality.\"</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lee Lake is a 134-acre, class 34 lake located in eastern Clay County.  Although relatively deep for a small lake (maximum depth of 36 feet), it is a fertile lake that is sharply stratified during summer months.  A large campground on the northeast shore now has approximately 80, semi-permanent, camper trailers that have greatly increased recreational use on Lee Lake.  In addition to the campground, a new Public access has improved the accessibility of the lake for recreational use.  The access is located on the Northwest side of the lake off of Minnesota Highway 32 and 7th Ave south.   During the winter of 2015, concerns were brought to the DNR's attention as the water had turned red.  After some water sampling it was determined that a filamentous blue-green algae was present in the sample.  A few species of this group are planktonic, and at certain times of the year turn the water a blood red color.  After doing a dissolved oxygen test it was determined that the algae was not affecting the amount of oxygen in the water.   Lee Lake was very unusual compared to other western Minnesota lakes in that it had no bullheads sampled until the 2015 survey. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, the Northern Pike catch rate was 9.7 per gill net, up from 2.7 in 2005 and also above the lake's historical average of 7.2 per net.  The mean length of Northern Pike sampled in 2015 was 23.7 inches and lengths ranged from 14.7 to 34.7 inches.  Northern Pike up to eight years old were found.  Lee Lake's Northern Pike exhibited faster than normal growth, with four-year-old Northern Pike reaching 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance as indicated by trap net catches have fluctuated widely in Lee Lake.  The 2015 Bluegill catch rate of only 9.2 fish per trap net indicates a continued fluctuation in the Bluegill population.  This catch rate is far below what was observed in 2005 (31.3 per trap net) and also below the lake's historical average (23.9 per trap net).  Bluegill had a mean length of 7.0 inches and ranged in size from 3.5 to 8.7 inches.  Bluegill growth was faster than that of the previous survey with Bluegills reaching almost seven inches by four years of age.   <br> \n <br> \nGill net catch rates of Walleye have remained above the lake's historic mean of 2.1 per net since 1990.  During this survey, 2.5 Walleyes per gill net were captured.  Walleye had a mean length of 16.2 inches and ranged in size from 9.3 to 27.4 inches.  Walleye up to 14 years old were found, with four year old fish reaching an average length of just over 16 inches.  Now that a functioning public access exists on Lee Lake, fingerling stocking was resumed in 2013.  Future surveys will be used to evaluate the success of this stocking. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Largemouth Bass were stocked in the 1930s, 1980, and 1988, the first bass was not sampled in Lee Lake until 1995 when two were captured.  The 2015 survey sampled 51 Largemouth Bass with various methods.  Average size was 10-12 inches long, depending on the method, with fish up to 17.1 inches being captured.  Largemouth Bass reached 12.3 inches long by the time they were four years old.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catches had declined since 1985.  The Black Crappie catch rate in trap nets of 12.4 found during this survey was the highest recorded for Lee Lake and much above the lake's historical average of 5.2 per trap net.   Black Crappie mean length was 5.3 inches and ranged from 3.9 to 10.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch rate in 2015 was 35.7 per set, which was slightly more than the lake's historical average catch rate.  The mean length of sampled Yellow Perch was 6.5 inches, but some fish up to 9.5 inches were captured. <br> \n <br> \nBrown Bullhead had historically not been present in Lee Lake, but anglers reported catching them in 2014.  In 2015, their presence was confirmed with Brown Bullheads being observed while electrofishing and also captured with both trap nets and gill nets.  Fifty four Brown Bullheads were sampled, ranging in size from 7.9 to 14.4 inches long.  It is unknown how they got into Lee Lake, but it is likely it occurred during a high water event when one of the streams connected Lee Lake to wetlands upstream. <br> \n  <br> \nLee Lake is a very small lake that is experiencing increasing levels of recreational activity.  It is one of the first lakes encountered by Fargo/Moorhead metropolitan residents traveling east towards Detroit Lakes.  Observations by fisheries field crews suggest a decline in water quality from earlier surveys.  However an improving trend has been seen in the last two surveys.   Fish survey water quality data is only a snapshot collected in late July, but it is difficult to ignore declining water clarity readings, progressively more water that does not contain sufficient oxygen during summer stratification, and increasing phosphorus concentrations.  Practicing selective fish harvest, following the correct steps to prevent the spread of invasive species, and protecting water quality by using shoreland and watershed best management practices are highly encouraged. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Some new development of lakeshore has occurred since 2011, but overall, the shoreline is the same as it was in the 1960's.  Anglers reported poor fishing on Lee Lake and questioned the possibility of winterkill occurring during the winter of 2022-2023.  This targeted fisheries survey was completed in August 2023 to assess the status of the fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nOne gill net and five special trap nets were used to sample Lee Lake.  Both gears captured Black Bullhead, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch.  The average size of Northern Pike sampled was 16 inches while the average size of Yellow Perch was 6.5 inches. No Bluegill or Largemouth Bass were captured or observed in shallow water.  As a result, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie were reintroduced during 2023.  Angling opportunities for Northern Pike are still available, but it will take a few years to have quality fishing for other species.</p>",

Northern pike numbers are above medians and size acceptable.  Black crappie numbers are up significantly with a resultant decline in average size.  Walleye population has apparently not responded to stocking.  However, the recent introduction of yellow perch may change that.</p>",
