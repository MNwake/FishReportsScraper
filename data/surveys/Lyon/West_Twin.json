                "narrative": "<p>West Twin is a 232 acre lake, has a maximum depth of 10.0 and is located near Florence in Lyon County.  The lake has been aerated with a helixor aeration system since 1985.  A full survey was conducted on the lake in 2005.  Fourteen different types of vegetation were sampled during the survey.  Vegetation is extremely important in lakes because it provides cover, habitat, and keeps water clear by using up nutrients.  An up to date management plan will be written in the spring of 2006.  The lake presently does not have a public access, however the Trails and Waterways Unit is in the process of purchasing some property to develop one.  Adult northern pike and walleye along with walleye fry were stocked in West Twin in 1988.  Black crappie fingerlings were stocked in 1989 and walleye fry were stocked in 1991, when a change in the legal definition of public access precluded further stocking.Yellow perch catch rates were very high in West Twin.  We caught 230.0 fish per net during the 2005 survey.  We would expect, for lakes similar to West Twin, to catch anywhere from 2.6 to 25.0 fish per net.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 5.2 to 13.2 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  The majority of the fish caught were hatched in 2003.  Twelve of the yellow perch caught were over 12 inches in length.Bluegill numbers are low in West Twin but the two caught in our nets were 9.2 and 10.2 inches in length.  Two fish were also caught in the last survey in 1986.Black bullhead catch rates were what we would expect for lakes like West Twin.  Length of black bullhead caught in trap nets ranged from 5.4 to 10.6 inches in length.The only other species of fish caught during our survey was green sunfish.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of West Twin Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing and a 15-foot seine were used to sample ten stations.  Nearshore sampling captured eight species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and three that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates West Twin Lake is in poor health as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Redwood River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

The lake has been aerated with a helixor aeration system since 1985 to reduce the frequency and/or severity of winterkills.  A Lincoln County ordinance restricts motor use on West Twin Lake to protect the diverse aquatic plant community that is present.  West Twin Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch, and secondarily for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass.   An electrofishing survey was conducted the week of May 17, 2016 to monitor the Largemouth Bass population.  The gill net and trap net portion of the survey will be completed in 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016, Largemouth Bass were captured at a rate of 124.3 per hour, which is nearly two-times greater than the 2012 catch rate of 65.8 per hour.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 2.8 to 19.5 inches and averaged 9.6 inches (PSD=7, PSD-P=4).  Age-4 Largemouth Bass from 8.5 to 11.0 inches in length were the most abundant, comprising 82 percent of the sample.  Five other age classes were present including age- 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 Largemouth Bass.  Condition of Largemouth Bass was high, as mean relative weight was 115, indicating that prey abundance is high.  The population is maintained through natural reproduction, as indicated by the presence of several year classes.  The management goal was met because a self-sustaining Largemouth Bass population is present in West Twin Lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Twin Lake is a 232-acre lake, has a maximum depth of 10.0 feet and is located near Florence in Lyon County.  A Lincoln County ordinance restricts motor use on West Twin Lake to protect the diverse aquatic plant community that is present.  West Twin Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch, and secondarily for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass.   A survey was conducted the week of June 12, 2017 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and six trap nets. An electrofishing survey was conducted the week of May 17, 2016 to monitor the Largemouth Bass population. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Northern Pike catch rate was 4.5 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net), and is the highest observed catch rate for this lake.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 22.5 to 32.5 inches and averaged 27.9 inches.  West Twin Lake has been a popular destination for spearers because of its clear water during the winter.  To bolster the Northern Pike population, 180 adult Northern Pike were stocked during December of 2017.  Beginning on the 2018 fishing opener, the Northern Pike daily limit changes to 2, and all Northern Pike less than 24 inches need to be released. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were captured at a rate of 126.0 per gill net, which is high compared to similar lakes in the area.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.4 to 11.1 inches and averaged 8.7 inches.  West Twin should be a good perch angling destination for the next couple of years.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016, Largemouth Bass were captured at a rate of 124.3 per hour, which is nearly two-times greater than the 2012 catch rate of 65.8 per hour.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 2.8 to 19.5 inches and averaged 9.6 inches.  Age-4 Largemouth Bass from 8.5 to 11.0 inches in length were the most abundant, comprising 82 percent of the sample.  Five other age classes were present including age- 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 Largemouth Bass.  The population is maintained through natural reproduction, as indicated by the presence of several year classes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Bluegill catch rate was 3.0 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes.  While not highly abundant, several year classes of Bluegill were present, with lengths ranging from 3.4 to 9.6 inches and averaging 6.1 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Black Bullhead (91.5 per gill net), Walleye (1.5 per gill net), and White Sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on West Twin Lake was conducted on August 24, 2018 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot beach seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with one site sampled from the boat.  Soft sediments with abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 7 native species of fish with Bluegill, Green Sunfish, and Yellow Perch most commonly sampled. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Banded Killifish, and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish, Black Bullhead).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for West Twin Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes, indicating poor water quality and habitat conditions exist for aquatic life.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Redwood River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nWest Twin is a 232-acre lake, has a maximum depth of 10.0 feet, is a class 43 lake, and is located near Florence in Lyon County.  West Twin Lake has a small contributing watershed (all land that drains water to the lake) relative to the size of the lake.  Outboard and inboard motors are prohibited in West Twin Lake.  The lake has been aerated with a helixor aeration system since 1985.  Fisheries management has been limited on West Twin due to a lack of a public access until the late 2000's; but northern pike, walleye, bluegill, and black crappie were stocked from 1979 to 1991.  Since a severe winterkill in 1991 that left only yellow perch, West Twin was restocked with northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill in 2008, 2009, and 2010.  Currently, West Twin is managed for northern pike, yellow perch, bluegill, and largemouth bass.   A population assessment with 2 gill nets and 6 trap nets was conducted in June of 2012 to assess the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch rate in 2012 was 4.0 fish per net.  The current catch rate of 4.0 fish per gill net is lower than desired, but is still within the normal range of 1.1 to 8.0 fish per gill net for class 43.  Three additional northern pike were caught in the trap nets.  The length of fish caught in the gill nets and trap nets ranged from 20 to 35 inches with an average length between 25 (trap nets) and 27 (gill nets) inches.  The size structure of the northern pike favored bigger fish with 45% of the fish in the sample equal to or larger than 28 inches.  The overall condition of the fish in the sample of gill nets and trap nets was good and indicated a population that is foraging successfully.  The outlook of the northern pike population is bright.  The population appears to be on the rise, and barring any major winterkill or summerkill conditions, the catch rates in the future DNR surveys should be at or above the long-term management goals set by the DNR because good quality habitat and plentiful forage exist in West Twin Lake.  Northern pike anglers will find plenty of fish to satisfy, but careful harvest should be done because northern pike populations can be easily overharvested which can set back their recovery in West Twin Lake.  Catch-and-release fishing for larger northern pike (greater than 28 inches) will help to preserve the fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population is doing well in West Twin Lake. The 2012 survey catch rates were 151.5 fish per gill net and 4.0 fish per trap net, both of which were above the normal ranges for class 43 (gill nets = 2.7 to 25.0 fish per net;  trap nets = 0.3 to 3.8 fish per net).  Yellow perch in the gill nets and trap nets had an average length of 8.5 inches, ranging from 5 to 11 inches.  The size structure analysis indicated a balanced size structure of yellow perch with a good number of small and large fish present.  Additionally, the overall health of the fish in the sample was good.  It appears that yellow perch are the most dominant and possibly the most stable component of the fish community in West Twin Lake at the current time.  Fishing for yellow perch in West Twin Lake should be good to very good over the next 2 to 3 years and anglers should have little trouble catching enough to satisfy when the bite is hot.      <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population has done very well in West Twin Lake since the DNR stocked adult fish in 2008 and 2009.  The bluegill trap net catch rate was 5.7 fish per trap net which was within the normal range of 1.2 to 20.0 fish per trap net for class 43.  Bluegill in the trap nets were 3 to 9 inches with an average length of 7 inches.  The large bluegill in the sample were from the 2009 stocking, but the smaller fish in the sample were naturally reproduced, which is an encouraging sign.  The size structure analysis indicated a population of bluegill that is dominated by fish in the 6 to 8 inch range, which is a good size to fish for.  The overall health of the fish in the sample was excellent, and their health is the best indicator of how well the bluegill are doing in West Twin Lake.  The bluegill population in West Twin Lake appears ready to expand, and given the health of the fish in 2012, it is safe to say that bluegill are starting to thrive.  Bluegill anglers should be happy with the quality of fish in West Twin Lake, and action for the fish can be good.    <br> \n <br> \nLARGEMOUTH BASS <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are also doing very well in West Twin Lake.  Largemouth bass are not easily sampled with trap nets or gill nets; in fact only 1 was caught in the net sample.  Therefore, largemouth bass are sampled with spring night electrofishing in lakes that the DNR manages for largemouth bass.  In the spring of 2012, 73 largemouth bass were caught in 66 minutes of electrofishing for a catch rate of 65.8 fish per hour.  A catch rate greater than 30 per hour indicates a very abundant population; West Twin had a catch rate of more than twice that amount!  Six age groups of largemouth bass were present in the sample (ages were read from scale samples) with 3 older age groups coming from a stocking of largemouth bass in 2008.  The 3 younger age groups (which were most abundant) are naturally reproduced fish.  Largemouth bass in the electrofishing sample had an average length of 9 inches and ranged from 4 to 19 inches.  The size structure analysis indicated a population that is dominated by larger fish with 75% of the fish being 15 inches or larger.  The overall health of the fish in the sample was very good indicating the population is in very good condition and foraging well.  Additionally, a high overall health value of largemouth bass in the spring (as seen here) indicates that many spawning female fish were most likely captured and full of eggs; this will falsely inflate the size structure values as well as the health values of the population.  However, the largemouth bass population still appears very robust and very healthy with many fish in the sample across a large size range and age range.  Look for the West Twin largemouth bass population to start to dominate the fish community and become a \"diamond in the rough\" for largemouth bass fishing in southwestern Minnesota.  Bass anglers in southwestern Minnesota, especially bank anglers, will find West Twin Lake a fun place to fish.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in West Twin Lake in 2012 include black bullhead, walleye, and smallmouth bass.  Black bullhead are abundant in West Twin Lake and are within the normal range of 30.3 to 150.6 fish per gill net for class 43 with a catch rate of 71.5 fish per gill net in 2012.  Walleye and smallmouth bass are not abundant in West Twin Lake and the fish were most likely illegally stocked into the lake from fish caught in East Twin Lake across the road (both species are present in East Twin Lake).  Black bullhead will continue to persist in West Twin Lake, but the walleye and smallmouth bass will most likely disappear from the lake as those illegally stocked fish die naturally or are harvested.   <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nWest Twin Lake is a gem hidden in rural Lyon County.  The lake has a plentiful population of yellow perch, bluegill, and largemouth bass and is filled with plenty of good habitat to support those fish. The northern pike population appears to be on the rise and the future looks bright.  While West Twin does not allow gas motors to be utilized on the lake, plenty of shore fishing opportunities exist around the lake.  The simple fish community in West Twin Lake, that had only 7 species sampled in 2012, would continue to benefit from best management practices in the watershed.  The in lake habitat in West Twin Lake is good and enhancement of that habitat with water quality and water clarity improvements would continue to help the fish community in West Twin Lake.  Local landowners can \"buy into\" the health of the lake and fish community by implementing best management practices in their farming operation within the watershed through use of setbacks and buffer strips as well as wetland restorations.  This may be a possibility for West Twin Lake as the watershed is small and only a few landowners reside in the watershed.  West Twin Lake is a special lake in southwestern Minnesota and its habitat and fish community should be improved and preserved for future generations.    <br> \n  <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

The seine hauls captured four species of fish, including Black Bullhead (N=3), Bluegill (N=60), Green Sunfish (N=2), and Yellow Perch (N=233).  Electrofishing captured three species of fish, Fathead Minnow (N=7), Green Sunfish (N=59), and Yellow Perch (N=3).  Reproduction exists for some of the species in West Twin Lake as, as young-of-the-year (YOY) Yellow Perch were sampled.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of West Twin Lake.  The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community.  <br> \n <br> \n An assessment of lakeshore habitat on West Twin Lake was conducted on 8/10/2017.  The assessment consisted of 129 survey sites evenly spaced 150 meters around the lake.  The average lake wide habitat score was 57.5(+/- 2.4), indicating overall lakeshore habitat quality was low (50-65).  Sites with low habitat quality are typically developed and have a lower than expected amount of natural habitat. Vegetation has been removed from at least a portion of the shore frontage either in a small percent of all the canopy layers or from a large percent of at least one canopy layer (ex. shrub layer has been removed but trees and natural ground cover remain high).  Approximately 96 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 56.3(+/- 2.1), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 93.3(+/- 0.0).  This habitat survey was designed to provide a means to quantify and compare lakeshore habitat between lakes.  The West Twin Lake shoreline habitat score is lower than the statewide lake score average of 73.6. <br> \n</p>",

A Lincoln County ordinance restricts motor use on West Twin Lake to protect the diverse aquatic plant community that is present.  West Twin Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch, and secondarily for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass.  Despite aeration, dissolved oxygen levels decreased to 0.6 mg/l in March of 2019, below the 2.0 mg/l threshold for many fish species.  At ice-off, anglers reported seeing dead fish at West Twin lake.  To determine if a fish kill occurred during the winter of 2018-2019, an electrofishing survey was conducted on April 26, 2019.  <br> \n <br> \nWest Twin likely experienced a partial winterkill that was not severe, as four game fish species were sampled including Bluegill (46.0 per hour), Largemouth Bass (10.0 per hour), Walleye (2.0 per hour), Yellow Perch (10.0 per hour).  Multiple year classes of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch were observed.  Adults of each species were present and should be able to repopulate the lake without supplemental stocking.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Twin Lake is a 232-acre, shallow southern Minnesota Lake with a maximum depth of 10.0 feet.  The nearest town to West Twin Lake is Florence, approximately 21 miles southwest of Marshall, in Lyon County.  The lake has been aerated since 1985 to reduce the frequency and/or severity of winterkills.  Currently the Balaton Sportsmen's Club uses an \"Ice Eater\" system to aerate the lake.  A County ordinance restricts motor use to electric or paddle only on West Twin Lake to protect the diverse native aquatic plant community that is present.  West Twin Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch, and secondarily for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass.   A fish survey using trap nets and daytime electrofishing was conducted during the summer of 2020.  <br> \n <br> \nFive Northern Pike were caught in six trap nets (0.8 per trap net).  The Northern Pike trap net catch rate was the highest observed for this lake.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from just shy of 20 inches to 30.5 inches and averaged 22.6 inches.  Current southern Minnesota bag limits are 2 Northern Pike over 24 inches in length, so some harvestable fish can be found in West Twin.  In addition to harvestable size Northern Pike, West Twin Lake Northern Pike are heavy bodied healthy looking fish!   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were captured at a rate of 4.8 per trap net, exceeding the upper expected catch rate value for similar shallow lakes (3.76 per trap net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from just under 6 inches to nearly 9.5 inches and averaged 6.8 inches.  Yellow Perch were in fair condition with a somewhat slim body shape.  West Twin Lake is currently dominated by smaller sized Yellow Perch that would benefit from increased prey abundance and some angler harvest to thin the population and reduce competition for food.  Statewide, the MN DNR is researching slow growth and lack of large Yellow Perch presence. More information on this subject may help to boost populations statewide.  The high abundance of Bluegills during the survey may influence Yellow Perch success due to competition.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring 2020, daytime electrofishing of Largemouth Bass resulted in a catch rate of 22 per hour.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from just under 4 inches to just above 16 inches and averaged 11 inches.  The Largemouth Bass do not require stocking and maintain themselves through natural reproduction.  West Twin Lake has excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass that should result in a stable or increasing Largemouth Bass population.  West Twin Lake has the potential to produce big Largemouth Bass, and several have been caught in the past.     <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 Bluegill catch rate was the highest ever recorded for West Twin Lake.  The catch rate of 61.1 per trap net was more than 5 times greater than the previous record of 5.7 per trap net in 2012.  The 2020 catch rate exceeds the upper expected catch rate value for other shallow southern Minnesota lakes (20.0 per trap net).   Several different ages of Bluegill are present, ranging in length from 4.5 to nearly 8 inches with an average just shy of 6 inches.  Condition and health of Bluegill was above average with many plump and potentially fast growing fish!  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Black Bullhead (30 fish with a catch rate of 5.0 per trap net), Green Sunfish (1 fish), and Walleye (7 fish with a catch rate of 1.17 per trap net).  Interestingly, Walleye are not stocked in West Twin Lake and most likely have made their way in via angler stocking or natural reproduction. In 2020 there was evidence of natural reproduction, so a small population of Walleye may persist in West Twin Lake with some really plump and healthy fish present from time to time.    <br> \n</p>",
