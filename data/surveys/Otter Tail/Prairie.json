STOCKING BEING THE SUSPECTED SOURCE OF THE FISH. THERE APPEARS TO BE ADEQUATE NUMBERS OF YELLOW PERCH PRESENT TO SUPPLY A FORAGE BASE, BUT THEIR NUMBERS SHOULD BE MONI- TORED IN THE FUTURE. OXYGEN READINGS TAKEN DURING THE WINTER OF 1985 WERE VERY LOW, LESS THAN 2.0 PPM AT THE AERATION SYSTEM. THESE LOW OXYGEN LEVELS MAY HAVE CAUSED SOME OVER WINTER MORTALITY OF THE OLDER FISH, AGES II AND III THAT WERE STOCKED IN THE FALL OF 1984 AND 1985. THE NET CATCHES SHOW A SHARP REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF WALLEYES THAT ARE REPRESENTED BY THESE YEAR CLASSES.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Adley Lake is a shallow 239-acre eutrophic lake located in southeastern Otter Tail County.  The majority of the lake is less than 10 feet in depth; therefore, the lake does experience some partial winterkill on a periodic basis.  A local sportsmen's club operates an aeration system to help alleviate the winterkill problem.  A public water access is located in a city park along the southeast shoreline.  There are a few private homes surrounding the lake.  The city of Parkers Prairie abuts the north shoreline of the lake.  The secchi disk reading at the time of the survey was 2.6 feet.  Water clarity in this lake often diminishes during the summer months due to plankton and algae blooms.       Hardstem bulrush and cattails are located in several areas around the lake, but are most prevalent in the south basin.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat during all stages of life and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Bulrush and cattail beds are natural shoreline stabilizers, reducing shoreline erosion caused from wave action and they can even absorb pollutants from the water.  Because of their ecological value, bulrush and cattails may not be removed without a DNR permit.       Adley Lake is a popular fishing lake, especially for anglers in southeastern Otter Tail County where the number of lakes is limited.  Fish abundance in Adley Lake can fluctuate due to the potential for periodic winterkill.  Anglers can expect to catch walleye, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and bullhead.       The walleye population is maintained primarily through walleye fingerling stocking.  The 1998 test-net data indicated that walleye abundance was low which prompted the stocking of large fingerlings in hopes that they would be less vulnerable to northern pike predation.  It appears that stocking larger walleye fingerlings has helped reestablish a viable walleye population that will be further improved with future stockings.       The 1998 and 1999 black crappie year classes appear to be very strong and should provide consistently good fishing for several years, with another strong 2002 year class to follow.  The average length of crappies was 8.9 inches and within a year anglers should be catching ten inch fish if exploitation rates aren't too high on these two strong year classes.       Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Fergus Falls Area Fisheries staff conducted a targeted nearshore survey of Adley Lake on August 6th, 2021.  Nearshore sampling captured seven native species of fish including one species that is intolerant of habitat disturbance (Iowa Darter).  The nearshore survey data was combined with standard gill net and trap net survey data from the week of August 3rd to calculate a Fish IBI (FIBI) score for assessing the aquatic life use of Adley Lake.  FIBI Tool 7 was used for scoring, resulting in a FIBI score of 37, which slightly exceeds the impairment threshold value (36) for this tool.  <br> \n     The high proportion of individuals sampled in the nearshore sampling that are classified as vegetative dwelling and the proportion of biomass in the gill nets from top carnivores most positively influenced the FIBI score.  The primary negative influences on the FIBI score are the number of species sampled that are tolerant of stressors and the number of species sampled that are classified as insectivores.  <br> \n     Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Redeye River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore and littoral fish species in Adley Lake was conducted on August 14-15, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations and a 15-foot seine was used at eight stations. Nearshore sampling captured eleven species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Iowa Darter) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured eight species of fish, including none that were intolerant or tolerant of disturbance. Yellow Bullhead and Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey are similar to previous survey findings and indicate that the fish community in Adley Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold determined for similar shallow lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Redeye River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Adley Lake is a shallow 239-acre eutrophic lake located in southeastern Otter Tail County. The city of Parkers Prairie abuts the north shoreline of the lake. The maximum depth of the lake is 20 feet but the majority of the lake is less than 10 feet in depth.  Consequently, the lake is subject to periodic winterkill.  The Parkers Prairie Sportsmen's Club operates an aeration system during severe winters, which has recently minimized the severity of winterkills.  The secchi disk reading during this survey was 4.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 1.5 to 4.0 feet.  Water clarity can be affected by seasonal algae and plankton blooms.   <br> \n     Residential development is minimal  but has been increasing recently.  A public water access is located in a city park along the east shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of gravel and sand.  Hardstem bulrush and cattails are located in several areas around the lake; however, they are most prevalent in the southern basin.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They provide critical spawning and nursery habitat for species of fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and sunfish.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can actually absorb and break down pollutants.  Because of their ecological importance, bulrush and cattails may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Adley Lake is a popular fishing lake, especially for anglers in southeastern Otter Tail County where the number of lakes is limited.  Historically, fish abundance has fluctuated due to periodic winterkill.  The dominant gamefish species are northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. <br> \n     An abundant walleye population exists.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.7 to 27.9 inches with an average length and weight of 15.9 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.8 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     A moderate-density northern pike population exists.  Northern pike ranged in length from 17.2 to 29.3 inches with an average length and weight of 21.3 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 21.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n      Catch and length data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that there is a balanced largemouth bass population.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 5.0 to 17.9 inches with an average length and weight of 10.4 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 12.3 inches at four years of age.      <br> \n     Black crappies have remained consistently abundant over the recent series of surveys.  The average length of black crappie was 7.4 inches.  Age data indicate that the 2009 year class is strong and should provide good angling for several years.   <br> \n     Bluegills have also remained consistently abundant.  Bluegill reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Size structure is also good as forty-three percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.8 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Adley Lake is a shallow 239-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in southeastern Otter Tail County. The city of Parkers Prairie abuts the north shoreline of the lake. The maximum depth of the lake is 20 feet but the majority of the lake is less than 10 feet in depth.  Consequently, the lake is subject to periodic winterkill.  The Parkers Prairie Sportsmen's Club operates an aeration system during severe winters, which has recently minimized the severity of winterkills.  The secchi disk reading was 3.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 1.5 to 4.2 feet.  Water clarity can be affected by seasonal algae and plankton blooms.   <br> \n     Residential development is minimal but has been increasing recently.  A public water access is located in a city park along the east shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of gravel and sand.  Hardstem bulrush and cattails are located in several areas around the lake; however, they are most prevalent in the southern basin.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They provide critical spawning and nursery habitat for species of fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and sunfish.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can actually absorb and break down pollutants.  Because of their ecological importance, bulrush and cattails may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Adley Lake is a popular fishing lake, especially for anglers in southeastern Otter Tail County where the number of lakes is limited.  Historically, fish abundance has fluctuated due to periodic winterkill.  The dominant gamefish species are Northern Pike, Walleye, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 10.0 to 20.2 inches with an average length and weight of 15.4 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.1 inches at three years of age. <br> \n      Northern Pike ranged in length from 16.0 to 33.3 inches with an average length and weight of 22.8 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.   Pike attain an average length of 24.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Black Crappies have remained consistently abundant over the recent series of surveys.  Twenty-one percent of the crappies were 9.0 inches or greater in length.   Age data indicate that the 2013 year class is strong and should provide good angling for several years.   <br> \n     Bluegills have also remained consistently abundant.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Size structure is also good as 34% of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.9 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Adley Lake is a shallow 239-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in southeastern Otter Tail County. The city of Parkers Prairie abuts the north shoreline of the lake. The maximum depth of the lake is 20 feet but the majority of the lake is less than 10 feet in depth. Consequently, the lake is subject to periodic winterkill. The Parkers Prairie Sportsmen's Club operates an aeration system during severe winters, which has recently minimized the severity of winterkills. The secchi disk reading during the 2020 survey was 3.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 1.5 to 4.2 feet. Water clarity can be affected by seasonal algae and plankton blooms.   <br> \n     Residential development is minimal but has been increasing recently. A public water access is located in a city park along the east shoreline of the lake. Shoal water substrates consist primarily of gravel and sand. Hardstem bulrush and cattails are located in several areas around the lake; however, they are most prevalent in the southern basin. These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality. They provide critical spawning and nursery habitat for species of fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and sunfish. They protect shorelines from erosion and can actually absorb and break down pollutants. Because of their ecological importance, bulrush and cattails may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Adley Lake is a popular fishing lake, especially for anglers in southeastern Otter Tail County where the number of lakes is limited. Historically, fish abundance has fluctuated due to periodic winterkill. The dominant gamefish species are Northern Pike, Walleye, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. <br> \n     Walleye abundance in the 2020 survey was equivalent to the historical average. Walleyes ranged in length from 12.2 to 25.2 inches with an average length and weight of 17.7 inches and 2.1 pounds. Walleyes attain an average length of 15.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n      Northern Pike abundance is at a moderate level. Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good. Northern Pike ranged in length from 14.8 to 31.9 inches with an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.1 pounds. Pike attain an average length of 20.0 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Black crappies have remained consistently abundant over the recent series of surveys. Thirteen percent of the crappies were 9.0 inches or greater in length. Age data indicate that the 2018 year class is strong and should provide good angling for several years.   <br> \n     Bluegills have also remained consistently abundant. Bluegill average length was 7.1 inches and 67% of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length. Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare. Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Adley Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2016. Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters. Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations. Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Neascus was noted on a few of the walleyes. The test netting data indicates that lack of proper sized prey may become a problem if the walleye are to grow past the 3 lb. range.  Once the abundance of fathead minnows is reduced, slower growth may occur if a conservative stocking schedule is not followed (once every 3 years). The fathead minnow population should be monitored by seining or trapping during the next survey.</p>",

Compared to the 1986 survey, walleye catch rates are up slightly, while black crappie and black bullhead numbers are up substantially.  <br> \n     The yellow perch gill net catch rate declined considerably since 1986; however, yellow perch numbers in the trap net sample increased considerably.  <br> \n     Walleye aging data indicated that the sample was comprised entirely of age I+ and II+ fish (1986 and 1985 year classes, respectively).  Age and catch data indicate that fingerling stocking is more effective than fry stocking.  Year classes that were stocked as fry, 1983 and 1984, were not represented in the walleye sample.  Controlling the increasing black bullhead population by commercial fishing should be considered. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Adley Lake is a shallow, 239 acre eutrophic lake located in southeastern Otter Tail County.  The maximum depth is 20 feet, but a majority of the lake is less than 10 feet in depth.  The lake is subject to periodic, partial winterkill.  The Parkers Prairie Sportsman's Club operates an aeration system, which has helped to alleviate the winterkill problem.  A public access is located in a city park along the east shore.  Residential development is light, but has increased considerably since 2003.  The city of Parkers Prairie abuts the north shoreline of the lake.  The secchi disk reading during this survey was 2.0 feet.  Water clarity in the lake is often impaired due to seasonal algae and plankton blooms.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of gravel and sand. <br> \n     Hardstem bulrush and cattails are located in several areas around the lake, but are most prevalent in the south basin.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can actually absorb and break down pollutants.  Because of their ecological importance, bulrush and cattails may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Adley Lake is a popular fishing lake, especially for anglers in southeastern Otter Tail County, where the number of lakes is limited.  Historically, fish abundance has fluctuated due to periodic winterkill.  Anglers can expect to catch walleye, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike and bullhead.  <br> \n     The walleye population is maintained primarily through stocking of large fingerlings every other year.  The walleye gill net catch rate was 3.0 per net, which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.7 to 27.8 inches, with an average length and weight of 17.8 inches and 2.2 pounds.   <br> \n     The black crappie trap net catch rate was 24.6 per net, which is the highest recorded in any survey.  The average length of black crappie was 7.8 inches.  Age data indicates the 2004 and 2005 year classes are strong.   <br> \n     The bluegill trap net catch rate was 29.4 per net, which is also the highest recorded in any survey.  The average length of bluegill was 6.8 inches.  Age data indicates the 2002 and 2003 year classes are strong. <br> \n     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",
