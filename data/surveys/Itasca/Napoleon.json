Diverse aquatic plant life can be found along the 2.8 mile shoreline.  A county access is located along the northeast side with limited parking. <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to the previous assessment, the northern pike catch rate was within the expected range for lakes similar to Napoleon.  However, size structure appears moderately poor with an average gill net sampled length of 19 inches.  Lengths ranged from 9 to 30 inches.  Scale analysis indicated that five ages were sampled with fish up to age-5 in the sample.  Growth was slow early but near the statewide average by age-2.  Northern pike averaged 22 inches by age five. <br> \n <br> \nBoth gill nets and trap nets sampled black crappie within the expected range.  The previous gill net catch rate exceeded the expected range, while the trap net catch rate was less than expected.  Lengths ranged from 8-10.8 inches.  The sample size was too small to accurately calculate size structure indices.  Three age classes were identified through scale analysis with fish up to age-5 present in the sample.  Growth was slow for age one and similar to the statewide average for all others.  Black crappie averaged nine inches by age four. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled in trap nets near the low end of the expected range, similar to the previous assessment.  Size structure was moderate with lengths ranging from 3-8.4 inches and an average length of 5.9 inches.  Ages two through nine were present in the sample.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for lake class 28. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers appeared to be down, being sampled in gill nets at a lower rate than the expected range and less than the previous assessment.  Lengths were typically too small to interest most anglers, averaging 6.3 inches.  Trap nets sampled two largemouth bass, one was six inches and the other was 10 inches.  Angler accounts suggest that a fishable population exists, while not well represented in the sample.  Other species sampled include pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",
