                "narrative": "<p>Chisago Lake, which is located in southern Chisago County bordering Chisago City, is a moderately fertile lake just under 900 acres in size.  The shoreline is predominately sand with good water clarity given the area.  The lake is broadly connected to South Lindstrom Lake by a natural channel.  The two lakes are somewhat physically different with South Lindstrom having less shallow water habitat.  However, the fish species composition and abundance are very similar.  The current management plan treats both lakes as one for management purposes with walleye and largemouth bass as the primary management species.A lake survey was conducted during the week of July 18, 2005, to evaluate the current fishery and the management goals for Chisago Lake.  Walleye abundance was normal for the lake type while average size, 20.4 inches and 3.3 pounds, was high.  Walleye numbers have fluctuated far more than in South Lindstrom and appear to be on a down swing.  Since natural reproduction has been limited, the walleye population has been maintained primarily through stocking.  Spring night electrofishing found an excellent abundance of quality sized largemouth bass.  Lengths extended from 7 to 18.5 inches.  Along with South Lindstrom, Chisago was selected for an experimental, 12 inch maximum largemouth bass regulation in 1997.  A high bass population, consistent reproduction, and heavy fishing pressure were deciding factors.  The goal of the regulation is to increase the proportion of bass greater than 13 inches.  Prior to the regulation, only 14% of the sampled bass exceeded this mark.  Post regulation sampling has shown a stepped increase in larger bass with 55% of the 2005 catch over 13 inches.  Night electrofishing is scheduled biennially to evaluate the bass population.  The abundance of northern pike fell in the normal range for the lake class but the average size, at 4.8 pounds, was higher than in most similar lakes.  Measured northern ranged from 19.9 to 35.6 inches.  Bluegill were found at a normal levels while black crappie abundance was high.  Yellow perch, a valuable food source for northern pike and walleye, were found at a normal abundance in 2005 and appear to be on the increase.During a fishing outing, anglers are likely to encounter acceptable numbers of quality sized walleye and northern pike, or an abundance of quality sized largemouth bass.  Good numbers of average sized bluegill and black crappie should keep panfish anglers interested.  The current management goals set for South Lindstrom and Chisago Lakes combined are to develope and maintain a largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate of 110 fish/hour with the highest number of fish in the 13-15 inch range, a walleye gill net catch rate from 3-8 fish/lift with an average size near 2.0 pounds, and a northern pike gill net catch rate of 4.0 fish/lift with an average size near 3.0 pounds.  With the exception of northern abundance, all management goals were met in 2005.  The combined catch rate for largemouth bass was 123 per hour with a mode between 14 and 16 inches.  The combined catch rate for walleye was 4.4/net with an average weight of 2.7 pounds.  Northern pike abundance, 3.7/gillnet, fell just short of the goal but average weight reached 4.7 pounds.  Fishing enthusiasts should remember that harvest of largemouth bass at 12 inches or larger is prohibited and are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the small ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain or enhance the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to experience the excitement of hooking a quality sized fish.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chisago Lake is a moderately fertile 873 acre lake located in southern Chisago County bordering Chisago City.  The lake is broadly connected to South Lindstrom Lake by a natural channel.  The two lakes are somewhat physically different with South Lindstrom having a smaller percentage of littoral (water less than 15 feet deep) acreage (42%) than Chisago (80%). The channel allows fish to migrate freely between the two lakes. Because past surveys and assessments dating back to 1956 indicate similar fish composition and abundance, the two lakes are considered one for management purposes. Currently, the primary management species are Walleye and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Chisago chain of lakes, which also includes South Lindstrom, North Lindstrom, North Center, and South Center, has a history of extreme water level fluctuations. These fluctuations, up to 7 vertical feet, are believed to be due to a net loss of water to groundwater in the system, making the lakes dependent on long term cycles in precipitation.  Water levels increased in 2014 and were almost 4 feet higher than the low water levels recorded in 2009 and 2010. The water levels in 2009 were the lowest they had been in 40 years.   <br> \n <br> \nChisago-South Lindstrom Lake was selected for a special Largemouth Bass regulation due to a 1995 survey that found a high abundance of small bass in both basins. A 12-inch maximum size limit for Largemouth Bass was implemented in March 1997 and was based on the premise that angler harvest was limiting the size structure of the Largemouth Bass population. The long-range goal of the special regulation was to maintain a Largemouth Bass population with a modal length between 13 and 15 inches and an electrofishing catch rate greater than 110 per hour. Post regulation surveys have indicated that the overall population size structure of Largemouth Bass has improved. Nighttime spring electrofishing was conducted on May 28, 2014 to assess the current Largemouth Bass population. A catch rate of 192 fish per hour, was slightly less than the previous assessment in 2010, but was still the second highest catch rate observed in Chisago Lake. The modal length group of Largemouth Bass observed in the electrofishing assessment was 13 inches, and lengths ranged from 7.5 to 17.5 inches.  Currently, the Largemouth Bass population is meeting the objectives of the special regulation.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were down from the 2010 assessment to 2.9 per set with a mean weight of 3.3 pounds, but catch rates were still high when compared to similar lakes in Minnesota. Walleye lengths ranged from 14.1 to 25.7 inches with a mean length of 20.8 inches. Otolith data sorted the twenty-nine aged Walleye into six year classes, with most of the fish corresponding to years with fall fingerling stockings. The 2007 year class (stocked) accounted for 41% of the catch.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch, at 9.0 per set, was high when compared to similar lakes and up from 7.9 in 2010 and 3.3 in 2005. Mean weight was similar and remained high at 3.5 pounds. Northern Pike lengths ranged from 17.1 to 33.9 inches with a mean length of 25.1 inches. The oldest Northern Pike sampled was age-9 and 7 year-classes were represented with the 2009 year class making up 38% of the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled Bluegill at 27.6 fish per set, which was slightly above average when compared to similar lakes. The mean weight, 0.21 pounds, was also slightly above average.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.3 to 8.0 inches with a 6.2 inch mean length. Bluegill 7 inches and greater represented more than 38% of the catch from both gear types, a good ratio for the Chisago Lakes Area. However, not many Bluegill exceeded 8 inches. Pumpkinseed abundance is also high and Pumpkinseed over 8 inches were more numerous than Bluegill over 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie gill net catch rates declined for the fourth consecutive survey to 10.6 per net, but still remained high when compared to similar lakes. Mean weight, based on the trap net catch, was at a new high of 0.31 pounds, but mean weights in both gill and trap nets remained below average. Sampled Black Crappie lengths ranged from 4.0 to 12.2 inches and had a mean length of 7.1 inches, however only a few fish over 9 inches were observed.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers declined from a long time high of almost 14 per gill net in 2010 to 3.2 per gill net during this assessment, which is below average when compared to similar lakes.  Golden Shiner catch rates increased to an all-time high of 9.5 per gill net, and likely provide another important forage for the lakes predator populations. <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for most species in Chisago Lake.  At times fishing pressure on Chisago Lake can be high and anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of Chisago Lake's fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. The current Largemouth Bass regulation is a great example of this. This regulation protects larger fish, which has created excellent catch-and-release angling opportunities for Largemouth Bass larger than 12 inches, while still allowing for harvest of smaller fish. <br> \n <br> \nNon-native invasive species of vegetation are present in Chisago Lake.   Eurasian Watermilfoil was first documented in Chisago Lake in the fall of 2009 and Curlyleaf Pondweed has been present since at least 1969. Anglers and boaters should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. <br> \n <br> \nSome shorelines of Chisago Lake are highly developed, which can put stress on the lake's aquatic habitat and ecosystem integrity.  Environmentally friendly development practices, such as shoreline buffer strips of natural vegetation, are encouraged to help maintain and improve the water quality of Chisago Lake.  Water level fluctuations in the Chisago chain of lakes can leave exposed sediments and if left alone, these areas will naturally vegetate and stabilize the shorelines on their own.  Also, if trees and branches have fallen in the water, consider leaving them where they are to provide important habitat for fish and wildlife that is often missing in highly developed lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chisago Lake and South Lindstrom Lake are broadly connected, and show similar trends in fish numbers in survey work done over the last forty years.  They are managed together, with walleye and northern pike as primary species, and largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie as secondary species.  These lakes have a long stocking history, with mainly walleyes and northerns stocked after 1945.       Walleye stocking was changed from an annual to alternate year stocking in 1994 for cost effectiveness, and to allow for better evaluation of the contribution of stocked walleyes to the population.  Walleye numbers were above average for the lake type in this survey, and normal in average weight.       Northern stocking has been somewhat more erratic than walleye stocking.  Results of this survey suggest that most northerns currently in Chisago Lake are the product of natural reproduction.  The 1992 year class was especially large in Chisago Lake, and in other area lakes.  Northern numbers were normal for the lake type.  Northerns have typically been above average in weight for the lake type.  In this survey, they were average, but this was probably partly because northerns to the large 1992 year class were still fairly small.     Bluegills were normal for the lake type in both numbers and average size in this survey, with a large group in the 6.0 to 7.0 inch range.  Black crappies were normal in number but low in average weight, with a large group in the 5.0 to 5.5 inch range.     Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing, and showed good numbers.  Their length distribution peaked in the 12.0 to 13.0 inch range.  Chisago/South Lindstrom was chosen as a site for a Silverado catch and release bass fishing tournament in 1995.     Seining conducted as part of this survey showed successful largemouth bass, bluegill, and yellow perch reproduction in 1995.-Steve Morse          </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chisago Lake, which is located in southern Chisago County, is a moderately fertile lake just under 900 acres in size.  The lake is largely connected to South Lindstrom Lake by a natural channel.  The two lakes are somewhat physically different in abundance of water depths at fifteen feet or less with Chisago Lake having a larger percentage of shallow water acreage (80%) than South Lindstrom (61%).  However, the fish species composition and abundance are very similar.  The current management plan treats both lakes as one for management purposes with walleye and largemouth bass as the primary management species followed by northern pike, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie as the secondary management species.A fish population assessment was conducted during the week of July 17, 2000 to evaluate the current status of the fishery in Chisago Lake.  Sampling gear types consisted of spring night electrofishing for largemouth bass, gill nets, trap nets, and late summer shoreline seining.  Walleye numbers and average size, at 2.8 pounds, were both above normal for this type of lake.  Abundance has decreased since 1995, but numbers have been above normal since 1990 while the average size has improved.  Lengths of sampled walleye ranged from 12.2 to 28.3 inches with an average length of 19.5 inches.  Spring night electrofishing found an excellent abundance of largemouth bass that had an average size of 1.4 pounds with lengths extending from 5.7 to 19.1 inches.  Since small largemouth with declining numbers of larger fish were characteristic of the largemouth population, Chisago and South Lindstrom Lakes were selected for an experimental regulation as part of a statewide experimental regulations research project.  In 1997, a 12 inch maximum size limit for largemouth bass was put into place and will continue until 2008.  A final analysis will then determine if the regulation should be continued, discontinued, or modified.  The abundance of northern pike was within a normal range while the average weight, at 3.1 pounds, exceeded the norm for this type of lake.  When compared with 1995 data, northern pike numbers were down considerably, but the average size was up from 1995's 2.0 pound average.  Measured northern ranged from 15.8 to 34.4 inches.  Normal growth was determined at all ages for walleye, largemouth bass had above average growth at age one and normal growth thereafter, and northern pike showed normal growth from ages 1-5 and above normal growth at age 6.  Bluegill sunfish numbers were found at a normal abundance level while black crappie numbers were well above normal for lakes of this type.  The average size was determined to be small for bluegill sunfish and normal for crappie.  Both bluegill and crappie numbers have increased since 1995.  Their lengths ranged from 3.5 to 7.6 and 4.9 to 9.3 inches, respectively.  Yellow perch, a valuable food source for northern pike and walleye, were found at a normal abundance level in 2000.  According to previous suveys, perch numbers in the late seventies, eighties, and early ninties were well above what was found in the 2000 survey and sometimes reaching over two times more.  However, since 1995 abundance has increased some while northern pike and walleye numbers decreased.  When yellow perch numbers dropped considerably in 1995, northern pike and walleye numbers were very abundant.  Shoreline seining efforts found excellent natural reproductive success for bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass and some success for black crappie.  The fish population in Chisago Lake was also made up of black, brown, and yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.  When compared to similar lakes, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker were within a normal abundance range while numbers of brown bullhead and dogfish were above normal and black bullhead, common carp, golden shiner, and yellow bullhead were below normal.During a fishing outing, anglers are likely to encounter an abundance of nice sized walleye, a good number of larger northern pike or an abundance of largemouth bass with an increasing likihood of catching a quality sized bass.  Currently, a good number of smaller bluegill sunfish and larger black crappie should keep panfish anglers entertained.  The current management goals set for Chisago and South Lindstrom Lakes combined are to develope and maintain a largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate of 110 fish/hour with the highest number of fish in the 13-15 inch range, a walleye gill net catch rate from 3-8 fish/lift with an average size near 2.0 pounds, and a northern pike gill net catch rate of 4.0 fish/lift with an average size near 3.0 pounds.  The 2000 assessment reports largemouth bass numbers (78.6 fish/hour) a bit below the future goal, but the highest number of largemouth in any length group were from 13.0 to 13.9 inches followed by the 14.0 to 14.9 inch length group.  Both walleye and northern pike catch rates and average weights found in 2000 completely satisfy the above stated goals.  Fishing enthusiasts should remember that harvest of largemouth bass at 12 inches or larger is prohibited and are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the small ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain or enhance the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to experience the excitement of hooking a quality sized fish.  Since Chisago Lake lies within a watershed that has a lot of urban/residential development, and some agricultural crop land the lake is subject to some degree of nutrient input.  Because nutrient loading can influence a lakes water quality, additional nutrient input may decrease this lakes water quality and ultimately its overall health.  Land users within the watershed and shoreline property owners can prevent or maintain the current water quality by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips along the shoreline of lakes with native plants, updating outdated or failing septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns, gardens or crop land, utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removel or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chisago Lake, which is located in southern Chisago County bordering Chisago City, is a moderately fertile lake just under 900 acres in size.  The shoreline is predominately sand with good water clarity given the area.  The lake is broadly connected to South Lindstrom Lake by a natural channel.  The two lakes are somewhat physically different with South Lindstrom having less shallow water habitat.  However, the fish species composition and abundance are very similar.  The current management plan treats both lakes as one for management purposes with walleye and largemouth bass as the primary management species. <br> \n <br> \nA population assessment was conducted during the week of August 2, 2010, to evaluate the current fishery and the management goals for Chisago Lake.  Walleye average size, 18.9 inches and 2.6 pounds, and abundance was high for the lake type.  Walleye numbers have fluctuated far more than in South Lindstrom and appear to be climbing.  Since natural reproduction is limited, the walleye population is maintained through fingerling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night electrofishing found an extremely high abundance of largemouth bass.  Lengths extended from 4.8 to 18.6 inches.  Along with South Lindstrom, Chisago was selected for an experimental, 12 inch maximum largemouth bass regulation in 1997.  A high bass population, consistent reproduction, and heavy fishing pressure were deciding factors.  The goal of the regulation is to increase the proportion of bass greater than 13 inches.  Prior to the regulation, only 14% of the sampled bass exceeded this mark.  Post regulation sampling has shown an increase in larger bass with 36% of the 2010 catch exceeding 13 inches.  Night electrofishing is scheduled biennially to evaluate the bass population. <br> \n <br> \nThe abundance of northern pike has increased since 2005 but pike numbers and average size remain in the normal range for the lake class.  Thirty percent of the northerns captured were more than 26 inches in length.  Bluegill and black crappie were once again present at normal and high levels respectively.  Both species were larger on average than in most previous assessments. <br> \n <br> \nDuring a fishing outing, anglers are likely to encounter acceptable numbers of quality sized walleye, northern pike, and an abundance of various sized largemouth bass.  Good numbers of bluegill and black crappie should keep panfish anglers interested with sizes exceeding most lakes in southern Chisago County.  The current management goals set for South Lindstrom and Chisago Lakes are to maintain a largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate of 110 fish/hour with a 13-15 inch length frequency mode, a walleye gill net catch rate from 3-8 fish/lift with an average size near 2.0 pounds, and a northern pike gill net catch rate of 4.0 fish/lift with an average size near 3.0 pounds.  With the exception of the bass modal length, all management goals were met in 2010.  The catch rate for largemouth bass was 220 per hour with a mode between 10 and 11 inches.  The combined catch rate for walleye was 6.5 per set with an average weight of 2.6 pounds.  And, the northern pike catch rate and mean weight were 7.6 per net and 3.3 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should remember that the harvest of largemouth bass 12 inches or larger from South Center Lake is prohibited.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    In July 1990, a lake survey was conducted on Chisago Lake.  To determine the status of the fish populations, ten gillnets and eight trapnets were set and three shoreline stations were seined.  Based on the results of these efforts the status of the fish populations compared to previous surveys and to lakes of the same classification statewide are as follows:\n  The walleye net catch (6.60/set) was substantially higher than the statewide median catch (2.28/set) and was above the third quartile (4.00/set).  The 1990 walleye net catch was the highest ever recorded for Chisago Lake and represents a real increase in walleye abundance since the previous survey.  The walleyes that were captured ranged from 6.5 to 27.9 inches in total length with a median length group of 19.0 to 19.9 inches and an average weight of 3.11 pounds.  Age analysis determined that these fish ranged in age from two to twelve years with four year olds representing 40 percent of the catch.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were slightly above values typical for walleyes throughout the state, indicating slightly better than average growth.  The walleye population in Chisago Lake is composed primarily of stocked fish.  Limited natural reproduction may exist in Chisago Lake as was indicated by the presence of five year old fish when no walleyes from the 1985 year class were stocked.  \n  The northern pike net catch (4.20/ set) was higher than the statewide median (3.43/ set) but remained below the third quartile (6.50/ set).  The 1990 northern pike net catch was higher than the net catch of the previous survey in 1985 (2.00/ set).  The 1990 net catch indicated a real increase in northern pike abundance from the previous survey.  The northern pike ranged in length from 16.0 to 33.9 inches with a median length group of 26.0 to 26.9 inches and an average weight of 4.35 pounds.  Age analysis determined that captured fish were from two to seven years old with five year old fish representing 54 percent of the catch.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were just above average for northern pike throughout the state, indicating slightly better than average growth.  Northern pike were apparently self-sustaining in Chisago Lake as indicated by rather consist year classes without stocking.\n  The bluegill net catch (70.00/set) was higher than the statewide median (21.79/set) and was well above the third quartile (37.19/set).  The 1990 bluegill catch was higher than the net catch of the previous survey (37.71/set), but remained within the range of values from other, previous surveys.  The sub-sample of bluegills that were measured (76 of 560 captured) ranged in length from 3.0 to 7.4 inches with a median length group of 6.0 to 6.4 inches and an average weight of 0.18 pounds.  Age analysis estimated that fish ranged in age from two to seven years with four and five year old fish representing 61 percent of the catch.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were slightly lower than typical of bluegills throughout the state, indicating slightly below average growth.  Natural reproduction was evident from the abundance of young-of-the-year and juvenile bluegills in the seine catches.\n  Similar to bluegills, the hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish net catches were high.  The pumpkinseed net catch (8.88/set) was higher than the statewide median (2.75/set) and the third quartile (6.79/set).  The pumpkinseed net catch was the second highest ever recorded on Chisago Lake.  Corresponding to the high bluegill and pumpkinseed net catches, the hybrid sunfish net catch (9.25/set) was the highest ever recorded on Chisago Lake.  \n  The black crappie net catch (8.00/set) was above the statewide median (5.86/ set) but remained below the third quartile (15.00/ set).  The 1990 black crappie catch was higher than the net catch of the previous survey (5.71/set), but remained within the range of values from other, previous surveys.  The black crappies ranged in length from 5.0 to 8.9 inches with a median length group of 7.5 to 7.9 inches and an average weight of 0.22 pounds.  Age analysis estimated that fish ranged in age from two to seven years with two and three year old fish representing 89% of the catch.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were lower than typical of black crappies throughout the state, indicating slightly below average growth.  Natural reproduction in Chisago Lake was evident from the consistent year classes.  \n  The yellow perch net catch (11.90/set) was lower than the statewide median (12.75/set) but remained above the first quartile (4.91/set).  The 1990 yellow perch catch was the highest ever recorded for Chisago Lake although the catch was just above that recorded in other surveys.  The sub-sample of yellow perch that were measured (80 of 119 captured) ranged in length from 9.00 to 9.4 inches with a median length group of 6.0 to 6.4 inches and an average weight of 0.12 pounds.  \n  The largemouth bass trapnet catch (0.38/set) was higher than the statewide median (0.25/set) but remained below the third quartile (0.63/set).  The 1990 trapnet catch of largemouth bass was within the range of values previously recorded in Chisago Lake surveys.  Additionally, the largemouth bass gillnet catch (1.60/set) was higher than the statewide median (0.37/set) and was above the third quartile (0.63/set).  The 1990 gillnet catch was higher than previously recorded for Chisago Lake.  Captured largemouth bass ranged in length from 6.5 to 13.9 inches with a median length group of 9.0 to 9.4 inches and an average weight of 0.48 pounds.  Age analysis determined that these fish ranged in age from two to five years with two year olds representing 63 percent of the catch.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were slightly below values typical for largemouth bass throughout the state, indicating slightly below average growth.  Natural reproduction was evident from the presence of 54 young-of-the-year and 4 juvenile largemouth bass in the seine catches.  \n  Seven other species were captured during the survey (bowfin, white sucker, golden shiner, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, green sunfish).  Catch rates of white sucker, brown bullhead, and yellow bullhead were below their respective statewide medians but remained above the first quartile.  The catch rate of black bullhead (0.38/set) was below both the statewide median (5.50/set) and the first quartile (1.00/set).  The catch rates of golden shiner and green sunfish were above their respective statewide medians but remained below the third quartiles.  The bowfin catch rate (1.12/set) was considerably higher than the statewide median (0.27/set) but was within the range of previous net catches on Chisago Lake.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Chisago Lake was conducted on July 23, 2018 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot beach seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations with one site sampled from the boat.  Soft sediments with abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at four sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 13 native species of fish including two species that are intolerant of high levels of disturbance (Iowa Darter and Banded Killifish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Banded Killifish, and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Chisago Lake based on this survey is well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar shallow lakes, indicating good water quality and habitat conditions exist for aquatic life.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Lower St. Croix River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chisago Lake is a moderately fertile 944 acre lake located in southern Chisago County bordering Chisago City.  The lake is broadly connected to South Lindstrom Lake by a natural channel.  Either lake can be accessed by a concrete public boat ramp located in the channel between lakes. The two lakes are somewhat physically different with South Lindstrom having a smaller percentage of littoral (water less than 15 feet deep) acreage (42%) than Chisago (80%). The channel allows fish to migrate freely between the two lakes. Currently, the primary management species are Walleye and Largemouth Bass. The Walleye population is maintained by stocking fingerlings in even numbered years. There is currently a special regulation on Largemouth Bass limiting harvest to fish less than 12 inches in length. A survey consisting of 6 gill net and 9 trap net sets was conducted in July 2022 to assess fish populations. The previous survey was conducted in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled by gill nets at a rate of 2.1 fish per net compared to 5.4 fish per net in 2018. This is a decline in the catch rate for this lake. Average weight was at 2.1 lbs. Fish ranged from 10.8 to 25.8 inches in length with an average of 17.8 inches. Eighty one percent of the catch was over 15.0 inches during the 2022 survey on Chisago Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch of 2.1 fish per net was low for this lake, but relative to previous surveys. Average weight of pike was 4.2 lbs. Lengths ranged from 18.0 to 33.5 inches and averaged 26.3 inches. Several fish over 30 inches in length were sampled.  Fifty percent of the pike caught were over 26 inches.  Angler can expect to catch good numbers of hefty pike throughout the lake. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled Bluegill at a rate of 45.7 fish per net compared to 37.5 fish per net in 2018, which is a good catch rate for lakes of this type in the area. Average size was moderate for  Bluegill at 0.24 lbs. Bluegills averaged 6.7 inches and all lengths were between 0.7 to 8.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 16.8 fish per gill net which is above average for lakes of this type. Average weight was at 0.2 lbs. Fish length ranged from 4.6 to 9.7 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.  Thirty-five percent of the gill net catch for crappies was over 8.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers are up from the 2018 survey of 1.9 per net to 7.1 per net in 2022, which is average when compared to similar lakes.  Size was small with a mean weight of 0.13 lbs. Fish length ranged from 5.5 to 8.6 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNighttime electrofishing for Largemouth Bass was conducted in early June.  There is currently a special regulation on Largemouth Bass limiting harvest to fish less than 12.0 inches in length. The current catch rate of 75 fish per hour is an average catch rate for these types of lakes.  Largemouth Bass averaged 12.8 inches compared to 12.9 inches in 2018. The largest fish was 18.5 inches.  Chisago Lake provides a good opportunity for anglers to catch good numbers of moderate sized bass.  Forty-five percent of the bass caught were over 12 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for most species in Chisago Lake.  At times fishing pressure on Chisago Lake can be high and anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of Chisago Lake's fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  <br> \n</p>",

The northern pike is low at 2.00 fish per set but of good size averaging 3.89 pounds.  The yellow perch is low at 8.00 per set but is at the state median figure.  The bluegill at 37.71 per set is slightly high while the black crappie at 5.71 is low and both species are of small to average size.  The largemouth bass was absent in the trap net catch, but was slightly high in the gillnet catch.  The pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, white sucker, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, and brown bullhead all had low population figures while the bowfin was high at three times its median figure.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chisago Lake is a moderately fertile 944 acre lake. It is located in southern Chisago County bordering Chisago City. The lake is broadly connected to South Lindstrom Lake by a natural channel. The connection between the two lakes facilitates fish movement. Either lake can be accessed via a concrete public boat ramp located in the channel between lakes. The primary management species are Walleye and Largemouth Bass. The Walleye population is maintained by stocking 900 lbs. of fingerlings in even numbered years. There is currently a special regulation on Largemouth Bass limiting harvest to fish less than 12 inches in length. A survey consisting of 6 gill net and 9 trap net sets was conducted in July 2018 to assess fish populations. The previous survey was conducted in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled by gill nets at a rate of 5.4 fish per net. This is higher than most other similar lakes but typical compared to historical catches. Fish ranged from 16.4 to 27.8 inches in length with an average of 19.5. Two-thirds of fish were from the 2014 year class with all year classes from 2015 to 2010 represented. Growth appears to have been excellent.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch of 5.9 fish per net was typical for the lake. Lengths ranged from 18.4 to 39 inches and averaged 23.5. Several fish over 30 inches in length were sampled. Ages were well distributed from the 2016 through 2009 year classes. Growth appeared to be fairly variable but good overall.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled Bluegill at a rate of 37.5 fish per net which is typical for the lake. Size also remained typical with a mean weight of 0.19 lbs. Bluegills averaged 5.8 inches and all lengths were well represented up to 8.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 8.5 fish per trap net. This is typical for the lake and lakes like it. Mean weight was slightly below average compared to similar lakes at 0.27 lbs, but this is typical relative to previous surveys. Fish length ranged from 4 to 10 inches and averaged 7.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was low with only 1.9 fish sampled per gill net. This is below normal and continues a downward trend since a record high catch rate of 13.9 fish per net in 2010. Size was also fairly small with a mean weight of 0.12 lbs. Fish averaged 6.5 inches but none were sampled over 8 inches.  The lake's forage base is supplemented by the presence of Golden Shiners. <br> \n <br> \nNighttime electrofishing for Largemouth Bass was conducted in early June. The catch rate was 97 fish per hour which is slightly below the goal of 110 for the first time since 2002. Largemouth averaged 12.9 inches but the largest fish was only 16.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
