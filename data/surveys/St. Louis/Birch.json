                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have soft (unmineralized) water,  Birch Lake is the impoundment of old river beds.  Compared to most Class 7 lakes, Birch Lake is larger, shallower, has steeper shoreline dropoffs, and has an extremely irregular shoreline shape.Birch Lake was very slightly thermally stratified on 08/25/2003 with a surface temperature of 75 F and a bottom temperature of 72 F.  Dissolved oxygen was at saturation at the surface (7.5 ppm), and remained near saturation (5.9 ppm) at the bottom.  The major inlet (South Kawishiwi River) and the outlet (Birch River, also known as South Kawishiwi River) are both in the northeast corner of the lake.  There is a dam at the outlet and dam operation results in winter drawdown of about 4 ft.  Shoal water substrates on Birch Lake are mostly boulder and ledgerock, with lesser amounts of sand.  Aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of 5 ft and is sparse, with small clusters in protected bays; waterlilies, various pondweeds, and floatingleaf burreed are the most common plants.  Birch Lake ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.Birch Lake has been stocked with walleye fry every second or third year since 1982.  There is a special regulation for northern pike which began on May 10, 2003: a 24-36\" protected slot with one over 36\" allowed in possession.  The 2003 fish population assessment consisted of 15 standard gillnet sets to evaluate northern pike and walleye populations.  Trapnets were not set because they were not necessary for this evaluation. Twelve previous gillnettings on this lake dating back to 1954 consisted of 5-15 gillnets set in mid-to-late August.Fish populations in 2003, as in previous investigations, were dominated by walleye, followed by northern pike, cisco, sucker, and perch.  The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2003 of 31 fish/net (29 lb/net) was at the median for this lake class and was near the median for all investigations on this lake.Walleye numbers in 2003 (12.5/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 8.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye were evenly spread throughout the lake.  Walleye sizes in 2003 averaged 12.4\" (0.9 lb), which was near the median for this lake class and was similar to the average length of 12.9\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2003 was 29.1\" (6.6 lb).  The number of walleye of quality size (16\" or larger) in 2003 of 1.7/gillnet was higher than the median catch of 1.4/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  There does not appear to be any trend in the number of quality size walleye present in Birch Lake over time, although no data is available for the initial survey in 1954 because the lengths of fish in the gillnets and trapnets were combined.    Walleye scales were collected for age and growth analysis in 2003 and were considered to be moderately difficult to read, but it appeared that eleven different year classes of walleye were captured in the gillnets.  Many of the walleye were young: age two (37 percent) and age one (24 percent).   Walleye growth was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.Northern pike numbers in 2003 (1.9/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were slightly lower than the median catch of 2.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2003 averaged 21.9\" (2.3 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 22.4\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike captured in 2003 was 26.7\".  The number of northern pike in the protected slot range (24-36\") in 2003 of 0.4/gillnet was lower than the median catch of 0.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake (no data is available for the initial survey in 1954 because the lengths of fish in the gillnets and trapnets was combined).  Catches of 24-36\" pike were consistently lower than the median in the three most recent investigations on this lake, beginning in 1997.   Pike scales were collected for age and growth analysis in 2003 and were considered to be moderately difficult to read, but it appeared that only five year classes of pike were captured.  Most pike (48 percent) were age two.  Pike growth was faster than normal (in the third or fourth quartile, depending on the age) by area standards.Cisco numbers in 2003 (7.1/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were near the median catch of 7.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes in 2003 averaged 10.4\" (0.6 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 9.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest cisco in 2003 was 17.6\".White sucker numbers in 2003 (4.9/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were at the median catch for all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2003 averaged 15.7\" (1.7 lb), which was at the median for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 14.0\" in all investigations on this lake.Yellow perch numbers in 2003 (3.3/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 4.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2003 averaged 7.7\" (0.2 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 7.3\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch captured in 2003 was 12.2\".  Perch scales were difficult to read, but six year classes appeared to be present and growth appeared to be somewhat faster than normal (in the third quartile) by area standards.Smallmouth bass were first observed in Birch Lake in the 1997 investigation.  While smallmouth numbers have been low, with a median catch of 0.1/gillnet, their numbers in the gillnet catch probably underestimate their true abundance because smallmouth are known to be \"net shy\".  Smallmouth sizes increased from an average of 5.3\" in 1997, to 13.5\" in 2000, and to 15.7\" in 2003.  The largest smallmouth captured in 2003 was 15.9\".  Smallmouth scales were easy to read, and growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.Many of the game fish examined in 2003 were infected with neascus.  Some of the yellow perch also had yellow grub, and some of the cisco had triaenophorus larvae in their muscle tissue.  Neascus (black spot), yellow grub, and triaenophorus are all common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.Five rusty crayfish were captured in Gillnet 1, at the northeast tip of Birch Lake in 2003.  This is the first appearance of this species in this lake, and if experience is a guide, we can expect their numbers to increase over time with negative consequences for native crayfish and aquatic plants.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have soft (unmineralized) water.  Birch Lake is the impoundment of old river beds.  Compared to most Class 7 lakes, Birch Lake is larger, shallower, has steeper shoreline dropoffs, and has an extremely irregular shoreline shape.  <br> \n <br> \nBirch Lake was not thermally stratified on 8/21/2006, with a surface temperature of 72 F and bottom temperature of 71 F.  Oxygen levels were at saturation at the surface (8.4 ppm) and remained near saturation at the bottom (6.0 ppm).  The major inlet (South Kawishiwi River) and the outlet (Birch River, also known as South Kawishiwi River) are both in the northeast corner of the lake.  There is a dam at the outlet used to control water supplies for the Winton hydroelectric facility downstream at the outlet of Garden Lake; dam operation has resulted in winter drawdowns of up to 4 ft in the past.   Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Birch Lake are mostly boulder and ledgerock, with lesser amounts of sand.  Aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of 5 ft and is sparse, with concentrations in protected bays.  Waterlilies, various pondweeds, and floatingleaf burreed are the most common aquatic plants.  Birch Lake ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index. <br> \n <br> \nBirch Lake was stocked with walleye fry every second or third year from 1982 through 2002.  Stocking was discontinued after 2002 because evaluations showed that fry-stocked walleye year classes during this period of stocking were no stronger than non-stocked walleye year classes.  A special regulation for northern pike began with the fishing opener in 2003: a 24-36 inches protected slot limit with one pike over 36 inches allowed in possession.  The 2006 fish population assessment was done to evaluate northern pike and walleye populations and consisted of 15 standard gillnet sets.  Trapnets were not used because they were not necessary for this evaluation.  Thirteen previous fisheries investigations on Birch Lake used 5-15 gillnets set in mid-August. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2006, as in previous investigations, were dominated by walleye, followed by northern pike, cisco, white sucker, and yellow perch.  The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2006 of 31 fish/net (26 lb/net) was normal (near the median) for this lake class and was similar to the median catch in all investigations on this lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2006 (16.4/gillnet) were higher than in any previous assessment on Birch Lake, were higher than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class, and were higher than the median catch of 10.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye were spread evenly throughout the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye sizes in 2006 averaged 12.8 inches (0.85 lb), which was normal (near the median) for this lake class and was similar to the average walleye size of 12.9 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2006 was 23.4 inches.  The number of walleye of quality size (16 inches or larger) in 2006 of 2.9/gillnet was higher than the median catch of 1.4/gillnet in all investigations on this lake from 1972 to the present (walleye lengths in the initial fisheries survey in 1954 were not available for the gillnet catch).  The highest catches of quality-sized walleye in Birch Lake have occurred in recent investigations: 3.1/gillnet in 2000 and 2.9/gillnet in 2006.    <br> \n <br> \nMost walleye captured in 2006 were ages 1-4, however fair numbers of age 7 and age 9 walleye contributed to the high catches of quality sized walleye in the 2006 catch.  Walleye growth was slower than normal by area standards (in the first or second quartile, depending on the age). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2006 (1.7/gillnet) were somewhat lower than normal (in the second quartile) for this lake class and were lower than the median pike catch of 2.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake. <br> \n <br> \nPike sizes in 2006 averaged 23.0 inches (3.0 lb), which was somewhat larger than normal (in the third quartile) for this lake class and was similar to the average pike size of 22.4 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike captured in 2006 was 32.1 inches.  The number of pike in the protected slot range (24-36 inches) in 2006 of 0.7/gillnet was at the median value for all investigations on this lake and was higher than the 2003 catch of 0.4/gillnet. <br> \n <br> \nAll of the pike captured in 2006 were ages 1-5, and pike recruitment was fairly even from year-to-year.  Pike growth was somewhat faster than normal by area standards (in the third quartile). <br> \n <br> \nCisco numbers in 2006 (4.7/gillnet) were somewhat lower than normal (in the second quartile) for this lake class and were lower than the median cisco catch of 7.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes in 2006 averaged 8.6 inches (0.3 lb), which was somewhat smaller than normal (in the second quartile for this lake class) and was smaller than the average cisco size of 9.7 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest cisco in 2006 was 15.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSucker numbers in 2006 (3.5/gillnet) were somewhat lower than normal (in the second quartile) for this lake class and were lower than the median sucker catch of 4.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake. <br> \n <br> \nPerch numbers in 2006 (4.0/gillnet) were normal (at the median value) for this lake class and were similar to the median perch catch of 4.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2006 averaged 7.6 inches (0.23 lb), which was somewhat larger than normal (in the third quartile) for this lake class and was similar to the average perch size of 7.3 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch in 2006 was 9.8 inches.  Most of the perch captured in 2006 were ages 3-5.  Perch growth was normal by area standards (in the second or third quartile, depending on the age). <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were first observed in Birch Lake in the 1997 investigation.  While smallmouth catches have been low, smallmouth are known to avoid capture in standard sampling nets and they are likely more abundant than indicated by their net catches.  Two smallmouth (14.9 inches and 15.9 inches) were captured in 2006.  Growth of these smallmouth was faster than normal by area standards (in the fourth quartile).   <br> \n <br> \nAbout a third of the game fish examined in 2006 were infected with neascus (black spot).  Some of the yellow perch also had yellow grub, and a few walleye had lymphocystis (fish warts).  These are normal afflictions of fish and are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish. <br> \n <br> \nFive rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) were caught in gillnet #1 in 2006, off a small island just south of the Hwy 1 bridge where the Kawishiwi River enters Birch Lake.  Five rusty crayfish were caught in this same net in 2003, which was the first appearance of this species in Birch Lake.  Sixty native crayfish (Orconectes virilis) were captured throughout the lake in the gillnets in 2006.  Based on our experience with introductions of rusty crayfish in other lakes in the area, we can expect them to spread and their numbers to increase in Birch Lake, with negative consequences for native crayfish and aquatic plants.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is a 15 mile long reservoir located northeast of Babbitt.  It is accessible by four public ramps and several portages/carry-ins.  This 7074 acre lake has a maximum depth of 25 feet and brown water.  Several major inlets flow into Birch Lake from west to east including: Birch River, Dunka River, Stony River, Keeley Creek and Kawishiwi River.  The only outlet is the Kawishiwi River which flows out the far northern tip of the lake.  A dam at the outlet is used to control water supplies for the Winton hydroelectric facility downstream at the outlet of Garden Lake; dam operation can result in winter drawdowns of up to 4 feet at times.   \n\nOn August 17, 2015 Birch Lake was not thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 74 F and a bottom temperature of 70 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish throughout the depth range.  \n\nBirch Lake is one of the most heavily used lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management area.  Its close proximity to Ely and Babbitt allow for easy access by local residents and vacationers.  Two US Forest Service maintained campgrounds are located on the lake.  Two resorts on the west end offer houseboat rentals and the Forest Service maintains several houseboat accessible campsites throughout the lake.  Although the west end near Babbitt has a fair amount of development (compared to other lakes in the area) the majority of the lakes shoreline is public land and remains undeveloped.  Most shorelines and islands are heavily wooded.  Lake bottoms along the shoreline of Birch Lake are mostly boulder and ledgerock, with gravel, sand and muck in the bays.  Aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of 5 feet and is generally limited to the bays.  The basin of Birch Lake is a complex of old river beds that are now impounded by the downstream dam.  Because of this unique lake bed structure, many of the shorelines drop off quickly.  \n\nBirch Lake has a long and varied walleye stocking history dating back to 1928. Fry, fingerlings and occasionally adults have all been stocked.  Stocking was discontinued after 2002 when it was determined that it was largely ineffective due to the lakes ability to sustain itself through natural reproduction.  A special regulation to increase northern pike sizes began in 2003.  This regulation was a 24-36 inch protected slot limit with one pike over 36 inches allowed in possession.  \n\nThis population assessment consisted of only gillnet sets.  Fish species sampled were walleye, cisco, white sucker, yellow perch, northern pike, black crappie, rock bass, smallmouth bass and bluegill.   \n\nA total of 161 walleye were sampled for a catch rate just over 13 fish/net, which is quite high compared to other similar lakes throughout the state and good compared to other previous surveys on Birch Lake.  Sizes were from 8 to 29 inches with an average of 12 inches.  The average weight was just under a pound which is somewhat small compared to other similar lakes.  Walleye growth is slow compared to other lakes in the area.  Ages ranged from 0 to 15 but trended toward young fish.  Nearly 93% of the total catch was younger than age 5.  \n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch was just under one fish per net which is low compared to other assessments of Birch Lake.  Sizes were good with fish from 18 to 40 inches sampled.  The average length was just over 25 inches and average weight was nearly 5 pounds.  A special fishing regulation for northern pike (24-36 inch protected slot with one over 36 inches allowed in possession) went into effect in 2003.  Assessments before the regulation showed that on average, only 29% of northern pike captured were bigger than 24 inches.  Assessments after the regulation have shown improvement with 52% of pike sampled being bigger than 24 inches.  The average length has also improved from 23 inches to 25 inches.    \n\nThe yellow perch gillnet catch was 3.5 fish/net which is close to average for Birch Lake.  Historically, the yellow perch population has been quite stable.  In 2015, fish averaged 0.2 pounds and lengths were from 7 to 10 inches.  \n\nCisco numbers in 2015 are slightly better than average although they have historically been highly variable.  The average fish weighed nearly a pound with lengths ranging from 8 to 17 inches. \n\nThe white sucker gillnet catch was nearly 6 fish/net which is above average.  The average weight was nearly a pound and a half with fish up to 20 inches being sampled.  \n\nFish also sampled in gill nets but in very low numbers were smallmouth bass, black crappie, bluegill and rock bass.\n\nRusty crayfish, which are a non-native invasive species, are in high abundance in lakes downstream of Birch Lake.  They were first sampled on the far east end of Birch Lake in 2003.  Surveys through 2012 showed they had not moved far out of the east end.  In this survey only one rusty crayfish was captured but it was caught in a gill net near the middle of the lake.  This location is nearly 8 miles away from where they were last sampled with no evidence of them being sampled in between these locations.  An additional 41 native crayfish were sampled throughout the entire lake.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is a 7, 074 acre reservoir located between Ely and Babbit. Birch Lake was created when the Birch and South Kawishiwi Rivers were impounded at Highway 1 approximately 2.5 miles above White Iron Lake.  Birch is one of the most heavily used lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management area. There are numerous public accesses with concrete ramps located around the lake. The 2012 fisheries investigation on Birch Lake included a special assessment consisting of trap netting in May approximately 2-3 weeks post ice-out targeting black crappie.  This report includes the results of this special assessment.  A population assessment utilizing gill nets was also conducted.  This sampling was completed in August, the standard time for gill netting on this lake, and the results are included in a separate document. \n\nBecause of low catches of black crappie and bluegill in past summer assessments, trap netting was conducted for the first time in early May 2012 in an effort to get a more representative sample.  A total of 196 crappie were captured that ranged in length from 4.2 inches to 12.9 inches with an average length of 9.9 inches. There were seven different year classes in the catch with the 2006 year class (age 6) making up 77% of the sample. This single strong year class comprising most of the fishery is consistent with anecdotal information from anglers that crappie fishing can be good on Birch for 2-3 years and then be poor for a few years. \n\nDuring the spring trap netting in 2012, a total of 147 bluegill were captured that ranged in length from 3.2 inches to 10.0 inches with a mean length of 6.8 inches. Fifty percent of the bluegill were greater than eight inches in length. There were nine different year classes in the catch. Like black crappie, bluegill were mostly from the 2006 year class (age 6) which made up 39% of the sample. \n\nThis early spring trap netting on Birch Lake was successful in providing a good sample of black crappie, an important component of the fishery.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have soft (unmineralized) water.  Birch Lake is the impoundment of old river beds.  Compared to most Class 7 lakes, Birch Lake is larger, shallower, has steeper shoreline dropoffs, has an extremely irregular shoreline shape, and has water that is less clear.Birch Lake was not thermally stratified on 08/21/2000 and retained 7.6 ppm oxygen to the bottom, where the temperature (68 F) was the same as at the surface.  The major inlet (South Kawishiwi River) and the outlet (Birch River, also known as South Kawishiwi River) are both in the northeast corner of the lake.  There is a dam at the outlet and dam operation results in winter drawdowns of about 4 ft.  Shoal substrates on Birch Lake are mostly boulder and ledgerock, with lesser amounts of sand.  Aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of 5 ft and is sparse, with small clusters in protected bays; waterlilies, various pondweeds, and floatingleaf burreed are the most common plants.  Birch Lake ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.Fish sampling in the 2000 fish population assessment consisted of 8 gillnets set in mid August, the purpose of which was to evaluate walleye fry stocking.  Eleven previous gillnettings dating back to 1954 consisted of 5-15 gillnet sets in mid to late August.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in 2000 of 40 fish/gillnet (32 lb/gillnet) was in the third quartile for this lake class and was higher than the median catch of 32 fish/gillnet (28 lb/gillnet) in all twelve investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 7 is one of the more productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.Fish populations in 2000, as in most investigations on this lake, were dominated by walleye, followed by cisco, white sucker, and northern pike.Walleye numbers in 2000 (13.1/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 7.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2000 averaged 12.7\" (0.8 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average of 13.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  Twenty five percent of the walleye were 16\" or larger, higher than the average of 18 percent in all investigations on this lake.  Sixty two percent of the walleye were ages two or three.  Walleye growth was in the second quartile for area lakes.Cisco numbers in 2000 (15.9/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 8.1/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes averaged 9.1\" (0.4 lb), which was near the median for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 9.7\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest cisco in 2000 was 17.7\".White sucker numbers in 2000 (5.5/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were near the median catch of 4.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes averaged 14.4\" (1.4 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 13.8\" in all investigations on this lake.Northern pike numbers in 2000 (2.1/gillnet) were near the median for this lake class and were near the median catch of 2.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes averaged 22.4\" (2.7 lb), which was near the median for this lake class and was identical to the average size of 22.4\" in all investigations on this lake.  Pike growth appeared to be near the median for area lakes, although pike scales were difficult to read.Yellow perch numbers in 2000 (2.6/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 5.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes averaged 7.6\" (0.3 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 7.3\" in all investigations on this lake.  Perch growth appeared to in the second quartile for area lakes, although perch scales were difficult to read. Many of the fish examined during the 2000 assessment had neacus, although few fish were heavily infested.  Neascus (black spot) is a parasite that is native to the area and is found in or just under the skin.  It cannot infect humans, is usually removed by filleting, and is killed by the temperatures used for cooking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have soft (low mineral content) water.  Birch Lake is the impoundment of old river beds.  Compared to most Class 7 lakes, Birch Lake is larger, shallower, has steeper shoreline dropoffs, and has an extremely irregular shoreline shape.  <br> \n <br> \nBirch Lake was not thermally stratified on 8/24/2009, with a surface temperature of 68 ?F and bottom temperature of 67 ?F.  Good oxygen levels were present throughout the water column with a reading of 8.4 ppm at the surface and 6.3 ppm near the bottom.  The major inlet (South Kawishiwi River) and the outlet (Birch River, also known as South Kawishiwi River) are both in the northeast corner of the lake.  There is a dam at the outlet used to control water supplies for the Winton hydroelectric facility downstream at the outlet of Garden Lake; dam operation has resulted in winter draw downs of up to 4 feet in the past.   Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Birch Lake are mostly boulder and ledgerock, with lesser amounts of sand.  Aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of 5 ft and is sparse, with concentrations in protected bays.  Water lilies, various pondweeds, and floating leaf burreed are the most common aquatic plants.  Birch Lake ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index. <br> \n <br> \nBirch Lake was stocked with walleye fry every second or third year from 1982 through 2002.  Stocking was discontinued after 2002 because evaluations showed that fry-stocked walleye year classes during this period were no stronger than non-stocked walleye year classes.  A special regulation for northern pike began with the fishing opener in 2003: a 24-36 inch protected slot limit with one pike over 36 inches allowed in possession.  The 2009 fish population assessment was done to evaluate northern pike and walleye populations and consisted of 15 standard gillnet sets.  Catch information was only used for 14 of these gillnet sets because one gillnet had been disturbed and no data was collected from that net.  Trapnets were not used because their catches in Birch Lake have always been very low and the species composition is similar to the gillnet catch.  Thirteen previous fisheries investigations on Birch Lake used 5-15 gillnets set in mid-August.  Five previous investigations also used 8-15 trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nThe gillnet catch in 2009, as in previous investigations, was dominated by walleye, followed by  cisco, white sucker, yellow perch, and northern pike.  The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2009 of 38.1 fish/gillnet (31.5 lbs/gillnet) was higher than the median catch (32.3/gillnet) for all investigations on this lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2009 (13.6/gillnet) were similar to recent investigation on Birch Lake but higher than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class and slightly higher than the median walleye catch (12.5/gillnet) for all Birch Lake assessments.  Consistent numbers of walleyes in gillnet sets across the lake indicate the population is rather evenly distributed.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye sizes in 2009 averaged 12.0 inches (0.7 lb), which was normal for this lake class and slightly lower than the average walleye size of 12.9 inches for all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2009 was 28.0 inches.  The 2009 catch rate of quality size walleye (16 inches or larger) of 1.2/gillnet was near than the median catch of 1.4/gillnet for all investigations on this lake from 1972 to the present (walleye lengths in the initial fisheries survey in 1954 were not available for the gillnet catch).  The highest gillnet catches of quality-sized walleye in Birch Lake occurred in 2000 (3.1/gillnet) and 2006 (2.9/gillnet).  Most of the walleye captured in 2009 were ages 1-4.  Walleye growth was slower than normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2009 (1.6/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and slightly lower than the median pike catch of 2.1/gillnet for all investigations on this lake.  Northern pike sizes in 2009 averaged 26.5 inches (4.7 lbs), which was larger than normal for this lake class and larger than the average size of 22.7 inches for all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike caught in 2009 was 39.3 inches.  The number of pike in the protected slot range (24-36 inches) in 2009 of 1.0/gillnet was slightly higher than the median value (0.7/gillnet) for all investigations on this lake and higher than the 2003 and 2006 catches of 0.4/gillnet and 0.7/gillnet, respectively.  All of the northern pike captured in 2009 were ages 3-8, and recruitment was fairly even from year-to-year.  Pike growth varied somewhat by year class but appeared to be normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nCisco numbers in 2009 (13.3/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and higher than the median cisco catch of 7.2/gillnet for all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes in 2009 averaged 10.5 inches (0.5 lb), which was normal for Lake Class 7 and slightly larger than the average cisco size of 9.7 inches for all investigations on this lake.  The largest cisco in 2009 was 18.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker numbers in 2009 (5.1/gillnet) were normal for Lake Class 7 and similar to the median catch of 4.9/gillnet for all investigations on this lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2009 (2.9/gillnet) were normal for Lake Class 7 but lower than the median perch catch of 4.6/gillnet for all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2009 averaged 7.6 inches (0.24 lb), which was normal for this lake class and similar to the average perch size of 7.3 inches for all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch in 2009 was 12.0 inches.  The 2009 perch catch was dominated by age four fish from the 2005 year class but included fish from 6 different age classes.  Perch growth was normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were first observed in Birch Lake in the 1997 investigation (caught in trapnets and gillnets).  Smallmouth bass have been captured in low numbers in every investigation since their initial discovery.  While catches in surveys and assessments have been low, smallmouth are known to avoid capture in standard sampling nets and are likely more abundant than indicated by their net catches.  Only one smallmouth was captured in the 2009 investigation, but it was rather large at 18.3 inches.  This smallmouth was estimated to be 8 years old, indicating faster than normal growth by area standards.   <br> \n <br> \nMany of the game fish examined in 2009 were infected with neascus (black spot).  Some of the yellow perch also had yellow grub, and two ciscoes had triaenophorus (whitefish tapeworm) infections.  These afflictions are all common to fish and native to the area.  They cannot infect humans and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.   <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) first appeared in Birch Lake in the 2003 assessment when five were caught in a gillnet off a small island just south of the Hwy 1 bridge.  Five rusty crayfish were caught in this same net location in 2006.  Two rusty crayfish were caught in 2009, approximately two miles southwest of previous catches.  Gillnets also captured thirty-four native crayfish (Orconectes virilis) throughout Birch Lake in the 2009 assessment.  Based on our experience with rusty crayfish in other lakes in the area, we can expect them to spread and their numbers to increase in Birch Lake, with negative consequences for native crayfish and aquatic plants.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is a 7,074-acre lake located between Ely and Babbit in northeast Minnesota. The lake is one of the more heavily fished lakes of the Tower Fisheries Management Area. It is convenient to both Ely and Babbitt and has several good public accesses with concrete plank boat ramps around the lake. Shoreline development on the lake has increased considerably in recent years, however 75% of the shoreline is undeveloped and under public ownership. On Birch Lake, anglers have had success catching walleye, northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics. Birch Lake is in lake class 7. Other area lakes in the same lake class include Agnes, Bear Island, Bearhead, Fall, and Shagawa. The lake is an impoundment of old river beds so it larger, shallower, has steeper shoreline drop-offs, and has an extremely irregular shoreline shape compared to most other class 7 lakes. The major inlet (South Kawishiwi River) and the outlet (Birch River, also known as South Kawishiwi River) are both in the northeast corner of the lake. Dam operation results in a winter drawdown of about 4 ft.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, the Birch Lake walleye fishery is sustained from natural reproduction. Birch Lake was stocked with walleye fry every second or third year from 1982 through 2002. Stocking was discontinued after 2002 because evaluations showed that stocked year classes were no stronger than non-stocked year classes. Walleye captured in the 2012 investigation ranged in length from 7.8 inches to 30.0 inches with a mean length of 12.5 inches. Walleye were caught in the nets throughout the lake indicating the population is evenly distributed.  <br> \n <br> \nOn Birch Lake, a special regulation for northern pike began with the fishing opener in 2003. It is a 24-36 inch protected slot limit with one pike over 36 inches allowed in possession. The special regulation is improving opportunities to catch large pike. In investigations conducted on Birch Lake from 1981 to 2003, only 29% of the pike were 24 inches or longer. Since the implementation of the regulation, that portion of larger pike has shifted to 56% of the population. Pike growth was above average. After three years of growth, Birch Lake pike were typically 23 inches long and almost into the protected slot limit. On average, pike of this age from other area class 7 lakes are 19 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe May trapnetting effectively sampled black crappie and bluegill. A total of 196 crappie were captured and ranged from 4 to 13 inches in length. The 2006 year class (age 6) was the strongest year class identified and made up 77% of the sample. At capture, an age-6 crappie averaged 10.3 inches long. The 147 bluegill sampled ranged from 3 to 10 inches with a mean length of nearly 7 inches. Anglers need to show some constraint when these bigger mature bluegill are biting. By keeping a few of the smaller bluegill for eating, you can help maintain the quality size structure. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (cisco) and white sucker are two species that are excellent forage food for northern pike and walleye. Historically, both species have been captured on Birch Lake at abundances that are typical of other class 7 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe aquatic invasive species rusty crayfish first appeared in Birch Lake in the 2003 assessment. They were found off of a small island just south of the Highway 1 bridge. In 2012, four rusty crayfish and 51 native crayfish were captured in the nets. So far rusty crayfish appear to be limited to the north end of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nAquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters. These nonnative species harm fish populations, water quality, and water recreation especially fishing. You can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following both the required and recommended actions listed in the Minnesota Fishing Regulations synopsis and on the Minnesota DNR website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, have very irregular shoreline shapes, and have soft (unmineralized) water.  Birch Lake is the impoundment of a complex of old river beds.  Compared to most Class 7 lakes, Birch Lake is larger, shallower, has steeper shoreline dropoffs, has an extremely irregular shoreline shape, and has water that is less clear.Birch Lake ranks between mesotrophic and eutrophic.  It does not stratify thermally in the summer and retains good oxygen (about 7 ppm) to within a foot or so of the bottom.  The major inlet is the South Kawishiwi River, which enters the northeast corner of the lake and has no barriers to fish movement for about a mile, where there are some shallow rapids.  The outlet is also in the northeast corner of the lake.  A dam at the outlet impounds Birch Lake and dam operation results in winter drawdowns of about 4 ft.The lake bottom along the shoreline is mostly boulder and ledgerock, with lesser amounts of sand.  Aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of 5 ft and is sparse, with small concentrations in protected bays; waterlilies, various pondweeds, and floatingleaf burreed are the most common plants.Shoreline development is moderate, with much of the shoreline undeveloped and in public ownership.  There were 195 homes and cottages in 1997, compared to 126 in 1975 and 30 in 1954.  Fish sampling in 1997 consisted of trapnets, shoreline seines, and gillnets.  Four previous trapnettings and 10 previous gillnettings have been conducted on Birch Lake, dating back to 1954.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1997 (all species combined) of 10.6 fish/net (6.6 lb/net) was similar to the average catch of 5.6 fish/net (9.7 lb/net) in previous trapnettings on Birch Lake.  Rock bass numbers in the 1997 trapnetting (3.5/net) were higher than in previous trapnettings (average of 0.2/net), and this resulted in the higher number of fish per trapnet in 1997.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 1997 of 36.3 fish/net (32.6 lb/net) was normal for this lake class and was similar to the average catch of 32.8 fish/net (27.8 lb/net) in previous gillnettings on this lake.Fish populations in 1997, as in most previous surveys and assessments on Birch Lake, were dominated by walleye, cisco, white sucker, and northern pike.Walleye numbers in 1997 (14.2/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the average catch of 8.9/gillnet for previous gillnettings on this lake.  Most walleye captured in 1997 were from very strong 1994 and 1995 year classes, while very few were from the 1992 and 1993 year classes.  Poor year classes were produced in many area lakes during the cold summers of 1992 and 1993, while good year classes were produced in these lakes in 1994 and 1995.  Walleye sizes in 1997 averaged 13\", the same as the long term average for this lake.  The number of walleye 16\" or larger in 1997 of 1.5/gillnet was similar to the long term average catch of 1.3/gillnet for fish of that size.  The largest walleye captured in 1997 was 28.1\" (9 lb).  Growth of walleye captured in 1997 (12\" at age three, 17\" at age 6) was normal for the area. Northern pike numbers in 1997 (2.3/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the average catch of 2.4/gillnet for previous gillnettings on this lake.  All pike in the gillnets were ages two, three, and four.  Pike sizes averaged 20.4\", which was smaller than the long term average size of 22.4\" for this lake.  The largest pike, caught in a trapnet, was 42.1\" (20.5 lb).  Growth of pike captured in 1997 (15\" at age two, 23\" at age four) was faster than normal for the area.Yellow perch numbers in 1997 (3.8/gillnet) were normal for this lake class, but were lower than the average catch of 6.3/gillnet for previous gillnettings on this lake.  Perch sizes averaged 7.0\"; the largest was 10.6\".  Perch growth (6\" at age four) was slower than normal for the area.Cisco and white sucker numbers were normal for this lake class and were similar to previous catches in this lake.  Other species were present in low numbers.  Some large black crappie (11\") and bluegill (9\") were present.  Growth of crappie (8\" at age three) and bluegill (5\" at age three) were faster than normal for the area.Black spot (Neascus) was found on 60 percent of the northern pike, 7 percent of the walleye, and 10 percent of the perch.  Yellow grub was also found on 18 percent of the perch.  Black spot and yellow grub are common parasites found in or just under the skin.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed by cooking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is a 15 mile long reservoir located northeast of Babbitt.  It is accessible by four public ramps and several portages/carry-ins.  This 7,074 acre lake has a maximum depth of 25 feet and brown water.  Several major inlets flow into Birch Lake and the only outlet is the Kawishiwi River which flows out the far northern tip of the lake.  A dam at the outlet is used to control water supplies for the Winton hydroelectric facility downstream at the outlet of Garden Lake; dam operation can result in winter drawdowns of up to 4 feet at times.    <br> \n <br> \nOn August 17, 2020 Birch Lake was thermally mixed with a surface temperature of 72 F and a bottom temperature of 71 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish throughout the water column.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Birch Lake are mostly boulder and ledgerock, with gravel, sand and muck in the bays.  Aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of 5 feet and is generally limited to the bays.    <br> \n <br> \nIn the 2020 survey, 192 walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 16.0 fish/gill net, which was very good compared to other similar lakes in the state and the second highest ever on Birch Lake.  Walleye lengths ranged from 8 to 29 inches with an average of 12 inches which was slightly below normal compared to past surveys on the lake.  Mean weight per fish was just under a pound which was on the low side compared to other similar lakes.  Walleye growth was also slower than normal compared to other lakes in the Tower area.  Despite large numbers of fish, ages tended to be young with just over 90% of the total catch being five years old or younger.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch rate of 1.8 fish/net falls just shy of average for Birch Lake and other similar lakes in the state.  Lengths ranged from 14 to 35 inches with an average of 23 inches.  A special regulation for northern pike (24-36 inch protected slot with one over 36 inches allowed in possession) went into effect in 2003.  Pre-regulation August assessments showed that on average, only 29% of northern pike captured were greater than or equal to 24 inches long.  Post-regulation assessments continue to show improvement with 49% of pike greater than or equal to 24 inches.  Consequently average lengths also improved with a pre-regulation average of 23 inches compared to a post-regulation average of 25 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe cisco (tullibee) catch rate in 2020 was 10.4 fish/net which was above average compared to past investigations on the lake.  The average weight was just over a half a pound and sizes ranged from 7 to 16 inches with an average of 10 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low numbers were yellow perch, white sucker, smallmouth bass, black crappie, and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish are an invasive species that exists in Birch Lake and are in high abundance in lakes downstream of Birch Lake.  Counts in Birch Lake have been made of rusty crayfish entangled in gill nets since they first appeared in 2003.  Numbers have generally remained low but do show an increasing trend through 2020. <br> \n</p>",

This represents a decline from 14/set in previous two assessments. Walleye sizes are small, reflecting abundant younger age-classes and few fish over 16 for the state. Yellow perch were present in average number in 1984. They have fluctuated widely over the long term. Northern pike, white sucker, and rock bass were present in average numbers in 1984. These populations were stable over the long term. Cisco's were present in below numbers in 1984. Long term trends show moderate fluctuations. </p>",

Low numbers of black crappie, bluegill, rock bass, and trout-perch were also captured.Cisco sizes ranged from 7\" to 15\" and averaged 10.9\".  Some large walleye (over 25\") and crappie (12\") are present.  Occasional trophy northern pike are reported by anglers, but no large northerns were caught in this assessment.Recruitment of crappie and northern pike is consistent.  Walleye recruitment is variable, but walleye numbers (7.4/gill net) are good.  Growth of these species is average for the area.</p>",
