                "narrative": "<p>   Lake Seven is a 243-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Vergas, MN.  An unnavigable inlet is located along the north shoreline and an unnavigable outlet is located along the south shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwoods.  The maximum depth of Lake Seven is 90 feet; however, 27% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2013 survey was 24.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 15.5 to 21.0 feet. <br> \n     Development is scattered around the entire shoreline of Lake Seven.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.   A DNR owned concrete public access is located on the north shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic vegetation is not prevalent in Lake Seven. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Lake Seven.  Catch data indicate that Walleye abundance is down compared to previous surveys but is still within the normal range for this type of lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 10.0 to 24.1 inches with an average length and weight of 19.0 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Walleyes exhibit good growth with an average length of 16.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     A low-density Northern Pike population exists.  Northern pike reproduction is limited by a lack of suitable spawning habitat during years of low to normal water levels.  Northern Pike size structure is excellent.  Pike ranged in length from 18.2 to 32.4 inches with a mean length and weight of 24.8 inches and 3.7 pounds.  Northern Pike also exhibit good growth with an average length of 22.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Catch data indicate that an abundant Bluegill population with a good size structure exists.  Thirty-three percent of the Bluegill sample measured 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.9 inches at six years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing on Lake Seven by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

This was the first recorded catch of this species in Lake Seven.  <br> \n     Northern pike abundance is very low at 0.8 per gill net lift. Northern pike abundance has historically been low, which is most likely due to the lack of suitable spawning sites and discontinuation of stocking.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased from 48.0 per trap net in the 1971 survey to 221.5 per trap net.  Bluegill size structure remains similar to that found in previous surveys despite the large increase in numbers.  <br> \n     Largemouth bass abundance was well above the area median.  Age data indicates that the 1985 and 1986 year classes are strong.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance increased from 11.0 per gill net lift in 1971 to 41.2 per gill net lift.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance increased from 8.2 per gill net lift in the 1982 survey to 10.8 per gill net lift.  Average weight of walleye decreased from 1.3 lbs. to 0.8 lbs. Walleye growth rates appear to have declined since 1982. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Lake Seven is a 243-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Vergas, MN.  An unnavigable inlet is located along the north shoreline and an unnavigable outlet is located along the south shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwoods.  The maximum depth of Lake Seven is 90 feet; however, 27% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2008 survey was 17.5 feet which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 15.5 to 21.0 feet. <br> \n     Development is scattered around the entire shoreline of Lake Seven.  The 1993 lake survey referenced 67 homes/cottages.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located on the north shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic vegetation is not prevalent in Lake Seven. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Lake Seven.  The test-net catch rate for walleye has exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for this class of lake in every survey conducted.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.0 to 24.6 inches with an average length and weight of 16.2 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2005 year class is strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye exhibit good growth with an average length of 15.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the normal range for this class of lake.  Northern pike reproduction is limited by a lack of suitable spawning habitat during years of low to normal water levels.  Northern pike size structure is excellent.  Pike ranged in length from 13.0 to 39.0 inches with a mean length and weight of 24.5 inches and 3.9 pounds.  Northern pike also exhibit good growth with an average length of 22.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range.  Bluegill size structure has remained stable with 22% of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 6.8 inches at six years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing on Lake Seven by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Seven is a 243-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Vergas, MN.  An unnavigable inlet is located along the north shoreline and an unnavigable outlet is located along the south shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwoods.  The maximum depth of Lake Seven is 90 feet; however, 27% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2004 survey was 15.5 feet which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 17.0 to 21.0 feet.  Lake Seven is included in class 23 of the Minnesota DNR lake classification scheme.     Development is scattered around the entire shoreline of Lake Seven.  The 1993 lake survey referenced 67 homes/cottages.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located on the north shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic vegetation is not prevalent in Lake Seven.     Walleye is a primary management specie in Lake Seven.  The test-net catch rate for walleye has exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 23 lakes in every survey conducted.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.7 to 20.8 inches with an average length and weight of 15.8 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2001 year class is strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  This year class corresponds with a year of walleye fry stocking; however, age data from recent surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction can be substantial in some years.  The DNR stocks walleye fry on a biennial basis to supplement natural reproduction.  Walleye exhibit good growth with an average length of 14.6 inches at four years of age.     The northern pike test-net catch rate was equivalent to the lower limit of the normal range for lake class 23.  Northern pike recruitment is limited by a lack of suitable spawning habitat during years of low to normal water levels.  Pike ranged in length from 17.2 to 30.6 inches with a mean length and weight of 22.4 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Northern pike also exhibit good growth with an average length of 22.0 inches at three years of age.     The bluegill test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range.  Bluegill size structure appears to have improved as 21% of the trap net sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length compared to only 3% in the 1998 survey.  Bluegill attain an average length of 6.8 inches at six years of age.       Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing on Lake Seven by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Lake Seven is a 243-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Vergas, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwoods.  An unnavigable inlet is located along the north shoreline and an unnavigable outlet is located along the south shoreline.  The maximum depth is 90 feet; however, 27% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2019 survey was 17.9 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 15.5 to 24.8 feet. <br> \n     Development is scattered around the entire shoreline of Lake Seven.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.   A DNR owned concrete public access is located on the north shoreline.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as hardstem bulrush and common cattail are not prevalent. <br> \n     Walleye and Northern Pike are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community of Lake Seven. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 13.3 to 28.7 inches with an average length and weight of 18.6 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.2 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike ranged in length from 22.2 to 38.8 inches with an average length and weight of 27.4 inches and 5.2 pounds.  Northern Pike exhibit good growth rates with an average length of 23.9 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing on Lake Seven by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n     Lake Seven is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",
